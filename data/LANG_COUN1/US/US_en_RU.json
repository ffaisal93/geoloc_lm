    "Putin faces fury in Russia over military mobilization and prisoner swap": "Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nRussian families bade tearful farewells on Thursday to thousands of sons and husbands abruptly summoned for military duty as part of President Vladimir Putin’s new mobilization, while pro-war Russian nationalists raged over the release of Ukrainian commanders in a secretive prisoner exchange.

ArrowRight As women hugged their husbands and young men boarded buses to leave for 15 days of training before potentially being deployed to Russia’s stumbling war effort in Ukraine, there were signs of mounting public anger.\n\nMore than 1,300 people were arrested at anti-mobilization protests in cities and towns across Russia on Wednesday and Thursday, in the largest public protests since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports of booked-out flights and queues to leave Russia as “false.”\n\n“The information about a certain feverish situation in airports is very much exaggerated,” Peskov insisted during his daily conference call with reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut there were other signs of increased public pushback against Putin and his war, despite the Kremlin’s harsh crackdown on dissent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the city of Togliatti, a local military recruitment office was set on fire, one of dozens of similar attacks across Russia in recent months.\n\nRussia’s war hawks on the far right, meanwhile, had a different cause for fury: a prisoner exchange that freed commanders from Ukraine’s controversial Azov Regiment, long branded by Russia as “Nazis.” They were swapped for dozens of prisoners held in Ukraine, including Viktor Medvedchuk, reputed to be Putin’s closest Ukrainian friend and the leader of the country’s main pro-Kremlin political party.\n\nThe dual backlash over mobilization and the prisoner exchange showed Putin facing his most acute crisis since he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Not only is his country grappling with punishing economic sanctions imposed by the West, but his military has suffered dramatic setbacks, including an embarrassing retreat from the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 ordered a partial military mobilization, as Moscow's troops battle a Ukrainian counteroffensive. (Video: Reuters)\n\nWith his options diminishing, Putin has made increasingly perilous decisions that could turn the Russian public against the war. In his national address Wednesday, he voiced support for steps toward annexing four Ukrainian regions that he does not fully control, which risks fierce fighting and further humiliation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin also used his speech to make a thinly veiled threat that Russia would use nuclear weapons. On Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy head of the country’s Security Council, made the threat explicit.\n\n“Referendums will be held, and the Donbas republics and other territories will be accepted into Russia,” Medvedev posted on Telegram, warning that Russia would be willing to use “strategic nuclear weapons” for the “protection” of those territories.\n\nIn New York, where world leaders are gathered for the annual United Nations General Assembly, the top U.S. and Russian diplomats clashed during a heated meeting of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told the council that every member should “send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.” He also condemned the gruesome torture and murder of Ukrainian civilians discovered after Russia’s withdrawal from the cities of Izyum and Bucha.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Wherever the Russian tide recedes, we discover the horror that’s left in its wake,” Blinken said. “We can not, we will not, allow President Putin to get away with it.”\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied the charges and accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilians in the eastern Donbas region “with impunity.”\n\nLavrov also said that countries sending weapons to Ukraine or training its forces “to deplete and weaken Russia” were direct parties to the war.\n\n“Such a line signifies the direct involvement of Western countries in the Ukrainian conflict, and makes them a party thereto,” he said, walking out of the chamber as soon as he finished speaking.\n\nYet amid the escalating rhetoric, the secretive prisoner exchange deal announced Wednesday night, which involved the mediation of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, showed that some behind-the-scenes diplomacy was still possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal was celebrated in Kyiv, where the Azov commanders are widely regarded as heroes for their role in holding the line during the siege of Mariupol. The head of Ukraine’s chief military intelligence directorate, Kyryl Budanov, alleged that some of the liberated prisoners had been tortured. “There are persons who were subjected to very cruel torture, and unfortunately the percentage of such persons among whom we returned is quite large,” he said.\n\nIn Russia, the deal was so toxic that the Kremlin distanced itself from the decision and the Ministry of Defense would not confirm the details.\n\nMedvedchuk, the apparent centerpiece of the deal, was chief of staff to former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma from 2002 to 2005 and has long played a Machiavellian role in Ukrainian politics.\n\nBefore the failure of Moscow to seize Kyiv and topple the elected government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Medvedchuk was seen as a potential puppet leader for the Kremlin. But he is known mainly as a close friend of Putin. Medvedchuk has said the Russian leader is godfather to his daughter and Putin has visited his palatial mansion in Crimea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked whether Medvedchuk had been freed, Peskov said: “I can’t comment on the prisoner exchange. I don’t have powers to do so.” A statement from the Russian Defense Ministry also failed to mention Medvedchuk.\n\nFreed Russian prisoners arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Sept. 22 as part of major prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia. (Video: Reuters, Photo: AP/Reuters)\n\nEventually, Denis Pushilin, Moscow’s proxy leader in a separatist area of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, confirmed that he had agreed to the exchange for 50 Russian servicemen, five pro-Russian fighters from Ukraine and Medvedchuk.\n\nSending Russian men to fight in a war to “denazify” Ukraine, at the same time as releasing the Azov commanders and fighters, was difficult for Russia to explain — given that, for years, Kremlin propaganda has portrayed the Azov group as fanatical terrorists and “Nazi” ringleaders who must be destroyed.\n\nThe exchange deal took place “in difficult circumstances,” Pushilin told Russian state television. “We gave them 215 people, including nationalistic battalion fighters. They are war criminals. We were perfectly aware of that, but our goal was to bring our guys back as soon as possible.”\n\nHard-line nationalists branded the exchange as a betrayal that undercut the reason for the war, on the same day Russia was calling up men to fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the toughest critics of the Russian military approach — for being too soft — is Igor Girkin, a former Russian FSB agent who commanded Moscow proxy fighters in 2014. He called the exchange of the Azov fighters “treason,” in a post on social media Thursday, blaming “as yet unidentified persons from the top leadership of the Russian Federation.”\n\nThe release was “worse than a crime and worse than a mistake. This is INCREDIBLE STUPIDITY,” he complained. (Girkin is being tried in absentia by a court in The Hague over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.)\n\nIn Chechnya, the regional dictator and close Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov said on Telegram that the Azov Regiment “terrorists” should not have been handed over.\n\n“It is not right. Our fighters crushed the fascists in Mariupol, drove them into Azovstal, smoked them out of the basements, died, got wounded and shell-shocked. The transfer of even one of these Azov terrorists should have been unacceptable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin has relied on public apathy to continue his war, and has stopped short of declaring a full national draft. But his mobilization, which is supposed to call up at least 300,000 reservists, will force many more Russians to confront the brutal reality of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIn a speech posted online late Thursday, Zelensky, switching to Russian, addressed Russian citizens directly, invoking the thousands of their countrymen already killed and wounded in Ukraine. “Want more? No?” he asked. “Then protest. Fight. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity. These are the options for you to survive.”\n\nSome Russian protesters who were arrested while demonstrating against mobilization Wednesday were handed military summonses at police stations, a move designed to deter further dissent, especially by fighting-age men. Peskov said it was perfectly legal. “It does not contravene the law. Therefore, there is no violation of the law,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions about the partial mobilization swirled on Thursday, with confusion over who would escape being called up and who would be forced to fight.\n\nThe role of Peskov’s own son, Nikolai Peskov, underscored Russian suspicions that wealthy and politically connected figures would be spared from military service, and that the war would continue to be fought largely by men from impoverished regions, far from Moscow.\n\nNikolai Peskov was less than enthusiastic about the idea he could be sent to fight when he was phoned Wednesday by Dmitry Nizovtsev, a member of the team of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and an opposition YouTube channel anchor. Nizovtsev, posing as a military official, demanded that the younger Peskov appear at a local military commissariat the following day at 10 a.m.\n\n“Obviously I won’t come tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Nikolai Peskov said. “You have to understand that I am Mr. Peskov and it’s not exactly right for me to be there. In short, I will solve this on another level.”\n\nNatalia Abbakamova in Riga, Latvia, and David Stern in Kyiv contributed to this report.\n\nWar in Ukraine: What you need to know The latest: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of troops in an address to the nation on Sept. 21, framing the move as an attempt to defend Russian sovereignty against a West that seeks to use Ukraine as a tool to “divide and destroy Russia.” Follow our live updates here.

    "Bad to Worse for Russia": "Julian added: “The potential countermove for the West is going to be to send more artillery tubes and tanks to Ukraine.”\n\nThe U.S., the E.U. and other allies have already sent billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine. Those weapons, especially shoulder-fired and longer-range missiles, have been enormously helpful. President Biden, speaking at the United Nations yesterday, trumpeted this assistance while also warning Putin not to use nuclear weapons.\n\nStill, Ukraine’s leaders say they need additional equipment to force Russian troops out of the country. The Biden administration has requested more funding for Ukraine from Congress.\n\nOne question is whether the U.S. would be willing to send longer-range missiles and more modern tanks to Ukraine than allies have previously sent. So far, the West has chosen not to, partly out of a desire to avoid making Putin believe that an invasion of Russia was plausible. In that scenario, Putin might choose to escalate his attacks. Without more tanks, however, Ukraine would likely be at a military disadvantage.",
    "The Moscow Mechanism Report on Russia’s Failure to Fulfill its Human Dimension Commitments": "The United States and 37 other countries invoked the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) Moscow Mechanism on July 28 to examine the Russia’s adherence to its OSCE Human Dimension commitments on human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the report released today in Vienna, the expert mission found that a decade of legislation in Russia “has completely changed the scope of Russian civil society, cutting it off from foreign and international partners, suppressing independent initiatives, stifling critical attitudes towards the authorities, silencing the media, and suppressing political opposition.”\n\nSpecifically, this report documents that the Kremlin has centralized all federal and regional law enforcement authorities under Kremlin control; used so-called “foreign agent” laws to impose draconian penalties and fines on individuals and civil society organizations with any foreign contacts; effectively silenced freedom of expression, including independent media and criticism of the government through harsh censorship laws; and “created a climate of fear and intimidation…that is not in line with OSCE standards based on pluralism and a strong and independent civil society.” The report also makes clear that Russia’s “(r)epression on the inside and war on the outside are connected to each other as if in a communicating tube.”\n\nThe United States and our Allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for its sweeping failure to fulfill its OSCE commitments and obligations under international law to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other states.",
    "Russia Is Denounced at U.N. Over Nuclear Threat and Alleged War Crimes": "Video In remarks to the United Nations Security Council, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia’s escalation of the war in Ukraine. Credit Credit... Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times\n\nInsults, accusations and talk of war crimes and nuclear holocaust dominated the world’s premier diplomatic stage on Thursday, as the United Nations Security Council met to debate how and whether anyone would be held accountable for the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov called Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a “bastard,” but was not around long enough to hear what many of his counterparts had to say. After arriving 90 minutes late to the meeting — and missing the briefings given by António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, and Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court — Mr. Lavrov left early.\n\nThe U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for saying on Wednesday that he could use all arms available to him in the war, interpreted by officials in both Russia and the West as a veiled reference to nuclear weapons.\n\n“Every council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately,” Mr. Blinken told the Security Council, in some of his sharpest comments since the war began. “Tell President Putin to stop the horror he started.”\n\n“One man chose this war. One man can end it,” he added. “Because if Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.”\n\nIt was the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February that Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Blinken, as well as the top diplomats of some key U.S. allies, were in the same room together.\n\nThe meeting, coinciding with the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering, was called to discuss allegations of war crimes and human rights abuses by Russian forces. But Mr. Lavrov, like Mr. Putin and other Kremlin officials, tried to flip the narrative, casting Russia as the aggrieved party.\n\nMr. Lavrov said Ukraine had launched “an assault” on the Russian language and trampled on the rights of ethnic Russians in the Donbas region that Russia now mostly controls. He said the goal of countries supplying weapons to Ukraine was to prolong the conflict and “to wear down and weaken Russia.”\n\n“That policy means the direct involvement of the West in the conflict,” he said.\n\nImage Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, attributed the prolonged conflict to countries supplying weapons to Ukraine. Credit... Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times\n\nMr. Lavrov was not in the room when Dmytro Kuleba, foreign minister of Ukraine, called for a special tribunal to hold Russia’s leaders accountable for the crime of aggression against his country.\n\n“There will be no peace without justice,” Mr. Kuleba said. “None of the crimes of Russia in Ukraine would be possible without the crime of aggression.”\n\nHe described Mr. Putin’s announcement this week that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to active duty an admission of defeat.\n\nIn March the International Criminal Court formally opened an investigation into allegations of Russian crimes against humanity in Ukraine, and it has dispatched teams of investigators to gather evidence there. Mr. Khan said a team would travel to eastern Ukraine to investigate newer accusations.\n\nThe foreign ministers representing the 15 Security Council members all called for accountability for abuses in Ukraine, though their tones depended on whether their governments have taken sides or tried to remain neutral.\n\nChina, aligned with Russia and a permanent Council member, has not publicly condemned the invasion but has signaled reservations about it. Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, called for investigations that would not be “politicized” and be “objective and fair, based on fair facts, rather than an assumption of guilt.”",

The so-called kamikaze drones struck a tugboat in the southern city of Ochakiv and a nonresidential building in Kryvyi Rih in the country’s heartland, but no one was injured, the military command said on Facebook . Ukrainian officials reported their first encounter with the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones last week, after Iran began sending them to Russia in August.\n\nFive people were injured and at least one person died in overnight strikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said Thursday on Telegram. Residential buildings were destroyed by rockets, he said, adding that the extent of the damage was still being clarified. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said nine rockets hit a hotel, trapping people under the rubble. He said a power station was also struck, leaving people in the south of Zaporizhzhia without electricity.",
    "World opinion shifts against Russia as Ukraine worries grow": "Belarus' Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei speaks during a high level Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine, Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022, at United Nations headquarters. The tide of international opinion appears to have decisively shifted against Russia, as a number of non-aligned countries joined the United States and its allies in condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and its threats to the principles of the international rules-based order.

Only one country, Belarus, a non-council member and Russia ally that was invited to participate, spoke in support of Russia, but also called for a quick end to the fighting, which it called a “tragedy.” (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The tide of international opinion appears to be decisively shifting against Russia, as a number of non-aligned countries are joining the United States and its allies in condemning Moscow’s war in Ukraine and its threats to the principles of the international rules-based order.\n\nWestern officials have repeatedly said that Russia has become isolated since invading Ukraine in February. Until recently, though, that was largely wishful thinking. But on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, much of the international community spoke out against the conflict in a rare display of unity at the often fractured United Nations.\n\nThe tide had already appeared to be turning against Putin even before Thursday’s U.N. speeches. Chinese and Indian leaders had been critical of the war at a high-level summit last week in Uzbekistan. And then the U.N. General Assembly disregarded Russia’s objections and voted overwhelmingly to allow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be the only leader to address the body remotely, instead of requiring him to appear in person.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat shift against Russia accelerated after President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced the mobilization of some additional 300,000 troops to Ukraine, signaling the unlikelihood of a quick end to the war. Putin also suggested that nuclear weapons may be an option. That followed an announcement of Russia’s intention to hold independence referenda in several occupied Ukrainian regions with an eye toward possible annexation.\n\nThose announcements came at the very moment that the General Assembly, considered the premier event in the global diplomatic calendar, was taking place in New York.\n\nNumerous world leaders used their speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday to denounce Russia’s war. That trend continued Thursday both in the assembly hall and at the usually deeply divided U.N. Security Council, where, one-by-one, virtually all of the 15 council members served up harsh criticism of Russia – a council member -- for aggravating several already severe global crises and imperiling the foundations of the world body.\n\nThe apparent shift in opinion offers some hope to Ukraine and its Western allies that increasing isolation will add pressure on Putin to negotiate a peace. But few are unduly optimistic. Putin has staked his legacy on the Ukraine war and few expect him to back down. And, Russia is hardly isolated. Many of its allies depend on it for energy, food and military assistance and are likely to stand by Putin regardless of what happens in Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStill, it was striking to hear Russia’s nominal friends like China and India, following up on last week’s remarks, speak of grave concerns they have about the conflict and its impact on global food and energy shortages as well as threats to the concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are enshrined in the U.N. Charter.\n\nBrazil registered similar concerns. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa make up the so-called BRICS bloc of countries, which has often shunned or outright opposed Western initiatives and views on international relations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnly one country, Belarus, a non-council member and Russia ally that was invited to participate, spoke in support of Russia, but also called for a quick end to the fighting, which it called a “tragedy.”\n\n“We hear a lot about the divisions among countries at the United Nations,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “But recently, what’s striking is the remarkable unity among member states when it comes to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Leaders from countries developing and developed, big and small, North and South have spoken in the General Assembly about the consequences of the war and the need to end it.”\n\n“Even a number of nations that maintain close ties with Moscow have said publicly that they have serious questions and concerns about President Putin’s ongoing invasion,” Blinken said.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was careful not to condemn the war but said that China’s firm stance is that “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes of the principles of the U.N. Charter should be observed.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndian Foreign Secretary S. Jayashankar said “the trajectory of the Ukraine conflict is a matter of a profound concern for the international community.” He called for accountability for atrocities and abuses committed in Ukraine. “If egregious attacks committed in broad daylight are left unpunished, this council must reflect on the signals we are sending on impunity. There must be consistency if we are to ensure credibility,” he said.\n\nAnd Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Alberto Franca said immediate efforts to end the war are critical. “The continuation of the hostilities endangers the lives of innocent civilians and jeopardizes the food and energy security of millions of families in other regions, especially in developing countries,” he said. “The risks of escalation arising for the current dynamics of the conflict are simply too great, and its consequences for the world order unpredictable.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nForeign ministers and top officials from Albania, Britain, France, Ireland, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico and Norway delivered similar rebukes.\n\n“Russia’s actions are blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations,” said Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka. “We all tried to prevent this conflict. We could not, but we must not fail to hold Russia accountable.”\n\nMexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard called the invasion a “flagrant breach of international law” and Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said: “If we fail to hold Russia accountable we send a message to large countries that they can prey on their neighbors with impunity.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was unapologetic and defensive at the same time and specifically targeted Zelenskyy. Citing a phrase often attributed to President Franklin Roosevelt, Lavrov called Zelenskyy “a bastard,” but said Western leaders regarded him as “our bastard.”\n\nHe repeated a long list of Russia’s complaints about Ukraine and accused Western countries of using Ukraine for anti-Russia activities and policies.\n\n“Everything I’ve said today simply confirms that the decision to conduct the special military operation was inevitable,” Lavrov said, following Russian practice of not calling the invasion a war.\n\nRussia has denied being isolated and the foreign ministry used social media to publicize a number of apparently cordial meetings that Lavrov has held with foreign minister colleagues at the UN in recent days.\n\nStill, Blinken and his colleagues from other NATO nations seized on what they believe to be growing opposition to and impatience with Putin.\n\nAnd, several speakers, including Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, pointed out that Lavrov skipped the meeting except for his speaking slot.\n\n“I notice that Russian diplomats flee almost as quickly as Russian soldiers,” Kuleba said, referring to Lavrov’s hasty exit along with recent Russian troop retreats in Ukraine.",
    "U.S. has sent private warnings to Russia against using a nuclear weapon": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe United States for several months has been sending private communications to Moscow warning Russia’s leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon, according to U.S. officials, who said the messages underscore what President Biden and his aides have articulated publicly. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Biden administration generally has decided to keep warnings about the consequences of a nuclear strike deliberately vague, so the Kremlin worries about how Washington might respond, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations.\n\nThe attempt by the White House to cultivate what’s known in the nuclear deterrence world as “strategic ambiguity” comes as Russia continues to escalate its rhetoric about possible nuclear weapons use amid a domestic mobilization aimed at stanching Russian military losses in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe State Department has been involved in the private communications with Moscow, but officials would not say who delivered the messages or the scope of their content. It was not clear whether the United States had sent any new private messages in the hours since Russian President Vladimir Putin issued his latest veiled nuclear threat during a speech announcing a partial mobilization early Wednesday, but a senior U.S. official said the communication has been happening consistently over recent months.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, wrote Thursday in a post on Telegram that territory in eastern Ukraine would be “accepted into Russia” after the completion of staged “referendums” and vowed to strengthen the security of those areas.\n\nTo defend that annexed land, Medvedev said, Russia is able to use not only its newly mobilized forces, but also “any Russian weapon, including strategic nuclear ones and those using new principles,” a reference to hypersonic weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Russia has chosen its path,” Medvedev added. “There is no way back.”\n\nThe comment came a day after Putin suggested Russia would annex occupied lands in Ukraine’s south and east, and incorporate the regions formally into what Moscow considers its territory. He said he was not bluffing when he vowed to use all means at Russia’s disposal to defend the country’s territorial integrity — a veiled reference to the country’s nuclear arsenal.\n\nBiden administration officials have emphasized that this isn’t the first time the Russian leadership has threatened to use nuclear weapons since the start of the war on Feb. 24, and have said there is no indication Russia is moving its nuclear weapons in preparation for an imminent strike.\n\nStill, the recent statements from the Russian leadership are more specific than previous comments and come at a time when Russia is reeling on the battlefield from a U.S.-backed Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhereas previous Kremlin statements appeared to be aimed at warning the United States and its allies against going too far in helping Ukraine, Putin’s most recent comments suggested Russia is considering using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine to freeze gains and force Kyiv and its backers into submission, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonproliferation advocacy group in Washington.\n\n“What everyone needs to recognize is that this is one of, if not the most, severe episodes in which nuclear weapons might be used in decades,” Kimball said. “The consequences of even a so-called ‘limited nuclear war’ would be absolutely catastrophic.”\n\nFor years, U.S. nuclear experts have worried that Russia might use smaller tactical nuclear weapons, sometimes referred to as “battlefield nukes,” to end a conventional war favorably on its terms — a strategy sometimes described as “escalate to de-escalate.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, told the U.K.’s ITV News that it is possible Russia will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine “to stop our offensive activity and to destroy our state.”\n\n“This is a threat for other countries,” Skibitskyi said. “The blast of a tactical nuclear weapon will have an impact not only in Ukraine but the Black Sea region.”\n\nThe Ukrainians have tried to signal that even a Russian nuclear strike wouldn’t force them into capitulation — and in fact could have the opposite effect.\n\n“Threatening with nuclear weapons … to Ukrainians?” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted on Wednesday. “Putin have not yet understood who he is dealing with.”\n\nIn an interview with CBS News’s “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Biden was asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader is considering using nuclear weapons in the conflict against Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Don’t. Don’t. Don’t,” Biden said. “You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.”\n\nBiden declined to detail how the United States would respond, saying only that the reaction would be “consequential” and would depend “on the extent of what they do.”\n\nThe Biden administration would face a crisis if Russia were to use a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine, which isn’t a U.S. treaty ally. Any direct military U.S. response against Russia would risk the possibility of a wider war between nuclear-armed superpowers — the avoidance of which the Biden administration has made its No. 1 priority in all of its Ukraine policymaking.\n\nMatthew Kroenig, a professor of government at Georgetown University and director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, has argued that the best option for the administration, if faced with a limited Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine, might be to step up backing for Ukraine and conduct a limited conventional strike on the Russian forces or bases that launched the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If it’s Russian forces in Ukraine that launched the nuclear attack, the United States could strike directly against those forces,” Kroenig said. “It would be calibrated to send a message that this is not a major war coming, this is a limited strike. If you are Putin, what do you do in response? I don’t think you immediately say let’s launch all the nukes at the United States.”\n\nBut even a limited conventional strike by the U.S. military against Russia would be viewed as reckless by many in Washington, who would argue against risking a full-scale war with a nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nJames M. Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it doesn’t make sense at this point to game out U.S. responses because there is such a wide range of possible Russian actions — from an underground nuclear test that doesn’t hurt anyone to a large-scale explosion that kills tens of thousands of civilians — and there are no signs Putin is close to crossing the threshold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If he was really thinking very seriously about using nuclear weapons very imminently, he almost certainly would want us to know that,” Acton said. “He would much rather threaten nuclear use and have us make concessions than actually have to go down the path of nuclear use.”\n\nU.S. officials have been stepping up efforts at the U.N. General Assembly this week to deter Russia from seriously considering what would be the first use of a nuclear weapon in a conflict since the atomic bombings of Japan by the United States in 1945.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting Thursday, said Russia’s “reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.”\n\n“This week, President Putin said that Russia would not hesitate to use and I quote, ‘all weapons systems available’ in response to a threat to his territorial integrity — a threat that is all the more menacing given Russians’ intention to annex large swaths of Ukraine in the days ahead,” Blinken said. “When that’s complete, we can expect President Putin will claim any Ukrainian effort to liberate this land as an attack on so-called Russian territory.”\n\nBlinken noted that Russia in January joined other permanent members of the Security Council in signing a joint statement declaring, “nuclear war can never be won, and must never be fought.”\n\nHudson reported from the United Nations in New York.\n\nWar in Ukraine: What you need to know The latest: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of troops in an address to the nation on Sept. 21, framing the move as an attempt to defend Russian sovereignty against a West that seeks to use Ukraine as a tool to “divide and destroy Russia.” Follow our live updates here.

    "US urges world to tell Russia to stop its nuclear threats": "US urges world to tell Russia to stop its nuclear threats\n\nThe United Nations Security Council meets on the situation in Ukraine, Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022 at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nThe United Nations Security Council meets on the situation in Ukraine, Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022 at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States urged other nations to tell Russia to stop making nuclear threats and end “the horror” of its war in Ukraine as all three countries’ top diplomats spoke — but didn’t quite meet — at a high-profile U.N. Security Council meeting Thursday.\n\nHeld alongside the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders , the session followed a striking development in the war this week: Russia called up a portion of its reserves for the first time since World War II. At the same time, President Vladimir Putin said his nuclear-armed country would “use all means available to us” to defend itself if its territory is threatened.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saw Putin’s remark as particularly menacing given plans for referendums in Russian-controlled parts of eastern and southern Ukraine on whether to become part of Russia.\n\nWestern nations have condemned those votes as illegitimate and nonbinding. But, in their wake, Moscow might see any Ukrainian attempt to retake those areas as an attack on “Russian territory,” Blinken warned.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Every council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately,” he said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov didn’t mention his country’s nuclear capacity or the new troop mobilization during his own remarks at the council meeting, which France called to discuss accountability for alleged abuses and atrocities during the nearly 7-month-long war .\n\nInstead, Lavrov repeated his country’s frequent claims that Kyiv has long oppressed Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east — one of the explanations Moscow has offered for the invasion — and that Western support for Ukraine is a menace to Russia.\n\n“What’s particularly cynical is the position of states that are pumping Ukraine full of weapons and training their soldiers,” he said, maintaining that their goal is to prolong fighting “to wear down and weaken Russia.”\n\n“That policy means the direct involvement of the West in the conflict,” said Lavrov. He added that Ukraine had become “an anti-Russia staging ground to create threats against Russian security” and his country wouldn’t accept it.\n\nThe Security Council has held dozens of contentious meetings on Ukraine since the war began in February, but Thursday’s session had special stature.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“That President Putin picked this week, as most of the world gathers at the United Nations, to add fuel to the fire he started shows his utter contempt and disdain for the U.N. Charter, the U.N. General Assembly and this council,” Blinken told foreign ministers around the group’s famous horseshoe-shaped table.\n\n“Tell President Putin to stop the horror he started. Tell him to stop putting his interests above the interests of the rest of the world, including his own people,” Blinken added.\n\nRegardless, no one expects the council to act against Russia, since Moscow has veto power as a permanent member.\n\nBut the meeting was still a rare moment for top diplomats from Ukraine and Russia to appear in the same room — made all the more extraordinary for the fact that Lavrov is under U.S. sanctions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a sign of the charged atmosphere, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba apparently objected as council staffers prepared to put a placard marking Ukraine’s seat next to Russia’s. The placard was ultimately moved to another spot.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Kuleba wryly told reporters that he planned to keep a “social distance” from Lavrov. But it turned out he didn’t have to: The Russian appeared only just before speaking and left right after, prompting Kuleba to quip later in his own speech that “Russian diplomats flee almost as quickly as Russian soldiers.”\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he thought Lavrov didn’t care to hear “the collective condemnation of this council.”\n\nAnd in an interview with The Associated Press, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre called Lavrov’s decision not to hear other speakers in person “a sign of insecurity.”\n\nIn an undiplomatic exchange, Lavrov accused the U.S. and its allies of covering up alleged misdeeds by Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s government on the rationale that “he’s a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.” Kuleba later chided Russia for the “inappropriate slang.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlinken argued that Russia should face further censure and isolation for its invasion, pressing other countries to join in Washington’s forceful condemnations of the conflict . He cited the discovery of mass graves in Ukraine and repeated allegations from Ukrainians that they were tortured by Russian soldiers.\n\nThe International Criminal Court opened an investigation in March into possible crimes amid the war and sent teams to gather evidence. Prosecutor Karim Khan told the council Thursday that he’s dispatching more ICC staffers next week to look into allegations emerging from eastern Ukraine.\n\nKhan hasn’t yet announced any charges linked to the conflict, but he reiterated that he believes there are reasonable grounds to think that crimes have been committed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The picture that I’ve seen so far is troubling indeed,” he said.\n\nThe meeting came less than a week after Ukraine’s Zelenskyy announced the discovery of a mass burial site near a northeastern city, Izium, that had recently been recaptured from Russian forces. Zelenskyy said investigators found evidence that some of the dead were tortured.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna told the council that the discovery prompted her country to send more investigators to join others who have been in Ukraine since hundreds of civilians were found dead in another city, Bucha, after a Russian withdrawal in late March.\n\nThere are “so many violations of the laws of war and so many actions for which Russia must be held accountable,” she said.\n\nOther council members also called for accountability, but in varying tones.\n\n“Investigations into violations of international humanitarian law should be objective and fair, based on fair facts, rather than an assumption of guilt, and without being politicized,” said Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, which has maintained strong ties with Russia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Edith M.

    "Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 212 of the invasion": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Russians to resist the partial military mobilisation announced by Vladimir Putin, which has sparked protests and a fresh exodus out of Russia. The Ukrainian president said in his daily address on Thursday: “55,000 Russian soldiers died in these six months of war … Want more? No? Then protest, fight back, run away, or surrender” to the Ukrainian army.\n\nThousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after the mobilisation announcement. Among those called up since Putin’s announcement on Wednesday were Russians detained while protesting against the mobilisation, the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said.\n\nTraffic at Russian border crossings with Finland and Georgia surged after the mobilisation announcement sparked fears that men of fighting age would be called to the frontlines in Ukraine. Prices for one-way flights out of Moscow to the nearest foreign locations rose above $5,000 (£4,435), with most air tickets sold out for the coming days. Photos showed long tailbacks at border crossings with Finland and Georgia.\n\nIn response, Finland’s prime minister said her government was considering ways to sharply reduce Russian tourism and transit through Finland. “The government’s will is very clear: we believe Russian tourism [to Finland] must be stopped, as well as transit through Finland,” Sanna Marin told reporters.\n\nThe Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age as “exaggerated”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: “This is not against the law.”\n\nPutin is giving directions directly to generals in the field, CNN reported. The direct orders from the Russian president to generals “hints at the dysfunctional command structure” that has affected Russian forces on the battlefield, according to two sources familiar with American and western intelligence who spoke to CNN.\n\nNato has condemned plans to hold “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation in Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine, describing them as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest”. “Sham referenda” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson have no legitimacy, the alliance said.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, wants European Union sanctions on Russia lifted by the end of the year, a pro-government daily newspaper said. Orban, a Putin ally, has frequently railed against the sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMany of the Ukrainians exchanged in the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the beginning of the invasion show signs of violent torture, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence said on Thursday. On Wednesday, Ukraine announced the exchange of a record-high 215 imprisoned soldiers with Russia, including fighters who led the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks that became an icon of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nBritain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said he was “not surprised” that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, walked out of a UN security council meeting. “I don’t think Mr Lavrov wants to hear the collective condemnation of this council,” Cleverly said at the UN.\n\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, has strongly rebuked Russia for “totally unacceptable” nuclear threats. Speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, Guterres said Moscow’s plans to annex parts of Ukraine were a “violation of the UN charter and of international law”.\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, also denied reports that an undisclosed clause in Putin’s mobilisation decree provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. “This is a lie,” Peskov said in response to a report by Novaya Gazeta.",
    "‘I will cross the border tonight’: Russians flee after news of draft": "Hours after Vladimir Putin shocked Russia by announcing the first mobilisation since the second world war, Oleg received his draft papers in the mailbox, ordering him to make his way to the local recruitment centre in Kazan, the capital of the ​​Tatarstan republic.\n\nAs a 29-year-old sergeant in the Russian reserves, Oleg said he always knew that he would be the first in line if a mobilisation was declared, but held out hope that he would not be forced to fight in the war in Ukraine.\n\n“My heart sank when I got the call-up,” he said. “But I knew I had no time to despair.”\n\nHe quickly packed all his belongings and booked a one-way ticket to Orenburg, a southern Russian city close to the border with Kazakhstan.\n\n“I will be driving across the border tonight,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday from the airport in Orenburg. “I have no idea when I’ll step foot in Russia again,” he added, referring to the jail sentence Russian men face for avoiding the draft.\n\nOleg said he will leave behind his wife, who is due to give birth next week. “I will miss the most important day of my life. But I am simply not letting Putin turn me into a killer in a war that I want no part in.”\n\nThe Kremlin’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, likely sparking a new, possibly unprecedented brain drain in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to over a dozen men and women who had left Russia since Putin announced the so-called partial mobilisation, or who are planning to do so in the next few days.\n\nOptions to flee are limited, they say. Earlier this week, four of the five EU countries bordering Russia announced they would no longer allow Russians to enter on tourist visas.\n\nDirect flights from Moscow to Istanbul, Yerevan, Tashkent and Baku, the capitals of countries allowing Russians visa-free entry, were sold out for the next week, while the cheapest one-way flight from Moscow to Dubai cost about 370,000 rubles (£5,000) – a fee too steep for most.\n\nAnd so many, like Oleg, were forced to get creative and drive to some of the few land borders still open to Russians.\n\nBorder guards in Finland, the last EU country that still allows entry to Russians with tourist visas, said that they have noticed an “exceptional number” of Russian nationals seeking to cross the border overnight, while eyewitnesses also said the Russian-Georgian and Russian-Mongolian borders were “collapsing” with overwhelming traffic.\n\n“We are seeing an even bigger exodus than when the war started,” said Ira Lobanovskaya, who started the “Guide to the free World” NGO, which helps Russians against the war leave the country.\n\nShe said her website had received over one and half million visits since Putin’s speech on Wednesday. According to Lobanovkaya’s estimates, over 70,000 Russians that used the group’s services have already left or made concrete plans to leave.\n\n“These are people who are buying one-way tickets. They won’t be coming back as long as mobilisation is ongoing,” she said.\n\nMany of those who are still in Russia will feel that time is running out. At least three regions have already announced they will close their borders to men eligible for the draft.\n\nBorder agents at Russian airports have also reportedly started interrogating departing male passengers about their military service status and checking return tickets.\n\nAfter thousands of Russians rallied against the war and mobilisation on Wednesday, some took to social media to criticise protesters for not speaking out earlier, when their country’s troops were committing human rights abuses in Bucha, Irpin and countless of other towns across Ukraine.\n\nPolicemen move in to detain participants of an unauthorised protest against partial mobilisation in central St Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday. Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPA\n\n“I understand people’s frustration,” said Igor, a 26-year-old IT professional from St Petersburg, who is planning to fly to Vladikavkaz and drive to Georgia, another popular fleeing route used by Russians, next week. “I attended the anti-war protest when Putin launched his invasion, but the authorities just jail everyone.”\n\nSome of the protesters detained in Moscow have subsequently been given draft notices while locked up, according to the monitoring group OVD, further underlying the dangers average Russians face when taking to the streets.\n\n“I think the only way I can personally help Ukraine right now is by not fighting there,” Igor said.\n\nThere have also been calls for the EU to support Russians who are looking for a way out of the draft.\n\nThe EU Commission spokesperson on home affairs, Anitta Hipper, said that the bloc would meet to discuss the issuance of humanitarian visas to Russians fleeing mobilisation. The three Baltic states said on Thursday, however, that they are not prepared to automatically offer asylum to Russians fleeing the draft.\n\nEven those without any military experience – men who Putin vowed not to call up – are packing their bags.\n\nRussian police detaining a protester against the partial mobilisation. Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA\n\nThey point to the ambiguity of Putin’s mobilisation law and point to previous broken promises that he would not call for one.\n\n“Putin lied that there will be no mobilisation,” said 23-year-old Anton, a student in Moscow, referring to the president’s International Women’s Day address on 8 March, when he insisted that no reservists would be called up to fight in Ukraine. “Why would he not lie again about this partial mobilisation?”\n\nFears have grown after independent website Novaya Gazeta Europe reported, based on its government sources, that the mobilistation decrees allow the Ministry of Defence to call up 1,000,000 people, instead of the 300,000 announced by the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, on Wednesday.\n\nFor now, Lobanovskaya said, the majority of Russians leaving are men.\n\nThe Guardian also spoke to a number of women, mostly medics, who similarly decided to leave the country after reports started to trickle out that Russia was calling up health professionals to the front.\n\n“I know medics are supposed to treat people, that is our duty,” said Tatayana, a doctor from Irkutsk, who bought a plane ticket to Baku for next week. “But I believe the sooner this horrible war stops, the fewer people will die.”\n\nThe mobilisation also appears to have spooked some of the very people on whom the regime relies to sustain its war efforts.\n\n“For me, mobilisation is the red line,” said Ilya, 29, a mid-level official working for the Moscow government. “Tomorrow I will be in Kazakhstan.”\n\nOne man, the son of a west-sanctioned oligarch due to come back to Russia after his studies abroad to work for his family business, said he no longer planned to do so.\n\n“Well, one thing is clear,” he said, in a brief interview by text message. “I won’t be coming back to Russia anytime soon.”",
    "Four occupied Ukraine regions begin vote on joining Russia": "Referendums will continue until Tuesday and are seen as paving the way for Moscow’s annexation of the territories and an escalation of the war.\n\nFour areas of Russian-occupied Ukraine have started to hold referendums, which have been condemned as illegitimate by Kyiv and are seen as paving the way for Moscow to formally annex some 15 percent of Ukrainian territory.\n\nVoting in Luhansk and Donetsk, self-proclaimed “independent republics” controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014, as well as in southern Kherson and Zaporizhia provinces will continue until September 27.\n\nThe voting process in the four regions would be untraditional, Russian news agency TASS reported.\n\n“Given the short deadlines and the lack of technical equipment, it was decided not to hold electronic voting and use the traditional paper ballots,” it said.\n\nAuthorities will go door-to-door for the first four days to collect votes, and polling stations will open only on the final day for residents to cast their ballots.\n\nThe Russian-installed leaders of the four areas abruptly announced the plans on Tuesday after a lightning Ukraine counteroffensive recaptured swathes of territory in northeastern Kharkiv that Russia had occupied after invading the country on February 24.\n\nThe results are seen as a foregone conclusion in favour of annexation, and Ukraine and its allies have already made clear they will not recognise the outcome.\n\nA similar referendum, held in Crimea after the Russian invasion of 2014, found 97 percent in favour of formal annexation in a vote that took place under the close watch of Russian soldiers and was not recognised by the international community.\n\nThe votes are seen as a significant escalation of the seven-month-old war in Ukraine — in which thousands have been killed and millions displaced — because incorporation would allow Moscow to claim that it was defending its own territory.\n\n“If this is all declared Russia territory, they can declare that this is a direct attack on Russia so they can fight without any reservations,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai told Ukrainian TV.\n\nThe referendums have been condemned by the United Nations and world leaders, including United States President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as international bodies such as NATO, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n\nOSCE, which monitors elections, said the outcomes would have no legal force because they do not conform with Ukraine law or international standards and fighting is continuing in the areas where the votes are taking place.\n\n‘All a sham’\n\nThere will be no independent observers, and polling stations in Zaporizhzhia will be under heavy guard, local officials told the RIA news agency.\n\nSome residents continued to leave ahead of the vote. Yulia, who fled Melitopol and preferred to share only her first name for fear of reprisals, travelled to Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia, but left her parents behind.\n\nShe would told Al Jazeera they were part of an older generation who were nostalgic for the Soviet Union, which collapsed more than 30 years ago and included Ukraine. Russia recognised Ukraine’s post-Soviet borders under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.\n\n“I kept my children at home,” she said, of life in the occupied city. “At school there was too much pressure on them. They would get punished if they spoke Ukrainian. I’m afraid I won’t be able to return home because after the referendum people will need special permits to get in and out.”\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions – the self-proclaimed republics Putin recognised as independent just before the invasion – residents will have to answer if they support their “republic’s entry into Russia”, according to TASS.\n\nThe question on the ballots in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be phrased differently: “Are you in favour of secession from Ukraine, formation of an independent state by the region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?”\n\n“This is all a sham. This is all a charade being orchestrated by Putin,” Kurt Volker, who was US special representative for Ukraine negotiations from 2017 to 2019 and is now a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think this has any impact on the situation on the ground and won’t change Ukrainian determination to recover and recapture territories. Nor will it harm the determination in the West to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression.”\n\nUkraine has said the referendums were a sign of Russia’s weakness rather than strength.\n\nRussia controls most of Luhansk and Kherson, about 80 percent of Zaporizhzhia and just 60 percent of Donetsk.\n\nA day after the referendums were announced, Putin ordered a mobilisation of reservists to bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, and declared he was ready to use nuclear weapons to fend off any attacks on Russian territory.\n\n“Any decision that the Russian leadership may take changes nothing for Ukraine,” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday.\n\n“Of interest to us are strictly the tasks before us. This is the liberation of our country, defending our people and mobilising world support [public opinion] to carry out those tasks.”",

Vitaliy Lukov, the deputy mayor of Mykolaiv, has theories for why Russia could be targeting the site.\n\n\"The Russians probably have some coordinates indicating that this place is significant, maybe because they think there is some military facility there or because it's near government administration buildings,\" Lukov says. \"But for the citizens, this place is just a bus stop.\"\n\nFor Komarova and her family, the consequences were devastating. She remembers holding her lifeless dog and reaching for her dying father.\n\n\"He could barely stay conscious,\" she says. \"My mother saw everything from the window of our apartment.\"\n\nSince the start of the war this year, Russia has been bombarding the southern region of Mykolaiv, which is near the coveted port of Odesa. Russian forces control a small portion of the region and said this week that they plan to incorporate this area into the neighboring region of Kherson, much of which is under Russian occupation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Umit Bektas/Reuters Umit Bektas/Reuters\n\nLast Sunday, a Russian missile hit less than 1,000 feet from the Mykolaiv region's South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, affecting power lines and breaking windows at the facility.\n\nThat attack didn't cause casualties, but local authorities say Russian airstrikes have killed more than 400 people and injured at least 1,000 in the Mykolaiv region since Russia invaded Ukraine seven months ago. About a quarter of those killings have happened in the city of Mykolaiv, the region's administrative center. Ukrainian authorities say the bombardments have intensified in recent weeks as Ukraine carries out a counteroffensive about 40 miles southeast of here to take back Kherson.\n\nAuthorities also say the strikes seem to be getting more precise, leading them to suspect some locals might be passing on intelligence to Moscow.\n\nIn recent weeks, officials have detained hundreds of suspected collaborators in Mykolaiv, and are investigating if and how they may have provided information that helped Russian forces stage targeted attacks in the area.\n\nA shipping tycoon became a target\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joanna Kakissis/NPR Joanna Kakissis/NPR\n\nThe hunt for spies intensified late this summer, after Russian missiles hit a mansion in a gated community overlooking the sea, killing 74-year-old Oleksiy Vadaturskyi and his wife, Raisa Vadaturska.\n\nVadaturskyi was a revered agribusiness entrepreneur and one of the richest men in Ukraine. Unlike other tycoons, he was a self-made multimillionaire who reinvested his profits in his agribusiness company, Nibulon, which employs 7,000 people. Through his company, he helped make Ukraine a major global grain exporter.\n\nThe blasts at the Vadaturskyi mansion awoke their next-door neighbor, a tanned, runner-thin man in his 60s who gives his name as Piotr Leonidovich.\n\n\"I ran outside and saw smoke billowing from their house,\" he says, choking back tears. \"I called him and his wife over and over but they didn't pick up. Then the emergency services came and found their bodies. The missile hit their basement shelter, where they were sleeping.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Julian Hayda/NPR Julian Hayda/NPR\n\nLong before the war, Vadaturskyi anticipated Russia might block Ukrainian ports, so Nibulon built a fleet of cargo ships to transport grain by river. He also invested heavily in Mykolaiv, prompting some to call him the father of the city.\n\nRoman Waschuk, a former Canadian ambassador to Ukraine who is now Ukraine's business ombudsman, says he believes Russian forces targeted Vadaturskyi because \"he was so key to the resilience of this whole region.\"\n\nHundreds of suspects have been detained\n\nIt's not the first time Russian forces targeted a high-profile leader in Mykolaiv.\n\nEarly in the war, on March 29, bombs hit a multistory building housing the offices of the Mykolaiv region's governor, Vitaliy Kim.\n\n\"I know I am a target for the Russians because it was my window,\" he says, standing outside the ruined building where 37 of his colleagues died. He survived because he overslept and was late for work.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joanna Kakissis/NPR Joanna Kakissis/NPR\n\nKim's office is offering $100 rewards for details on collaborators, but he says most people offering information don't accept the money. \"They say, 'Just find these people so the strikes will stop, and give the money to someone who needs it more,' \" he says.\n\nSo far, he says, hundreds of suspected spies have been detained. \"Some of them are crazy,\" he says. \"Some of them truly believe in Russia.\"\n\nKim says a small but determined minority of locals want Russia to win. On June 27, the Security Services of Ukraine arrested a local city council member they accused of leaking information about Ukrainian troops and pushing to create a Russia-aligned \"Mykolaiv People's Republic.\"\n\n\"Why? I don't know, because the Russians are killing us,\" Kim says. \"Maybe they want to go back in time and live in the USSR.\"\n\nHis hunt for spies has many supporters in Mykolaiv. They include logistics manager Serhii Zubenko, who recently fled Russian-occupied Kherson. He says he \"prays every day\" that Ukrainian forces will liberate it.\n\n\"We are trying to fight to get our land back so it's causing the Russians to get really aggressive,\" he says. \"It freaks me out that there are individuals walking around here helping the Russians during this war.\"\n\nSome residents are nostalgic for Soviet times\n\nRussian is the main language spoken in Mykolaiv, yet no one in the city shares openly pro-Russian sentiments with NPR.\n\nBut Tatiana Mazets, a retired marine engineer, does express nostalgia for the USSR. That's despite a history that includes Josef Stalin's Holodomor famine, which killed millions of Ukrainians in the early 1930s, and decades of Soviet crackdowns on freedom of speech and identity.\n\n\"Back then we were all friends, we got along really well,\" she says. \"The Soviet Union educated us and found us jobs, like the one I had in shipbuilding.\"\n\nMykolaiv used to be the shipbuilding capital of the Soviet Union.

The gas stations are working, and the supermarkets are well-stocked. But many shops, restaurants and cafes have closed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Umit Bektas/Reuters Umit Bektas/Reuters\n\nLukov is sipping a cappuccino at one of the cafes still open.

    "Russia’s nuclear threats ‘totally unacceptable’, says UN chief": "The UN secretary general has issued a strongly worded rebuke to Russia for “totally unacceptable” nuclear threats and denounced its plans to annex parts of Ukraine as a “violation of the UN charter and of international law”.\n\nAntónio Guterres also said the impact of the conflict could cause a food supply crisis next year. “Simply put the world will run out of food,” he said.\n\nGuterres was speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, announcing a partial mobilisation and threatening the use of nuclear weapons “if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened”. Putin also approved referendums in four Ukrainian regions intended to pave the way for annexation, raising the prospect that he would then deem Ukrainian operations to recapture them as a threat to Russia’s “territorial integrity”.\n\nThe US president, Joe Biden, rejected the nuclear threat as reckless, and Ukraine’s backers said they would not be deterred from providing military support.\n\n“The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate. This in itself is totally unacceptable,” Guterres said.\n\n“I’m also deeply concerned by reports of plans to organise so-called referenda in areas of Ukraine that are not currently under government control,” he said. “Any annexation of a state’s territory by another state resulting from a threat or use of force is a violation of the UN charter and of international law.”\n\nRussia was widely condemned at Thursday’s security council meeting chaired by the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna.\n\nChina’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, repeated Beijing’s line that the UN charter and territorial integrity must be supported, without directly criticising Russia, which is an ally. Wang did not, however, offer Moscow any rhetorical support in a carefully worded address.\n\nThe council was briefed by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan, on the investigation of mass graves found in Ukrainian towns liberated from Russian occupation. Khan said the “echoes of Nuremberg should be heard today”, invoking the precedent set by the war crimes trials of the Nazis.\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, did not address Guterres’s comment, repeating Moscow’s discredited claims that Ukraine was being run by “neo-Nazis” and the war had been caused by mistreatment of Russian speakers in the Donbas. He said Russia had no confidence in the ICC. Lavrov was not in the chamber for the ministers who spoke before him, and left as soon as he had delivered his own address.\n\nThe expansion of Russian conscription, initially intended to draft 300,000 soldiers, has triggered protests around Russia and an exodus of military-age men.\n\nPutin’s escalation of the war in the face of territorial losses to Ukrainian forces has led to a new round of sanctions being considered. EU foreign ministers agreed in Brussels to prepare a new package expected to include broad economic and individual measures.\n\nGuterres also pointed to the success of the UN-brokered Black Sea grain initiative in exporting more than 4.3m tonnes of food, as a result of which he said food prices had dropped sharply.\n\nBut he said a drop in Russian exports of fertiliser and ammonia was creating already causing shortages in West Africa and elsewhere. “If the fertiliser market is not stabilised next year it could bring the food supply crisis,” he said.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday Biden said that food and fertiliser were not subject to international sanctions.\n\n“Let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow – explicitly allow – Russia the ability to export food and fertiliser. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it,” he said.\n\nSpeaking at Thursday’s security council session, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said similar and blamed Moscow for the crisis.\n\n“Let us be clear, we are not sanctioning food,” he said. “It is Russia’s actions that are preventing food and fertiliser getting to developing countries. It is Russia’s tactics and bombs that are to blame for destroying Ukraine’s farms infrastructure and delaying its exports.”",
    "Russia Can’t Protect Its Allies Anymore": "Azerbaijan’s 2020 offensive—with key support from Turkey and Israel —was settled only by an uneasy cease-fire mediated by Russia, which has a close relationship with Armenia. While the circumstances remain disputed, it appears that Russia threatened to intervene more forcefully if Baku did not agree. This marked an expansion of the Russian military’s presence into the South Caucasus region on a scale unprecedented since the Soviet collapse.\n\nA key destabilizing factor is a power vacuum in the region, which has emboldened Azerbaijan to press its advantages. Its military supremacy over Armenia was conclusively displayed by their previous conflict, the 2020 war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous ethnic Armenian enclave within the de jure borders of Azerbaijan.\n\nA tentative cease-fire between Armenia and Azerbaijan has held for the past week, following one of the deadliest-ever outbreaks of fighting between the two frequent belligerents on Sept. 12-14. But it is unlikely to hold; Azerbaijani forces who marched into Armenia continue to occupy part of its territory, in particular heights around the town of Jermuk.

Its military supremacy over Armenia was conclusively displayed by their previous conflict, the 2020 war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous ethnic Armenian enclave within the de jure borders of Azerbaijan.\n\nAzerbaijan’s 2020 offensive—with key support from Turkey and Israel—was settled only by an uneasy cease-fire mediated by Russia, which has a close relationship with Armenia. While the circumstances remain disputed, it appears that Russia threatened to intervene more forcefully if Baku did not agree. This marked an expansion of the Russian military’s presence into the South Caucasus region on a scale unprecedented since the Soviet collapse.\n\nThe deal provoked mass opposition within Armenia. But Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who had initially come to power three years prior on the back of an anti-kleptocratic liberalizing revolution, had no one to turn to but Moscow, as Washington and Europe were entirely absent from diplomatic efforts to end the 2020 fighting. Pashinyan ultimately allowed Russia to expand its military presence within Armenia, building new bases in the country proper in addition to its expanded role in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nRussia is now incapable of sustaining that presence—and Armenia is now suffering the consequences. The question is whether the West will now recognize the opportunity to expand its own influence in the South Caucasus region.\n\nWhat the Russian-brokered deal did not do was solve any underlying problems in the region. Instead, it opened more territorial disputes without solving the Nagorno-Karabakh one. Subsequent diplomacy proved unable to address both sides’ concern. Meanwhile, the Kremlin—long the major arms supplier of both sides—also continued to offer Azerbaijan more heavy weaponry. At the end of this August, Azerbaijan presented Armenia with a fait accompli, sending its forces to take the town of Lachin (known as Berdzor in Armenian) itself, revealing Russia’s impotence.\n\nBy that time it was increasingly apparent that the Kremlin had overstretched itself in its war in Ukraine, which it launched in February, having to draw on military personnel and equipment from across Russia itself, as well as its other overseas deployments as far afield as Tajikistan and Syria. Kyiv alleges that Moscow has redeployed soldiers from its 102nd military base in the Armenian city of Gyumri, one of its largest foreign bases, to Ukraine as well.\n\nYerevan began to consider other options, but the West’s interest was limited. Washington said it was open to new diplomatic avenues but took little effort to pursue them. European diplomats had their hands tied as well amid fuel shortages due to Russia’s war, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visiting Baku in July, pledging a new partnership based on doubling Azerbaijani gas supplies. The plan may not be feasible, but Europe is in desperate need of alternative energy allies. Brussels appears to believe it cannot risk a spat with Baku as a result.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Yerevan sought further alternatives, including neighboring Iran. Yerevan and Tehran have economic links, and Iran also home to a large ethnic Armenian population. Iran also has frequent tensions with Azerbaijan, primarily over the issue of Azerbaijani irredentism. In August, Armenia agreed for Iran to establish a consulate in the border village of Kapan, in Armenia’s Syunik district, in hopes of deterring Azerbaijan. Known as Zangezur in Azerbaijani, Syunik is the territory through which Baku aims to establish its land corridor to Nakhchivan. But it is highly unlikely that Iran will intervene directly, and Tehran has hardly been an effective security guarantor elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the Sept. 12-14 fighting, Armenia turned to the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and requested a direct intervention to protect it. Pashinyan had backed Russia’s use of the CSTO as its vector for intervening in Kazakhstan following mass unrest there this January, in an effort to shore up support. However, the organization has no independent position from Russia. Amid the deteriorating situation for the Russian military in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin showed no interest in diverting efforts.\n\nThe CSTO duly refused to get involved, just as it did in 2020, when it excused its absence by stating the fighting was not in Armenia proper. That justification was no longer available, revealing the organization to be a paper tiger.\n\nWashington, however, did pick up the slack, brokering a cease-fire on Sept. 14. This prompted a long-overdue escalation of U.S. efforts to address the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. On Sept. 18, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, was in Yerevan and declared Baku’s attacks illegal under international law. Although Azerbaijan reacted negatively, the following day U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken mediated a discussion between the two countries’ foreign ministers ahead of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. However, no progress was announced.\n\nDespite the increased diplomacy, the United States has not directly demanded Azerbaijan withdraw, at least publicly. Nor has it signaled what actions it could take if Azerbaijan does attack again. And while Armenia has an effective lobby and allies in Congress, so does Azerbaijan. It is hard to imagine Washington intervening directly, let alone providing Yerevan with any significant defensive aid.\n\nNotably, Azerbaijan also seems willing to act regardless of its partners’ positions. The latest offensive was launched without the explicit Turkish support that accompanied the 2020 war. In fact, Armenia and Turkey had in the preceding months made rare diplomatic progress on their own long-standing tensions, with direct flights resuming in February and talks about their long-shuttered border progressing as recently as July. However, Ankara has not publicly opposed Baku’s actions—and Turkey also has an interest in Azerbaijan securing a land corridor to Nakhchivan, which would result in direct overland access between mainland Azerbaijan and Turkey as well.\n\nBaku appears emboldened, confident in its apparent military supremacy over Armenia. The power vacuum in the region resulting from Russia’s self-inflicted troubles and self-interested foreign policy risks turning into a black hole, the gravitational pull of which is so strong that it crushes all that falls into it. The regime of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev regime has made clear that would suit it just fine.\n\nUnless the crisis moves far up the international agenda—and the United States, the EU, and Turkey can work together to disincentivize Azerbaijan—the outlook for Armenia is bleak.",
    "Hungary creates public poll to gauge support of EU sanctions on Russia": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s governing party said Thursday it wants to poll the country’s citizens on whether they support European Union sanctions imposed against Russia over its war in Ukraine.\n\nFidesz plans to call for a “national consultation” on energy sanctions which he said had been decided on by the EU’s “Brussels elite,” the party’s caucus leader, Mate Kocsis, said at a news conference Thursday following a closed-door meeting.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden asks global leaders to counter Russia as Putin calls more troops to Ukraine\n\n“The sanctions are causing harm. They are destroying Europe’s economy,” Kocsis said. “We have to convince European decision-makers, the members of the elite, that they shouldn’t maintain the energy sanctions because big problems will come out if it.”\n\nThe poll, which the government calls a “national consultation,” is an informal survey available to every adult in Hungary which can be returned by mail or filled out online.\n\nSuch surveys, issued several times by the governments of nationalist-populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban since he came to power in 2010, have been criticized by pollsters and opposition parties for containing biased and leading questions, and for having no binding legal relevance.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia sanctions 25 more Americans, including Sean Penn, Ben Stiller\n\nIn the news conference, Kocsis acknowledged that the consultation is a “political tool” which the government can use in its debates with the EU over whether to extend or impose further sanctions against Russia.

Budapest has also refused to supply neighboring Ukraine with weapons, or to allow their transfer across its border with the embattled country.\n\nPro-government newspaper Magyar Nemzet on Wednesday reported that Orban — who has for years nurtured a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin — had told the Fidesz conference that sanctions against Russia should be scrapped, and that doing so would curb inflation and cut gas prices in half.",
    "‘They Are Watching’: Inside Russia’s Vast Surveillance State": "Four days into the war in Ukraine, Russia’s expansive surveillance and censorship apparatus was already hard at work.\n\nRoughly 800 miles east of Moscow, authorities in the Republic of Bashkortostan, one of Russia’s 85 regions, were busy tabulating the mood of comments in social media messages. They marked down YouTube posts that they said criticized the Russian government. They noted the reaction to a local protest.\n\nThen they compiled their findings. One report about the “destabilization of Russian society” pointed to an editorial from a news site deemed “oppositional” to the government that said President Vladimir V. Putin was pursuing his own self-interest by invading Ukraine. A dossier elsewhere on file detailed who owned the site and where they lived.\n\nAnother Feb. 28 dispatch, titled “Presence of Protest Moods,” warned that some had expressed support for demonstrators and “spoke about the need to stop the war.”\n\nThe report was among nearly 160,000 records from the Bashkortostan office of Russia’s powerful internet regulator, Roskomnadzor. Together the documents detail the inner workings of a critical facet of Mr. Putin’s surveillance and censorship system, which his government uses to find and track opponents, squash dissent and suppress independent information even in the country’s furthest reaches. The leak of the agency’s documents “is just like a small keyhole look into the actual scale of the censorship and internet surveillance in Russia,” said Leonid Volkov, who is named in the records and is the chief of staff for the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny. “It’s much bigger,” he said.\n\nRoskomnadzor’s activities have catapulted Russia, along with authoritarian countries like China and Iran, to the forefront of nations that aggressively use technology as a tool of repression. Since the agency was established in 2008, Mr. Putin has turned it into an essential lever to tighten his grip on power as he has transformed Russia into an even more authoritarian state.\n\nThe internet regulator is part of a larger tech apparatus that Mr. Putin has built over the years, which also includes a domestic spying system that intercepts phone calls and internet traffic, online disinformation campaigns and the hacking of other nations’ government systems.\n\nThe agency’s role in this digital dragnet is more extensive than previously known, according to the records. It has morphed over the years from a sleepy telecom regulator into a full-blown intelligence agency, closely monitoring websites, social media and news outlets, and labeling them as “pro-government,” “anti-government” or “apolitical.”\n\nRoskomnadzor has also worked to unmask and surveil people behind anti-government accounts and provided detailed information on critics’ online activities to security agencies, according to the documents. That has supplemented real-world actions, with those surveilled coming under attack for speaking out online. Some have then been arrested by the police and held for months. Others have fled Russia for fear of prosecution.\n\nThe files reveal a particular obsession with Mr. Navalny and show what happens when the weight of Russia’s security state is placed on one target.\n\nThe system is built to control outbursts like the one this week, when protesters across Russia rallied against a new policy that would press roughly 300,000 people into military service for the war in Ukraine. At least 1,200 people have already been detained for demonstrating.\n\nMore than 700 gigabytes of records from Roskomnadzor’s Bashkortostan branch were made publicly available online in March by DDoSecrets, a group that publishes hacked documents.\n\nThe New York Times built software and a search tool to analyze the Russian-language documents, spreadsheets, videos and government presentations. Five individuals directly targeted by Roskomnadzor in the files were interviewed, along with lawyers, activists and companies who have battled the agency and other experts on Russian surveillance and censorship.\n\nRoskomnadzor did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“This is part of authoritarianism,” said Abbas Gallyamov, a former top government official in Bashkortostan who Roskomnadzor scrutinized because of his criticism of Mr. Putin. “They are watching.”\n\nPutin’s Eyes on the Internet\n\nRoskomnadzor (pronounced Ros-com-nod-zor) was started in 2008 as a bureaucratic backwater with a few dozen employees who regulated radio signals, telecom and postal delivery. Its role expanded as Kremlin concerns grew about the internet, which was under less state control than television and radio, leading to more activity from independent and opposition media.\n\nAfter social media helped facilitate mass protests during the 2010 Arab Spring and in Moscow starting in 2011, Russian authorities had Roskomnadzor exert more control, said Andrei Soldatov, the co-author of a book on Russian internet censorship and surveillance.\n\nFrom its headquarters in Moscow, the agency squeezed companies that provided internet access. Starting in 2012, the year Mr. Putin retook the presidency, Roskomnadzor built a blacklist of websites that the companies were required to block. That list, which grows constantly, now includes more than 1.2 million banned URLs, including local political news websites, social media profile pages, pornography and gambling platforms, according to Roskomsvoboda, a civil society group tracking the blocks.\n\nOver the last decade, the agency also fined and penalized Google, Facebook, Twitter and Telegram to force them to remove what authorities deemed to be illicit content. In 2016, LinkedIn was shut down in Russia after being sanctioned for not storing data on Russian users in the country’s data centers.\n\nBy 2019, authorities wanted internet control to go further. Roskomnadzor ordered new censorship technology, known as a “technical means for countering threats,” installed in telecom networks around the country, including Bashkortostan, according to the documents. The agency then blocked and slowed down websites from Moscow.\n\nOfficials demanded that local internet services confirm that the censorship systems had been installed, according to the documents. Schematics showed where the censorship boxes should be placed in the network. Roskomnadzor workers visited sites to be sure the equipment was installed correctly and sent reports on the efficacy of the technology.\n\nOne early target of the blocking system was Twitter. In 2021, authorities throttled access to the social media service to a crawl. Since the invasion of Ukraine this year, Roskomnadzor has also blocked Facebook, Instagram and other websites, as well as many virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are used to bypass internet controls.\n\nIn 2020, Andrei Lipov, a government technocrat who supports a Russian internet that is more closed off from the West, took charge of Roskomnadzor. Under his guidance, the agency has operated even more like an intelligence service.\n\nJust in Bashkortostan, an oil-rich region with about 4 million residents, Roskomnadzor tracked the online activities of hundreds of people and organizations. It gathered information about government critics and identified shifting political opinions on social media. It compiled dossiers on independent media outlets and online influencers who shared information unfavorable to the government that might gain traction with the Russian public.\n\n“Roskomnadzor was never part of this game before of providing political intelligence,” said Mr. Soldatov, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a pro-democracy think tank. “They’re getting more and more ambitious.”\n\nVladimir Voronin, a lawyer who has represented activists and media groups targeted by Roskomnadzor, said the agency also became closer to the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the domestic intelligence agency once led by Mr. Putin. The F.S.B. operates a spy system, called the System for Operative Investigative Activities, which is used to monitor phone calls and internet traffic in Russia.\n\nRoskomnadzor helps the F.S.B. watch opponents and identify new threats to Mr. Putin, Mr. Voronin said. “Roskomnadzor is more of a police agency and not only monitors, but persecutes oppositionists, activists and the media,” he said.\n\nUnlike more technologically savvy counterparts in China, where internet surveillance is more automated, much of the work of Russian censors is done manually, the documents show. But what Russia lacks in sophistication it has made up for in determination.\n\nIn Bashkortostan, documents like this six-page report on the regional “information space” from December 2021 summarized criticism of Mr. Putin from pundits and bloggers. In the report, officials measured sentiment with a chart showing events that increased public disapproval, such as videos involving opposition activists and news of a possible invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt times, the assessments sound almost like weather forecasts. “Calm with separate minor pockets of tension,” one Roskomnadzor report said, summarizing public sentiment after the arrest of a local activist.\n\nSocial media was viewed by the agency as a form of “soft power” that could “influence the opinion of the masses,” according to one document. Roskomnadzor workers watched for “destabilizing subjects” like opposition groups and “antimilitarism,” but also social issues such as drug legalization and “sexual freedoms,” according to some of the documents. Meduza, an independent Russian-language news organization, earlier reported on these specific documents.\n\nRoskomnadzor also tracked local state-run media and political leaders, so that Mr. Putin could keep an eye on both enemies and allies, said Mr. Gallyamov, who is now a political commentator living outside Russia.\n\nIn some cases, censors recorded their screens showing detail down to the movements of their computer mouse as they watched over the internet. They monitored overtly political videos and, at other times, focused on less obviously worrisome content, like this viral song by the young rapper KEML. Bashkortostan is known as a hub for rap in Russia.\n\nRoskomnadzor also helped Mr. Putin centralize power far from Moscow. The regional office in Bashkortostan only shared a fraction of its work with the local government, according to one document. Many reports were instead sent straight to the F.S.B. and other central agencies.\n\nThe scrutiny took a toll on surveillance targets. ProUfu.ru, a local news site in Bashkortostan that wrote critically about the government, said authorities pressured businesses to stop advertising with it. In the records, censors flagged ProUfu.ru for the critical Ukraine editorial written about Mr. Putin in February. The group was the subject of a regularly updated dossier about its coverage, ownership and top editor.\n\n“Businessmen are threatened with closure for enterprises if they dare to meet us halfway,” the group, which now goes by Prufy, said on its website. “Our resources are depleted.” Prufy declined to comment.\n\nHunting Navalny\n\nMr. Navalny, the imprisoned leader of Russia’s largest opposition movement, overshadows Mr. Putin’s other domestic opponents. In Roskomnadzor’s Bashkortostan office, no mention of Mr. Navalny was too small to escape notice.\n\nWorkers flagged articles and social media comments about Mr. Navalny and websites where his name appeared in the margins as a related link. In monthly reports, they tallied online criticism of the government day-by-day, often alongside major news developments related to Mr. Navalny.\n\nAfter ProUfu.ru published a video of an interview with Mr. Navalny in 2020, the site was charged with an administrative violation for posting information about “criminally punishable acts,” according to a record of the infraction included in the files.\n\nThe agency worked with different branches of the Russian security apparatus to go after not just Mr. Navalny, but his supporters. In Bashkortostan, the main target was Lilia Chanysheva, a 40-year-old lawyer.\n\nMs. Chanysheva, who has been a supporter of Mr. Navalny for at least a decade, moved in 2013 from Moscow to Ufa, Bashkortostan’s largest city and where her parents lived. In 2017, she traded a well-paying auditing job with the international consulting firm Deloitte to start a regional office for Mr. Navalny.\n\n“She understood that if she did not do it, no one would,” said Maksim Kurnikov, the former editor of a regional branch of the radio station Echo of Moscow, who got to know Ms. Chanysheva in Ufa.\n\nMs. Chanysheva planned protests and linked groups who disagreed not just with Mr. Putin’s rule, but also were motivated by local issues like government corruption and environmental exploitation in the mineral-rich Bashkortostan region. She was known for volunteering time to provide legal aid to anyone in need, friends and colleagues said.\n\nAuthorities watched her closely, according to the documents. In 2017, Roskomnadzor officials sent a letter to the F.S.B. and other branches of the national security apparatus, warning that Mr. Navalny’s team was uniting “various small oppositional regional communities into a ‘united front.’”\n\nMs. Chanysheva faced random searches and police arrests. During a presidential campaign by Mr. Navalny ahead of elections in 2018, she spent more than 45 days in jail for holding unauthorized protests and other offenses, colleagues said. With authorities fond of detaining leaders well before organized protests, she made a habit of disappearing and then materializing at the rallies, they said.\n\n“It made them look very stupid,” said Mr. Volkov, Mr. Navalny’s chief of staff, who hired Ms. Chanysheva.\n\nAuthorities included Ms. Chanysheva in regular reports about the activity of opposition figures who appeared in local and social media, including a 2020 meeting with activists who fought a real-estate development that would involve cutting down a forest.\n\nRoskomnadzor confronted her with minor infractions, including violations of data-protection rules, according to the records. She topped a list on another document that suggested individuals for expanded monitoring and surveillance.\n\nOn a spreadsheet of “leaders of opinion” in Bashkortostan, Roskomnadzor officials highlighted Ms. Chanysheva’s name in dark red along with links to her social media accounts and follower totals.\n\nIn October 2020, she was placed on a list of the region’s “destabilizing sources,” and was cited for “criticizing Russian federal and regional government.”\n\nIn April 2021, Mr. Navalny’s organizations were forced to disband after the Kremlin listed them as illegal extremist groups. Fearful of being imprisoned, many top operatives left Russia. Ms. Chanysheva stayed. She was arrested on charges of extremism in November 2021.\n\nRoskomnadzor’s censors noted her arrest “caused a resonance both among activists and users on social networks,” according to a record of the incident. They were not overly concerned. At the top of the report, they wrote: “Protest activity was at a relatively low level.”\n\nMs. Chanysheva, who is being held at a detention center in Moscow, could not be reached for comment. Mr. Voronin, her lawyer, said she spends her time writing letters and sorting trash from recycling. She faces a decade in prison.\n\nThe Lone Protester\n\nIn the first weeks of the war on Ukraine, Roskomnadzor censors ramped up, according to the documents. They focused not just on the war but its side effects, including the public response to a domestic crackdown on dissent and grumblings about the invasion’s effect on the rising cost of goods.\n\nOn Feb. 27, agency officials monitored the reaction to reports that a family from Ufa — including young children — was detained for protesting the war. Another report flagged an item that was spreading quickly online that described how the F.S.B. brutally beat and electrocuted a protester.\n\n“Some users negatively assessed the actions of law enforcement agencies,” they wrote, noting 200,000 users had viewed the news on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nThe files also showed how office life went on as normal for the censors, who are part of the security-state middle class that Mr. Putin has built over the past 20 years to consolidate power. The employees marked a national holiday celebrating women and shared memes. In a jocular video passed around the office, they joked about accidentally blocking the Kremlin website and bribing judges with alcohol and chocolate.\n\nIn March, the censors highlighted an Instagram post from a protest in Bashkortostan. The demonstrator — a lone individual named Laysan Sultangareyeva — stood in Tuymazy, an industrial town west of the regional capital, to decry the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe post showed Ms. Sultangareyeva holding a sign that read “No to Putin, No to War.” Comments were filled with emojis cheering her on.\n\nAt the protest, police arrested the 24-year-old political activist and kept her in jail overnight. Roskomnadzor censors described her arrest with terse and matter-of-fact language: “Took place, the protester was detained.”\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Sultangareyeva said that police intimidated her, asked about her support for Mr. Navalny and made her take a drug test.\n\nMs. Sultangareyeva, whose Instagram profile once said “making delicious coffee and trying to stay out of jail,” protested twice more in April. She was arrested again. Online posts were used as evidence against her, as were photos shared in a local antiwar Telegram channel. She was fined 68,000 rubles or about $1,100.\n\n“The fact that Roskomnadzor monitors social networks I did not know, but I guessed that they would not leave me without attention,” she said. She recently noticed police-affiliated accounts looking at her Instagram Stories and blocked them.\n\n‘I Thought I Knew What Censorship Was’\n\nRoskomnadzor’s tightening grip has manifested itself in the form of outright censorship.\n\nThree days after DOXA, a media organization run by university students and recent graduates, posted a video calling on students to speak out against Mr. Putin in January 2021, a letter arrived from the agency.\n\nIt said the video had been added to a registry of “prohibited information” that “encouraged minors to participate in activities that are dangerous to their health and lives.” Roskomnadzor ordered DOXA to take the video down, said Ilia Sagitov, a reporter for the site who has left Russia.\n\nDOXA complied but then sued Roskomnadzor over the takedown. Mr. Sagitov said the site had been careful not to encourage protest directly in the video and argued there was nothing illegal in it.\n\nAt 6 a.m. on April 14, 2021, security forces struck back. In a coordinated raid, Russian police broke into the website’s offices and the apartments of four of its editors. They placed the editors under house arrest and forbade them from accessing the internet.\n\n“We believe that they were tracking everything we were doing back then and desperately trying to find anything to oppress us in any way,” Mr. Sagitov said. “So they finally got it — our video — and immediately started to fabricate this case.”\n\nStill, the site was not blocked and reporters continued publishing articles. Then came the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn February, DOXA published a guide to “antiwar disputes in the family and work,” which included 17 answers to the most common arguments justifying the war.\n\nAkin to stories in the United States that prepare people for contentious Thanksgiving dinner discussions, or how to speak to a climate change denier, the article went viral. An illustration from the piece showed a young person debating the war with an older man.\n\nThis time, Roskomnadzor swiftly blocked each of DOXA’s three different websites. The sites remain down. Some staff have fled the country while others left the organization fearing for their safety. Roskomnadzor has taken a similar tack elsewhere, blocking more heavily and widely than before, according to those who have been targeted.\n\n“There’s no new level of competence, just a new bigger scale of repression — both digital and real-world,” Mr. Sagitov said. “I thought I knew what censorship was, but it turned out I didn’t. Well, now I know.”",

    "Russia Is Losing India": "India’s initial reluctance to condemn Russia for its war against Ukraine has been the subject of much debate and criticism in the West. In mid-March, Jen Psaki, then the White House press secretary, urged India to reflect on “where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time.” Numerous world leaders and diplomats have expressed impatience with India for effectively abetting a Russian agenda by remaining on the side-lines.\n\nSome analysts and former policymakers in strategic circles in New Delhi insist that such a reproach is unfair and fails to appreciate India’s nuanced position on the war. India, they argue, is merely navigating between clashing geopolitical powers, Russia and the United States, that happen to be two of its major partners. Yes, India notably abstained from key votes about the war in Ukraine in the United Nations (in the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, and the International Atomic Energy Agency). But it has also toughened its statements about the invasion, decrying the killing of civilians and the violation of national sovereignty. New Delhi has its own concerns, this line of thinking runs, and doesn’t want to jeopardize its relations with either Moscow or Washington.\n\nA deeper look at Indian actions, however, suggests an altogether different reality. India is not backing Russia’s invasion, nor is it simply balancing between two major powers. Instead, a subtle but major shift is underway: India’s slow but inevitable decoupling from Russia.\n\nSuch a reorientation began before the invasion of Ukraine, but the war has accelerated it. Although Russia remains for now an important source of both military equipment and energy, New Delhi is slowly extracting itself from any dependence on Moscow. Deeply entrenched anti-Americanism, a staple of India’s old strategic elite, is disappearing, and India and United States are now closer than ever before. Russia’s ties to China have grown stronger just as India and China’s relationship has become rocky; border clashes in 2020 left India’s government and strategic community viewing China as an existential challenge to Indian national security.\n\nThe contours of a future geopolitical framework are clear, with India drifting closer to the West and the U.S. to hedge against China and, in the process, withdrawing from its long partnership with Russia. This decoupling will not happen overnight, and Indian and Russian officials will make concerted efforts to keep the relationship afloat, perhaps for years to come. But larger geopolitical pressures will invariably drive India and Russia apart.\n\nTHE TIES THAT DON’T BIND\n\nIndia’s decision to ramp up its purchases of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine has piqued many Western commentators. In February, just before the war began, India’s purchases of Russian oil were negligible; by April, they had risen to 389,000 barrels a day, and in June the figure reached the one-million mark. But the boost in oil imports is largely opportunistic. Russia has offered India deep discounts, much as it has other willing buyers. In May, for instance, buying Russian oil saved India $16 per barrel over the average oil import price for that month. The injection of Russian oil has helped alleviate economic distress resulting from the lingering aftermath of the pandemic and the rise in retail prices driven by the war in Ukraine. Indian officials bristle at criticism about these purchases, especially considering that most European countries have continued to buy at least some Russian gas—and have been reluctant to stop doing so.\n\nIn other important areas, however, great change is afoot. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia was India’s largest supplier of arms in the last decade. But from 2012 to 2021, the share of Russian weapons in India’s arsenal shrunk by nearly half. Over the years, India has been attempting to diversify its defense procurement, turning to alternate suppliers, including France and the United States. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, New Delhi deferred its plans for more military purchases from Moscow, including a deal for 21 new MiG-29 fighter jets for the Indian Air Force. Indian officials claimed to have made the move to support domestic production, but the country is clearly slowing its rate of arms purchases from Russia. The protracted nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has also raised concerns in New Delhi about Russia’s military production capabilities. In particular, India worries that Russia won’t be able to follow through on scheduled deliveries of new hardware and spare parts for older equipment, especially in emergency situations.\n\nAt the level of public diplomacy, India is also sending important signals. The contrast between New Delhi’s official statements during the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year further demonstrates India’s tilt away from Russia. In 2014, there was little condemnation of Russia’s attack. In fact, Shivshankar Menon, then national security adviser, insisted that “there are, after all, legitimate Russian and other interests involved.” However, the phrase “legitimate Russian interests” is notably absent from recent Indian statements. Although Indian officials have not named or condemned Russia, their statements from March onward have been indirectly yet undeniably critical of Russian actions. Their continuous references to respect for international law, the UN Charter, and the principles of territorial integrity and the sovereignty of states suggest that India does not in fact consider Russia’s invasion legitimate.\n\nIndia’s overtures to the West in the last year have been highly consequential.\n\nIndia’s discomfort with Russia’s shelling of civilians in Ukraine is evident from its official statements; in June, India “unequivocally condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha and supported the call for an independent investigation.” New Delhi further suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin enter direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, stating that “there will be no winning party in this war, everyone will suffer.” In official statements, India has also criticized Russia for putting the developing world’s food and economic security at risk.\n\nIn August, India voted against Russia for the first time on the issue of Ukraine, favoring a move to invite Zelensky to address the Security Council via video. Most recently, during the September summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Samarkand, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi openly expressed displeasure with Russia when he told Putin that “today’s era is not the era for war.” New Delhi may not have taken a formal position on the invasion, but its statements seem to convey growing disapproval.\n\nJust as its rhetoric and public messaging about Russia have stiffened, India has also sought to strengthen ties with Western states. Although New Delhi hosted the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in April and Modi had a phone conversation with Putin in July, India’s overtures to the West in the last year have been more frequent and far more consequential.\n\nSince March, Modi has hosted Boris Johnson, then the British prime minister; Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president; and Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, in New Delhi. He attended the G­–7 summit in Germany with U.S. and European leaders in June and the summit of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (an Indo-Pacific partnership grouping Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), in Japan in May. Such high-profile meetings with key world leaders, taking place as the war in Ukraine raged on, have allowed for meaningful discussion of crucial issues, especially at a time when the UN has been found severely wanting. This diplomacy shows quite clearly that as India’s ties with Russia remain practically frozen, its engagement with the West (including the United States) has intensified since the onset of the war.\n\nDRIFTING APART\n\nIndia’s slow but steady decoupling from Russia does not come as a surprise to close observers of the relationship. Despite a long history of friendship and a great deal of cooperation dating back to the Cold War era, the two are no longer natural partners. India and Russia are moving away from each other not because they want to but because they cannot help but do so.\n\nToday, there is little that connects the two countries. India has limited incentive to remain closely tethered to Russia, outside of the legacy relationship based on their now-shrinking defense trade. In 2021, trade between India and Russia was worth around $13 billion. Fewer than 30,000 Indians live in Russia, and fewer Indians speak Russian than did during the peak of Soviet-India friendship during the Cold War. By comparison, India-U.S. trade totaled $157 billion in 2021, and 4.2 million people of Indian origin reside in the United States.\n\nNot only is there little people-to-people contact between India and Russia and minimal trade, but the new generation of India’s strategic community has little interest in Russia. The pool of Russia specialists in India is shrinking. India’s old elite was more supportive of Russia, but younger Indian leaders and thinkers have less reason to be inclined toward Moscow—a process that began at the end of the Cold War and is even more pronounced today. Russia, for more and more Indians, is a friend whose utility is in terminal decline. When Indians think of their strategic partnerships, Russia is referred to in the past tense, and the United States in the future.\n\nIndia and Russia are no longer natural partners.\n\nIndia’s dependence on Russia will continue to wane over time as it leans on alternate military suppliers such as France, Israel, and the United States. Even though U.S. weapons often come with conditions (unlike Russian or even French weapons sales), growing diplomatic trust between India and the United States is likely to lead to ever closer defense ties and burgeoning purchase agreements.\n\nOne crucial area where Russia was useful to India was at the UN Security Council, where it often assisted India in opposing the adoption of sanctions or other resolutions. But many analysts and former policymakers in New Delhi today think that France or even the United States could help India pursue its interests at the Security Council. Furthermore, India could grow concerned that China may influence a weakened Russia’s votes on the Security Council. China and Russia are closer than ever, and it is only a matter of time before China begins exerting some influence on the independence of a war-fatigued Russia’s foreign policy. If skirmishes between Indian and Chinese forces recur in the Himalayan borderlands, for instance, China could put pressure on Russia to stop providing diplomatic backing or arms and ammunition to India.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has quickened the evolution of a more definitive realignment, with Russia and China drawing closer and India drifting to the West. Even if Moscow and New Delhi make a serious effort to sustain their relationship, structural constraints such as growing Sino-Russian ties, closer India-US relations, and the increasing geopolitical incompatibility between the two sides are bound to drive a wedge between them.\n\nStill, the Moscow-New Delhi relationship has enough ballast not to sink in the immediate future. Nor will India make a decisive break with Russia anytime soon. The relationship will continue to persist, or flicker on, in an imperfect state and with diminishing returns for a considerable period of time. As it does, Western commentators must take care to understand India’s subtle movements as more than equivocations. India may not be toeing the line but preparing to jump across it.",
    "One day after Zelenskyy speech, US, Russia square off at UN": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — One day after Ukraine’s president laid out a forceful case against Russia’s invasion at the United Nations, the United States made its own assertions in front of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday about why Russia should face further censure and isolation. Minutes later, Russia came right back, calling the claims unfair and saying Ukraine is to blame.\n\nAntony Blinken, the United States’ top diplomat, spoke to Security Council members on Thursday, detailing allegations of what he called war crimes and other atrocities committed by Russia and urging them to “send a clear message” to the country to stop its nuclear threats.\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, addressed the Security Council shortly afterward, repeating his country’s frequent claims that Kyiv has long oppressed Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east — one of the explanations Moscow has offered for the invasion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkraine’s Western allies “have been covering up the crimes of the Kyiv regime,” said Lavrov, who was not in the room when Blinken and some other U.S. allies spoke. He appeared just before his own speech and departed immediately afterward.\n\nThe almost-exchange between the two top diplomats came on the heels of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s demands for world leaders to punish Russia in a video speech delivered Wednesday, just hours after Moscow made an extraordinary announcement that it would mobilize some reservists for the war effort.\n\nBuoyed by a counteroffensive that has retaken swaths of territory that the Russians seized, Zelenskyy vowed that his forces would not stop until they had reclaimed all of Ukraine.\n\n“We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms,” the president said in a speech delivered in English. “But we need time.”\n\nVideo speeches by Zelenskyy in an olive green T-shirt have become almost commonplace. But this speech was one of the most keenly anticipated at the U.N. General Assembly, where the war has dominated over conflicts in other regions.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel’s prime minister, Yair Lapid, delivered a speech focused on the Palestinians and included a call for the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two states for two peoples, is the right thing for Israel’s security, for Israel’s economy and for the future of our children,” Lapid said.\n\nThe speech, coming ahead of Nov. 1 elections, appeared to be part of an effort by Lapid to portray himself — both to voters and global leaders — as a statesman and moderate alternative to his main rival, hardline former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBut it was short on details, and there is virtually no chance Lapid, who has long supported a two-state solution, will get to push forward with his vision. Israel’s parliament is dominated by parties that oppose Palestinian independence, and opinion polls forecast a similar result after the upcoming elections.\n\nThe Palestinians seek the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip — territories captured by Israel in 1967 — for an independent state, a position that enjoys wide international support.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Lapid and dozens of other world leaders sought airtime for issues plaguing their own nations — including climate change, rising food costs, human rights and vaccine inequity — Ukraine remained at the center of the U.N. General Assembly, popping up in speeches by leaders from all over the world decrying Russia’s invasion of a sovereign country.\n\n“It’s an attack on this very institution where we find ourselves today,” said Moldovan President President Maia Sandu, whose country borders Ukraine.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden’s address , too, focused heavily on the war in Ukraine.\n\n“This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,” he said. “If nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who is not attending the General Assembly, has said he sent his armed forces into Ukraine because of risks to his country’s security from what he considers a hostile government in Kyiv; to liberate Russians living in Ukraine — especially its eastern region of the Donbas — from what he views as the Ukrainian government’s oppression; and to restore what he considers to be Russia’s historical territorial claims on the country.\n\nEarlier this week, he warned that his nuclear-armed country will “certainly use all means available to us” if its territory is threatened and to defend the country and its people.\n\nPutin’s decree Wednesday about the mobilization was sparse on details but officials said as many as 300,000 reservists could be tapped. It was apparently an effort to seize momentum after the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nBut the first such call-up in Russia since World War II also brought the fighting home in a new way for Russians and risked fanning domestic anxiety and antipathy toward the war. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, flights out of the country rapidly filled up, and more than 1,000 people were arrested at rare antiwar demonstrations across the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZelenskky asserted that Moscow wants to spend the winter preparing its forces in Ukraine for a new offensive, or at least preparing fortifications while mobilizing more troops in the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II\n\n“Russia wants war. It’s true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history,” he said, declaring that “mankind and the international law are stronger” than what he called a “terrorist state.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Andrew Katell in New York and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

    "'Path to oblivion': Ukraine military gains could deepen Russia's economic problems": "Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member states at a summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan September 16, 2022. Foreign Ministry Of Uzbekistan | via Reuters\n\nUkraine's counteroffensive, which has seen vast swathes of Russian-occupied territory get recaptured, could be compounding Russia's economic troubles, as international sanctions continue to hammer its fortunes. Ukraine's military has had stunning success in recent weeks, recapturing Russian-occupied territory in the northeast and south of the country. Now, Kyiv is hoping to liberate the Luhansk in the eastern Donbas region, a key area where one of two pro-Russian self-proclaimed \"republics\" is located. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said the recent Ukrainian military gains could hit Russia's economy hard. \"Even more so than before, the Russian economy looks set to descend into a gradually deepening recession,\" Schmieding said in a note last week. \"The mounting costs of a war that is not going well for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, the costs of suppressing domestic dissent and the slow but pernicious impact of sanctions will likely bring down the Russian economy faster than the Soviet Union crumbled some 30 years ago.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers ride on an armored vehicle in Novostepanivka, Kharkiv region, on September 19, 2022. Yasuyoshi Chiba | Afp | Getty Images\n\nHe highlighted that Russia's main bargaining chip when it comes to the international sanctions imposed by the West – its influence over the energy market, particularly in Europe – was also waning. \"Although Putin closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on 31 August, the EU continues to fill its gas storage facilities at a slightly slower but still satisfactory pace,\" he noted, adding that even Germany — which was particularly exposed to Russian supplies — could even get close to its 95% storage target ahead of winter.\n\nEnergy problems\n\nEurope's rapid shift away from Russian energy is particularly painful for the Kremlin: the energy sector represents around a third of Russian GDP, half of all fiscal revenues and 60% of exports, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Energy revenues fell to their lowest level in over a year in August, and that was before Moscow cut off gas flows to Europe in the hope of strong-arming European leaders into lifting the sanctions. The Kremlin has since being forced to sell oil to Asia at considerable discounts. The decline in energy exports means the country's budget surplus has been heavily depleted. \"Russia knows that it has no leverage left in its energy war against Europe. Within two or three years, the EU will have gotten rid of its dependency on Russian gas,\" the EIU's Global Forecasting Director Agathe Demarais told CNBC. This is a key reason why Russia has opted to cut off gas flows to Europe now, she suggested, with the Kremlin aware that this threat could carry far less weight in a few years' time.\n\nGDP slump\n\nThe EIU is projecting a Russian GDP contraction of 6.2% this year and 4.1% next year, which Demarais said was \"huge, by both historical and international standards.\" \"Russia did not experience a recession when it was first placed under Western sanctions in 2014. Iran, which was entirely cut off from Swift in 2012 (something that has not happened to Russia yet), experienced a recession of only around 4% in that year,\" she said. Statistics are scarce on the true state of the Russian economy, with the Kremlin keeping its cards relatively close to its chest. However, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, citing an internal document, that Russian officials are fearing a much deeper and more persistent economic downturn than their public assertions suggest. Putin has repeatedly claimed that his country's economy is coping with Western sanctions, while Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov said last month that inflation will come in around 12-13% in 2022, far below the gloomiest projections offered by global economists earlier in the year. Russian GDP contracted by 4% in the second quarter of the year, according to state statistics service Rosstat, and Russia upped its economic forecasts earlier this month, now projecting a contraction of 2.9% 2022 and 0.9% in 2023, before returning to 2.6% growth in 2024.\n\nwatch now\n\nHowever, Demarais argued that all visible data \"point to a collapse in domestic consumption, double-digit inflation and sinking investment,\" with the withdrawal of 1,000 Western firms also likely to have implications for \"employment and access to innovation.\" \"Yet the real impact of sanctions on Russia will be felt mostly in the long term. In particular, sanctions will restrict Russia's ability to explore and develop new energy fields, especially in the Arctic region,\" she said. \"Because of Western penalties, financing the development of these fields will become almost impossible. In addition, U.S. sanctions will make the export of the required technology to Russia impossible.\"\n\nSanctions 'here to stay'\n\nIn her State of the Union address last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen lauded the impact of EU sanctions, claiming that Russia's financial sector is \"on life support.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen delivers the State of the European Union address to the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, France, on Sept. 14, 2022. Yves Herman | Reuters\n\n\"We have cut off three quarters of Russia's banking sector from international markets. Nearly one thousand international companies have left the country,\" she said. \"The production of cars fell by three-quarters compared to last year. Aeroflot is grounding planes because there are no more spare parts. The Russian military is taking chips from dishwashers and refrigerators to fix their military hardware, because they ran out of semiconductors. Russia's industry is in tatters.\" She added that the Kremlin had \"put Russia's economy on that path to oblivion\" and vowed that sanctions were \"here to stay.\" \"This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nwatch now",
    "Who still stands with Putin and Russia in the war with Ukraine?": "It has been a critical question since the Russians invaded Ukraine — and the answers have shifted in the nearly seven months since then: On the geopolitical stage, who stands with Russian President Vladimir Putin?\n\nFrom the beginning, the U.S. and its European allies have tried to convince the rest of the world of the moral and strategic imperatives of condemning Russia and supporting the Ukrainian resistance. Among core arguments made by the collective West: How can the world stand by as one nation invades another without provocation? How to defend silence in the aftermath of atrocities — at Bucha, Mariupol and other places in Ukraine? How to avoid a dangerous precedent — one that might encourage further attacks on other nations’ sovereign territory?\n\nThe counterpoints have taken different forms — and they have come from many places other than Russia itself. Among these: We cannot always afford to take a moral stance; we have our own self-interests to worry about — Russian oil and food staples, to name two prominent examples; and the West has remained silent or ineffectual in response to acts of aggression in other parts of the world.\n\nIn April, Grid’s Nikhil Kumar published a piece under the heading, “Is Putin a pariah?” What was clear at the time was that there was a sizable divide between the West and a range of important nations — China, India, Turkey and several countries from across the so-called Global South — which were either openly supporting Russia or at least refusing to condemn the invasion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Ukraine War and the “Who stands with Putin?” question loom large at this week’s gathering of the United Nations General Assembly. And the answers may shift yet again given Putin’s game-changing announcements Wednesday. Putin and his defense minister gave a pair of speeches from the Kremlin — not to the U.N., but to the Russian people. The main points: a call-up of 300,000 Russian reservists; the announcement of referendums to be held in four territories in southern and eastern Ukraine — presumably a step toward the formal Russian annexation of those territories; and — a note meant for the wider world — a new and not-so-veiled reminder that Russia has nuclear weapons at its disposal, and that the West has, in Putin’s view, crossed “red lines.”\n\nWho stands with Putin now? This week’s Global Grid conversation took up the question with Global Editor Tom Nagorski, China Reporter Lili Pike, Deputy Global Editor Nikhil Kumar and Global Security Reporter Josh Keating.\n\nTheir conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTom Nagorski: Lili Pike, what was the response from the Chinese to what Vladimir Putin said Wednesday?\n\nLili Pike: The Foreign Ministry put out a statement at its daily press conference saying China calls for all sides to come to the negotiating table and to “find a peaceful resolution” to the conflict. The spokesperson emphasized that this is a consistent position that China has had from the beginning, but it’s still notable that he did speak, that he responded to reporters’ questions directly about Putin’s speech and about the escalation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo we’re not seeing China come out with a brand new position, denouncing Russia. But it is still notable that China is, once again, calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. China has tried to carve out this position of neutrality, which has meant that China hasn’t denounced Russia for the war — and it actually hasn’t called the war a “war,” explicitly.\n\nBut China hasn’t lent its full support to Russia, either. China hasn’t sold weapons to Russia or explicitly violated sanctions to support the war effort. But at the same time, from the beginning, China has in some ways effectively supported Russia’s stance by echoing statements Russia has made about NATO’s expansion as a precursor to the war, putting blame on the West for that. So it’s been an interesting position to follow from the beginning, a difficult position to hold as Russia escalates.\n\nAlong with the statement Wednesday, we have seen other signs that China is uncomfortable in this position. Just last week, [Chinese President] Xi Jinping met with other world leaders, including Putin, at a regional summit in Uzbekistan. Putin himself actually said that he understood that Xi had “questions and concerns” about the war. Xi did not speak to these concerns in his public remarks, but I think that gives you a sign that despite the fact that Russia and China have this strong partnership, China is certainly not all-in in supporting Russia in this war and may have rising concerns about it.\n\nTN: A pretty well-honed principle of Chinese foreign policy is, “You don’t mess in the internal affairs of another country.” So I suppose one could sit in Beijing and say, “We don’t want to interfere in what Russia decides it should be doing.” On the other hand, you could read that principle to say, there’s no basis for encroaching and annexing Ukrainian territory. How does that conundrum play into what they say or do in Beijing?\n\nLP: That’s a great question. From the beginning, experts have pointed to China’s principle of sovereignty and said that China is being hypocritical by effectively, in some ways, supporting Russia, given that it’s breaching Ukraine’s sovereignty. You can point to that as a contradiction, certainly. In its latest remarks, China continued to speak to that principle, which would seem to, again, contradict this move toward formal annexation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut at the same time, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said this dialogue process toward a peaceful resolution would need to take into account all parties’ “legitimate security concerns.” That’s language that we’ve seen again and again, referencing this encroachment that Russia and China feel from NATO. You’re seeing both of those principles — and certainly some conflict between the two of them — in their statements.\n\nTN: Nikhil, back to that meeting that Lili referenced in Uzbekistan last week. Perhaps less opaque were the comments made by another major global leader, Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India. There’s a country that has straddled the fence for reasons of its own economic and security interests. What exactly did Modi convey to Putin?\n\nNikhil Kumar: What he said exactly was “sitting next to Putin, I know that today’s era is not an era of war.” That phrase was picked up quite a lot, which people read as him basically telling Putin off. He knew Putin’s position on the conflict in Ukraine, but he also said that they’ve talked about this again and again on the phone, basically indicating that he was trying to press Putin to bring this conflict to an end. But as you say, it’s a complicated position with Modi.\n\nTN: I doubt we’re going to hear any kind of full-throated condemnation from Delhi about what Putin has said and done Wednesday. It’s tougher for India to make a clean break with Moscow — is that right?\n\nNK: Absolutely, which is why India has over the last few months, again and again, abstained when it comes to votes at the U.N. to do with Ukraine. It did vote against Russia in a recent procedural vote to allow [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy] to address the Security Council. That was the only time that it broke away.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not easy for India to condemn Russia for a host of reasons. It starts with a very long-standing relationship that India had with the former Soviet Union, and which it’s continued to have with Russia, which has to do with defense. Something like 60 to 70 percent of the equipment that India’s armed forces use originates in Russia. That means not only that they need all kinds of spare parts and so on, but they need maintenance from Russia as well. So there’s that relationship, which is not going to shift overnight.\n\nThen there is the whole energy relationship, which has become much more important in recent months because India has been hit by the very high energy prices, which have been driven up, of course, by the war. Russia stepped in by offering India, along with other countries, a discount on the oil that it sells. We don’t know the precise figure, but people have said that it’s something around 30 percent below the market rate. That’s why earlier in the summer, for a brief period, Russia replaced Saudi Arabia as India’s second-largest oil supplier.\n\nSo there are all these very complicated deep links, which mean that when Modi thinks of his domestic picture, when he looks at inflation, at what he needs for his armed forces, he is having to balance this against the fact that India, over the last two to three decades, has also become very close to the United States and other Western countries.\n\nThat’s not a relationship that he wants to ruin in any way. So he’s been working the middle ground, trying to balance the two things. So far, it has to be said, he has been getting away with it.\n\nTN: Josh, the assumption one makes from a distance about the Kremlin announcements from Putin and his defense minister is that they come as a response to the troubles they’ve had on the battlefield. You suggested there may also be something in the fact that they came only a few days after these gentle rebukes from China and India.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJoshua Keating: Clearly, the main driving force behind what we saw from Vladimir Putin this morning was the setbacks they faced in eastern Ukraine and the mounting domestic criticism. But the international dimension is important too. For both the countries that have stood by Russia and the ones that have been on the fence, there was an assumption that this war would be over relatively quickly. And as it drags on, we’ve seen just how destructive this conflict has been, how disruptive it’s been to the global economy. Some of these countries, particularly China and India, are losing patience with this. There’s a sense that Russia needs to demonstrate some progress — a way out of this conflict, other than just a protracted endless war that it seems to be embarked on right now.\n\nTN: All this is coming in the midst of this big, crazy week at the United Nations. Even before Putin said what he said, it was clear that the war was going to be on the front burner at the U.N. President Biden called Putin’s statements “outrageous” and “irresponsible.” Are we going to have U.N. resolutions? What should we expect from the United Nations by way of response?\n\nJK: It really is a jarring juxtaposition. The U.N. does a lot, from famine relief to cultural preservation to nuclear security. But it has one core function: Keeping countries from using force to conquer each other, from invading each other. It’s right there in the U.N. Charter, which President Biden referred to specifically in his speech: Countries can’t use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other countries.\n\nSo to have this meeting of the U.N. at the same time that Putin has basically declared or set in motion the process for the annexation of about 15 percent of Ukraine’s territory is pretty jarring. As far as action that might be taken, we will probably see the U.S. try to table another Security Council Resolution, which will obviously be vetoed by Russia, as previous resolutions have been. Things may then move to the General Assembly, where there’s a pretty good chance that the General Assembly would vote to condemn Russia’s seizure of territory. That’s the kind of vote people look for to see which countries abstain, which don’t vote, to get a sense of the global level of support and the degree to which some of these countries that were trying to remain neutral might finally be running out of patience with what they’re seeing from the Russian government.\n\nTN: A question about Turkey. They are also in that category of fence-sitters. Talk about [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and what he has been saying in the last 24 or 48 hours.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJK: Turkey has played a pretty fascinating role in this conflict — as a NATO member, but one that also has a close defense relationship with Russia, at times a tense one. But it’s tried to play both sides of the fence. It’s sold weaponry to Ukraine, including the drones that Ukrainian military has made very effective use of, but it also stopped short of joining other NATO countries and sanctioning Russia.\n\nTurkey has played the role of a go-between — it was one of the important countries in mediating the deal to allow the export of grain through the Black Sea. It was interesting to watch President Erdogan being interviewed Tuesday by Judy Woodruff of PBS. He was asked if Russia should be permitted to keep some of the territory that it’s taken from Ukraine. His answer was no, undoubtedly no. The lands which were invaded will be returned to Ukraine.\n\nIf this war does end at the negotiating table, there’s a good chance Turkey might be one of the mediators of those talks, the country that’s been talking to both sides of this war. If Turkey, of all countries, is saying absolutely not, Russia can’t keep any of this territory, that’s a good sign that there’s not a lot of international support for Russia’s political position on this conflict.\n\nTN: Nikhil, there are a lot of expressions of concern at the U.N. this week that the poor nations of the world can’t afford to choose sides without making calculations about where they’re going to get their food and energy. Talk a little bit about this dynamic and how much that matters.\n\nNK: The world was already facing a food crisis even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for a variety of reasons, including the disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. And for a lot of poor countries, these problems have been made worse by this war.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor instance, sanctions on Russia have interrupted the food supply — as Josh mentioned, the grain deal has helped and provided some relief when it comes to food prices. But there are still lots of problems. One involves the supply of fertilizer, which is essential for farmers in all parts of the world. Right now, fertilizer prices are about three times where they were before covid. That’s connected very much to the war in Ukraine.\n\nFor a lot of these countries that are geographically very far away, they don’t have a feeling of being right next door to this conflict, as many people do in Europe. They’re far away, but they are nonetheless impacted by what’s going on because of how this conflict impacts the food market and energy markets. In the global energy market, the inflationary effects of all of this are bearing down on their populations. This was a point that was made again and again by Modi’s foreign minister last week, who in various places said that this was not India’s war, essentially, but we are having to live with the consequences of it.\n\nThe point that he made has been made by other officials in other parts of the world. Who would say no to cheap oil at a time of rapidly rising inflation? For all these countries, that’s the biggest concern. “Yes, we don’t think big countries should attack smaller countries, but at the same time, we’re having to live with the consequences.”\n\nTN: Let’s come back to China. We know that Xi Jinping is not in New York. As is often the case, his Foreign Minister Wang Yi is going to do the honors at the General Assembly. In terms of the war, what do you think China’s likely message will be?\n\nLP: We’re likely to hear similar messages to what we heard from the foreign ministry Wednesday. China calls for a peaceful resolution, balancing these two seemingly contradictory principles of supporting sovereignty and also supporting these [Russian] claims of legitimate security concerns, which speak to Russia’s interests.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI don’t anticipate seeing a big shift. I had a conversation with the Stimson [Center] China expert Yun Sun last week, in the wake of that big meeting in Uzbekistan. She was clear that when we look at this relationship between China and Russia, the war is certainly a factor, and we might see some shifts in China’s position. But the broader rationale for China’s growing engagement with Russia is based on the growing tensions with the U.S. So as long as those tensions with the U.S. grow, China has an interest in building its relationship with Russia.\n\nAs she put it, whether Russia wins or loses, China benefits in the long term. If Russia wins, China gains a stronger partner and if Russia loses, China gains a vassal state to basically support its interests globally. Given that Russia on the U.N. Security Council has that veto power, that’s all very important for China. From her perspective, China has a long-term interest in keeping this relationship with Russia strong, and that’s likely to dictate how China sees the conflict going forward.\n\nTN: Nikhil, the assumption has been that Europe is where the most steadfast stand against Putin exists. Is that strong as ever? Or fraying a little bit?\n\nNK: The polling that has been done in various countries continues to show a lot of public support for Ukraine and against Russia. This is, of course, reflected in the stances of the various political leaders across the European spectrum.\n\nNot all though. There’s Viktor Orban, Hungary’s authoritarian leader, who people have called Putin’s Trojan horse inside the European bloc. Because of rising energy costs, we’ve seen protests in different parts of Europe. We’ve seen them in Austria, in Italy and elsewhere. People have been calling for more action to bring down these prices, and they have been doing this while at the same time saying that they still stand with Ukraine in many cases.\n\nThe question is: What happens as we head into winter and as the energy crunch intensifies? There’s an election in Italy coming, and the woman who is likely to become prime minister, according to all the polls, is Giorgia Meloni, who leads a right-wing coalition which includes parties that are not so strongly against Putin. One of her allies, Matteo Salvini, has called for the sanctions on Russia to be watered down, saying that they are in fact hurting Italy. Meloni herself has made clear that she doesn’t support that point of view. But if she becomes prime minister, we don’t know what’s going to happen within that coalition and what the stance of this very important member of the European Union might be.\n\nSo there are all these questions about what happens next with Europe. We’re heading into winter, and that raises questions about what happens with public support in Europe, as people start seeing the impact of this energy crisis, and then what will happen? That would not have been a question if this war had ended two months ago. As this persists, I think, yes, there will be more questions about European support. But for now, it holds.\n\nThanks to Alicia Benjamin for copy editing this article.",
    "The View From Russia": "It’s kind of surreal to be here and to see people going on about their lives almost as if nothing has happened. Prices in Moscow have gone up, but people are living more or less as usual. Store shelves are full. I’m drinking Coca-Cola right now, despite the company officially leaving the Russian market.\n\nPeople are still luxury shopping. While lots of high-end brands closed their shops here, department stores are open, and some are selling Chanel and Dior perfumes and cosmetics as normal. Restaurants are full. People are going to copycat versions of McDonald’s. I recently walked by a closed Starbucks, which is becoming something called a Stars Coffee. Russians know how to adapt. Some have started saying: “It’s time we start building these companies for ourselves.”\n\nI’m also trying to think about what I don’t see. Tens of thousands of people have gone to other countries. For some it was an act of protest. Others were afraid of a conscription. Some journalists and activists left because of a crackdown on dissent — now if you write an antiwar post, it’s enough to send you to jail for years. Many of my friends and journalist colleagues left. I personally feel their absence.\n\nMoscow has incredible culture and performers. A lot of people made Moscow a world-class capital because they had the freedom to make art, and now many of them are gone.\n\nOur colleague Anton Troianovski reported that some politicians recently spoke out against the war, a remarkable moment given the Kremlin’s crackdown on dissent. How does criticism filter down to Russians?",

    "Belgium’s diamonds lose shine amid Russia sanctions talk": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nANTWERP, Belgium — Russian diamonds are on Europe’s radar once again — as is Belgium’s fraught role in the industry.\n\nDespite six rounds of sweeping European Union sanctions against Moscow, Russian diamonds have remained a shining absence from the embargo list.\n\nTheir omission is due in part to Belgium’s prominent role in the diamond industry. Antwerp has, for generations, served as the main hub for diamonds arriving in Europe — including from Russia.\n\nBut that may change. Russia’s pledge to ramp up its military campaign in Ukraine has prompted the EU to accelerate work on a new sanctions package. And several diplomats said Belgium’s hesitance about a Russian diamond ban is increasingly untenable.\n\nPublicly, Belgium has pledged not to block diamond sanctions. It has also expressed concerns that such a move may harm EU economies more than Russia’s purse. Privately, Belgian diplomats have successfully lobbied EU officials to keep the precious stones off the sanctions list, according to numerous diplomats familiar with the sanctions discussions.\n\n“This position is becoming more difficult,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nThe result is that Belgium — and its unyielding support of an industry long linked to autocrats, dictators and conflict zones — is once again in an uncomfortable spotlight. The EU has already sanctioned Russian gold and other luxury goods. And now those long pushing for diamond sanctions, including the Baltic states, Poland and the Netherlands, are trying to pounce.\n\n“We’ve been pushing for sanctions on Russian diamonds for months,” said another EU diplomat.\n\nDiamond divergence\n\nRough Russian diamonds currently account for 30 percent of the global trade in the precious stone. And the U.S. Treasury Department estimates that diamonds are one of Russia’s top-10, non-energy exports, totaling over $4.5 billion in 2021.\n\nYet even amid the war, Belgian leaders have not distanced themselves from the country’s diamond industry. Just last week, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was in Antwerp expressing his support at an industry conference. He has repeatedly argued that any diamond ban would hurt Europe more than Moscow.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” he said in a speech that didn’t mention Russia.\n\nDiamond industry leaders in Antwerp remain confident, even after the renewed debate on sanctions started this week.\n\nOther countries have taken a different approach.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo | Paul O'Driscoll/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. barred the import of “non-industrial” diamonds from Russia shortly after the invasion. It also sanctioned Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, the chief executive of Russia’s largest diamond mining firm, Alrosa, and his father, Sergei Borisovich Ivanov, a former chief of staff to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe EU has not followed suit.\n\nRoland Papp, who follows illicit financial flows for Transparency International, said the EU was demonstrating “moral hypocrisy” on the subject.\n\n“Over the summer the EU added Russian gold to the sanctions list, it is not too late to add diamonds,” he said.\n\nIn July, the anti-corruption NGO wrote to EU officials urging them to include diamonds in its Russian sanctions regime. Papp said the EU did not respond to the letter.\n\nTom Neys, a spokesperson for the Antwerp World Diamond Center, argued that the diamond business, already under huge pressure from regulators and consumers, organically responds to consumer demands, which currently include ethical and sustainable practices.\n\n“We have invested for 20 years in making the diamond trade more transparent,” said Neys in an interview with POLITICO at the Antwerp conference. “Are we really going to throw that all away to reward Dubai, which is already opening its doors for Russian oligarchs?” he added.\n\nThese arguments have left Ukrainian officials fuming. In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at Belgian lawmakers in a video appearance before the country’s parliament.\n\n\"There are those for whom Russian diamonds, sometimes sold in Antwerp, are more important,” he said.\n\nA historic bond\n\nAnti-money laundering, tax regulation and greater transparency haven’t come naturally to Antwerp’s diamond traders.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Belgium’s diamond industry has been linked to civil war, armed struggle and corruption across Africa. The world’s first-ever trial against a smuggler of “blood diamonds” from Sierra Leone was held in Antwerp in 2004.\n\nBelgium’s government has long faced criticism for looking the other way.\n\nIn 2008, Human Rights Watch wrote to Belgium’s then-Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders, now the EU’s justice commissioner, urging Brussels to crack down on Zimbabwe’s diamond smuggling and the human-rights abuses that accompanied it.\n\nBut NGOs later accused Belgium of doing the opposite and lobbying the EU to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe’s major diamond producer, which it did in 2013, providing a boost for the country’s despotic ruler, Robert Mugabe.\n\nSimilarly, a group of Antwerp-based politicians in the early 2010s known as the “diamond club” were accused of dictating government policy and laws to benefit the industry.\n\nWhen it comes to Russia, then-Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, now the European Council president, was another advocate for Antwerp’s diamond scene. In January 2018, Michel met Dmitry Medvedev, then Russian premier, in Moscow to discuss business opportunities.\n\n“Our investment cooperation has not come to a standstill,” Michel said at the time, referencing recent EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea. “Russian companies have long been working in Antwerp.”\n\nMichel and Reynders declined to comment.\n\nRussia divides diamond industry\n\nSanctions aside, the diamond industry has also split over how to address Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSince 2002, the so-called Kimberley Process has been a United Nations-endorsed certification scheme designed to assure consumers and traders that the diamonds they buy are not fuelling wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBut critics say the Kimberley Process fails to address current conflicts, like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Still, Bruce Cleaver, the chief executive of De Beers, told POLITICO his company supports reforming the Kimberley Process instead of eliminating it.\n\n“We think it's an important building block in maintaining consumer confidence that the diamonds they're buying are not conflict diamonds or [had] child labor involved in them,” he said.\n\nReform may be impossible, though. Papp, of Transparency International, said pro-Russian members are resisting pressure to expand the Kimberley Process’s narrow conflict definition, which only covers diamonds financing rebellions seeking to overthrow legitimate governments.\n\nIndeed, at a Kimberley Process meeting in June, members like China, Belarus and the Central African Republic, stopped any debate on the topic.\n\nHans Merket, who covers natural resources for the Antwerp-based IPIS think tank, said the Kimberley Process is struggling to protect consumers from fears they are funding Russia’s conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It runs the risk of becoming increasingly irrelevant,” he said.\n\nBarbara Moens contributed reporting.",

    "The Myths That Made, and Still Make, Russia": "Despite the rise of a meritocratic bureaucracy in the 17th century, and other developments manifested in the Westernizing reforms of Peter the Great, Russia never experienced its own version of European feudalism, or a Renaissance or Enlightenment. As Figes makes clear, the empire’s autocratic rule suppressed the kind of civil society that would be crucial for the development of modern European civilization.\n\nNevertheless, Peter’s critics accused him of diverting Russia from its Byzantine traditions in what became the country’s central cultural debate, symbolized by the opposition between the so-called Westernizers and Slavophiles in the 19th century. Later intellectuals “twisted earlier Slavophile ideas about Russia’s role as the protector of Christian principles against the materialism of the West to argue that the latter was an existential threat to it,” Figes writes. Sic transit Putin.\n\nIt is testament to the pervasiveness of Russian myths that Figes perpetuates some of them. They include his description of Ivan the Terrible, whose rule conventional histories divide between a dynamic first half and descent into madness following the death of his beloved first wife, Anastasia Romanova. That characterization almost certainly came from later mythologizing, partly to legitimize the establishment of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nAnd developments from the mid-19th century on are treated increasingly superficially, presented as all but inevitable consequences of earlier history. In fact, the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 was the result of not only bungling by the reactionary Czar Nicholas II but also dumb luck and German support — the ensuing civil war could have gone either way. Even more nuance is missing from later Soviet history, including the paradoxical figure of the reformer Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nFiges has previously courted controversy for allegedly embellishing interviews and for anonymously panning rivals’ works on Amazon. There are some mischaracterizations here; it was not so much President Boris Yeltsin’s constitutional reform that prompted a violent standoff with Parliament in 1993, for instance, as a power grab by the Soviet-era legislature (then called the Congress of People’s Deputies, not the later Duma, as Figes has it).\n\nBut the author’s glossing over the Westernizing 1990s is perhaps most disappointing. They are characterized as essentially doomed to failure, with little acknowledgment of the importance of a newly free press, democratization and fundamental transformation in governance, including how the center dealt with the country’s regions. Instead of czarist and Soviet administrative coercion, Moscow relied on monetary policy: the flow of appropriations to the provinces and ebb in the form of taxes. Such developments do not fit neatly into Figes’s narrative.",

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight What many watchers of the war in Ukraine feared is about to happen. Separatist leaders in four enclaves controlled by Russian forces and their proxies in Ukraine announced “referendums” to be staged Friday through Tuesday to decide whether their territories would join Russia. These votes, which are illegal under both Ukrainian and international law and viewed by most analysts as a sham, are similar to what Russia unfurled following its 2014 annexation of Crimea. Unlike then, the Kremlin’s military hold over these statelets in Ukraine’s Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions is more tenuous, with Ukraine in the midst of an ongoing offensive to push Russian troops out of more areas of the country.\n\nVoronezh BELARUS RUSSIA Chernihiv Area held by Russia- backed separatists before Feb. 2022 Belgorod Sumy Valuyki Kyiv Kharkiv LUHANSK KHARKIV Cherkasy Slovyansk Luhansk UKRAINE Dnipro Donetsk Kirovohrad DONETSK Zaporizhzhia ZAPORIZHZHIA Rostov- on-Don Mariupol Mykolaiv Melitopol KHERSON MOL.

Humbled on the battlefield in recent weeks, he may believe changing the political facts on the ground could stymie Ukrainian advances and force a recalculation among Western governments. “After annexing the territories, Moscow would likely declare Ukrainian attacks on those areas to be assaults on Russia itself, analysts warned, a potential trigger for a general military mobilization or a dangerous escalation such as the use of a nuclear weapon against Ukraine,” wrote my colleague Robyn Dixon.\n\nVladimir Putin warned the West that if it continued what he called its “nuclear blackmail,” that Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal. (Video: Reuters)\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Putin delivered a speech ordering a “partial mobilization” of Russian troops and warned that Russia “will use all the means at our disposal” to defend its territory — a veiled nuclear threat. His country’s rubber-stamp parliament is pushing through a bill that will stiffen punishments for a host of crimes, such as desertion and insubordination, if committed during military mobilization or combat situations. Pro-war hard-liners have called for such tougher measures to buttress Russia’s flagging war effort. They also believe that a tightening of control over Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia will up the ante in the Kremlin’s favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Judging by what is happening and what is about to happen, this week marks either the eve of our imminent victory or the eve of nuclear war,” Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of state propaganda channel RT, tweeted. “I can’t see any third option.”\n\nUkrainian officials were unimpressed. “Sham ‘referendums’ will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid ‘mobilization,’” responded Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.”\n\n#Russia's state propaganda outlets already publish the results of \"opinion polls\" in occupied areas in #Ukraine, which are likely to be used as \"targets\" for the fake \"referenda\" on #annexation:\n\n\n\nDonetsk region - 94%\n\nLuhansk - 93%\n\nZaporizhzhia - 87%\n\nKherson - 80% pic.twitter.com/S8WAqKXdyE — Alex Kokcharov (@AlexKokcharov) September 20, 2022\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron when speaking Tuesday at the dais of the U.N. General Assembly. He cast Russian actions since the Feb. 24 invasion as “a return to the age of imperialism and colonies” and spoke directly to nations in the developing world that seem to be sitting on the fence during this conflict. “Those who are silent now on this new imperialism, or are secretly complicit with it, show a new cynicism that is tearing down the global order without which peace is not possible,” Macron said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther Western diplomats condemned the mooted annexation plans. “Russia, its political leadership, and all those involved in these ‘referenda’ and other violations of international law in Ukraine will be held accountable, and additional restrictive measures against Russia would be considered,” E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.\n\nWith the exception of the rhetorical backing of a clutch of far-right allies in Europe, Putin can’t count on much support from elsewhere, either. Last week at a summit in Uzbekistan, he faced a degree of pressure from the leaders of China and India, which have historically warm ties with Moscow, to draw down hostilities in Ukraine.\n\n“Those countries signaled to Putin that he should end the war as quickly as possible, and stop claiming to represent the entirety of the non-Western world,” tweeted Alexander Baunov, a Russian journalist and international policy expert. “Moscow’s actions, therefore, are being taken to either end the war as soon as possible, or, if it that doesn’t work, to put the blame for that on other people, and turn Russia’s invasion of a neighboring country into a defensive war.”\n\nReferendums planned in Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions on joining #Russia will not be recognized by the international community, said Emmanuel Macron and called the plans \"cynical\" and \"a parody.\"\n\n\n\nAlso, Macron guaranteed the continuation of arms deliveries to #Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/a2hCAGDW6k — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) September 20, 2022\n\nUkraine’s stunning victories in the northeast Kharkiv region set the table for this strategic turn. The rapid Ukrainian advance exposed a depleted, disorganized Russian military that melted away. It also further collapsed Putin’s propaganda narrative surrounding the war. For months, the Kremlin framed the Russian invasion as a “special operation” with an inevitable outcome — to bring an unruly little neighbor back into the Russian fold. The series of stinging setbacks have illustrated the seeming impossibility of a decisive Russian military victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd many in Russia are now getting the picture, too. “Judging by the scathing commentary in Russian Telegram channels and the shift of tone in the Kremlin-controlled media, Russians are in the process of losing the last remaining glimmers of their perceived military might,” wrote Gian Gentile and Raphael S. Cohen in Foreign Policy, likening the Ukrainian victory in Kharkiv to the American victory over the British at Saratoga in 1777, which turned the tide of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThat analogy may be a bit premature. Dara Massicot, Gentile and Cohen’s colleague at the Rand Corporation, warned that the next phase of the war — still massively influenced by Western military support to Ukraine as it bids to reclaim its lost territory — could see a whole new series of Russian provocations. “If the Kremlin’s annexation gambit fails to stop the fighting and support to Ukraine, the Kremlin will need to lash out to show it is serious,” she tweeted. “That means escalation that could come in different form” — including more missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian areas and energy infrastructure, cyberattacks, and exercises that involve the “brandishing of nuclear weapons,” if not their deployment.\n\nThe stakes are getting higher. The West “should remind Russia of the invisible rules of the war: that neither side wants to turn this conventional war into a wider NATO-Russian confrontation,” wrote Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage in Foreign Affairs. “A nuclear escalation would violate these rules and could lead to NATO involvement. It would be to everybody’s detriment.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Fix and Kimmage argued, Kremlin attempts to order a general mobilization may only plunge approval for the war among the Russian public and undermine Putin’s own grip on power. “Putin’s Russia has been unable to develop a clear concept for its war, unable to learn from its mistakes, and unable to execute many of the functions of a world-class military,” they wrote. “Mobilization per se would change none of this.”\n\nWar in Ukraine: What you need to know The latest: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of troops in an address to the nation on Sept. 21, framing the move as an attempt to defend Russian sovereignty against a West that seeks to use Ukraine as a tool to “divide and destroy Russia.” Follow our live updates here. The fight: A successful Ukrainian counteroffensive has forced a major Russian retreat in the northeastern Kharkiv region in recent days, as troops fled cities and villages they had occupied since the early days of the war and abandoned large amounts of military equipment.

    "Officials: Navy bribery case fugitive tried to get to Russia": "Since escaping two weeks ago, officials say the fugitive Malaysian defense contractor nicknamed “Fat Leonard” — who orchestrated one of the U.S. Navy’s largest bribery scandals — zipped between countries to find a place where he could become virtually untouchable for American authorities.\n\nIt almost worked.\n\nAfter cutting off an ankle monitor and slipping away from house arrest in San Diego on Sept. 4, U.S. and Venezuelan officials say Leonard Glenn Francis went across the border into Mexico, then traveled to Cuba and Venezuela, where he was arrested Tuesday at Simón Bolívar International Airport outside Caracas.\n\nFrancis was planning to travel to Russia, according to Interpol Venezuela Director General Carlos Garate Rondon, who disclosed the arrest in a statement posted Wednesday on Instagram. He said Francis would be handed over to the country’s judicial authorities to begin extradition proceedings.\n\nGreg Rinckey, a former Army lawyer who is now in private practice, said he believes Francis was “trying to play the angle of using some countries to get outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Marshals Service.”\n\n“It looks like they caught him just in time,” Rinckey said. “If he made it to Russia, I don’t believe the Russians would have turned him over to us.”\n\nAnd while Venezuela and the United States have an extradition agreement, the U.S. government could face an uphill challenge returning the fugitive to American soil. The Biden administration doesn’t officially recognize President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government, has no embassy in Venezuela and has imposed crushing sanctions on the country that have further embittered relations. Law enforcement cooperation between the two countries is rare.\n\nThere was no immediate word on when Francis might be extradited to the U.S.\n\nThe arrest came on the eve of his scheduled sentencing in a federal court in California for a bribery scheme that lasted years.\n\nFrancis pleaded guilty in 2015 and had been allowed to remain in home confinement to receive medical care while he cooperated with the prosecution. With his help, prosecutors secured convictions of 33 of 34 defendants, including more than two dozen Navy officers.\n\nThe towering man with a wide girth and gregarious personality wielded incredible influence as a main point of contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia. His family’s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, supplied food, water and fuel to vessels for decades. He plied officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines. In exchange, commanders passed him classified information and steered their ships, mostly from the Navy’s 7th Fleet, to ports he controlled so he could cover up as much as $35 million in fake charges.\n\nAmong those he befriended was a Russian diplomat, Francis told podcaster Tom Wright, who created a nine-part series on the case. In an episode posted last October, Francis said he lived only a “stone’s throw” from the Russian Embassy in Singapore, and the Russian diplomat would stop by his home uninvited to drop off vodka and other gifts.\n\nIt's unknown if Francis turned to his Russian friends for help while on the lam.\n\nA law enforcement official familiar with the case told The Associated Press that authorities tracked down Francis using a cellphone number they were provided. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said Francis was located Tuesday in a Caracas neighborhood.\n\nVenezuelan authorities deployed a team of officers at the airport after a cab driver tipped them off that Francis was leaving a hotel and headed there.\n\nThe official said Francis intended to board a plane to the Venezuelan Caribbean Island of Margarita, which Venezuela wants to turn into a popular destination for Russian tourists because of its pristine beaches accessible by ferry or flights from the mainland. The government said last month it plans to offer five flights a week between Margarita and Moscow starting Oct. 1. Signs in Russian can already be seen at the island.\n\nThe official said Francis later told authorities his final destination was Russia.\n\nIt's unclear if Francis had contacts in Russia offering to help, and if he did, what they wanted in return. Francis bragged about still holding compromising photos and videos of Navy officials.\n\n“What really worried the United States the most was these officers being corrupted by me, that they would be corruptible by the foreign powers,” Francis said in one of the podcast’s episodes.\n\nHis sentencing hearing was still held Thursday to deal with the changing situation. When he returns, Francis will need new attorneys. His defense attorney, Devin Burstein, told the judge he plans to file a motion severing their ties due to an “irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”\n\nAnd when he does return, prosecutors indicated Francis will face an even longer sentence, asking the court to note his failure to appear at his sentencing hearing as ordered. That could add five years to his potential sentence of 25 years if he is ultimately charged for not showing up.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino set a Dec. 14 status hearing for Francis with the caveat that all parties could meet sooner depending on how events unfold.\n\n“This turn of events raises several issues, and obviously will have an impact on other cases,\" she said.\n\nSentencing hearings are scheduled in October for four Navy officers who went to trial and were convicted in the case.",

Today, the GRU is being designated by the Department of State pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(i) for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. The GRU was previously designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, in 2016; pursuant to Section 224 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act in 2018; and pursuant to E.O. 13382 in 2021.\n\nSince the start of Russia’s further, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has engaged in systematic “filtration” operations and forced deportations in Russian-controlled and held areas of Ukraine. The GRU has been centrally involved in Russia’s filtration activities and forced deportation activities.\n\nThe unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime. Estimates from a variety of sources indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported at least hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens, including children, from their homes to Russia – often to isolated regions in the Far East.\n\nCredible reports also indicate Russian authorities are deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents and abducting others from orphanages before putting them up for adoption inside Russia. Credible accounts indicate that the “filtering” process often involves beating and assaulting detained Ukrainian citizens, separating the families of Ukrainian citizens, seizing Ukrainian citizens’ identification documents, such as passports, and depriving detained Ukrainian citizens of basic necessities such as water and food for periods of time.\n\nCredible reports also indicate that the filtration camps often have poor sanitation measures to protect the health of those being held there and that Ukrainian citizens have died in such camps because of a lack of access to medical care. There are also reports that Ukrainian citizens have been killed in Russia’s filtration camps.\n\nIsolating High-Technology Industries That Contribute to Russia’s Defense Capabilities\n\nU.S.-designated Russian President Vladimir Putin has for years focused on leveraging advanced science and technology to strengthen Russia’s defense capabilities – the same defense capabilities that the Russian Federation is using to attack Ukraine’s population centers and that have resulted in extraordinary suffering including the deaths of children. Today, the Department of State is also taking further action to degrade high-technology industries that support Putin’s war machine.\n\nMilitary Space\n\nThe Department of State is designating three leading Russian military space entities that play central roles in strengthening Russia’s defense capabilities.

    "Russia’s Tatarstan Bans Reservists From Leaving as Mobilization Underway": "Authorities in Russia’s republic of Tatarstan have prohibited all residents in the military reserves from leaving the region, according to a government order published Wednesday.\n\nThe order follows President Vladimir Putin's decaration of a “partial” military mobilization for the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Officers, warrant officers, midshipmen, sergeants, foremen, soldiers and sailors of the reserve…are temporarily prohibited from traveling outside their district (city),” the Tatarstan government's document reads.\n\nThe ban on movement is a part of Tatarstan’s effort to maintain good relations with the federal government by fulfilling the Kremlin’s manpower requests for the war in Ukraine, Tatar political expert and journalist Ruslan Aysin said.\n\n“Tatarstan always has to prove to the federal government that it is the best region…and can fulfill all orders from Moscow,” Aysin told The Moscow Times.\n\nThis was echoed in comments by the head of Tatarstan's spokeswoman, Liliya Galimova, who said at a press conference Wednesday that the Turkic Muslim-majority republic would fulfill Moscow’s mobilization needs “on time.”\n\nTatarstan's new movement restrictions also require business owners to ensure that all employees in the reserves report to enlistment offices, with administrative fines for non-compliance.",
    "Zelenskyy promises no let up in counteroffensive against Russia": "Zelenskyy’s pledge comes as the US calls for vigilance and the UK warns of more Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has promised there will be no let up in Ukraine’s campaign to regain territory lost to Russia.\n\nThe pledge on Sunday came as the United Kingdom said Russian forces were stepping up raids on civilian infrastructure and a top United States general warned it was unclear how Moscow would react to its battlefield setbacks in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainian forces would keep up the pressure on Russia.\n\n“Perhaps now it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly video address. “But this is not a lull. This is preparation for the next series … Because Ukraine must be free – all of it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian military said its forces had repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of neighbouring Donetsk. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in the Kharkiv region.\n\n“From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region, said this meant the “de-occupation” of his region was “not far away”.\n\nAs Russian shells hit towns and cities during the weekend, the British defence ministry warned that Moscow was likely to increase attacks on civilian targets as it suffers battlefield defeats.\n\n“In the last seven days, Russia has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect,” the ministry said in an online briefing. “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government.”\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, meanwhile called for vigilance after visiting a base in Poland supporting Ukraine’s war effort. His remarks were a reminder of the risks of escalation as the US and its NATO allies aid Ukraine from a distance.\n\n“The war is not going too well for Russia right now So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” he said after his trip to the base, which reporters travelling with him were asked not to identify.\n\nPutin, Biden warnings\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, has brushed off Ukraine’s swift counteroffensive and said Moscow would respond more forcefully if its troops were put under further pressure.\n\nSuch repeated threats have raised concerns Putin could at some point turn to small nuclear weapons or chemical warfare.\n\nUS President Joe Biden asked what he would tell Putin if he was considering using such weapons, and replied in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes”: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.\n\nSome military analysts have said Russia might also stage a nuclear incident at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant which is held by Russia but run by Ukrainian staff. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling around the plant that has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines needed to keep it cool and safe.\n\nA top Vatican envoy reportedly came under fire in Zaporizhzhia city on Saturday as he was helping in the distribution of humanitarian supplies there. The incident forced Vatican Cardinal Konrad Krajewski and others to take cover, the Vatican news service said on Sunday. It reported no injuries.\n\n“For the first time in my life, I didn’t know where to run. Because it is not enough to run, you have to know where to go,” said the Polish-born cardinal, whose office makes charitable contributions in the pope’s name.\n\nUkrainian officials, meanwhile, reported continued shelling across a wide stretch of the country.\n\nRussian fire killed four medics attempting to evacuate a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkiv region on Saturday, said governor Oleh Synyehubov. Two patients were wounded in the attack in Strelecha, he said.\n\nOvernight shelling also hit a hospital in Mykolaiv, a significant Black Sea port, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. And five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day. In Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, according to regional governors.\n\nSeparately, the pro-Russian separatist forces that control much of Donetsk accused Ukraine of shelling a prisoner-of-war colony in Olenivka and said one prisoner was killed and four were wounded in the attacks.\n\nAl Jazeera could not verify the battlefield reports independently.\n\n‘Still scared’\n\nIn areas retaken from Russian forces, returning Ukrainians were searching for their dead relatives.\n\nIn Izyum, where Ukrainian officials said they had found 440 bodies at a forest grave site, Volodymyr Kolesnyk was trying to match numbers on wooden crosses with names on a neatly handwritten list to locate relatives who he said were killed in an air raid early in the war. Kolesnyk told the Reuters news agency that he got the list from a local funeral company that dug the graves.\n\n“They buried the bodies in bags, without coffins, without anything. I was not allowed here at first. They [Russians] said it was mined and asked to wait,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors in Kharkiv are accusing Russia of torturing civilians in one village that was recently freed. In an online statement, they said they found a basement where Russian forces allegedly tortured prisoners in Kozacha Lopan, near the border with Russia. In the images they released, they showed a Russian military TA-57 telephone with additional wires and alligator clips attached to it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of using Soviet-era radio telephones as a power source to shock prisoners during interrogation.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to verify the Ukrainians’ claims.\n\nElsewhere in the region, residents of towns recaptured after six months of Russian occupation were returning with a mixture of joy and trepidation.\n\n“I’ve still kept this feeling, that any moment a shell could explode or an aeroplane could fly over,” said Nataliia Yelistratova, who travelled with her husband and daughter 80 kilometres (50 miles) on a train from Kharkiv to her hometown of Balakliya to find her apartment block intact, but scarred by shelling.\n\n“I’m still scared to be here,” she said after discovering a piece of shrapnel in a wall.",

    "Putin under pressure: what is Russia’s next move?": "In late August, occupation authorities in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kupyansk held celebrations to mark Russian Flag Day.\n\nA few dozen people — including both pro-Kremlin activists and locals who had stayed in the town after it was captured by Russian forces six months ago — unfurled an enormous 60mx40m Russian tricolour on the main square, then waved flags and danced to a medley of patriotic tunes.\n\nJust a few weeks later, the Russian occupying forces were gone after a surprise Ukrainian attack forced them to surrender more than 3,000 sq km of territory, leaving tanks, armoured vehicles and supplies.\n\nThe stunning reversal has shattered the mantra, repeated by senior officials visiting occupied territories over the spring and summer, that “Russia is here forever” in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nBacked by western weapons and intelligence, Ukraine’s lightning counter-offensive across the Kharkiv region has shifted the momentum of the war, laying bare the vulnerability of Russia’s overstretched invasion forces and shattering the illusion of normality at home the Kremlin has worked to sustain.\n\nThe dramatic retreat on the battlefield is only one of a number of Ukraine setbacks that Russian leader Vladimir Putin has faced this week.\n\nRussia’s budget surplus for the year has almost evaporated, according to figures published this week, due to weaker oil prices and dwindling gas deliveries to Europe — potentially putting even greater pressure on the economy.

On Friday, India’s Narendra Modi publicly rebuked Putin at the same summit, saying “today’s era is not an era of war”.\n\nSince Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February, the Russian leader has maintained the public stance that it is a “special military operation” — a term designed to introduce a sense of business as usual in domestic life, evoking far-off conflicts in places like Syria rather than Russians’ traumatic memories of bloody, grinding wars in Chechnya and Afghanistan.\n\nBut that position is becoming increasingly untenable — both from a military point of view and in terms of domestic politics.\n\nSome military analysts believe he has little choice but to order a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n“By the end of this year, the Kremlin will lose almost all of its artillery ammunition, almost all of its armoured vehicles, battle tanks and the main part of its ground forces,” says Pavel Luzin, an expert on the Russian military. “How can you continue the war without artillery and troops?”\n\nHe also finds himself being under pressure at home not just from the liberal opposition, much of which has either fled the country or is too fearful to criticise the invasion, but also from the right, including some of the most prominent cheerleaders of the war who are urging him to escalate.\n\nAlexei Venediktov, the editor of liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, says Putin is playing a very dangerous game © AFP via Getty Images\n\nWith no victory in sight, it is becoming increasingly difficult to shield Russians from the war’s blowback.\n\n“He’s playing a very dangerous game,” says Alexei Venediktov, the longtime editor of liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, which was closed down in March.\n\n“It’s a battle of resources, and the most important resource is time. Now either he waits out longer than Europe [during the winter], or the Russian people get tired,” Venediktov adds. “And it’s unclear what collapses first — Putin, or everyone else.”\n\nShadowy drive for recruits\n\nOn Wednesday, a video emerged online of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a caterer-turned-warlord known as “Putin’s chef”, addressing convicts in a Russian prison yard.\n\nPrigozhin urged the prisoners to fight on the front lines in Wagner, a shadowy paramilitary group the US says he runs. If they survived six months, they would get amnesty; if they deserted, he said, they would be executed.\n\nThe video highlighted how Russia has been forced to adapt as the war drags on with no victory in sight.\n\nRussia’s covert operations are now overt: Wagner advertises on billboards across Russia. Prigozhin appeared to confirm the video’s authenticity after denying the group’s very existence for years.\n\nThe apparent drive to recruit prisoners for Prigozhin’s militia has made Russia’s manpower problems starker still. “Either mercenaries and inmates [fight], or your children do — decide for yourselves,” Prigozhin wrote in a subsequent social media post.\n\nRussia’s problems only begin there. By cutting off Russia’s main north-south supply line and occupying a vital staging ground for Moscow’s troops, Ukraine has in effect scuppered the Kremlin’s stated objective of “liberating” the entire Donbas region, say analysts. It has given Kyiv’s forces battlefield momentum and Ukraine’s western allies reassurance that it will prevail with their support.\n\n“This counter-offensive shows very well that the Russian armed forces are exhausted,” says Luzin.\n\nRussia’s defense ministry acknowledged the retreat but described it as a “regrouping”.\n\nUltranationalist sabre-rattling\n\nMoscow’s setback in Kharkiv has stirred criticism from the most virulent pro-war camp at home, which has openly bemoaned the defeat and raced to find someone to blame.\n\nThis more radical, sabre-rattling group has long criticised the Kremlin for not going far enough in its assault on Ukraine. It wants Putin to declare a full-scale war, propelling Russia’s large conscript army into battle and mobilising the wider population and economy.\n\n“For the first half-year of the conflict Russia has been waging war like Britain once did in its colonies,” says Alexander Borodai, a Russian MP who commands three volunteer battalions currently fighting in Ukraine. “The brave little English soldiers in red are fighting somewhere in India. And the metropole is going on as usual with its balls, society galas and salons.”\n\nRussian MP Alexander Borodai: ‘For the first half-year of the conflict Russia has been waging war like Britain once did in its colonies’ © AFP via Getty Images\n\nBorodai, who previously led a Moscow-backed Donbas separatist government, adds: “Sometimes a sun-tanned, hopped-up Rudyard Kipling comes to read his romantic poetry about blood, dust and sand. They applaud, donate to charity, and then he goes back and life goes on.”\n\nThis ultranationalist camp is a minority, existing on the fringes of Russian politics, and is mostly made up of military bloggers and other commentators writing on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHowever, it can still have political resonance. “History is made by the minorities,” says Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of Moscow political consultancy R.Politik.\n\nThe hyperactivity of the ultranationalist group, and its highly vocal and emotional response to the defeat in Kharkiv, is affecting the mainstream pro-Kremlin elite, from the TV anchors to the technocrats, making its members nervous, says Stanovaya.\n\n“If before, their fears were around the war dragging on, and potentially lasting years . . . Now, fears have appeared that Russia could lose,” she says. “This raises questions about the future of everyone who plays a role and whose fate is tied up with that of the government.”\n\nThe ultranationalist critique has not gone unnoticed in the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday sent a barely veiled threat, warning them to not take the clamouring too far — a rare admission that criticism may be unsettling Russia’s leadership.\n\n\n\n“When it comes to other points of view, critical ones, when these stay within the bounds of the existing legislation, it’s pluralism,” Peskov said. “But the line is very, very thin. One has to be very careful here.”\n\nFor the time being, the ultranationalist group’s views do not align with those of the wider population. The majority of Russians appear happy to passively support Putin and the war, but prefer to pay as little attention to it as possible. Their support is predicated on them not having to escalate their involvement.\n\nThese “laymen”, as Greg Yudin, head of Political Philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, has termed them, are “completely depoliticised” and don’t want to engage in any way with the war.\n\nSome of the war’s supporters have proposed half-measures to boost the war effort without alienating what Venediktov calls the “indifferently loyal” bulk of the population.\n\nBorodai suggests a partial mobilisation of up to 400,000 men and declaring martial law only on Russia’s border. “It’s long past time to admit we are at war. And everything else follows from that,” he says.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya, suggested that the government try a “self-mobilisation” approach instead.\n\nThis would put the burden of mobilisation on regional leaders, rather than on the Kremlin or ministry of defence. Moscow has deployed this tactic for unpopular policies before, most notably during the pandemic, when Putin wanted to introduce lockdowns without taking responsibility for them.\n\nOptions for Putin\n\nPutin’s response to the setbacks in Ukraine remains a mystery. Even six months after Russia’s troops swarmed over all of eastern and central Ukraine, Putin has attempted to keep his options open. In public, he speaks repeatedly about efforts to gain control of the whole of Donbas but rarely mentions other hotspots such as Kharkiv and Kherson.\n\nBut as a result, “nobody knows why we need Kharkiv, as opposed to the Donbas,” a person close to the Kremlin says. “Putin might know what he wants, but the rest are all guessing. He’s been in power for 20 years and has become this godlike figure. So we assume he must know what he wants. But he’s not explaining it to the people who are actually doing the work.”\n\nRamzan Kadyrov, centre, the strongman leader of Chechnya, suggested that the Russian government try a ‘self-mobilisation’ approach © Chingis Kondarov/Reuters\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Putin insisted that Russia would not change its operational plans and that its main goal remained “liberating all of the Donbas.” He claimed Russia’s offensive operations were bringing more territory under its control.\n\n“We are not fighting with the whole army, but only part of it,” Putin said, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. “We are not in a rush.”\n\nPutin could choose to escalate the conflict. This week Russia stepped up missile strikes on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, hitting the power network, district heating plants and hydroelectric installations, in what Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal described as an attempt to terrorise the Ukrainian population as winter approaches.\n\nThough Russian radicals reacted with glee, “revenge is an act of helplessness”, the person close to the Kremlin says. “The most dangerous situation is if Russia loses, because then Putin might turn to more unconventional means.”\n\nPutin could also try to expand the conflict by provoking a clash with Nato, says Luzin, thereby justifying a full mobilisation at home to expand the armed forces. But military experts say it would take several months to produce trained men integrated into military units with commanders and equipment.\n\nSuch a move would also make the war impossible to ignore for ordinary Russians — with potential consequences for Putin’s popularity. Yet as Ukraine advances, the radicals are urging him to go further.\n\n“Most Russians want us to stop playing at the ‘special military operation,’ take our white gloves off, and really hit Kyiv where it hurts. We haven’t been doing this so far out of politeness,” Borodai says.\n\nHe insists the retreat will only prove a minor setback. “At the start of the second world war, Russia and the Soviet Union suffered the most terrible defeats on the battlefield, but ended the war in Berlin,” Borodai says. “So maybe this campaign will end like that one, too — perhaps right there, in Berlin?”",
    "Treasury warns against Russia's efforts to evade sanctions with cryptocurrencies": "Ether has hugely outperformed bitcoin since both cryptocurrencies formed a bottom in June 2022. Ether's superior gains have come as investors anticipate a major upgrade to the ethereum blockchain called \"the merge.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin could use cryptocurrencies to evade U.S. and other sanctions launched against the Kremlin for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a Treasury official told lawmakers Tuesday.\n\n\"Yes, senator, that's possible,\" Elizabeth Rosenberg, Treasury's assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked her if digital assets could be used to skirt sanctions.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs convened the hearing to discuss the next steps for deterrents against Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine, such as the seizure of assets from Russian oligarchs and the G-7 call to cap the price of Russian oil.\n\nWarren said she'd been concerned about the possibility of cryptocurrencies being used by Russian elites to bypass sanctions since the country invaded Ukraine in February.\n\n\"Back then we already knew that countries like North Korea had used crypto to skirt sanctions and launder at least hundreds of millions of dollars. And Russia could easily be part of that,\" Warren said.\n\nThe Treasury Department has already identified Russian entities attempting to circumvent sanctions with crypto. Twenty-two individuals and two entities, including a neo-Nazi paramilitary group, were designated this month for helping Russia digitally finance the war on Ukraine.\n\nIn April, the agency targeted a virtual currency mining agency for the first time, along with oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, privately owned commercial bank Public Joint Stock Company Transkapitalbank and 40 other individuals and entities led by Malofeyev.\n\nRussia-based Darknet Market Hydra and Garantex, a virtual currency exchange, were also sanctioned that month partly to cut off avenues for potential sanctions evasion.",

(Pavel Bednyakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday blasted what he described as U.S. efforts to preserve its global domination and ordered officials to boost weapons production amid the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking while receiving credentials from foreign ambassadors to Moscow, Putin said “the objective development toward a multipolar world faces resistance of those who try to preserve their hegemony in global affairs and control everything — Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.”\n\nHe added that “the hegemon has succeeded in doing so for quite a long time, but it can’t go on forever ... regardless of the developments in Ukraine.”\n\nPutin has repeatedly cast his decision to send troops into Ukraine as a response to alleged Western encroachment on Russia’s vital security interests.\n\nThe Russian leader described Western sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine as part of efforts by the U.S. and its allies to strengthen their positions, but charged that that they have backfired against their organizers and also hurt poor countries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“As for Russia, we won’t deviate from our sovereign course,” Putin said.\n\nSpeaking later during a separate meeting on military industries, he said Russian weapons have shown high efficiency during the fighting in Ukraine and told officials to quickly increase output of military industries.\n\n“Our equipment efficiently confronts Western types of weapons,” Putin said. “Practically all of NATO weapons stockpiles have been brought to support the current regime in Kyiv.”\n\nPutin added that Russia should study Western weapons to improve its own arsenals.\n\n“We can and must learn about these arsenals, everything they have, everything they use against us to qualitatively increase our potential and improve our equipment, our weapons where we need to do it,” he noted.\n\nPutin said he has ordered to boost allocations for new weapons, offer more loans to military industries and approve additional payments to their workers to increase weapons output.\n\n“Structures of the military industrial complex must deliver the required weapons and equipment in the shortest time possible,” Putin said.",
    "Ukrainians search grave site for relatives after Russians are driven out; Russia likely extended locations it's prepared to strike, UK says": "Forensic technicians uncover a coffin in a forest on the outskirts of Izyum, eastern Ukraine on September 16, 2022. - Ukraine said on September 16, 2022 it had counted 450 graves at just one burial site near Izyum after recapturing the eastern city from the Russians.\n\nResidents of the Ukrainian town of Izium searched for dead relatives in a nearby wooded grave site as emergency workers continued to exhume what they said were hundreds of bodies found after Russian forces were driven from the region.\n\nThe causes of death for those at the grave site, discovered last week, have not yet been established, although residents say some died in an airstrike.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said at least one of the bodies had tied hands and rope marks on the neck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said investigators had discovered new evidence of torture used against the people buried in Izium, one of more than 20 towns retaken in the northeastern Kharkiv region after a lightning advance earlier this month.\n\n\"More than 10 torture chambers have already been found in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region, in various cities and towns,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late on Saturday.\n\n\"Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territories.

(The Russians) said it was mined and asked to wait. And there was a lot of them in the woods, so it was scary to come here,\" Kolesnyk told Reuters.",
    "Russian Setbacks Are Hampering Army Recruitment, Says Pentagon Official": "Image An abandoned Russian tank with the “Z” symbol in Izium last week, during a media tour arranged by the Ukrainian government after the city was reclaimed. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON — Russia is struggling to attract recruits for its army amid its setbacks in Ukraine, while the United States is open to potentially sending Western tanks to Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday.\n\n“The Russians are performing so poorly that the news from Kharkiv Province has inspired many Russian volunteers to refuse combat,” the official said, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the status of Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding that the leader of the Wagner Group, a private military company with ties to the Kremlin, had been seen in videos posted on social media asking Russian prisoners, Tajiks, Belarusians and Armenians to join the fight in Ukraine.\n\n“We believe this is part of Wagner’s campaign to recruit over 1,500 convicted felons,” the official said. “But many are refusing.”\n\nLast week, a video posted online and analyzed by The New York Times showed the Wagner Group promising convicts that they would be released from prison in return for a six-month combat tour in Ukraine. It is unclear when the video was filmed.\n\nThe official added that Russia was failing in its own strategic objectives, noting that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia reiterated last week that the “main goal” of his invasion was limited to capturing the Donbas — the eastern Ukrainian region where Russia has recognized as independent two Kremlin-backed statelets but where Ukraine still controls several key cities and towns. And, at a regional summit in Uzbekistan on Friday, Mr. Putin said Russia was committed to its “special military operation,” despite Russian losses in the northeast and Ukraine’s offensive in the south, near the port city of Kherson.\n\nFurthermore, Ukrainian forces now control all of their territory west of the Oskil River in eastern Ukraine, the official said, and have liberated more than 300 settlements in Kharkiv Province.\n\nWith Ukrainian troops continuing to take back territory from Russian forces, and the war nearly seven months old, the Pentagon is discussing how best to support Kyiv for a long-term war. Part of that, the official said, includes transitioning Ukraine away from their Soviet-era weaponry and replacing them with those used by NATO and other Western militaries.\n\nWhile the United States and other nations have provided Ukraine with Soviet-era tanks, the Pentagon signaled an openness to transferring Western main battle tanks to Kyiv as well.\n\n“Armor is a really important capability area for the Ukrainians,” the official said. “We recognize that there will be a day when they may want to transition — and may need to transition — to NATO-compatible models.”\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked Western allies for more equipment and ammunition, saying the counteroffensive underway is dependent on getting more. He alluded to the need to speed up aid deliveries in his nightly address on Monday.\n\n“Pace is very important now,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We speak about this honestly. The pace of providing aid to Ukraine should correspond to the pace of our movement.”\n\nAnd despite its problems with manpower and organization, Russia still has a significant advantage over Ukraine in supplies and ammunition.\n\n“Tanks are absolutely on the table along with other areas,” said the American defense official. “We’re looking at the entirety of the Ukrainian armed forces and considering for the future what capabilities they will need and how the U.S. and our allies will be able to support Ukraine in building out those capabilities.”\n\n“In terms of the immediate fight, the tanks that are available that could be provided very quickly with little to no training are Soviet-type tanks, but we are certainly open to other options provided that the training, maintenance and the sustainment can be taken care of.”"
