    "Germany Considers Price Caps As Energy Crisis Worsens": "Germany looks to cap the prices of electricity and natural gas to help households and businesses reel from the soaring energy prices, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, quoting German government officials.\n\nAccording to the Journal's sources, the plan for price caps in Europe’s biggest economy could become official in the coming weeks if the EU doesn’t agree on a price cap for the entire bloc.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, in the UK, for example, there is a price cap on energy bills that energy providers can charge to customers. The new UK has just announced that it would cap the annual energy bills for households at $2,700 (£2,500) for two years.\n\nUnlike the UK cap on prices, and a similar measure introduced in France, the cap in Germany would rather impose a levy on electricity-generating firms that charge more than a certain amount, yet to be determined, the Journal’s sources say. The money collected from the levy on producers would be later distributed to the operators providing energy to the end users, which would allow for lower power prices for end users.\n\nMany energy-intensive industries and companies in Germany are already feeling the pinch from the soaring natural gas and electricity prices. Some have curtailed production or stopped entire production lines, many others plan to do so.\n\nSigns are mounting that the German economy is slipping into recession, which will deepen as we head into the winter months amid the ongoing natural gas and energy crisis, Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, said in its monthly report last week.\n\nAlso last week, the German government, energy giant Uniper, and Uniper’s majority shareholder, Finland-based firm Fortum, signed a deal under which Germany would nationalize its largest gas importer, in a move aimed at preventing a collapse of the German energy and gas suppliers.\n\nBy Michael Kern for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

    "Lindner raises doubts on Germany’s gas levy": "German Finance Minister Christian Lindner questioned whether the gas levy would lead to lower energy prices for consumers | John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner has questioned if efforts to help the country's energy companies tackle soaring energy costs would lead to lower energy prices for local consumers.\n\nSpeaking to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Lindner, the head of the country's liberal Free Democratic Party, said the so-called gas levy, the plan to charge Germans a fee to compensate energy companies for skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because of the war in Ukraine, may not be the best way to handle the global energy crisis.\n\n\"We have a gas levy that increases the price,\" Lindner said in an interview published on Sunday. \"But we need a gas price brake that lowers the price.\"\n\nThe gas levy, which is due to come into force on October 1, became a political hot potato between members of Germany's coalition government as soon as it was first proposed by Robert Habeck, the country's energy minister and member of the Green party.\n\nDespite rising cost-of-living concerns for average German voters, the levy was designed to help profit-making energy companies, some of which have recorded blockbuster income amid rising global prices for natural gas. Estimates suggest an average German four-person household will pay €480 more a year to cover the planned levy.\n\nLindner raised concerns about whether such a surcharge would have the designed effect of helping to support those energy companies, often smaller outfits, that were struggling to pay rapidly increasing wholesale energy prices.\n\n\"It's less a question of law when it comes to the gas levy, but more and more of a question of economic reasoning,\" Lindner said. \"A gas price brake must help everyone in the economy quickly.\"",
    "Germany takes baby from gay foster parents after Türkiye intervenes": "A Turkish-German family hailed Germany's decision to scrap the decision for adoption of their baby by gay parents after Türkiye intervened in the case following the family's opposition.\n\nIn May, the 10-month-old boy was handed over to Jugendamt, the German child welfare office, on the grounds that the mother, allegedly suffering from psychological problems was unfit for parenting and the infant was underdeveloped. Despite parents’ protest, the office did not retract the decision and the case was widely covered in Turkish media. The family, who lives in Duisburg, has said their child was given to a gay couple living near Cologne. They claimed that it was not an isolated case and that many other Turkish families had the same problem. A.K., the mother, has claimed she was allowed to see her son only once a month and called upon Turkish authorities to help her.\n\nA.K. said after the decision that Jugendamt apparently “felt the pressure” after media coverage of her case. “(Türkiye’s) Family and Social Policy attache’s office in Düsseldorf found us a lawyer and Minister of Family and Social Policy Derya Yanık personally took interest in the case,” she said, expressing her gratitude. A.K. stated that she also received many messages of support on social media. “We hope Jugendamt does not make another mistake and places my son at least with a Turkish family so he would not be deprived of the opportunity to learn Turkish culture and language,” she said.\n\nTurkish Ministry of Family and Social Policy had suggested two Turkish volunteer foster parents for E. earlier. The ministry has said in a recent statement that they hoped their request would be considered. The ministry also said that they attached importance that host countries considered lifestyle choices based on cultural and moral norms in such cases while assessing the foster care process for Turkish children.\n\nThe ministry, whose work was largely confined to Türkiye, had expanded its activities abroad in recent years. It seeks to promote the adoption of Turkish children in expat communities abroad by Turkish foster parents. Minister Derya Yanık has recently announced that some 200 Turkish children have been returned to their biological parents since 2015 in Germany thanks to the work of their attache offices in the European countries. First lady Emine Erdoğan also spearheads efforts to promote the foster parenting process among Turkish families abroad. Her campaign has seen 599 families volunteering to be foster parents in European countries.\n\nIn force since 1924, the Jugendamt was established to protect children but has become notorious for targeting the children of immigrant families. It gets paid by the German state according to the number of children it takes care of, and some foster parents manipulate childcare issues for their own economic interests. Such factors undermine the operation of the institution, which was originally founded with goodwill. Immigrant families in the country are scared to take their children to the hospital or psychologists because sharing their problems may mean they will inform the Jugendamt, which takes the custody of the children from their families. For instance, the child of a Turkish family with the surname of Toprak was forcibly taken when they took him to a hospital after he had chips stuck in his throat, while other families’ children were taken away because they allegedly spoiled their children and showed excessive attention. Germany currently hosts the largest number of Turkish immigrants, mostly descendants of \"guest workers.\"",
    "Germany’s Government Continues To Lock People Up For Being Extremely Online": "Germany’s Government Continues To Lock People Up For Being Extremely Online\n\nfrom the watch-your-fingers,-folks dept\n\nGermany’s uncomfortable relationship with free speech continues. The country has always been sensitive about certain subjects (rhymes with Bitler and, um, Yahtzee), resulting in laws that suppress speech referring to these subjects, apparently in hopes of preventing a Fourth Reich from taking hold.\n\nBut the censorship of speech extends far beyond the lingering aftereffects of Germany’s supremely troubled past. The government has passed laws outlawing speech with the vaguest of contours, like “hate speech” and “fake news.” And it has swung a pretty powerful hammer to ensure cooperation, stripping away intermediary immunity to hold platforms directly accountable for user-generated content. You know, like a nation run by authoritarians, except ones that enact penalties for references to a certain former authoritarian.\n\nGermany may wish to escape its abusive past. But its speech-related laws encourage abuse by powerful people. Allow this timeline to run without interruption long enough, and you’re staring down the barrel of history.\n\nMaybe it won’t be the second coming of national socialism. But it might just be the conversion of Germany into something resembling the USSR farm team East Germany was until the fall of the Berlin Wall. As this New York Times report details, people are being arrested for being careless online — something that suggests far too many local politicians desire a Stasi of their own.\n\nWhen the police pounded the door before dawn at a home in northwest Germany, a bleary-eyed young man in his boxer shorts answered. The officers asked for his father, who was at work. They told him that his 51-year-old father was accused of violating laws against online hate speech, insults and misinformation. He had shared an image on Facebook with an inflammatory statement about immigration falsely attributed to a German politician. “Just because someone rapes, robs or is a serious criminal is not a reason for deportation,” the fake remark said. The police then scoured the home for about 30 minutes, seizing a laptop and tablet as evidence, prosecutors said.\n\nIf the police already had copies of the posting, it doesn’t make much sense for them to search a home and seize devices. But that’s what they do. And, according to the New York Times article, this happens nearly one hundred times a day all over the nation, day after day after day.\n\nNormally, when someone suggests efforts like these produce a chilling effect, governments issue statements affirming support for free speech and obliquely suggest the original commenter is misinformed or misinterpreting these actions. Not so with Germany. The chilling effect is the entire point — something the government freely admits.\n\nGerman authorities have brought charges for insults, threats and harassment. The police have raided homes, confiscated electronics and brought people in for questioning. Judges have enforced fines worth thousands of dollars each and, in some cases, sent offenders to jail. The threat of prosecution, they believe, will not eradicate hate online, but push some of the worst behavior back into the shadows.\n\nThis means the earlier efforts — those forcing social media platforms to immediately and proactively remove anything the German government might find offensive — haven’t worked as well as politicians hoped. It was an impossible demand, one made by people who don’t believe anything is impossible if it’s backed by a government mandate and (most importantly) entirely the responsibility of other people.\n\nSince the government can’t make social media companies perform the impossible, prosecutors have decided to go after internet users, who are far easier to threaten, intimidate, and jail into silence. Chilling is what we do, say prosecutors, citing the supposed success similar tactics have had in the fight against online piracy(!):\n\nDaniel Holznagel, a former Justice Ministry official who helped draft the internet enforcement laws passed in 2017, compared the crackdown to going after copyright violators. He said people stopped illegally downloading music and movies as much after authorities began issuing fines and legal warnings. “You can’t prosecute everyone, but it will have a big effect if you show that prosecution is possible,” said Mr. Holznagel, who is now a judge.\n\nSince it’s almost impossible to tell what will trigger police action and prosecution, German citizens are likely engaging in self-censorship regularly. Sarcasm, irony, parody, shitposting… all of this is under scrutiny, since it’s apparent the government isn’t capable of performing anything but a straightforward reading of user-generate content. It would be almost comical if it weren’t for the police raids, prosecutions, device seizures, and jail time.\n\nNo national figures exist on the total number of people charged with online speech-related crimes. But in a review of German state records, The New York Times found more than 8,500 cases. Overall, more than 1,000 people have been charged or punished since 2018, a figure many experts said is probably much higher.\n\nThis effort siphons resources from law enforcement agencies asked to police more serious criminal acts — the kind that result in actual victims who can show actual harm, rather than the theoretical harm posed by posts that fall outside of the boundaries set by the German government’s escalating desire to regulate speech.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean local police aren’t welcoming the new duties. Some seem to particularly relish literally policing the internet.\n\nAuthorities in Lower Saxony raid homes up to multiple times per month, sometimes with a local television crew in tow.\n\nInternet use is under constant surveillance. This always-on monitoring provides law enforcement with targets. Arrestees who refuse to submit to device searches aren’t slowing down investigators. Electronics are sent to crime labs and subjected to forensic searches by Cellebrite devices. Millions of dollars fund these efforts… and for what?\n\nSwen Weiland, a software developer turned internet hate speech investigator, is in charge of unmasking people behind anonymous accounts. He hunts for clues about where a person lives and works, and connections to friends and family. After an unknown Twitter user compared Covid restrictions to the Holocaust, he used an online registry of licensed architects to help identify the culprit as a middle-aged woman. “I try to find out what they do in their normal life,” Mr. Weiland said. “If I find where they live or their relatives then I can get the real person. The internet does not forget.”\n\nThat’s what the government is going after. Germany is in the business of punishing stupidity. But only certain forms of stupidity. Far more threatening posts are ignored by law enforcement. An activist interviewed by the NYT said she was doxxed and threatened by online commenters. When she took this info to law enforcement, officers responded by giving her a brochure about online hate and telling nothing that was said broke any laws. Doxxing is ok. Threats are ok. Making an extremely terrible analogy? A criminal offense.\n\nSo is this:\n\nLast year, Andy Grote, a city senator responsible for public safety and the police in Hamburg, broke the local social distancing rules — which he was in charge of enforcing — by hosting a small election party in a downtown bar. After Mr. Grote later made remarks admonishing others for hosting parties during the pandemic, a Twitter user wrote: “Du bist so 1 Pimmel” (“You are such a penis”). Three months later, six police officers raided the house of the man who had posted the insult, looking for his electronic devices.\n\nWhile it’s somewhat understandable that speech restrictions have been put in place in hopes of preventing history from repeating, the government’s desire to turn ignorance into criminal activity is hugely problematic. Laws like this are never taken off the books. They either linger forever or are subjected to endless expansions, allowing the government to start serving its own interests rather than those it imagines the general public values. There’s no impending slippery slope here. Germany is already headed down it.\n\nFiled Under: chilling effects, content moderation, fake news, free speech, germany, hate speech, insults, piracy, surveillance\n\n",
    "Germany sued over air pollution levels": "German citizens are suing their government over its failure to bring down air pollution levels to limits recommended by the world's leading scientists.\n\nThe seven claimants, supported by environmental organisations ClientEarth and Deutsche Umwelthilfe [German Environment Help], last week launched the case in the Federal Administrative Court — Germany's highest court.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThey argue German law breaches their fundamental rights, since it allows air-pollution levels to be four to five times higher than those the World Health Organization (WHO) deems acceptable.\n\n\"Air pollution may not often be named the official cause of death, but it claims lives — and causes long-term diseases, including cancer, heart problems, shortness of breath and strokes,\" said one of the claimants from Munich, who suffers from asthma.\n\n\"I am now suing for my right to breathe clean and healthy air.\"\n\nThe claimants all come from the country's four most-polluted cities: Berlin, Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt.\n\nWhile the EU set legally-binding air quality standards to tackle air pollution in 2015, the WHO lowered its levels in 2021 — prompting campaigners to urge the EU to align its legislation with science.\n\nThe EU is currently reviewing its main air-quality law, with a proposal expected to come in October.\n\nBut its implementation will not be immediate, meaning EU member states will not be obliged to comply with more strict thresholds for several years.\n\nOver 90 percent of the EU's urban population is exposed to high levels of fine-particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone above those recommended by the WHO, according to the European Environment Agency.\n\nAnd it is estimated that reducing air pollution to WHO-recommended levels in the EU could prevent 51,213 premature deaths each year.\n\nThere are currently ongoing infringement procedures against 18 member states for failing to implement current EU air-quality rules — including referrals to the European Court of Justice against Romania, Greece, Malta, Italy, and Austria.\n\n\"What's needed here is simple — alignment of national air quality laws with the science laid out by the world's leading experts. This is the bare minimum our leaders should be doing to protect people,\" said Irmina Kotiuk, a lawyer from ClientEarth.\n\nIn the past, climate litigation has successfully led to a reduction in air pollution in Germany.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were reduced in several German cities where legal cases over air pollution had been undertaken by environmental groups.\n\nIn the EU, over 400,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of breathing toxic air.",
    "Russia and Germany to fall into recession as global economic outlooks darkens, OECD predicts": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring energy bills and record-breaking inflation have thrown the global economy into disarray, triggering an \"extended period of subdued growth,\" according to the latest forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nGermany, the EU's industrial powerhouse, is projected to fall into recession next year.\n\n\"The global growth outlook has darkened,\" the OECD said, in a report titled \"Paying the Price of War\"released on Monday morning.\n\nThe study paints a bleak picture of the world economy: business confidence, disposable incomes and household expenditure all plummet while the costs of fuels, food and transportation surge.\n\nInflation has become \"broad-based\" and will gradually ease throughout 2023, but still remain exceptionally high, as tighter financial conditions resulting from steep hikes in interest rates slowly yield results.\n\nFor Europe, the forecast is particularly gloomy in the event of a colder-than-usual winter: underground gas storage would be depleted and energy prices would soar, prompting shortages and industrial paralysis.\n\n\"This would push many countries into a full-year recession in 2023,\" the OECD says in the event of winter disruptions and enforced gas reductions.\n\nThe organisation also warns of the possibility that the sanctions against Russian oil, one of Moscow's top revenue sources, could prove \"more disruptive than anticipated.\"\n\nThe EU-wide embargo will take effect at the end of the year, taking about two million barrels per day of Russian crude and refined products off the market.\n\nIf Russia is unable to reroute these supplies to other regions, international prices will shoot up, adding even more pressure on the already-volatile energy supply chains.\n\n\"The global economy has lost momentum this year,\" the report notes. \"After bouncing back strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to a more normal economic situation appeared to be in prospect prior to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia and Germany head into recession\n\nOf all the countries analysed in the report, Russia is by far the worst-hit: the country, which has been hit by unprecedented Western sanctions, is projected to contract by 5.5% in 2022 and by 4.5% in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany will end this year with a 1.2% positive expansion but will decline by 0.7% next year. Recession fears are looming large over the country, which until early this year was a large consumer of Russian gas and is now scrambling to find alternative suppliers.\n\n\"The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying,\" Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said last week.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe other European economies included in the OECD's study fare slightly better. France, Italy and Spain will see modest growth rates in 2023, at 0.6%, 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, which means they could too fall into recession at one point but still end the year with moderate positive growth.\n\nThe eurozone will expand by 3.1% in 2022 and by a meagre 0.3% in 2023. Inflation will average 6.2% next year, over three times the 2% target desired by the European Central Bank.\n\nThese pessimistic estimations could deteriorate if the energy crisis takes a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Significant uncertainty surrounds the projections. More severe fuel shortages, especially for gas, could reduce growth in Europe by a further 1.25 percentage points in 2023,\" the OECD says.\n\nSpeaking before the European Parliament on Monday afternoon, ECB President Christine Lagarde also struck an ominous note and warned \"uncertainty remains high.\"\n\n\"The outlook is darkening,\" she told MEPs. \"We expect activity to slow substantially in the coming quarters.\"\n\nBeyond the bloc, the OECD expects the United States to grow by 0.5% next year, while the United Kingdom will post a 0% rate, meaning it will neither expand nor contract.\n\nJapan, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico will all see limited rates, below the 2% mark.\n\nChina, a driving engine of the world economy that is pursuing a strict zero-Covid policy, will expand by 3.2% in 2022 and then speed up to 4.7% in 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia appears to enjoy an economic boom, \"buoyed by high energy prices.\" The oil-rich country is estimated to swell by almost 10% this year and 6% next year.\n\nOverall, the world economy will grow by 3% in 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, a downward revision compared to the previous OECD estimate.",
    "Putin is mobilizing. Germany and France are unlikely to step up": "John R. Deni is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute and a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He’s the author of “Coalition of the unWilling and unAble.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s recent decision to partially mobilize Russian reservists represents a significant escalation in his war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, this could inject as many as 300,000 additional Russian troops into the Kremlin’s war effort — and just as Ukraine has achieved some battlefield success. Increased Western assistance is now vital for Kyiv to leverage and expand its gains and build up defensive positions, before additional Russian forces enter the fight. But not all Western powers have been pulling their weight in this regard — especially Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe Franco-German engine has powered the European Union for over 70 years. Today, however, that engine has stalled in the face of the greatest challenge confronting European security since the end of World War II. The Continent’s most powerful economy and its most powerful military are failing to meet the moment. And, unfortunately, odds that either will change course within the timeframe necessary to help Kyiv achieve its objectives are low.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top political leaders in both France and Germany appeared to recognize the scale of the crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately highlighted the damage Russia had done to European peace and stability, noting that in its response, the West would “be without weakness” in the military, economic, and energy domains. Meanwhile, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Putin had destroyed the European security architecture, arguing that the Russian invasion had marked a turning point, and it was now time to support Ukraine to “the best of our ability.”\n\nSince those early days, though, the actions of Europe’s political dynamic duo have failed to match their own rhetoric. Germany has been dragging its feet on sending the kinds of military equipment other allies have been providing Ukraine for months. After promising to deliver multiple launch rocket systems, self-propelled howitzers and air defense systems, the glacial pace of delivery has cast doubt on Berlin’s commitment. Moreover, Germany’s sheer unwillingness to send heavy armored forces — like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — has prompted criticism from Ukrainian leaders, who accuse Berlin of backtracking.\n\nMeanwhile, France has been willfully curtailing its assistance in hopes of playing the role of neutral arbiter when the shooting stops. Macron irreparably damaged his claim to European leadership when he called on Ukraine to avoid humiliating Putin, and from an operational perspective, while the country has provided offensive weapons to Ukraine, it has reportedly sent less than even Germany, and trained an extraordinarily small number of Ukrainian troops compared to others like the United Kingdom.\n\nClearly, these leading European countries have both failed to rise to the occasion — but for two very different reasons.\n\nFor over a half century, Germany has pursued a cooperative change-through-trade approach to Russia. Now, having finally woken up to Moscow’s zero-sum approach — and its corresponding disdain for cooperation with the West — Berlin is attempting to reverse its long-standing strategy. But change is never easy, especially in Germany, so the effort to overcome entrenched, conventional national security wisdom goes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFor France, however, the dynamic in question isn’t change but the opposite — status quo.\n\nResidual illusions of French grandeur lie at the heart of Macron’s efforts to walk an elusive middle ground between the West and Russia. Across much of the Continent, France’s leading role in pursing European “strategic autonomy” in recent years has been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to resuscitate French greatness and promote the country’s own interests. However, in trying to position France as a practically minded, neutral arbiter between Ukraine and Russia, Macron has instead undermined Paris’s reputation as a defender of Western values and interests.\n\nUnfortunately, as this French pursuit of greatness continues to endure and 50 years of German foreign policy won’t be changed overnight, neither of these European powers is likely to play a leading role in helping Ukraine in the short run. This is particularly problematic at the moment, as Kyiv is eager to keep up the momentum after the serious battlefield success realized by its forces.\n\nAlthough the news from the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has been remarkably positive for Kyiv in recent days, there are still many reasons to think Russia is far from being knocked out of the conflict.\n\nFor one thing, Ukraine’s progress in the south — where it had begun shifting resources from Kharkiv — remains slow and arduous. Additionally, Moscow retains the ability to conduct precision long-range strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Most importantly, though, Russia still holds both qualitative and quantitative military advantages over Ukraine in terms of both manpower and equipment.\n\nFor all these reasons — especially given Putin’s partial mobilization — the war will most likely continue to unfold over the coming months, if not years. Ukraine is unlikely to remain in the fight without significant long-term Western aid, precision weaponry in particular, which they have already been using to good effect, targeting Russian supply lines and logistics. But they will need more — particularly if outmatched in troop numbers later this year.\n\nThe United States, the U.K., Poland, and other allies are all currently providing substantial training, equipment, expertise and intelligence. And in response to Putin’s mobilization, both France and Germany have an opportunity to do so as well — but whether and when they will fulfill their potential remains to be seen.",

    "Germany must shake off its habit of finding excuses for inaction": "A German decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin, Constanze Stelzenmüller writes. This article originally appeared in the Financial Times .\n\nLife: it’s unfair. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht gave a long-prepared speech in Berlin on Monday, in which she laid out her thinking on strategy. She asserted confidently that Germany was destined by “our size, our geographical location, our economic power, in short our heft” to be a “leading power in Europe, whether we like it or not.”\n\nThe strategic adversaries uppermost in Lambrecht’s mind are, however, at home. She is striving to assert her authority at a time when the Foreign Ministry is writing Germany’s first ever national security strategy. It does not help that leaders of her Social Democratic Party (SPD)’s parliamentary group are vocal skeptics of what some pointedly refer to as “chic bellicism,” or a fashionable taste for war.\n\nLambrecht’s task is to remind them forcefully that the Zeitenwende, or turning point, promised by SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a landmark speech after Russia’s attack on Ukraine needs to be sustained and funded. Especially for the armed forces.\n\nUnfortunately, her audience — including Germany’s allies — was interested in a different question: how Berlin’s destiny to lead relates to Ukraine’s urgent requests for more heavy weapons. Contrary to the fears of many — and the hopes of some — across the west, Kyiv’s armed forces have achieved an astonishing rout of the invaders, regaining more territory in a week than Russia captured in five months.\n\nCaution remains warranted. But for the first time, a Russian defeat appears possible if Ukraine can press its advantage across the long frontline. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, this is impossible without armored infantry carriers and battle tanks.\n\nLambrecht, echoing Scholz, parried that no other ally had delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks; that this would deprive NATO allies of German protection; and that Germany would never “go it alone.” Also, such weapons deliveries would represent an “escalation” — meaning Russian President Vladimir Putin could then consider Germany a direct participant in the conflict. This is the brightest of red lines for Scholz’s three-party ruling coalition.\n\nCue yet another fierce Berlin brouhaha over heavy weapons deliveries. Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Scholz’s Greens coalition partner, tweeted that “the time for hesitancy is over.” Parliamentary defense committee chair Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the Free Democrats, the third coalition partner and herself something of a lethal weapon, demanded immediate deliveries of German Marder infantry carriers and Leopard 2 tanks.\n\nMore unusually, the U.S. Embassy in Berlin waded in with a three-part tweet thread: the U.S. appreciates German contributions; allies should support Ukraine “as much as possible”; each country is free to decide on the manner of its support (this last part blew up a smokescreen deployed for months by the German government).\n\nTranslated from diplo-speak: love you, Berlin, but please, please grow a pair and stop pretending we’re telling you what to do.\n\nIn truth, the government’s position is untenable. Other allies have sent armored infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. Some have sent tanks, mostly modernized Soviet-era versions. The 24 Gepard armorred air defense systems and 10 Panzerhaubitze 2,000 howitzers Berlin has sent to Ukraine, plus much other kit, have, by Kyiv’s admission, made a real difference in its counteroffensive. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is asking allies to prioritize deliveries to Ukraine. As for red lines, the Russian ambassador opines they were crossed a while ago.\n\nThe only serious concern about Leopard 2 tanks is that they are sophisticated machines which would require three or four months of training. But the Ukrainians are fast learners and Russia still occupies a fifth of their territory. Deciding to send the tanks now would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin that Germany won’t be intimidated.\n\nDuring the Cold War, leaders of a partly sovereign West Germany intoned a trinity of compelling reasons (Zwang) why they absolutely could not do something: rules, allies, and facts (Normzwang, Bündniszwang, and Sachzwang). Usually, it meant they absolutely didn’t want to.\n\nMore than 30 years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the regaining of full sovereignty, it’s a disingenuous habit Germany needs to shake off. It’s certainly unworthy of a country that aspires to leadership in Europe.",
    "Germany loses another glacier as warm temps melt Alpine ice": "Germany lost one of its few remaining glaciers this summer as exceedingly warm weather ate away Alpine ice at a faster pace than feared, a scientific report released on Monday showed.\n\nThe Bavarian Academy of Sciences said the state's Southern Schneeferner had lost its official status as a glacier due to rapid melting of its once sprawling ice sheet.\n\n\"The Schneeferner's ice thickness shrank significantly in large swathes and in most places no longer measures even 2 meters (6.5 feet),\" the academy said in its latest findings.\n\nIt said even the thickest spot was now diminished to less than 6 meters compared to around 10 meters in 2018. The surface area of the glacier halved during the same period to about one hectare.\n\n\"That leads us to conclude that the remaining ice will completely melt away in the next one to two years,\" the academy said.\n\nIt said that the dramatic shrinkage meant that the periodic measurements carried out by the academy since 1892 would now be suspended.\n\nThe loss means Germany has only four remaining glaciers: Northern Schneeferner and Hoellentalferner on its highest mountain, the Zugspitze, and Blaueis and Watzmann in the Berchtesgaden Alps.\n\nRapid glacier melt in the Alps and elsewhere, which experts say is being driven by climate change, has been increasingly closely monitored since the early 2000s.\n\nBavaria's Environment Ministry said last year in a bombshell report that Germany could lose its last glaciers within the decade as climate change gathered pace.\n\nScientists had previously estimated the glaciers would be around until the middle of the century.\n\nA global study released in April 2021 found nearly all the world's glaciers are losing mass at an ever-increasing pace, contributing to more than a fifth of global sea level rise this century.",
    "With drills and fighter jets, German defense minister seeks stronger Indo-Pacific ties": "Building on the monthslong dispatch of a frigate to the Indo-Pacific last year, Germany will on Wednesday deploy three fighter jets to Japan. But that is just the start, according to German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht, with more military exchanges in the planning for next year and beyond as Berlin seeks a continuous and long-term security commitment to the region.\n\n“Security concerns everyone, no country can afford to just watch from the sidelines,” Lambrecht said in an interview with The Japan Times, pointing to how the rules-based international order is increasingly being challenged in the Indo-Pacific.",
    "How will Germany line up at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022?": "Germany go in search of equalling five-time world champions Brazil as record FIFA World Cup winners when they land in Qatar this winter, but who will be taking the field when their campaign gets underway and how will Hansi Flick be setting out his stall?\n\nFollowing a two-year spell at Bayern Munich in which Flick collected two Bundesliga titles, DFB Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Champions League trophies, the 57-year-old took his country's reins in August last year.\n\nTypically, of a coach who led Bayern to an unprecedented sextuple, Flick took to international duty in fine fashion.\n\nPredecessor Joachim Löw finished his tenure with two losses, a defeat and just one win as Germany exited the UEFA Euro 2020 championships at the last-16 stage to old foes England.\n\nOne of Flick's first decisions was to immediately reinstate Thomas Müller to his side and the fresh face of a new coach saw the team hoover up eight successive victories. Now with 14 games under their belt, the former shopkeeper's side still boast an impressive run of results (W9, D4, L1) and they again look a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWatch: Tireless Thomas Müller\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that Flick served as Löw's assistant when Germany claimed a fourth world title in 2014.\n\nSince taking the big job, the national team have scored in 13 of those 14 matches and hit four or more goals on six occasions, including a 9-0 demolition of Liechtenstein as Germany made light work of qualification for Qatar.\n\nOption 1\n\nAs was the case during his spell in the Bayern hotseat, Flick has settled on a 4-3-2-1 formation for all but one of his games in charge, instead opting for a 3-4-2-1 in the 1-1 draw with England in June.\n\nInterestingly, versatile defender Thilo Kehrer has started most frequently under Flick, with the former Schalke man beginning on the right and left of Germany's defence four times apiece and at centre-half in his three other starts.\n\nHe's clearly a player trusted by his coach and his versatility will be a major asset in tournament football, but Kehrer is most likely to start from the bench when Germany are at full strength.\n\n- /\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?

On the opposite flank, Leipzig left-back David Raum is in pole position ahead of Robin Gosens and Christian Günter.\n\nIn front of them, Kimmich has been partnered in equal amounts by Leon Goretzka and Ilkay Gündogan, and it appears a straight shootout between the latter two as to who lines up alongside Bayern's No. 6.\n\nFlick's tenure so far has suggested that Müller and Sane are fairly certain of starting berths, but there is such fierce competition for places that the attacking spots remain up in the air.\n\nFormer Bayer Leverkusen starlet Kai Havertz hasn't yet nailed down a spot of his own but his ability to play anywhere in attack, coupled with the fact he is naturally left-footed, could help his cause.\n\nWatch: The best of Manuel Neuer\n\nSerge Gnabry scored four times in Flick's first four matches but has started just two of Germany's last nine.\n\nConsidering Gnabry's previous success under Flick for club and country, as well as his record of a goal approximately every 125 minutes in international football, and his more natural ability to operate from the flanks, you would imagine he and Sane would line-up either side of Müller in an all-Bayern supporting cast.\n\nIf fellow Bayern attacker Jamal Musiala continues his fine early season form, however, he could well get the nod from Flick, although Gnabry’s greater experience is likely to be valued highly at the World Cup, with Musiala set for a role as an impact substitute.\n\nGnabry has also operated through the middle for his country, but it looks far more likely that Werner and Havertz will vie for the opportunity to lead the line. On current evidence, Werner's movement off the ball and lighting pace look the better fit.\n\nWatch: Timo Werner - RB Leipzig take II\n\nOption 2\n\nGermany's strength in depth is remarkable, with world-class options in reserve at every station on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona custodian Marc-Andre ter Stegen has filled in for Neuer when the captain hasn't been present, and the long-standing back-up will surely be next in the pecking order in Qatar, his shot-stopping qualities and ability with the ball at his feet making him a reliable alternative.\n\nWith Hofmann having elbowed his way into the starting XI at right-back, West Ham’s Kehrer is next in line on the right of defence. The sheer number of times he has been picked by Flick indicating a place on the plane is virtually assured.\n\nFlick named Süle as a guaranteed starter against England in the Nations League at the end of September in Rüdiger’s absence, indicating that he will be among the first XI at the World Cup. If the 57-year-old’s tenure at Bayern is anything to go by, he likes to keep a settled team and avoid too much rotation in terms of personnel and formation, so a Rüdiger-Süle axis looks to be Germany’s centre-back duo in November.\n\n- /\n\nConsequently, Schlotterbeck is first in line as a replacement, alongside Freiburg’s Matthias Ginter, whom Flick recently praised for being “in very good shape”. At left-back, Gosens looks slightly ahead of Günter for the first reserve berth, although that could all change over the coming weeks with Gosens’ playing time limited at Inter, while Günter continues to shine for Freiburg in the Bundesliga and Europa League.\n\nGoretzka has struggled with injury in the early part of 2022/23 but is a high-calibre alternative for central midfield, with Wolfsburg’s Maximilian Arnold a reliable option – and a left-footer to boot, although he is slightly more defensive-minded.\n\nOnce again it is in the attacking third that Flick is really spoiled for choice. He singled out Musiala for praise ahead of the Nations League tie with England, hailing the 19-year-old’s development over the last couple of years.\n\n“From the first time he trained with the first team at Bayern you could see how talented he was,” the tactician said. “His progress has been great and he is brilliant in tight spaces. He’s got a good feeling for space and is a really good dribbler. He’s very good defensively and wins a lot of balls for us. I’m happy he plays for Germany.”\n\nWatch: All of Musiala's Bundesliga goals so far in 2022/23\n\nMusiala has usually been the first attacking substitute under Flick, although Kai Havertz and Marco Reus will likely have something to say about that in Qatar. The latter, in particular, will be raring to go as he is currently on the sidelines for a few weeks with an injury sustained against Schalke on Matchday 7. And we all remember how he missed the 2014 triumph due to an injury right before heading to Brazil.\n\nLukas Nmecha offers a different threat to Werner up front. Whereas the Leipzig forward is a blur of pace and movement, his Wolfsburg counterpart brings greater physicality at 6’1” and is equally lethal with either foot: last season he scored three with his left, three with his right and two headers for the Wolves.\n\nOption 3\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Flick has only employed a 3-4-2-1 formation once in his 14 games at the helm, but he is a pragmatist unafraid to change if necessary.\n\nIn this variation, Schlotterbeck’s composure in possession and ability to play accurate, raking diagonal balls from the back would fast-track him into the starting XI. Hofmann and Raum would be given license to explore the final third of the pitch, albeit with the brief to stay wide and drag deep-lying opposition defenders out of position in the absence of a more traditional winger like Sane or Gnabry.\n\nGündogan would play higher up than Kimmich to overload the centre alongside Müller and Musiala, who probe on the edge of the area looking for gaps to exploit Werner’s speed.\n\n- /\n\nOption 4\n\nAll of which leaves us with a purely hypothetical fourth option. Injuries to any of the above would open the door to a number of squad regulars, who could form an imposing side in their own right.\n\nKevin Trapp’s star rose in the wake of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Europa League triumph in May, Lukas Klostermann and Jonathan Tah have plenty of experience at the highest level for Leipzig and Leverkusen respectively, while former Bochum defender Armel Bella-Kotchap has impressed since his summer move to Southampton and recently received his first senior call-up.\n\nFurther forward in central midfield, Florian Neuhaus and Anton Stach are experienced Bundesliga pros, if slightly green at international level, while the likes of Julian Brandt, Julian Draxler and Karim Adeyemi would normally be the first names on the teamsheet in almost any other national side.\n\n- /\n\nFor Flick the only remaining question would be who to take as a third striker? Niclas Füllkrug has been consistently good for Werder Bremen over the past 18 months and is currently the leading German scorer in the Bundesliga. His aerial threat should not be overlooked, particularly if the side are chasing the game late on.\n\nIt is perhaps a coin toss between him and Dortmund teenager Youssoufa Moukoko. While still raw, he has pace to burn and former BVB teammate Erling Haaland once even claimed he was better than him at the same age. He would be familiar with the Dortmund contingent already in the squad but a handy wildcard to have nonetheless: attacking players with the ability to produce a moment of magic from nothing are highly prized commodities.",
    "Striking health care workers in Germany: “Privatization was a big mistake!”": "A 24-hour warning strike Tuesday at the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg (UKGM) has once again exposed the disastrous working conditions in Germany’s nursing profession. And this is not their first strike. In recent weeks, both nursing staff and clinic employees have struck four times at UKGM, causing significant cancellation of treatments and operations.\n\nIn Germany’s first privatized university hospital, the more than 9,000 employees are not only fighting against staff shortages, overwork and poor pay, but also against the threat that entire departments will be outsourced to subsidiaries and subcontractors and that apprentice nurses at the hospitals will no longer be taken on as staff after their training.\n\nHealth care staff from Marburg at the rally in Wiesbaden, September 21, 2022 (Photo WSWS)\n\nThe Asklepios group, which took over UKGM owner Rhön-Klinikum AG two years ago, is known for the rudest outsourcing and wage slashing at its clinics. The founder and main shareholder of Asklepios is multibillionaire Bernard Grosse Broermann, who in addition to other clinics, rehabilitation centers, etc., owns, among other real estate, a luxury hotel chain.\n\nRhön-Asklepios can rely on the cooperation of the state government in Hesse. In 2006, the government merged Justus Liebig University Hospital Giessen with Philipps University Hospital Marburg and then sold it to the Rhön Group. Since the takeover by Asklepios, the government has bound itself to participate in investments of up to half a billion euros in UKGM over the next 10 years.\n\nIn May, however, the Group unexpectedly terminated the corresponding “letter of intent” when it became clear that the war in Ukraine would drive up the costs of energy and new buildings. The state government immediately gave its assurance that it would share the additional financial burden. They would be “taken seriously” and “communal solutions would be found,” promised Science Minister Angela Dorn (Green Party).\n\nNevertheless, Rhön-Asklepios has refused to make any tangible promises regarding jobs, wages and the hiring of trainees. The 2017 collective employment agreement, which includes a complete ban on outsourcing and protection against dismissal, expires at the end of the year.\n\nIt is in this situation that the coalition government in Berlin is pushing ahead with its highly risky war policy. The German government is supplying Ukraine with ever more devastating weaponry in the fight against Russia, setting up a €100 billion “special fund,” not for care, but for the Bundeswehr (armed forces). And the working population, already struggling with inflation, must bear the cost.\n\nHospital workers are thus right to be worried and alarmed. On Tuesday, they showed once again the fighting potential that nursing staff collectively have and the support they can build on in the population. A case in point: a petition for the renationalization of the two university hospitals has received over 18,000 signatures.\n\nBut the warning strike also showed that this fight can no longer be left to the responsible service sector union, Verdi. It is—together with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Left Party (Die Linke)—the biggest obstacle to achieving job security, the prevention of war and the pandemic and the protection of quality health care in the future.\n\nWhat is required are independent rank-and-file committees, such as already exist among teachers and auto workers in the US, Sri Lanka and also among auto workers and nurses in Germany. They have the task of taking the struggle of care workers into their own hands and linking it with the struggle of other care workers and laborers. They do not focus on the profits of the corporations, but are dedicated to the health, safety and future of the workers.\n\nVerdi is systematically isolating the struggle at UKGM from other labor struggles in the nursing sector. Within the last year, workers at several other university hospitals have gone on strike for weeks at a time. After Berlin’s Charité and Vivantes struck, the university hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia went on strike for 12 weeks before Verdi smothered the protest by selling the workers out. At Frankfurt University Hospital, too, employees are ready to strike because there is no relief whatsoever on the way. The same nursing crisis prevails everywhere.\n\nAnd the next wave of the coronavirus is already looming. The pandemic has brought previously existing grievances to a head and made them broadly visible. “It is not the strike, rather the normal state of affairs that endangers the patients,” a nurse in the Ruhr area succinctly put it. In Giessen in the fall and winter of 2020–2021, at the height of the pandemic wave, up to 110 COVID-19 sufferers were hospitalized at a given time, 45 of them in intensive care units, mostly on ventilators. The situation was similar in Marburg.\n\nSince then, the employees have been working at or near their limits for almost three years, many having quit their jobs. Some have become seriously ill themselves and some have died. While a new pandemic wave with devastating consequences is threatening in the fall, monkeypox is spreading worldwide and polio is returning.\n\nIn this inflamed situation, Verdi only ever stages useless whistle protests and 24-hour strikes. In association with the Left Party, the union is leading the workers around by the nose. On Tuesday, Verdi organized a rally in Wiesbaden in front of the state parliament building to give politicians a platform for their lies and excuses.\n\nNo more than 120 employees from the two clinics took part. Together with journalists, full-time trade unionists and politicians, they surrounded the stage on which the health experts from the Greens, the CDU, the SPD and the Left spoke one after another. Amid boos, Minister for Science and the Arts Angela Dorn (Greens), claimed that she, too, had “always been against privatization.”\n\nThe spokesman for the Hesse Left Party made it clear what goals are behind its campaign of “Return the hospital to public ownership!” He said, “Anyone who does not seriously consider this possibility is also a bit helpless when facing the corporation. We demand that there must be public money, state funds, only in exchange for public influence.”\n\nThat translates as: The demand is intended as leverage for the government’s negotiations with Rhön-Asklepios. It makes clear that the Left Party and Verdi do not themselves consider the “demand” for a return to public ownership—which they humbly address to the Christian Democrat-Green state government—to be in any way realistic.\n\nIn conversations with the WSWS, participants from the university hospitals made it clear that the workers are slowly losing patience with these protest and stalling tactics of the Verdi leaders, who themselves sit on all the supervisory boards.\n\nTwo operating room nurses from Marburg, employees of over 20 years, confirmed, “We have now reached the point where working conditions are worse than ever. … After privatization, we lost our Christmas bonus. But what is being expected of us today goes far beyond that, especially because the staffing situation is so strained.”\n\nA nurse responsible for training young nurses said, “We train a lot, we put our hearts and souls in it—clearly, since we are not getting extra time off for it. But the market is empty, and if conditions are that bad, young people won’t stay with us.” She added, “What I don’t understand is why we don’t actually strike together with the Frankfurt University Hospital?”\n\nFrido, who has worked in the transport service in Marburg for more than 11 years, said, “So far these warning strikes haven’t achieved anything at all. That’s my impression. The politicians don’t have any interest in talking to us. Privatization was a big mistake, but the government is not willing to correct the mistake.”\n\nHis colleague added, “We are at the bottom, the lowest link in the chain. The transport service has been continuously understaffed for a long time. Some of us are now doing the work of two, sometimes three people. But we are not compensated for it. Amongst ourselves, we’ve been talking about mileage pay, because some of us have health problems from constantly walking and being on our feet far too much. That has gotten a lot worse.”\n\nWhen asked about the suggestion to fight together with nurses in Frankfurt, the Ruhr area and Berlin, Frido said, “That would be better: you can only achieve something together. If we stay isolated, they won’t take us seriously at all. Why did we come here anyway?”\n\nThe World Socialist Web Site and SGP support the building of independent rank-and-file committees.

    "The politics of Germany’s Zeitenwende": "Germany’s Zeitenwende still has a long way to go Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nAn economic downturn could threaten support for reducing a trifecta of dependencies: energy imports from Russia, exports to China and the United States for security.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrive for a press conference on August 20, 2021, in Moscow. In 2021, the last of Ms. Merkel’s 16 years as chancellor, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia. In the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s use of energy as a political weapon, Berlin wants to drastically reduce this dependency. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Germany faces difficulties undoing the mistakes of the Merkel-Schroeder eras\n\nDefense spending, despite increases, remains short of NATO’s 2 percent goal\n\nHigher energy prices may weaken the public’s willingness to support Ukraine\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz’s speech in the Bundestag on February 27, 2022, was a watershed event in German history.\n\nMr. Scholz spoke of a “turning point” – Zeitenwende in German – triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world after that is no longer the same as the world before,” the German leader said. The statement gave the impression that Germany had suddenly become aware of its responsibilities. From now on, the nation of 83 million people, with Europe’s largest economy, would no longer entrust its security to the United States alone, its energy supply to Russia and its economic growth to exports to China.\n\nThis turnaround is primarily about German-Russian relations, the need to strengthen defense capability and deterrence, and secure energy supplies. Mr. Scholz announced he would provide the Bundeswehr with a credit-financed special fund of 100 billion euros. That is a significant amount, but to meet the expectation that NATO members invest at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in defense, an additional 25 billion euros would have to be spent annually, adjusted for inflation.\n\nMajor overhaul needed\n\nThe change required is enormous. In 1989, Germany invested 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product in national security, and by 2014, it was only 1.1 percent. Only since 2017 has the share risen again – in 2021, it was 1.5 percent. However, 41 percent of this was spent on personnel and pension entitlements. In France, 26.5 percent of defense funds go to equipment; in Germany, only 16.87 percent do. On the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bundeswehr Inspector Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, the highest-ranking officer of the German Army, said that the army had been severely weakened after years of austerity and is no more up to the task.\n\nUnder Mr. Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schroeder (1998-2005) and Angela Merkel (2005-2021), German foreign and security policy assumed that the nation was surrounded only by friends. This misjudgment led to a security policy recklessness that manifested itself in the neglect of the Bundeswehr. When the U.S., the United Kingdom, Poland and other NATO partners supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, the Bundeswehr was already in such a deplorable state that it could not comply with the Ukrainian government’s requests.\n\nHowever, national security is only one of the many ruins Ms. Merkel has left to the Scholz government. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat to cut off gas supplies would not be nearly as effective if Germany had not done everything it could to make itself economically blackmailable. Udo Di Fabio, a former judge with the Constitutional Court, delivered a devastating verdict on German energy policy:\n\nNo country with a keen sense of the mechanics of foreign power relations would have actively promoted or passively accepted such a massive energy dependence on Russia as Germany under chancellors Schroeder and Merkel. Criticism from the U.S. of projects such as Nord Stream 2 was politely forbidden, criticism from the Baltic states was not taken seriously. The Federal Republic pursued an almost romantic energy policy.\n\n× Facts & figures Germany’s 3 major vulnerabilities In trade, defense and energy, Germany has been highly reliant on three nations – China, the United States and Russia, respectively. But the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to overhaul Germany’s natural security strategy to reduce dependencies in each area. (Sources: International Energy Agency, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.) © GIS\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds\n\nReduced Russian oil and gas supplies are hitting Germany particularly hard today because rising global demand is accompanied by a politically engineered shortage that began long before the sanctions against Russia. Germany has been suffering from the consequences of self-inflicted economic wounds that have dominated energy policy since Ms. Merkel embraced the positions of the Greens.\n\nIn 2011, she used the destruction of four reactor units in Fukushima, caused by an earthquake and a tidal wave, as a pretext to order Germany’s withdrawal from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The nuclear and coal-fired power plants were gradually shut down, and domestic gas extraction by fracking was dispensed with, citing possible environmental damage.\n\nAnother concession with which the chancellor drew the left-wing opposition to her side was the opening of borders during the migration crisis of 2015-2016. Compared to the Greens, the party Die Linke and the left wing of the Social Democrats, she thus distinguished herself as an ally in the “fight against the right.” The informal party coalition on which the chancellor relied ranged from the left-wing fringe to the Greens to deep into the CDU, which lost its conservative and Christian-democratic brand core.\n\nRevising wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nToday, German parties have to say goodbye to a series of apparent certainties that have been questioned for more than 20 years only on the fringes of the party spectrum branded as populist. To revise wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nThe three parties in the Scholz government had helped shape Germany during these two decades. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens governed under Mr. Schroeder of the SPD from 1998 to 2005. Twice, from 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to 2021, the SPD belonged to a grand coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Ms. Merkel. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) had been Ms. Merkel’s junior partner in the black-yellow coalition from 2009 to 2013. All three parties of the “traffic light” coalition and the CDU, as the largest opposition party, played a part in the drama that turned the economically strong and politically self-confident Germany of Helmut Kohl (who served from 1982-1998) into a less reliable and crisis-prone partner for the Western world.\n\nThe conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.\n\nRectifying misguided policies\n\nThe responsibility for the mistakes and omissions of the Merkel era lies first and foremost with the CDU. Friedrich Merz, who emerged from the turmoil as Ms. Merkel’s successor as the new CDU chairman, had been the chancellor’s most prominent opponent within the party for years. So, it was not too difficult for him to support the turnaround that Mr. Scholz announced in the Bundestag. To prevent conflicts in the party, however, he has so far avoided criticizing the former chancellor, who had shaped the profile of the CDU and still enjoys significant support in it. To stand openly against them would be understood as a concession by the new CDU chairman to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the only party in the Bundestag to have opposed them on almost all issues.\n\nMs. Merkel’s popularity was evident in a poll conducted three weeks before the federal election in September 2021. In it, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of her job. That judgment reflects the economic upswing experienced by Germany during her chancellorship.\n\nRobust German growth had been the result of an exceptionally favorable combination of several factors, led by cheap energy from Russia. But other factors contributed to the boom times: an upswing in the global economy, particularly from rising demand in China, the wage restraint of German workers and the weak external value of the euro. The higher tax revenues financed the expansion of the welfare state, the energy transition and a climate policy that was executed without regard for the industry’s concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The International Monetary Fund revised downward its growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023. In May 2022, it estimated Germany’s 2022 growth at around 2 percent; by July, the projection was only 1.2 percent. Numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the tourism and gastronomy sectors, have had to close due to the Covid lockdowns. It is feared that many companies will not survive the increased energy prices and the reduction of gas supplies in autumn and winter.\n\nTo relieve consumers, the government has thus far made 30 billion euros available. On September 4, the German chancellor announced an additional 65 billion-euro relief package, with Mr. Scholz finally acknowledging the obvious: “Russia is no longer a reliable supplier of energy.” It represents a sharp departure from the failed strategy of “change through trade.”\n\nThe situation has kept changing dramatically. On September 5, the German government even agreed to continue operating until April 2023 two of the remaining three nuclear power plants that had been scheduled to close at the end of the year. Also on that day, the Kremlin said it is stopping gas supplies to Europe through Nord Stream until Western sanctions are lifted against Russia.\n\nSee also\n\nWill support for sanctions hold?\n\nNevertheless, the party Die Linke and the AfD are planning a “hot autumn” for the government. There were violent protests when Chancellor Scholz wanted to explain the federal government’s plans at a citizens’ meeting in Neuruppin on August 18. Unlike Ms. Merkel, who largely eluded debate, Mr. Scholz strives to establish contact with the citizens. However, he lacks charisma, and he keeps as many options open as possible in his statements. The chancellor is wary of the tense relations in the coalition with the Greens and the FDP and tries not to provoke the left in his own party, whose influence has increased after the Bundestag election.\n\nMeanwhile, the approval ratings of the traffic light coalition are falling. In a survey at the beginning of August 2022, only 14 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with the government’s work, while 37 percent said they were “very dissatisfied.” Satisfaction with the chancellor has also slumped. Recent polls also show his SPD party losing popularity as the Greens gain.\n\nOpposition to supporting Ukraine is particularly strong in the SPD. Not only Mr. Schroeder but Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and numerous other Social Democrats are known for their pro-Russian stance, which was not questioned in the party until after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. If the energy crisis in winter leads to mass social protests, the pressure on the government to lift or at least mitigate the sanctions against Russia is likely to increase, as demanded by Die Linke and the AfD.\n\nIn the CDU, too, more voices want to force a change of course. The spokesman of this current movement is Saxon Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, who is pushing for quick negotiations to “freeze” the war because sufficient Russian gas flows in the coming years are essential to keep social peace in Germany. There has been a debate even in the FDP since Wolfgang Kubicki, vice president of the Bundestag, proposed activating the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as possible. The FDP chairman Christian Lindner and numerous other politicians of the party have spoken out vehemently against it.\n\nOnly the Greens have thus far resisted the temptation to question the turnaround in Russia policy announced by Mr. Scholz in the Bundestag. Among the German parties, only they had spoken out against Nord Stream 2 from the outset. In the German Bundestag, the Greens campaigned even more than the CDU and FDP to support Ukraine against Russia with the supply of heavy weapons.",
    "Germany nationalizes gas company Uniper to protect energy supplies": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBERLIN — The German government announced Wednesday that it would nationalize the country’s biggest importer of Russian gas, Uniper, expanding state intervention aimed at preventing an energy shortage because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The move builds on a 15 billion euro ($14.8 billion) rescue package from late July that was intended to stabilize the gas giant, which supplies 40 percent of the natural gas used across Germany. Through the additional 8 billion euro capital increase, the German government will now take ownership of 99 percent of the company.\n\n“The decision was made,” German Economic Affairs and Climate Minister Robert Habeck said at a news conference, “to ensure security of supply for Germany.”\n\nThe step became necessary as the situation has changed over the past few weeks, Habeck said. Conditions have worsened, he said, particularly since Russia halted all gas deliveries through the Nord Stream pipeline in early September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe German state will purchase the shares it did not already own for 1.70 euros per share — a fraction of the company’s stock price, which hovered close to 40 euros per share before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. The deal still needs to be approved by the European Commission.\n\nUniper, which is one of Europe’s largest gas companies, has struggled in the wake of the energy market turmoil following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company, which imports roughly 50 percent of its gas from Russia, announced that reduced deliveries led to a 12 billion euro loss ($11.8 billion) in the first half of 2022.\n\nKlaus-Dieter Maubach, Uniper’s CEO, said the move to nationalization was necessary due to the worsening conditions and pledged that the company would do “its part in overcoming the energy crisis.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he did not expect the bailout to be the last of its kind but could just be the start of nationalizations across the continent.\n\n“This is part of the bigger trend that we’re going to see really heavy state intervention into energy markets,” he said. “In some cases, it’s bailing out politically sensitive or economically vital companies like Uniper, and others it’s redesigning markets, price caps, interventions and to a capacity prices. So this is not the end.”\n\nThe bailout comes on the heels of an announcement last week that Germany would place two subsidiaries of the Russian oil giant Rosneft, which account for more than 10 percent of Germany’s total oil processing capacity, under the administration of Germany’s Federal Network Agency. The decision came with the explicit aim to “prevent the refusal of services to the companies with ties to Russia from negatively impacting the ongoing business operations.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The entry of the state is the right step in this situation,” German economist Veronika Grimm told The Washington Post via email.\n\nGermany’s gas storage has reached more than 90 percent of capacity, despite the recent pipeline shutdown, according to government data. For months, the German government has staunchly vowed to support Uniper because of the company’s key role within the country’s energy infrastructure.\n\n“We will not allow a systemically relevant company like Uniper to fail, thus jeopardizing Germany’s energy security,” Habeck said in July. “The shortage of energy that has been artificially created by Russia is not a normal fluctuation that the market can digest.”\n\nCahill described Uniper’s importance to Germany more simply. “Uniper is too big too fail,” he said.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Refugees: German cities are reaching their limits": "A bitter wind blows across the empty sports fields on the road out of Herzogenrath-Merkstein, a small community in the far west of Germany near Aachen. A few brown leaves whirl over the green grass of the soccer field; the red-colored sand of the running track is wet. On the once-white plaster of the gymnasium, someone has written \"SVS Merkstein,\" the name of the local sports club, in black paint.\n\nBut no sports activities are taking place here at the moment. Instead, the hall is being used to house refugees from the war in Ukraine. In early August, partitions were used to set up temporary accommodation for 80 people. Now the space is full — as are all the other accommodation facilities for refugees in Herzogenrath.\n\nPastor Frank Ungerathen and his team help the refugees in the small community of Herzogenrath\n\nAbout a kilometer down the road from the hall, the refugee advice team sits together for a meeting at the Protestant parish of Lydia. Pastor Frank Ungerathen has just told his colleagues that a second gymnasium will be converted this week. He learned this from the city's social welfare office, which is responsible for taking in and caring for the refugees.\n\nHe and his team had hoped that the situation would not again reach the point it did during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016, when people also had to be accommodated in gym halls and even tents. But there is simply no more housing available in the small city of about 50,000 residents.\n\n\"The housing market has totally dried up,\" said Mahkameh Robatian, who leads the advice center. Private offers to take in refugees are also rare. \"The high prices of gas and electricity mean that people often decline because it becomes too expensive for them,\" said volunteer Olga Meier.\n\nIn any refugee accommodation in Aachen, at least two people share a bedroom\n\nHelpers overwhelmed\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine and the first refugees from the war arrived in Germany, the advice center has been working nonstop. Its staff hold talks, make phone calls to authorities, help fill out forms, organize language courses, look for apartments and arrange cooking classes and meetings over coffee and cake. They encourage, advise, comfort and, when necessary, also look after children.\n\nA city like Herzogenrath normally received about 50 to 60 new refugees per year, estimated the pastor. \"Now, 400 war refugees from Ukraine arrived in the space of three months — and we currently have 530,\" he said. In addition, about 850 people who fled from 20 other countries have also arrived. \"Some have found jobs in the meantime, many have not — and the need for integration does not stop there.\" The municipality cannot cope with this on its own.\n\nIn Aachen, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, the situation looks no better. At the start of August, Mayor Sibylle Keupen pulled the emergency brake and announced that the city would not accept any more war refugees or asylum-seekers for the time being. All emergency accommodation centers were full, including eight gym halls.\n\nAachen Mayor Sibylle Keupen has said many refugees are here to stay, and need permanent accommodation\n\nMost of the more than 4,000 Ukrainian refugees who are registered in Aachen and receive financial support have found accommodation privately. This is also because Aachen already had a relatively large Ukrainian community before the war.\n\nIt is mostly people from African countries, along with a few Syrians and a handful of Ukrainians, who live in a \"container village\" made of prefabricated buildings that were set up on a former sports ground in the city's south in 2016. The small rooms, each with their own cooking facilities, showers and toilets, are in hot demand because they offer privacy. Up to 120 people can live there, but a third of the containers are currently leaking and therefore uninhabitable. Attempts are underway to repair them.\n\nThe city authorities in Aachen are working flat out to convert vacant commercial properties into accommodation. The plan is that the refugees should have moved out of the gyms in a few months, by the end of autumn.\n\nA Dutch company sets up makeshift accommodation to house refugees\n\nLocal authorities feel abandoned\n\n\"We are now in a situation where we realize this war will probably go on for a long time yet — the people will stay here, and they need something other than a sports hall,\" said Keupen. \"These are families, these are different ethnic groups, different age groups, who all clash together there — that is also an explosive social force that we must moderate. That is very difficult if we do not have more small-scale accommodation options.\"\n\nThe mayor supports the demand from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, which represent the interests of city and district authorities, for a refugee summit. The federal government must better control the distribution of people across the country, as well as step in financially, she believes.\n\nUkrainian children go to school in Germany\n\n\"We need an orderly system to really provide people with — and this is the important thing for me — not just a roof over their head and a bed, but more. They need a place at school, or day care: they also need psychosocial care, especially when it comes to families and children who are dealing with war-related trauma,\" she said.\n\nThese are all things that throughout Germany are just as hard to come by as an available apartment — for which the refugees are competing with the rest of the population.\n\n\"Most landlords say no straight away, or hang up when they hear about refugees,\" said Michaela Lee, who is responsible for administration at the refugee help center in Herzogenrath.\n\n\"I am always so glad when I manage to find an apartment for a refugee,\" she added. \"Or an apprenticeship, after I have helped write hundreds of applications.\" That is her motivation.\n\nThis article was originally written in German\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Nord Stream 2 pipeline pressure collapses mysteriously overnight": "Authorities in Germany are trying to establish what caused a sudden drop in pressure in the defunct Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, with a spokesperson for its operator saying it could have been a leak.\n\nThe pipeline has been one of the flashpoints in an escalating energy war between Europe and Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February that has pummelled western economies and sent gas prices soaring.\n\nNord Stream 2’s operator said pressure in the undersea pipeline dropped from 105 to 7 bar overnight.\n\nThe Russian-owned pipeline, which was intended to double the volume of gas flowing from Vyborg, Russia, under the Baltic Sea to Germany, had just been completed and filled with 300m cubic metres of gas when the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, cancelled it shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nEuropean countries have resisted Russian calls to allow Nord Stream 2 to operate and accused Moscow of using energy as a weapon. Russia denies doing so and blames the west for gas shortages.\n\n“We are currently in contact with the authorities concerned in order to clarify the situation. We still have no clarity about the causes and the exact facts,” said a statement from the German economy ministry.\n\nThe pipeline’s Swiss-based operator, which has legally been wound up, said it had informed all relevant authorities and that the leak, if that were the cause, could not have been at the landing point in Lubmin, northern Germany. “If it were in Lubmin, you’d have heard it,” the spokesperson said.\n\nGazprom referred questions about the incident to the Nord Stream 2 operator.\n\nGermany has informed the Danish authorities about the incident and is trying to establish whether the drop in pressure occurred in German waters. Danish authorities have asked ships to steer clear of a five nautical mile radius off the island of Bornholm.\n\nRussia has cut off gas supplies to several countries and halted flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, accusing western sanctions of hindering operations.\n\nThe suspected leak did not have an immediate impact on gas trading amid signs that Vladimir Putin’s efforts to disrupt energy supplies in Europe this winter will be thwarted.\n\nThe price for British wholesale gas for delivery this weekend dropped nearly 24% to 160p a therm on Monday, with the price for delivery on Tuesday down 17% at 190p a therm.\n\nPrices have tumbled in recent weeks as Europe has made progress in filling up storage facilities for this winter and intervened in the energy market to protect consumers.\n\nThe day-ahead price has fallen sharply since the 589p a therm seen a month ago after Russia’s Gazprom began to throttle flows through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\nAsked about the potential leak in Nord Stream 2, Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, said: “In terms of European supply, no one in the market seriously thinks it could become operational and a route to market for Russian gas, so it should have no impact on the price. It’s not a lost supply route – it’s a lost white elephant.”\n\nAnalysts said the fall back in prices was due to a collection of factors including progress in filling up storage facilities. Prices have also fallen due to an increase in wind power generation and signs that routine annual maintenance on Norwegian gasfields has gone to plan without need for further outages.\n\nMarzec-Maser said: “The fact that wind generation has kicked in and there’s plenty of wind power across the continent has eased the pressure on the amount of gas-fired generation required, particularly given the issues with hydro and nuclear.”\n\nLow water levels in southern Norway have disrupted supply of hydroelectric power, while French nuclear power stations have faced problems, including the rising temperature of river water.\n\nMarzec-Maser said concerns remained over how Europe would be supplied next year when storage facilities are likely to be empty and Russian gas is potentially unavailable, unlike earlier this year when efforts to import more gas began.\n\nThe fall in wholesale gas prices should reduce the cost to the UK government of its cap on energy bills. The government has set a £2,500 limit on average household bills, a policy that could cost more than £100bn.",
    "Akanda Plans First Shipment of Medical Cannabis to Germany and Anticipates Leading Market Share Position": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--International medical cannabis platform company Akanda Corp. (\"Akanda\" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AKAN) expects to take a leading position in the fast-growing German medical cannabis market, as it prepares for first export shipment from its Portugal-based Holigen operation in the coming weeks. Akanda’s EU GMP certified indoor grow facility in Sintra received its first purchase order and is expected to make its first export shipment to Germany imminently. Akanda recently entered into an agreement to deliver 1,000 kilograms of high-grade medical cannabis flower to German pharmacies through the Cansativa platform. Cansativa is the only company in Germany permitted to distribute domestically grown cannabis. Cansativa will have a right of first refusal (ROFR) to take on additional quantities that could result in the full capacity utilization of Holigen’s 2,000 kilograms per annum indoor production capacity. The deal ranks as one of the largest supply agreements in the European medical cannabis industry.\n\nAkanda is targeting a leading 10% market share position of German medical cannabis imports, with room for additional expansion and growth. Germany imported approximately 21,000 kilograms of medical cannabis in the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022 combined, based on official import numbers. Imports to Germany grew by 27%1 over the past quarter. Germany has imported medical cannabis from numerous countries, with Portugal becoming an increasingly larger player gaining ground on Canada, the leader in this space. Holigen is one of few publicly traded companies that is a Europe-based cultivator, manufacturer and distributor of EU GMP certified medical cannabis. Holigen hosts a one-of-a-kind 20,000 square foot indoor cultivation site in Sintra dedicated to the cultivation of high THC premium cannabis as well as a large 7 million square foot (180+ acres) outdoor facility located two hours south in Aljustrel.\n\n“Akanda’s push into the German medical cannabis market gives it an edge over its North American competitors in Europe, and this is the focus of the company's growth,” commented Akanda’s CEO Tej Virk. “German adult-use draft legislation is expected to be introduced either at the end of this year or early next, and the legislation to pass later in 2023. Other European countries may follow soon after given Germany’s prominence as the largest economy in the European Union. If cannabis is legalized for adult-use, the German cannabis market could reach €4.7bn ($4.6bn) per year2, according to the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics. Akanda’s strong positioning in the medical market, gives it an early mover advantage to lead this new and lucrative market. We have begun to partner with global brand leaders in quality and innovation like Cookies to capture market share in the current medical market and the future regulated adult-use market once it becomes a reality.”\n\nAkanda recently announced an exclusive license agreement with iconic international cannabis lifestyle brand Cookies. The multi-year agreement enables Akanda to pursue the current medical and future adult-use opportunities in Europe with arguably one of the best-known cannabis brands and highest quality genetics in the world. Akanda intends to initially produce EU GMP certified Cookies branded high THC medical cannabis products at its flagship indoor premium cultivation and manufacturing facility in Sintra. Additionally, Akanda is able to exclusively open and operate Cookies branded pharmacy outlets throughout Portugal.\n\nAkanda has also enlisted renowned cannabis experts to help its push to lead the European market, including Terry Booth who was an original founder of Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NASDAQ: ACB) (TSX: ACB). Booth led Aurora from its infancy to a market cap of nearly $10 billion, one of the world’s largest and fastest growing cannabis companies, with a focus on providing high-quality medical and adult use cannabis, and spearheaded the development of one of the first EU GMP certified medical cannabis production facilities in Canada.\n\nAbout Akanda Corp.\n\nAkanda is an international medical cannabis and wellness platform company seeking to help people lead better lives through improved access to high quality and affordable products.

    "Germany records immense growth in GCC visitors in first half of 2022": "With 318% increase of traffic in 2022, the GCC is the second largest overseas source market for inbound tourism to Germany\n\nGermany’s cultural offerings continue to entice visitors globally with data-driven campaigns proving particularly successful in attracting Emirati travellers\n\nDubai, UAE – The German National Tourist Board (GNTB) has revealed the country recorded a 318 per cent increase on overnight stays from Gulf nationals in the first six months of 2022 when compared to the same period last year*.\n\nGCC nationals were responsible for more than 335,000 stays in H1 2022, compared with a little less than 81,000 in 2021. Such figures confirm the region’s position as representing the biggest growth from an Asian source market.\n\nWhile tourism numbers may not have returned to pre-pandemic levels yet, the promising growth demonstrates the countries strong recovery as it continues to attract tourists.\n\n“The GCC is the top Asian source market, therefore it’s unsurprising with our recent campaigns that there has been such a strong increase,” said Yamina Sofo, director of sales and marketing at the German National Tourist Office, the regional office of GNTB. “Pandemic recovery has long been top of mind and it’s encouraging to see that both longstanding and first-time travellers are increasingly keen to explore everything that Germany has to offer.”\n\nOverall, the Asian source markets have recorded a 252.3 per cent increase in overnight visitors, a jump from just over 217,000 to just under 800,000 in 6 months. The surging increase demonstrates a dedication and determination to travel internationally, despite some countries continuing to implement travel restrictions during the first half of the year.\n\nTo further drive interest in travel to Germany in the remainder of 2022, GNTB has announced the launch of its ‘Feel Good’ campaign, which encompasses a plethora of guiding tips highlighting the country’s eco initiatives that provide conscious tourists with adequate tools and information to reduce their carbon footprint during their travels.\n\nA recent survey by D/A, the Dubai-based consumer insights company, revealed the UAE’s interest in travel has shifted post-pandemic, with relaxation in natural surroundings proving most popular, followed by cultural experiences. The German.Local.Culture campaign, which has been running across the GCC from 10 March, put a focus on driving awareness of the huge number of traditional experiences Germany has to offer, including national crafts and customs, local fare, and the diversity of the history-rich cities, while the Embrace German Nature which ran from 21st April highlighted the plethora of outdoor, nature-focused activities. Aligning with market wants, the campaigns directly attributed to higher footfall from the GCC, said Sofo.\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘Feel Good’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/feel-good/sustainability.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘German.Local.Culture’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/campaign/german-local-culture/home.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s ‘Embrace German Nature’ campaign: www.germany.travel/de/trade/marktbearbeitung/globale-kampagnen/embrace-german-nature.html\n\n*2022 inbound figures to Germany from GCC compared to 2019 figures are -36.7 per cent.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout the GNTB\n\nThe German National Tourist Board (GNTB) is Germany’s national tourism organisation. It works on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action to represent Germany as a tourist destination and is funded by the Ministry in accordance with a decision taken by the German Bundestag. Working closely with the German travel industry and private-sector partners and trade associations, the GNTB develops strategies and marketing campaigns to promote Germany’s positive image abroad as a tourist destination and to encourage tourists to visit the country.\n\nThe GNTB has a three-pronged recovery strategy for overcoming the challenges of the restart after the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nRaising awareness of the Destination Germany brand and enhancing the brand profile with a focus on sustainability and climate change mitigation\n\nSupporting the travel industry, which is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, through relationship management and the sharing of knowledge\n\nDeveloping evidence-based action plans on the basis of targeted market research and ongoing analysis of changing customer demand.\n\nFocus on sustainability and digitalisation\n\nThe GNTB promotes sustainable and forward-looking tourism in line with the objectives of the German government. The focus here is on sustainability and digitalisation.\n\nSustainability has been a core topic for more than a decade and we engage with it as a strategic issue across all areas of the organisation.

    "Germany lags far behind on gender equality in agriculture, study finds": "Germany is lagging far behind its EU counterparts when it comes to the share of farms being managed or passed on to women according to a new study, which points to the far-reaching consequences this has on their financial security.\n\nRead the original German story here.\n\nOnly 11% of farms in Germany are managed by women, according to a recent nationwide study conducted by the Thünen Institute and the University of Göttingen on behalf of the German agriculture ministry.\n\nOn top of that, only one in five of the people set to inherit or otherwise take over farms are women, the study added.\n\n“The results show that women in rural areas are performing tasks of systemic importance, but are at the same time often not very visible in terms of financial matters,” explained Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir at an event where the results of the study were presented on 22 September.\n\nSpecifically, the study points to an imbalance between women’s far-reaching responsibilities on farms and how this is reflected legally.\n\n83% of the women farmers surveyed said they work on their family’s farm, while almost three-quarters said they are also involved in strategic and entrepreneurial decisions. But only in very few cases is this contribution also reflected legally, as evidenced by the low proportion of female farm managers.\n\n“In contrast to many other countries, de facto joint farm management is not recorded statistically in Germany,” according to the report.\n\nFinancial insecurity\n\nThe consequences on the financial security of women farmers are far-reaching.\n\nThe report’s authors point out that divorce, separation or the death of their partners could plunge female farmers into financial insecurity, stressing that this has ramifications for women’s healthcare and old-age provision.\n\nIn case of divorce or death, for example, “the risk of female old-age poverty is significantly higher and still too few are covered by contracts or wills,” President of the German Rural Women’s Association Petra Bentkämper stressed in a statement.\n\n“These risks must be talked about openly,” she added.\n\nThe study’s authors are thus urging women on farms to start taking care of social security coverage, together with their partners, at an early stage.\n\nAt the same time, the report calls on insurance providers to “examine the risk of possible pension gaps for women with different employment histories” and to draw their attention to solutions for this.\n\nIn France, for example, the government passed a pension reform at the start of February that is set to benefit women farmers.\n\nGerman women still face 'greater hurdles' in EU farm fund access German women tend to benefit less than men from the support programmes of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Juliane Vees, the first vice-president of the German Association of Women in Agriculture, told EURACTIV Germany in an interview.\n\nTackling gender inequality\n\nTo tackle the root cause of gender inequality in the agricultural sector, the study’s authors stress it is necessary to address underlying barriers to entry such as outdated gender images and traditional inheritance practices.\n\n“In order for more women to take over and manage farms, a fundamental change in agricultural traditions is necessary, coupled with more educational work at agricultural educational institutions,” explained Janna Luisa Pieper from the University of Göttingen at the study’s presentation.\n\nIt is important that the educational work is not only directed at women, said Pieper: “Gender-equitable agriculture concerns everyone.”\n\nIn addition to counselling, education and mentoring services, the experts also believe that support programmes must be created or adapted to make it easier for women to start their own agricultural businesses even without inheriting a family farm.\n\nBut while Germany does support young farmers in setting up their own businesses, it is not doing enough for female entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn its observation letter on Germany’s National Strategic Plan for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the EU executive said the country needed to pay more attention to issues such as the “income gap between the sexes” or “the gender gap among farm managers, especially young farmers.”\n\nMore detailed data needed\n\nHowever, data on the income gap in Germany’s agriculture sector is very scarce.\n\nThe report presented last week, for example, is the first nationwide study on the situation of women in agriculture for which associations, like the LandFrauenverband, had long campaigned for.\n\nThe authors are thus calling for collecting more detailed data on the topic to identify better and address women’s obstacles in the field.\n\n“Even if we have been aware of many things for a long time, we need figures and evidence to be able to initiate changes politically,” said LandFrauenverband’s Bentkämper.\n\nWomen farmers 'essential' for future, says French agriculture minister An increasing number of women in France are entering the agricultural world, dominated by men for so long. EURACTIV France takes a closer look at the role of women farmers in the country.\n\n[Edited by Natasha Foote/Nathalie Weatherald]",

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nFRANKFURT/MUNICH, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Hakle has been a German household name since 1928, but the Duesseldorf-based toilet paper manufacturer said all it took was this summer's gas price shock to drive it into insolvency.\n\nEnergy-intensive firms such as Hakle were particularly vulnerable after Russian gas supply cuts to Europe, which Moscow has blamed on Western sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\n\"In a very short time, electricity and gas prices have exploded to such an extent that of course they cannot be passed on to our customers so quickly,\" Karen Jung, the company's head of marketing, told Reuters.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe number of insolvencies like Hakle's has jumped since August, stirring fears that a wave of bankruptcies could engulf Europe's largest economy as another consequence of Russia's energy standoff with Europe.\n\nThe companies' plight is heaping more pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition, which is trying to protect Germans from soaring gas bills, decades-high inflation plus the threats of recession and winter fuel shortages.\n\nThe annual energy price increase in Germany in August on average was 139%, latest producer price data showed this week. read more\n\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck already sparked a backlash this month when he played down the issue in a TV interview, saying that companies would not necessarily go insolvent even if hard-up customers no longer bought their products. read more\n\nInvoking the English football chant \"you'll never walk alone\" as a slogan, Scholz's government is spending tens of billions of euros on relief measures and has bailed out Germany's biggest Russian gas importer Uniper.

And here we really need solutions, so that the Mittelstand still has a future here in Germany.\"\n\nResponding to such concerns, Habeck has promised more support for smaller companies, while Justice Minister Marco Buschmann plans to loosen insolvency rules to help firms buckling under energy costs. read more\n\nNO SEDATIVES\n\nSome 718 German entities became insolvent in August, a 26% jump over the previous year, according to the IWH economic institute. It expects that figure to stay at around 25% in September and climb to 33% in October.\n\n\"After a long period of low insolvency numbers, a trend reversal has now set in,\" says Steffen Mueller of the IWH.\n\nGermany's BDI business association has warned of a \"massive recession\". In a BDI survey of 593 businesses, more than a third said their existence was threatened by higher energy prices, up from 23% in February.\n\nIndustry group VKU has also joined the chorus of concern, warning that local utilities faced insolvency due to high energy prices and possible defaults from their customers. read more\n\nThe head of the German Chemicals Industry Association VCI on Tuesday said rising energy prices were a \"huge alarm call\" for Germany as a place to do business.\n\n\"The step from the world's leading industrial nation to the industrial museum has never been so small,\" Wolfgang Grosse Entrup told Reuters.\n\nA survey by leading credit institutions in August suggested non-performing loans in Germany would rise to 37.6 billion euros ($37.7 billion) next year from 31.9 billion in 2022.\n\n\"Our corporate customers did not experience a wave of bankruptcies during the pandemic,\" Helmut Schleweis, President of the German Savings Banks Association, told a banking conference on Sept 8. \"Today, however, this can no longer be ruled out, only the scope cannot yet be quantified.\"\n\nChristoph Schalast, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, said there was no significant increase in NPLs (non-performing loans) during the pandemic, when government support programmes helped companies.\n\n\"But now it looks very different. There are other factors such as inflation, disrupted supply chains, the war of aggression against Ukraine and interest rate hikes,\" he said.\n\nSome industry experts are warning against drawing the wrong conclusions from the rising insolvency figures.\n\nThey may look bad now because insolvency numbers were artificially depressed during the pandemic in 2020-2021 when the government propped up ailing firms with state aid and suspended legislation obliging them to file for insolvency.\n\nAlso, insolvency rates have been lower than in the recent past. There were just under 14,000 insolvencies in 2021, less than half the rate of 32,687 seen during the global financial crisis in 2009 or 39,320 seen in 2003, based on government data.\n\nThough non-performing loans are expected to rise, industry experts say the mood in the financial sector is still relatively sanguine.\n\n\"Banks have now clearly picked up the alarm signal, nevertheless they’re sitting in a very comfortable position,” Juergen Sonder, President of the Federal Association of Loan Purchase and Servicing, told Reuters.\n\n\"They're counting on the state to also intervene this time to prevent a wave of bankruptcies.\"\n\nRestructuring expert Lucas Floether told Reuters that the government should not try to protect companies by throwing taxpayer money at them if their business models were fundamentally unsound.\n\n\"The energy crisis is calling into question the business model of many companies,\" he said in an interview.\n\nHe welcomed Buschmann's initiative to relax insolvency rules but added that suspending them outright again would be a \"serious mistake\".\n\n\"It would just be a sedative, and it won't help,\" he said. \"Competition must take hold at some point.\"\n\n($1 = 0.9965 euros)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marta Orosz, Alexander Hübner, Patricia Weiss, Petra Wischgoll; writing by Matthias Williams.

    "Germany Announces €10 Million in New, Additional Funding to Support Education Cannot Wait’s Education Response in Ukraine, Bringing Total Contributions to €330 Million - Ukraine": "24 September 2022\n\nNEW YORK/BERLIN\n\nIt is our common responsibility to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality education.’ – Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has severely impacted access to education for approximately 7 million children. In response to that, the Government of Germany announced today €10 million in new, additional funding to Education Cannot Wait at the Global Citizen Festival.\n\nGermany is the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, with almost €330 million in total funding to date.\n\n“The international community urgently needs to increase its investments in education. Global Citizens, thank you for raising your voices to call for more support for Education Cannot Wait, so that all young people everywhere in the world will have access to quality education: this will enable us to end extreme poverty - now,\" stated Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany.\n\n“Thank you, Germany! Your inspiring leadership and strong support has taken Education Cannot Wait to the next level. Education is the most crucial investment to make today, to build a more equal, prosperous and peaceful future for all! Through global and local partnerships, we can deliver on our promise of quality education for crisis-affected children and youth, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait.\n\nThe new contribution connects to Education Cannot Wait’s First Emergency Response grants in Ukraine. The current investments are managed by Save the Children and UNICEF and focus on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys, while also ensuring continuous access to education and psychosocial support.\n\nSchools across Ukraine have been the target of repeated attacks throughout the seven-month war. Recent government reports indicate that as many as 2,300 educational institutions had been hit, and over 280 have been destroyed. Millions of refugees have fled into neighboring countries, straining resources, ripping families apart, and denying children and adolescents to their inherent human right to 12 years of quality education.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine, massive displacement in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the compounding impacts of the climate crisis, and global economic uncertainty, the world is facing a worsening global education crisis.\n\nShocking new analysis from ECW indicates that 222 million crisis-impacted girls and boys are in need of urgent education support – up from previous estimates of 75 million in 2016.\n\nIn response to the global education crisis, ECW launched its Case for Investment and 2023-2026 Strategic Plan during this year’s United Nations General Assembly. To make good on promises outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG4 – Education For All), Safe Schools Declaration and other international accords, the Fund is rallying donors and strategic partners to mobilize US$1.5 billion in funding to reach at least 20 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents over the next four years through its #222MillionDreams campaign.\n\nEducation Cannot Wait’s High-Level Financing Conference will take place in Geneva in February 2023. Hosted by Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait – and co-convened by Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan – through the 222 Million Dreams campaign, the conference calls on government donors, private sector, foundations and high-net-worth individuals to turn commitments into action by making substantive funding contributions to ECW.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nAbout Education Cannot Wait (ECW):\n\nEducation Cannot Wait (ECW) is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises. We support quality education outcomes for refugee, internally displaced and other crisis-affected girls and boys, so no one is left behind. ECW works through the multilateral system to both increase the speed of responses in crises and connect immediate relief and longer-term interventions through multi-year programming. ECW works in close partnership with governments, public and private donors, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and other humanitarian and development aid actors to increase efficiencies and end siloed responses. ECW urgently appeals to public and private sector donors for expanded support to reach even more vulnerable children and youth. The Education Cannot Wait High-Level Financing Conference, co-hosted by ECW and Switzerland, and co-convened with Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan, will take place February 16-17, 2023, in Geneva.\n\nOn Twitter, please follow: @EduCannotWait, @YasmineSherif1, @KentPage\n\nAdditional information available at: www.educationcannotwait.org\n\nFor press inquiries:\n\nAnouk Desgroseilliers, adesgroseilliers@un-ecw.org, +1-917-640-6820\n\nKent Page, kpage@unicef.org, +1-917-302-1735\n\nFor other inquiries: info@un-ecw.org\n\nPress Office of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\n\nPhone: +49 / (0)30 / 18 535-28 70 or -24 51\n\nEmail: presse@bmz.bund.de",
    "Denouncing Russia’s war in Ukraine, German Chancellor calls for upholding rules-based global order": "“There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against Ukraine,” Mr. Scholz said as he addressed the Assembly’s annual high-level debate.\n\n‘Imperialism, plain and simple’\n\n“President Putin is waging this war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine. Self-determination, political independence do not count for him. And there’s only one word for this – this is imperialism, plain and simple. The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe, but also a disaster for our global peaceful order.\n\n“If we want this war to end, then we cannot be indifferent to how it ends. Putin will only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realizes that he cannot win,” he continued.\n\n“This is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia. This is why we will not accept any pretentious referenda. And this is why Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.”\n\nMr. Scholz said the world is witnessing new fragmentation, the emergence of new wars and conflicts, and the rise of major global crises.\n\n“Some have seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules,” he noted. “Our problem isn’t the absence of rules. Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by them and to enforce them.”\n\nThe alternative to a rules-based world is not anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the weak, he stated, stressing that the international community cannot be indifferent to “whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day.”\n\n“The international order does not happen by itself. If we do nothing, then this Charter is but a piece of paper, he said, holding up a copy of the founding document of the United Nations. “This Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.”\n\n‘We stand for international order’\n\nThe world “must not stand idly by when a major nuclear power, armed to the teeth, a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the UN Security Council no less, seeks to shift borders through the use of violence,” Mr. Scholz stated.\n\nThe Chancellor added that the war in Ukraine is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and famine. Germany is supporting Ukraine with the export of food and will also support efforts to rebuild the country. In this regard, on 25 October in Berlin, an international conference of experts will look at how to manage the “herculean” task of rebuilding.\n\n“Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack; for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians; and for the protection of our international order.”",
    "Germany Takes Over Russian Oil Subsidiary, Securing a Key Refinery": "The German government has taken over the Russian oil giant Rosneft’s subsidiary in Germany, an action aimed at securing critical energy supplies as Europe moves toward a ban on imports of Russian crude later this year, the economy ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe move, which involved placing Rosneft Deutschland in a trust for at least six months, is designed to ensure the continued operation of Rosneft’s three refineries in Germany, including PCK Schwedt, which supplies gas, heating oil and jet fuel to the city of Berlin and nearby areas, the government said.\n\nAfter decades of depending on Russia as its main source of energy, and since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Germany has struggled to find alternative sources of fossil fuels to power its industrial economy. While much of the focus has been on the importance of natural gas, oil from Russia accounted for more than a third of all crude imported by Germany, much of it flowing directly to facilities in the country’s former eastern states through Cold War-era pipelines.",
    "Germany announces a multibillion dollar inflation relief package": "Germany announces a multibillion dollar inflation relief package\n\nThe German government has announced a $65 billion dollar relief package to help citizens facing soaring inflation and surging energy costs as Russia cuts off its gas supplies to Europe.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nThe German government has announced a $65 billion relief package for its citizens.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nYeah. This is all designed to help ease the burden of soaring inflation and surging energy costs as Russia cuts off its gas supplies to Europe.\n\nMARTINEZ: NPR's Rob Schmitz is on the line from Berlin to talk about this. Rob, this package comes just a couple of days after Russia's state-owned energy company Gazprom announced an indefinite halt of natural gas in the key pipeline that supplies Germany and much of Europe. How much of a factor was that in this aid package?\n\nROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The erratic supply of natural gas from Russia was a big factor behind this relief package. For months, Gazprom has cut gas supplies through its pipeline to Europe and sometimes resumed those flows. We've seen this over and over. And each time, the company claims it's shutting down the pipelines for maintenance. But German officials roll their eyes at this. And they say that Russia's obviously using energy as a weapon against the European Union, which is supporting Ukraine and which has imposed a range of sanctions on Russia.\n\nGerman economy minister Robert Habeck spoke this weekend about the latest cut in gas deliveries to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Here's what he said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROBERT HABECK: (Speaking German).\n\nSCHMITZ: And he's saying here that Nord Stream 1 should be running at full capacity. But then there's the erratic decisions by the Russian government, which means that Germany should not count on any more gas coming through that pipeline this winter.\n\nMARTINEZ: And how much of a problem will that scenario be for Germany?\n\nSCHMITZ: Very big problem - but Germany's government has worked very hard to wean itself off of Russian natural gas. Prior to the war, Germany relied on Russia for more than half its natural gas supply. In August, that was down to less than 10%. Now, August is not a month where Germany typically uses a lot of gas. But overall, Germany's been able to sign contracts with other European countries, like Norway and the Netherlands, for alternative gas supplies. And German energy experts I've spoken to say they - will likely not be blackouts this winter for Germany's household sector, but that German industry may suffer.\n\nMARTINEZ: And that's probably not great for the German economy. Which brings us then back to this relief package. How is this going to help Germans get through the winter?\n\nSCHMITZ: This is the third and largest relief package from the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. It'll include one-time payments to families, payments for retirees on pensions, and it promises to reduce the price for public transportation. Energy-intensive German industrial companies will be given tax breaks to help them stay afloat and keep people employed. And all of this aims to counter the impact that inflation has had on the economy here. Prices rose 8% in August alone. The price of groceries rose nearly 17% last month. And natural gas is 10 times more expensive than a year ago. So the pressure on German citizens and companies is very real here.\n\nMARTINEZ: Things are OK right now, Rob. But, I mean, how concerned is the government about social unrest over all this?\n\nSCHMITZ: Very much so - German officials have been warning local police for months that soaring costs may lead to protests. And both left-wing and right-wing groups say they'll begin weekly demonstrations against the government. Labor unions have also warned about this. Beyond Germany, we saw big protests over inflation in neighboring Czech Republic over the weekend. Tens of thousands took to the streets in Prague, demanding that their government do more about this. And this could get a lot worse. We've got months before winter begins and this energy shortage starts to inflict real pain here in Europe.\n\nMARTINEZ: That's NPR Berlin correspondent Rob Schmitz.

    "Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia": "Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week.\n\nThe German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships.\n\nParty insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”.\n\nSupporters of Wagenknecht, a controversial but prominent figurehead, are already hatching plans for a breakaway party to compete in the 2024 European elections, the German newspaper Taz reported this week.\n\nSuch a split would be likely to spell the end of Die Linke, 15 years after it was founded in a merger between the successor to East Germany’s Socialist Unity party and former Social Democrats disillusioned by their party’s direction under Gerhard Schröder, and just under a decade after it formed the largest opposition force in the Bundestag’s 2013-17 term.\n\nIn her speech last Thursday, Wagenknecht had called chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-leaning governing coalition “the stupidest government in Europe” because it imposed sanctions on Russia, which supplied over half of Germany’s gas needs before the start of the war in the spring.\n\n“Yes, of course the war in Ukraine is a crime”, Wagenknecht said. “But how dumb is the idea that we can punish Putin by pushing millions of German families into poverty and destroy our economy while Gazprom makes record profits?” The speech was greeted with applause not only by the Linke leadership but also by delegates of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\n\nWagenknecht no longer holds any official positions in Die Linke, but was nominated to be its sole speaker in the recent parliamentary session on the national climate budget.\n\nIn the run-up to the speech, Die Linke’s parliamentary co-chair Dietmar Bartsch had reportedly urged Wagenknecht to avoid calling for an opening of Nord Stream 2, the Russian gas pipeline project that was halted shortly before the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhile the 53-year-old did not mention Nord Stream 2, her “economic war” comments proved incendiary. Even though the German government has used similar language to describe its standoff with the Kremlin over gas deliveries, Wagenknecht suggested that the act of aggression in this conflict had been initiated by the west.\n\n“The thesis that the federal republic of Germany is leading an economic war against Russia reverses cause and effect”, said Bodo Ramelow, the Left party state premier for Thuringia. “The phrase ‘the USA’s economic war against Russia’ is Kremlin propaganda”, said Martina Renner, a former deputy leader of the leftwing outfit.\n\nWhile Die Linke has broadly opposed the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, it voted in favour of economic sanctions against Russia in May, and a party congress in June condemned Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine as “imperialist”.\n\nSplits in the leftwing party, present since Die Linke’s founding, have become increasingly entrenched in recent years.\n\nThe biggest and most bitter split is between reformists who see the party’s future in a space where different union and social justice movements overlap, and those more traditional, nationalist leftists gathered around Wagenknecht, who accuse what they call the “lifestyle left” of having betrayed the party’s traditional working-class base.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the party’s parliamentary status in a fine balance, there have until now been few attempts to rock the boat by seeking an open conflict.\n\nWagenknecht had ended her speech by calling for the resignation of the minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck. Instead, her contribution triggered the resignations of two high-profile members.\n\nUlrich Schneider, the head of the German welfare association Der Paritätische, on Monday announced via Twitter he had handed in his membership over the party letting Wagenknecht take the podium. “That was too much”, said Schneider, who heads Germany’s largest umbrella organisation of self-help initiatives in the area of health and social work.\n\nFabio di Masi, a former Linke MP who had remained its most prolific financial expert even after standing down as an MP last year, said a day later he was also handing in his membership, as he no longer wanted to bear responsibility for the “blatant failure of key actors in this party”.\n\nThe draining of support is reflected at a grassroot level. According to internal party figures seen by the Guardian, Die Linke has lost more than 3,000 members – or 5.5% of its total membership –in the first half of this year.\n\nAfter gaining 4.9% of the vote at federal elections last September, the leftwing party has failed to make it over the electoral threshold at five consecutive state elections.",
    "What I learnt about Germans at the first post-pandemic Oktoberfest": "On leaving Germany, I’m asked to fill in an online form, which requests my reason for departure. I write “Lederhosen”.\n\nIt’s not that they look silly (though they do). It’s not that they mark me out instantly as a tourist (they don’t, actually; plenty of locals are wearing them). It’s – and I’m sorry, there’s no non-invasive way of saying this – the chafing.\n\nFortunately, there is a lubricant-cum-emollient-cum-anaesthetic available, in one-litre (two-pint!) doses, as I’m attending the opening weekend of Oktoberfest 2022. Munich’s is the original and beeriest – founded in 1810 to mark the marriage of King Ludwig (God knows what his stag do was like) – and this year’s is being billed as potentially the wildest ever, since it swaggers back after a two-year disco nap necessitated by eine kleine deadly pandemic.\n\nThat global party-pooper is still making its presence felt in Munich: masks are compulsory on all public transport, and (rule-respecters that the Germans are) everyone complies. But the mask slips rather once you hit Theresienwiese, the 100-acre home of Oktoberfest. Here, I discover, the vibe is punters packed in 10-to-a-table, embraces from strangers, and generally partying like it’s 2019.",
    "Rail workers in Germany: “We face the same problems here as our colleagues in the US”": "The World Socialist Web Site spoke with rail workers in Germany about the industrial struggle in the United States in which 100,000 railroaders are confronting the White House, billion-dollar rail companies and their trade unions. Here, too, train drivers, engineers and other rail employees who know the WSWS are following the struggle of their American brothers and sisters with enthusiasm and support.\n\nThe struggle of American railroad workers for better wages and conditions is increasingly turning into a power struggle with the White House. President Biden and the railroad companies have reached an agreement with the unions to call off a strike that had been decided for September 16. At the same time, there is the “recommendation” of the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) that does not meet a single demand of the railroad workers.\n\nAmerican railroad workers have been without a contract for three years and have not received a wage increase during that time. Most recently, an independent Railroad Workers Rank-and-File Committee has emerged at the initiative of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees. On September 14, some 500 rail workers attended an online meeting of the committee, while the White House, rail barons and union bureaucrats conferred behind closed doors. The meeting virtually unanimously adopted a resolution stating that rail workers will not tolerate the violation of their right to strike and will not accept any contract that is not explicitly ratified by the workforce.\n\nWhile the German media has completely ignored this important development in the class struggle in the US, the WSWS regularly reports on it. In Germany, WSWS reporters spoke with several rail workers who support the struggle of the American rail workers, with which they stand in solidarity.\n\nAndreas, former locomotive engineer, now a crane operator in the Ruhr [Photo: WSWS]\n\n“It’s good that the train drivers and rail workers are taking to the barricades and organizing independently of their union,” says Andreas, who worked for many years as a train driver in the Ruhr region. “Because the unions do what the employer says. It’s no different here in Germany.”\n\nIndeed, a year ago at Deutsche Bahn (DB), train drivers and conductors went on strike for several weeks before their dispute was isolated and sold out by union leaders.\n\nAs for the deal the US rail companies and the Biden administration negotiated with the unions, Andreas says that was to be feared. “In fact, they should have taken full strike action by now, they should have gone on the offensive.”\n\nAndreas changed jobs for health reasons after many years. “I wore out my neck and spine, which is a typical railroad disease,” he says. Now he works as a crane operator for a subcontractor at steelmaker ArcelorMittal in Duisburg, where there are also long weekly working hours. “ArcelorMittal keeps producing until the doctor calls because they are currently getting good prices. It all takes a toll on our bones, and we’re paying the price.” Nevertheless, the former train driver thinks his crane driver job is better today.\n\nReports of an American railroader working up to 80 hours a week have shaken Andreas: “That’s not normal. You’re running on empty there.” He knows about the difficult working conditions of railroad workers. Of his time as a train driver, he reports, “We were always given more to do.”\n\nNew duties were added all the time, he says, even though he and his colleagues had been operating the train alone for many decades. “Brake officer, car inspector, local shunter, etc.—you do it all by yourself now,” Andreas says. “Catastrophes like the one a few weeks ago in the freight yard in Herne are a consequence of these working conditions. Because there, under these conditions, safety is also no longer guaranteed.”\n\nHowever, an 80-hour workweek was even worse, he said. It was “homicidal for you as a train driver and for everyone else.” Concentration inevitably wanes and there was hardly time to recover. “It takes a while for the body to get back into rest mode after a long shift. With an 80-hour week, you don’t even get into that relaxation and rest mode.”\n\nHe did not know exactly how much they earned but was sure “train drivers certainly aren’t well paid in the US.” When he sees on TV how long the trains are there, “it gives me the creeps. Here in Germany, we’re only allowed to pull 750-meter trains with one locomotive and 900-meter trains with two locomotives.”\n\nAndreas finds it particularly “brutal” that the unions have called in the government agency PEB: “Why is the government interfering? These are all private companies.” He says that proves his experience with the unions. “The unions, no matter which one you take, try to drive down wages. An acquaintance of mine—he’s retired now—received an hourly wage of €27 as a train driver until the end.”\n\nToday, the railroads like to use career changers from other backgrounds who are only trained for a short time. “They then come in via temporary work and then have an hourly wage of €13,” Andreas reports. “You can complain to the union or the works council all you want. They won’t budge, they support it.”\n\nStrike by train drivers and conductors in August and September 2021, here in front of Berlin Central Station [Photo: WSWS]\n\nIn Bavaria, we spoke with Peter, who is a third-year apprentice at DB Fernverkehr in Munich. Peter said he thought the situation of railroad workers in the US was bad. “The shift changes, for example, are not sustainable. Here in Germany, you have a break of at least 12 hours after a 12-hour shift, but that is actually too little. After a 12-hour shift, you are totally exhausted. The obligation to be constantly on call is also not okay. More workers are needed so that everyone can work normal shifts and also have days off.”\n\nPeter was particularly angered by the behaviour of the unions in the US but is familiar with such things already. He says, “Here in Germany, too, the unions work closely with the companies. There are many people on the board of EVG [Rail and Transport Workers Union] who were previously in high-ranking positions at DB. That’s a close relationship with the management, but not with the workers. These people need to be fired and replaced with capable people who really represent the interests of the workers.” As for the Biden administration’s intervention, Peter says, “The government has no business getting involved. It’s just supporting the company.”\n\nPeter added, “There’s nothing left but prepare and carry out a nationwide strike, especially when these maggots get involved.” For him, the initiative of railroad workers to organize independently in rank-and-file action committees was “a very good idea. Such a strike must be well planned. You don’t have any other option anymore. We should do it here in Germany, too. We are basically facing the same problems as our colleagues in the US. Therefore, the action committees must also serve to unite us internationally. I wish my colleagues in the US every success!”\n\nHerrmann Helke worked for the railways in the Ruhr region for several decades. He reports: “Almost 50 years ago, I started working for the state railways in West Germany, which was ‘reunited’ with the [East German] Reichsbahn to form Deutsche Bahn AG after the fall of the Berlin Wall. This meant total reorganization, frustration and massive job cuts, but the union leadership expressed its loyalty to the reorganization right from the start. In the end, colleagues had to wipe their eyes as their jobs were melting away so quickly.\n\n“Colleagues at American railroads are about to take a big step. They are on their way to breaking the power of the conspiratorial alliance made up of the insatiable capitalists, the corrupt union leadership and a lying clique of politicians and journalists. I follow developments on the WSWS very closely—after all, the media don’t report on them.\n\n“I am enormously pleased to see my colleagues in the US going on the offensive and building an alternative leadership to assert the power of workers, especially railway workers at the moment. This is worth every ounce of support!”\n\nTom, a tram driver in Munich [Photo: WSWS]\n\nTom, a tram driver in Munich, also wanted to express his support for railway workers in the US. “Through your struggle,” he writes, “it becomes clear how politicians and unions are conspiring with railroad corporations and shareholders. Rotten compromises are being made to stall your strike.”\n\nHe continues, “We workers in Germany and all over the world are following your struggle very closely because we all face the same problems: The unions are on the side of the companies. In addition, there is inflation and rapidly rising prices for food, heating gas, electricity and fuel. Politicians are spending billions on war and the military, which the unions also support. At the same time, there’s no money for health care, and measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic have been all but eliminated.”\n\nThis was precisely why, Tom stresses, “It is so important that we workers unite in action committees independent of the unions and network internationally. Our struggle against the capitalist system can only succeed if we base it on a socialist program.”\n\nThe WSWS is the only news source reporting regularly on the important battles that herald a new upsurge of class struggle in the United States. We call on train drivers and other rail workers to contact us at railwrfc@gmail.com and participate in building independent action committees.",
    "Germany's energy options are dwindling as it tries to break ties with Russia": "Germany's energy options are dwindling as it tries to break ties with Russia\n\nMillions of Germans are worried about efforts to wean the country off of Russian natural gas and possibly not having heat this winter. But energy experts say German industry should be more concerned.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nGermany has approved energy-saving measures for the winter that will limit heating and lighting for public buildings. It may not be enough to meet demand. Germany depends on Russia for a third of its natural gas. And because of tensions over the war, Russia could turn the gas spigot off at any time. NPR's Rob Schmitz reports on Germany's dwindling energy options.\n\nROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: It's market day in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighborhood, but Ulrike Steinke isn't buying much.\n\nULRIKE STEINKE: (Speaking German).\n\nSCHMITZ: The retired kindergarten teacher says her pension's not big enough for the rising price of food nor energy.\n\nSTEINKE: (Through interpreter) I'm really worried about the winter. My place is drafty, so I'm considering living in the smallest room - the one that heats up quickly. I'll probably leave the heating off in the rest of the apartment.\n\nSCHMITZ: These are the choices facing millions of Germans as the price of energy has risen four times that from a year ago. The government has urged citizens to turn off lights and take shorter showers, and citizens have urged their government to hurry up and find reliable energy alternatives to Russian gas. That's why some were surprised when Germany's economy minister announced the country would not extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants scheduled to shut down at the end of the year.\n\nFRANZISKA HOLZ: We do not need any further use of the nuclear power plants beyond their current legal lifetime, simply because gas is only partially used in the power sector.\n\nSCHMITZ: Franziska Holz is an energy expert at the German Institute for Economic Research. She says only a third of Germany's natural gas is used to generate electricity, and Germany's replacing that by burning more coal. That's why, she says, extending the life of nuclear power plants won't make a difference. The problem, she says, is that another third of Germany's natural gas is used solely for heating homes and offices.\n\nHOLZ: And that is really a part of our gas demand, where it's hard to say, bring that to zero. So if we want to keep households at least a little bit warm, we need to keep those plants running.\n\nSCHMITZ: Holz is confident there won't be any electricity blackouts in Germany this winter. She's less confident German industry - which relies on the remaining third of natural gas - will have what it needs to get itself through the winter. To ensure it does, she says Germans will have to further cut their use of natural gas.\n\nHELENA MARSCHALL: Of course, like, we need to deal with the gas crisis we are now facing in the short term. But at the same time, we still have this other crisis we're facing, which is the climate crisis.\n\nSCHMITZ: Helena Marschall, spokesperson for climate group Fridays for Future, says as Germany's government scrambles to find quick solutions to its energy woes, it should keep the climate in mind. Example - Germany's decision to burn more coal to get out of its current predicament.\n\nMARSCHALL: Increasing coal production for a short amount of time, like to address the short-term energy crisis, is fine as long as those additional emissions that are now being put out through that are reduced in another sector or, like, in the next few years are reduced.\n\nSCHMITZ: But that, she says, would require trusting the German government to do that.\n\nMARSCHALL: And we don't have that trust - right? - because it does not look like the government is taking the situation of multiple crises that we find ourselves in very seriously.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nSCHMITZ: Back at the market in Kreuzberg, Ulrikie Steinke agrees.\n\nSTEINKE: (Through interpreter) On the one hand, we need to source energy quickly. On the other hand, the money the government is throwing at fossil fuels and maybe even nuclear power plants should be invested in renewables so that we have options in the near future.\n\nSCHMITZ: Sure, Germans will have to tighten their belts for a couple of winters, but the retired teacher poses the question - wouldn't it be a good lesson for us?

    "Germany promised Ukraine weapons but hasn't delivered. Now, anger toward Berlin is rising": "Soldiers drive a \"Marder\" infantry fighting vehicle of the German armed forces Bundeswehr during the informative educational practice \"Land Operation Exercise 2017\" at the military training area in Munster, northern Germany. Afp Contributor | Afp | Getty Images\n\nUkraine's relations with Germany have soured this week, with Kyiv asking why Berlin reneged on its promise to provide heavy weaponry. Tensions over Germany's provision of Leopard tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine — or lack thereof — came to a head this week when Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, publicly asked why Berlin was backtracking on a pledge made to send these weapons to Ukraine. \"Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now — to liberate people and save them from genocide,\" Kuleba said on Twitter, adding that there was \"not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses.\"\n\nwatch now\n\n\"What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?\" he added. The Marder is a German infantry fighting vehicle designed to be used alongside Leopard battle tanks in combat. Kuleba's comments came as Ukraine launches counterattacks against Russian forces in both the south and northeast of the country. Ukraine's counterattack in the northeast Kharkiv region was hailed as a particular success, with Russian forces withdrawing from towns and villages across the region, almost completely deoccupying it.\n\nA new Leopard 2 A7V heavy battle tank Bundeswehr's 9th Panzer Training Brigade stands during a visit by German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht to the Bundeswehr Army training grounds on February 07, 2022 in Munster, Germany. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nUkraine is largely reliant on Western weapons systems to fight Russian forces. And its allies in the West, NATO members essentially, have individually sent Ukraine a vast range of military hardware. In April, Germany promised to give Leopard tanks and Marders to Ukraine. Rather than deliver them directly, it proposed a swap scheme. The intention was that NATO members, Poland or Slovakia for example, could send Ukraine older Soviet-era tanks (such as Leopard 1s), and Germany would then replenish their stocks with its own more modern equivalent weapons (such as Leopard 2s). Germany justified the proposal to send older weapons by saying that Ukraine's forces were used to Soviet-era weapons, and that it should only supply weapons they know how to use. The only problem with the plan is that this exchange of weapons has largely failed to materialize and Germany is now facing a backlash from critics, both within Germany and externally — and not least of all, from a disappointed Ukraine.\n\nOne of the arguments is that they are afraid of further escalation — but that's an invalid argument because it's like, an escalation to what? It's bad enough as it is. Yuri Sak Ukrainian defense ministry official\n\nYuriy Sak, an advisor to Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, told CNBC on Wednesday that Kyiv doesn't understand Berlin's reluctance to send it weapons that could prove decisive on the battlefield. \"It's difficult to read their minds, but Germany's words, during the last seven months on a number of occasions, have not been matched by their actions. And this is disappointing because there was a moment in time when they made this commitment that they would provide Ukraine with these tanks, it was a moment of hope and promise that we looked forward to,\" he noted. \"If they're afraid of some nuclear strikes or some other attacks on the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, which could result in major tragedy, it's another story but as far as the situation on the battlefield is concerned, we don't understand the logic behind it. It could be some internal political games as well,\" he noted.\n\nKyiv wants weapons, Germany has them\n\nUkraine's need for more weapons comes as the war enters what could be a definitive phase in which the balance shifts in Kyiv's favor. Russia was seen to have been taken by surprise by Ukraine's latest counterattacks, having redeployed some of its most effective fighting units to southern Ukraine after Kyiv signaled over the summer it would launch a counteroffensive to retake Kherson. After what seemed like a brief period of stunned silence as it took in Ukraine's rapid victories and advances in the northeast, Russian forces have begun their response to those wins, launching an intense series of attacks on energy infrastructure in the northeast, as well as missile strikes on the south.\n\nwatch now\n\nAll the while, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Ukraine's international allies to continue sending weapons, saying this is when it needs them most to maintain the momentum. And it's weapons like Germany's Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles, that Ukraine says could change the balance of the war definitively. Among Ukraine's NATO allies, Germany — the self-professed \"leader of Europe\" — has attracted criticism and even ridicule for its military assistance to Ukraine. Just before Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, Germany's offer to send thousands of helmets to Ukraine was met with derision. Analysts say that criticism is not entirely deserved, however, noting that after the U.S. and U.K., Germany has been one of the biggest donors of weapons to Ukraine. Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans run a Dutch open-source intelligence defense analysis website and keep a tally of weapons Germany has delivered to Ukraine. They note on their site that, to date, these deliveries include a number of Gepard SPAAGs (self-propelled anti-aircraft guns), man-portable air defense systems (known as MANPADS, they're portable surface-to-air missiles), howitzers, and anti-tank weapons, as well as hundreds of vehicles and millions of rounds of ammunition. The German government has also published a list of the military equipment it has sent to Ukraine, right down to 125 pairs of binoculars it has donated.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz observes damages as he visits with French President Emmanuel Macron, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine June 16, 2022. Viacheslav Ratynskyi | Reuters\n\nBut when it comes to German tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, Germany has ostensibly dragged its feet, with no decision on the supply of such hardware, let alone deliveries, made despite Ukraine's specific requests from Kuleba and other officials since March. Analysts say Germany's good intentions have just not come to fruition. \"Germany has ... attempted to entice other countries to send their heavy weaponry to Ukraine in a programme known as 'Ringtausch' ('exchange'). Under this policy, countries can receive German armament free of charge in exchange for delivering tanks and infantry fighting vehicles from own stocks to Ukraine,\" Mitzer and Oliemans noted in an article in early September. \"Although a promising scheme at first, the 'Ringtausch' programme has largely failed to live up to expectations as most countries expect to have their Soviet-era systems replaced by larger numbers of modern weapon systems than what Berlin is currently able (or willing) to offer,\" they noted.\n\nWhat does Germany say?\n\nPressure has been mounting on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to make a decision on sending such weapons to Ukraine, but there appears to be reluctance at the top to take that decision. On Monday, Germany's defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, said sending more heavy weaponry to Ukraine was \"not so simple.\" \"It's not so simple just to say: I'll just risk that we won't be able to act, the defense of the country, by giving everything away. No, I won't do that,\" she said. \"But we have other possibilities, from industry, with our partners,\" Deutsche Welle reported. CNBC contacted the German Defense Ministry for more comment, and a response to Kuleba's comments, and is yet to receive a response. Scholz defended Germany's record over weapons deliveries on Wednesday, however, telling reporters that \"it can be said that the very weapons that Germany has now provided to Ukraine are decisive to the development of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and they have also made the difference\" in battle. Germany's reticence over certain arms deliveries has prompted some critics to look for ulterior motives for its reluctance, with some even suggesting that Germany does not like the idea of German tanks facing Russian tanks on the battlefield, as they did in World War II.\n\n\"We have no alternative. It is about our independence, about our future, about the fate of the entire Ukrainian people,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (pictured here on June 16). Ludovic Marin | Reuters\n\nRafael Loss, a defense expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC Wednesday that the German government has put forward various explanations for not sending the weapons. \"The German government itself has put forward explanations for why not to do so, essentially, since the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine and even before that. We've heard concerns about the potential for escalation, that Russia might see the transfer of such weapons as some kind of red line.\" \"We see concerns, mostly from the SPD (Scholz's Social Democratic Party) about the images that German Leopard tanks might produce going toe to toe with Russian tanks in Ukraine. And we've also heard in the past arguments about the tight timeline as a reason for sending the Soviet-produced materiel first. I think that that is a legitimate argument. But it only holds up so long,\" he said. \"At some point, Ukraine — and the countries that will be able to support Ukraine with these types of systems — will run out of them, and you can't replace them as easily. So at some point, you need to start thinking about Western supply chains that are based on Western western systems.\" Loss characterized Germany's stance toward Ukraine as one of \"immense\" resistance to sending weapons unilaterally, and that it would prefer some kind of European coalition that jointly sends arms and assistance. \"Over the past six or four months, we've seen an immense reluctance both from the Chancellery and from the Defense Ministry to be proactive, to take the initiative and they've always referred to 'not going it alone,'\" Loss said, adding that Germany appeared to want the U.S. to take the lead and for Berlin to follow.\n\nUkraine left waiting",

    "Pressure mounts on Germany’s Scholz to send tanks to Ukraine": "The warning shots are getting closer and louder.\n\nIn a heated parliamentary session on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received stark signals from his coalition partners that they expect him to ramp up weapons supplies to Ukraine at what is becoming an increasingly critical inflection point of the war.\n\nWhile his government coalition bought him a little more time in the Bundestag debate and temporarily fended off a critical parliamentary motion expressing a lack of faith in his military support for Ukraine, it is now looking more and more likely Scholz will have to respond to the calls for Europe’s biggest economy to pull its weight when it comes to arming Kyiv more decisively.\n\nWitheringly, opposition lawmaker Florian Hahn from the center-right Christian Social Union fumed that Germany was only “number 18 in the world” when comparing its military aid for Ukraine relative to the economic output. Hahn noted that Estonia was far ahead of Germany in supplying arms instead of keeping them for national defense, “even though they have a direct border with the Russian Federation.”\n\nThe center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) opposition block had requested a vote on a Bundestag motion that urges the government to “immediately” allow the export of German battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. That would have been tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in Scholz’s Ukraine strategy, since the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out such deliveries as long as other Western allies don’t deliver similar heavy gear.\n\nThe opposition’s maneuver was particularly dangerous for Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) because leading politicians from his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), have also demanded the delivery of German Leopard battle tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nTiming is now of the essence. Ukraine is appealing for more weapons as it launches bold counter-offensives against the Russian invaders in the east and south of the country, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is vowing to throw hundreds of thousands of new soldiers into the conflict and is holding fake referendums in occupied territories to incorporate them into Russia.\n\nA vote on weapons deliveries in the Bundestag would have risked revealing fatal cracks in the government unity and could even have led to a defeat of Scholz in parliament.\n\nFollowing a heated 50-minute debate, however, the majority of SPD, Greens and FDP lawmakers voted to send the opposition’s motion to the foreign affairs and economic affairs committees for further discussion. That effectively delays a plenary vote on the text for a few weeks.\n\nStill, the government now also faces the risk of renewed pressure next week as the opposition “could request a plenary vote” on another tanks-for-Ukraine motion that the CDU/CSU initially put forward in June but which was also delayed at the time by delegating it to committee level, the CDU’s Roderich Kiesewetter told POLITICO.\n\nThe SPD’s foreign policy spokesperson Nils Schmid argued that Thursday’s delay of the vote was justified because the opposition was merely orchestrating a political attack, hoping to weaken the government’s unity.\n\nScholz, who was not present at the debate, had said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that Germany would support Ukraine “with all its might: financially, economically, with humanitarian aid and also with weapons.”\n\nPressure from coalition partners\n\nThe most striking part of Thursday’s debate was the intensity of criticism from within the ranks of Scholz’s own coalition. Senior lawmakers from the Greens and FDP expressed clear disapproval of the chancellor’s position and stressed that they want Germany to send more heavy arms.\n\n“As Free Democrats, we believe that in the current military situation, in which Ukraine is reclaiming its territory, piece by piece, we must supply at least the Fuchs armored transport vehicle and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle — and if the situation requires it, the Leopard main battle tank as well,” said the FDP’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag’s defense committee.\n\nCrucially, Strack-Zimmermann cited the “Zeitenwende” — a historic shift in German foreign and security policy that Scholz announced in February in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — to argue that Scholz shouldn’t justify his reluctance to send tanks by arguing that other allies like the U.S. weren’t sending modern tanks to Ukraine either.\n\n“Zeitenwende doesn’t just mean doing more for the German armed forces, it also means taking leadership and not waiting for our partners to take uncomfortable decisions from us,” she said.\n\nThe Greens’ co-leader Omid Nouripour delivered a broadside against concerns among Social Democrats that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine could trigger an “irrational” escalation by Putin — a fear that was most recently expressed by the SPD’s Secretary General Kevin Kühnert.\n\n“There are arguments that I cannot follow,” Nouripour told the Bundestag. “That our weapons would lead to an escalation presupposes that the Russian side needs excuses for escalation. That is grotesque. Of course they don’t need excuses, the aggression is there,” Nouripour said in reference to Putin’s announcement on Wednesday to mobilize up to 300,000 reservists.\n\nSpent cartridges at a former position of Russian troops in the Kharkiv area, Ukraine, September 22, 2022 | Oleksandr Ratushniak/EPA-EFE\n\nMoving up from No. 18\n\nGermany has so far sent 30 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 10 Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers and three Mars multiple rocket launchers, as well as various lighter weapons, to Ukraine, according to a government list.\n\nFollowing growing pressure at home and from allies, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced last week that Berlin would also send 50 “Dingo” armored vehicles and two more Mars rocket launchers — contradicting her own arguments from a few days earlier that Germany could not spare any further weapons in support of Ukraine.\n\nStill, despite these increases, Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, argued that Germany had a historical and moral obligation to step up its support for Ukraine.\n\n“If, in the light of mass graves in Bucha and Izium, we are serious in saying: ‘Never again! Germany must ensure that something never happens again’ — then we have to go a decisive step further here,” he said."
