    "How great partnerships can lead to effective service delivery in Bangladesh": "These achievements are not without its challenges. Health facilities can easily be overwhelmed, as was the case during the usually high outbreak of dengue fever this year. Similarly, earlier this year, when a fire broke out, it led to 70 beds in the SARI ITC being destroyed. It highlights the degree of vulnerability and the risks that continue to constrain service delivery efforts.\n\nThe close collaboration between the government and partners will continue to be crucial in developing and sustaining critical service delivery systems for both the DRPs and the host communities. The provision of family planning services at the Camp 3 primary health care center, which I also had the chance to visit, is a terrific example of how partnerships can lead to beneficial results – with the government providing the facility while UN agencies like International Organization for Migration, United Nations Population Fund, World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank crowdsourcing the provision of equipment, technical assistance, and renovation support. The DRPs and the host communities' lives are being positively impacted as a direct result of this support from The World Bank.\n\nI am hoping to talk to more people like Jannatul and Mohammed in the future to continue to gauge our impact on the ground.",

Ahad, File)\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh -- Standing in line to try to buy food, Rekha Begum is distraught. Like many others in Bangladesh, she is struggling to find affordable daily essentials like rice, lentils and onions.\n\n“I went to two other places, but they told me they don’t have supplies. Then I came here and stood at the end of the queue,” said Begum, 60, as she waited for nearly two hours to buy what she needed from a truck selling food at subsidized prices in the capital, Dhaka.\n\nBangladesh’s economic miracle is under severe strain as fuel price hikes amplify public frustrations over rising costs for food and other necessities. Fierce opposition criticism and small street protests have erupted in recent weeks, adding to pressures on the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has sought help from the International Monetary Fund to safeguard the country’s finances.\n\nExperts say Bangladesh’s predicament is nowhere nearly as severe as Sri Lanka’s, where months’ long unrest led its long-time president to flee the country and people are enduring outright shortages of food, fuel and medicines, spending days in queues for essentials. But it faces similar troubles: excessive spending on ambitious development projects, public anger over corruption and cronyism and a weakening trade balance.\n\nSuch trends are undermining Bangladesh’s impressive progress, fueled largely by its success as a garment manufacturing hub, toward becoming a more affluent, middle-income country.\n\nThe government raised fuel prices by more than 50% last month to counter soaring costs due to high oil prices, triggering protests over the rising cost of living. That led authorities to order the subsidized sales of rice and other staples by government-appointed dealers.\n\nThe latest phase of the program, which began Sept. 1, should help about 50 million people, said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.\n\n“The government has taken a number of measures to reduce pressures on low-income earners. That is impacting the market and keeping prices of daily commodities competitive,” he said.\n\nThe policies are a stopgap for bigger global and domestic challenges.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has pushed higher prices of many commodities at a time when they already were surging as demand recovered with a waning of the coronavirus pandemic. In the meantime, countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos — among many — have seen their currencies weaken against the dollar, adding to the costs for dollar-denominated imports of oil and other goods.\n\nTo ease the strain on public finances and foreign reserves, the authorities put a moratorium on big, new projects, cut office hours to save energy and imposed limits on imports of luxury goods and non-essential items, such as sedans and SUVs.\n\n“The Bangladesh economy is facing strong headwinds and turbulence,” said Ahmad Ahsan, an economist and director of the Dhaka-based Policy Research Institute, a thinktank. “Suddenly we are back to the era of rolling power cuts, with the taka and the forex reserves under pressure,” he said.\n\nMillions of low-income Bangladeshis, like Begum, whose family of five can barely afford to eat fish or meat even once a month, still struggle to put food on the table.\n\nBangladesh has made huge strides in the past two decades in growing its economy and fighting poverty. Investments in garment manufacturing have provided jobs for tens of millions of workers, mostly women. Exports of apparel and related products account for more than 80% of its exports.\n\nBut with fuel costs so high, authorities shut diesel-run power plants that produced at least 6% of total production, cutting daily power generation by 1,500 megawatts and disrupting manufacturing.\n\nImports in the last fiscal year, ending in June, 2022, rose to $84 billion, while exports have fluctuated, leaving a record current account deficit of $17 billion.\n\nMore challenges are ahead.\n\nDeadlines are fast approaching for repaying foreign loans related to at least 20 mega infrastructure projects, including the $3.6 billion River Padma bridge built by China and a nuclear power plant mostly funded by Russia. Experts say Bangladesh needs to prepare for when repayment schedules ramp up between 2024 and 2026.\n\nIn July, in a move economists view as a precautionary measure, Bangladesh sought a $4.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, becoming the third country in South Asia to recently seek its help after Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nFinance Minister A.H.M. Mustafa Kamal said that the government asked the IMF to begin formal negotiations on loans “for balance of payments and budgetary assistance.” The IMF said it was working with Bangladesh to draw up a plan.\n\nBangladesh's foreign reserves have been falling, potentially undermining its ability to meet its loan obligations. By Wednesday they had dropped to $36.9 billion from $45.5 billion a year earlier, according to the central bank.\n\nUsable foreign reserves would be about $30 billion, said Zahid Hussain, a former chief economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office.\n\n“I would not say this is a crisis situation. This is still enough to meet three months of imports, three and half months of imports. But it also means that … you do not have a lot of room for maneuvering on the reserve front,” he said.\n\nStill, despite what some economists say is excessive spending on some costly projects, Bangladesh is better equipped to weather hard times than some other countries in the region.\n\nIts farm sector — tea, rice and jute are major exports — is an effective “shock absorber,” and its economy, four to five times larger than Sri Lanka’s, is less vulnerable to outside calamities like a downturn in tourism.\n\nThe economy is forecast to grow at a 6.6% pace this fiscal year, according to the Asia Development Bank's latest forecast, and the country's total debt is still relatively small.\n\n“I think in the current context, the most important difference between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh is the debt burden, particularly the external debt,” said Hussain.\n\nBangladesh’s external debt is under 20% of its gross domestic product, while Sri Lanka’s was around 126% in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n“So, we have some space. I mean debt as a source of stress on the macroeconomy is not much of a much problem yet,” he said.\n\nWaiting in a line to buy subsidized food, 48-year-old Mohammed Jamal said he was not feeling such leeway for his own family.\n\n“It has become unbearable trying to maintain our standard of living,\" Jamal said. “Prices are just out of reach for the common people,” he said. “It's tough living this way.”",
    "Bangladesh eye win against Nepal": "Bangladesh national football team players attend a training session at the Army sports ground in Kathmandu on Monday.— BFF photo\n\nAfter a 1-0 win over Cambodia on Thursday, the Bangladesh national football team will be looking to secure their second consecutive win on the international stage when they take on hosts Nepal in another FIFA friendly match in Kathmandu today.\n\nThe match will begin at 5:45pm Bangladesh Standard Time at the Dashrath Stadium, where the Bangladesh women’s team made history a week ago by clinching their maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title with a 3-1 win over Nepal in the final.\n\nSpanish coach Javier Cabrera’s charges reached Nepal from Cambodia on September 23 – a day after they beat hosts Cambodia - and had a three-day long training session in Kathmandu.\n\nThe win against Cambodia was the first win for Bangladesh under the Spaniard’s tutelage since he replaced English coach Jamie Day in January this year.\n\nCabrera believed that the win against Cambodia would inspire his charges to earn another win against Nepal.\n\n‘Obviously, Cambodia’s win is a big boost for the players’ anyway the players are positive, the group is confident, and every day they work hard enough to win tomorrow’s [Tuesday] game. They will give their best to win, ‘Cabrera said in the pre-match press conference on Monday.\n\nBangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyian was a bit cautious as Nepal would be playing at their home.\n\n‘It is Nepal’s home ground and we have to respect the home team…We want to be competitive tomorrow to win the match,’ said Jamal.\n\nNepal team’s interim coach, Pradip Humagain, vowed to present the country with a win as they will be celebrating the Durga Puja, beginning on October 1.\n\n‘It’s a great opportunity for us on the occasion of our great festival to play with our neighboring country, Bangladesh, in our homeland. When we play, we play to win, ‘Pradip said ahead of his first international assignment with the national team.\n\nNepal team captain Kiron Kumar Limbu said, ’It’s going to be an interesting match against Bangladesh. And as always, it is going to be exciting before the home crowds.’\n\nAlongside the home venue advantages, the latest FIFA rankings show that the Nepalese are stronger than Bangladesh, who are 16 steps behind Nepal (176th).\n\nThe most recent game results statistics also favoured Nepal, as Bangladesh could only manage a 2-0 win against Nepal in a friendly game in November 2020, while losing twice and drawing twice since September 2018.\n\nHowever, the overall statistics tell a different story, with Bangladesh winning 13 times, drawing three times, and losing seven times in their previous 20 meetings since September 1983.",
    "Tensions as Bangladesh accuses Myanmar of firing in its territory": "Weeks of firing from Myanmar escalates tensions between the neighbours, raising concerns of a new Rohingya exodus into Bangladesh.\n\nDhaka, Bangladesh – Mohammad Yunus, a 45-year-old resident of Ghumdhum in Bangladesh’s hilly district of Bandarban along the Myanmar border says he has not been able to sleep properly for weeks.\n\nThe reason? Weeks of relentless cross-border gunfire and shelling by the Myanmar military, which experts say could be a way to push more Rohingya into Bangladesh.\n\n“We are not able to sleep at night. There are constant sounds of firing guns. Sometimes there are explosions,” Yunus told Al Jazeera over the telephone.\n\n“We have left our house and moved to a relative’s place. We are scared for our lives,” he said.\n\nThe firing from Myanmar has escalated tensions between the neighbours, raising concerns of a new Rohingya exodus into Bangladesh as well as diminishing prospects of their repatriation into Myanmar.\n\nThe Bandarban administration said it has started the process of relocating some 300 families living in Ghumdhum to a safer place further inland. The no-man’s land in the frontier area is also home to about 4,500 Rohingya refugees.\n\nLast Friday, a Rohingya teenager was killed and four other Bangladeshi nationals injured when mortar shells fired from Myanmar exploded on a strip of land along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.\n\nBangladesh has the world’s largest refugee camp with nearly a million mainly Muslim Rohingya, most of whom fled a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military in 2017, which the United Nations said was carried out with “genocidal intent”.\n\nMyanmar has been charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Myanmar’s military denies the charges.\n\nBangladesh is lobbying with international agencies to repatriate the Rohingya back to their homeland, but the refugees have refused, citing safety concerns, and continue to stay in squalid and cramped camps.\n\nNow, weeks of relentless gunfire and shelling by the Myanmar military along its border with Bangladesh have added to the tensions between the neighbours.\n\nLocal media reports earlier this month said more than a dozen Rohingya have entered Bangladesh amid the cross-border firing, seeking refuge in camps near Teknaf. Hundreds more Rohingya have gathered near the border in a bid to cross the Naf River into Bangladesh, the reports added.\n\nBangladesh foreign minister A K Abdul Momen this week said the government has sealed its border with Myanmar to prevent a further influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh.\n\n“We won’t take any more Rohingya people,” Momen told a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Bangladesh’s border protection force, the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), has stepped up vigilance along the 271-kilometre (168-mile) Bangladesh-Myanmar border, Dhaka said it does not want to engage militarily and is seeking to resolve the tension through diplomatic channels.\n\nAung Kyaw Moe, Myanmar’s envoy in Dhaka, has been summoned four times in as many weeks by the Bangladesh foreign ministry, which has raised serious concerns over mortar shells falling on its territory, indiscriminate aerial firing and airspace violations.\n\nMoe said the firings into Bangladeshi territory were conducted by the Arakan Army, an armed group fighting the Myanmar military for the rights of the ethnic minorities in Myanmar’s Rakhine and Chin states.\n\nSince early August, fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army has increased along the border.\n\nA top official at the Bangladesh foreign ministry told Moe the shells falling into Bangladesh were unacceptable. He said the dispute between Arakan Army and Myanmar military was their “internal affair” and how they chose to solve it was “completely up to them”.\n\nDelwar Hossain, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, believes Myanmar military firing across the border and airspace violations by Myanmar could be ways to provoke Bangladesh to engage militarily.\n\n“It will sort of divert the international attention from their internal conflicts with different ethnic minority groups that have been going on for long,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said Bangladesh was on the right track so far by not falling into Myanmar’s trap.\n\nHossain said Myanmar could be trying to force another Rohingya influx into Bangladesh’s territory.\n\n“Myanmar also aims to make things more difficult so that the Rohingyas’ repatriation can be put off even longer. They see advantages if they can cause strife or military action in Bangladesh,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bangladesh’s home minister Asaduzzaman Khan held a meeting with the country’s security and law enforcement agencies. He later said the Bangladesh army was ready to defend the country if instructed to do so.\n\nAlso on the same day, Bangladesh army chief General S M Shafiuddin Ahmed said his troops were prepared to respond against Myanmar if necessary.\n\nForeign minister Momen, however, again stressed on Wednesday that Bangladesh had no intention of going to war with its neighbour and hoped the situation could be resolved diplomatically.\n\nBangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly, is expected to raise the issue in a speech scheduled later on Friday.\n\nHasina is also expected to urge global leaders to play an active role in arranging the repatriation of Rohingya refugees.\n\nShafqat Munir, senior research fellow at the think-tank, Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, told Al Jazeera the Bangladesh government has taken “absolutely the right steps in taking the diplomatic approach”.\n\n“Our goal should be to solve the problem diplomatically and through dialogue. Military solution is not required at this point,” he said.\n\n“We, however, must be on guard against any prospect of fresh influx of Rohingya or any other displaced Myanmar nationals. We also need to make sure that our voices are heard in the international community.”",
    "Afif Hossain's 77* saves Bangladesh's blushes": "Bangladesh 158 for 5 (Afif 77*, Nurul 35*, Meiyappan 2-33) beat United Arab Emirates 151 (Suri 39, Afzal 25, Miraz 3-17, Shoriful 3-21) by seven runs\n\nAfif Hossain and Mehidy Hasan Miraz led Bangladesh out of trouble an occasion each as they beat UAE by seven runs in the first T20I in Dubai. In front of a sparse crowd mostly made up of expat Bangladeshis, the visitors picked up their first T20I win in the country.\n\nAfter being put in, Bangladesh recovered from 47 for 4, then withstood Chirag Suri 's fiery start with the bat, before 16-year-old debutant Aayan Khan gave them a final scare in the last three overs of the 159-run chase.\n\nAfif top-scored with an unbeaten 77 while Miraz took three wickets and two superb catches, one of his own bowling, before Shoriful Islam's two wickets in the last over sealed the game for Bangladesh.\n\nOpening woes continue for Bangladesh\n\nSabbir Rahman and Miraz walking out to open the innings for Bangladesh laid to rest all the speculation about the opening pair since their curtailed training camp in Dhaka a couple of weeks ago.\n\nTheir stand, however, lasted just nine balls when Sabbir struck Sabir Ali down to Basil Hameed at deep square leg. Miraz also didn't look too comfortable, falling for 12 off 14 balls with two fours, top-edging one back to the fast bowler Zawar Farid in the fifth over.\n\nIn between, the returning Litton Das also fell for 13, although he did start with a lot of intent, hitting three boundaries.\n\nMeiyappan's double-strike\n\nBangladesh got into further trouble when legspinner Karthik Meiyappan removed Yasir Ali with his first ball. The delivery held its line, sending the visitors into a tail-spin at 47 for 4 in the eighth over. Meiyappan has been a revelation since his debut last year, having now taken 16 wickets in ten T20Is. When he lured Mosaddek Hossain out of the crease, and had him stumped for three, it looked like UAE were on the ascendancy.\n\nAfif to the rescue, again\n\nAfif, though, stood firm amid a flurry of wickets. He has already been Bangladesh's leading run-scorer in T20Is this year, so there was a bit of consistency expected of him. He dominated the 30-run stand for the fifth wicket with Mosaddek, before adding 81 in an unbroken stand with captain Nurul Hasan.\n\nLuck was also on Afif's side. He was dropped at deep square leg twice, on 2 and 63. But he struck the ball well through the leg side, regularly hitting it behind square, which seems to be one of his favoured areas this year. He missed a few scoops and ramps, and the straighter bat shots yielded more runs. He finished with three sixes and seven fours - Bangladesh will be happy that they have at one batter who is showing good form.\n\nSuri lights up UAE's chase\n\nSuri started with a boundary spree but Bangladesh had a lucky break in the middle. In the fifth over, a shot from Suri brushed bowler Shoriful's fingers on its way to the stumps at the non-striker's end to find Muhammad Waseem out of his crease. Waseem had struck a four and a six in his run-a-ball 15, but the home side needed a harder push.\n\nSuri then struck the ball brilliantly against Mustafizur Rahman in the last over of the powerplay. He timed the ball behind square on the off side for two fours before adding a third with a swivelled pull when Mustafizur came around the wicket. The 14-run over took UAE to 43 for 1 after six overs.\n\nMiraz comes to the party\n\nThe chasing, however, fell flat when Miraz got into the act. He had Suri stumped in the eighth over for 39 off 24 balls. In his next over, he had the dangerous Aryan Lakra for 19.\n\nAfter that, it was the turn of Miraz the fielder. UAE captain CP Rizwan tried to crack Mustafizur through point, but Miraz dived to his left to complete an excellent catch. Shoriful then removed Basil Hameed, before Miraz took his second brilliant catch of the game. Off his own bowling, he dived full length, once again to his left, to intercept Vriitya Aravind's leading edge.",
    "Bangladesh’s RMG industry preparing for next phase of growth": "Bangladesh's RMG industry preparing for next phase of growth\n\nThe RMG industry of Bangladesh has “immense potential for growth”, Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Exporters Association (BGMEA) has said, playing a crucial role in propelling the economic development of the country.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Dhaka last week, organised by the National Security Intelligence Training Institute (NSITI), Azim said, as a mainstay of Bangladesh’s economic success story, the apparel sector has continued its endeavours to seize every opportunity that lies ahead and contributes to the development of the country.\n\n“The industry is increasingly focusing on product diversification, innovation, technology upgradation and skill development in a bid to enhance its capabilities and competitiveness in the global market in the coming days,” he added.\n\nThe BGMEA recently urged investment in the country’s readymade garment sector as it gears up for graduation from its status as a least developed country (LDC). The country is expected to graduate from LDC status in 2024, however, it will continue to benefit from duty-free access to the European Union, Canada, and Japan until 2027.\n\nThe country’s growth in recent years has resulted in a decline in poverty levels, stable inflation, moderate public debt, and greater resilience to external shocks.\n\nIn his keynote speech last week, Azim gave an overview of Bangladesh’s RMG industry, including its challenges, opportunities, and preparedness to realise its potential. He also briefed the audience about the RMG industry’s future priorities, including upgrading business capabilities and embracing innovation to address future challenges of the RMG industry, especially after LDC graduation.\n\nThe industry is focusing on diversifying products, especially man-made fibre-based products as part of its strategy of shifting from volume to value and quantity to quality, he said.\n\n“Globally the share of cotton textile and clothing consumption is 25% only, whereas 75% of Bangladesh’s RMG product is concentrated on cotton. This means we have tremendous opportunities in this segment,” he remarked.\n\nHe also briefed the participants about the strategic vision of the BGMEA that aims to accelerate the growth of the RMG industry in a sustainable manner.\n\nLast month, the BGMEA announced a new sourcing event aimed at showcasing sustainability strides being made by Bangladesh garment makers and comprises 17 physical events including conferences, expositions, fashion runway shows, sustainable design and innovation awards, and factory tours.",

    "Liberal trade could boost Bangladesh’s GDP by 14.8%: World Bank study": "Infographic: TBS\n\nUnilateral trade and investment liberalisation could boost Bangladesh's GDP, investment, and exports by 14.8%, 20%, and 63.2%, respectively, according to a World Bank study.\n\nSuch unilateral reforms will help Bangladesh reduce trade costs and access to cheaper and better-quality imported inputs to boost domestic firms' competitiveness and output, it says, pointing out that Bangladesh's trade competitiveness is eroding mainly due to lack of lower export base.\n\nFor greater market access for exports, Bangladesh needs to explore deeper and comprehensive trade integration within the region and beyond, suggests the report \"Bangladesh- Country Economic Memorandum: Change of fabric,\" which was disclosed on the bank's website on Friday.\n\nIts chapter 3 on \"Boosting Bangladesh's Trade Competitiveness\" studies the potential gains for Bangladesh from regional and multinational integration as well as trade reforms.\n\nThe report, while calling for deeper bilateral integration with India and the European Union, estimates that the impact of a preferential trade agreement with India will be higher, with export gains more than double the benefits of an agreement with the European Union.\n\nBangladesh could also reap significant benefits from participating in regional integration with South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, with an estimated increase in GDP between 1.4% and 14.3%, it estimates.\n\nBangladesh's trade intensity is lower than predicted for countries at similar levels of per capita income and the country is missing out on gains from trade due to an inward-looking trade regime, it points out.\n\nWhile tariff modernisation is an important step to support export diversification, an ambitious trade agenda that covers goods, services, and investment can boost the gains for Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh's gains from a deep regional integration scenario are estimated to be more than 10 times higher compared with shallow regional integration relying on tariff cuts only, the study estimates in its designated chapter.\n\nGiven historical political tensions, the degree of regional integration in South Asia is very low compared with other world regions, it points out. Despite growth over the past 20 years, trade and investment linkages between Bangladesh and South Asia are still constrained by high tariffs and NTBs, and burdensome and costly customs procedures, it says, suggesting that Bangladesh can focus on strategies that go beyond South Asia and include countries in Southeast Asia and beyond as well as pursue free trade agreements.\n\n\"Bangladeshi policy makers may consider joining existing regional groupings such as ASEAN or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,\" reads the report.\n\nCommenting on the study, Dr Zahid Hossain, former chief economist of the World Bank in Dhaka, said Bangladesh can benefit from regional connectivity and signing FTAs with South Asia and South-East Asian countries. But in that case, along with achieving progress in ease of doing business, initiatives should be taken to remove existing tariff and non-tariff barriers in various markets.\n\nWhile speaking high of regional and multinational integration, the World Bank study also points to the possible downsides in some areas.\n\n\"Bangladesh has a lot to lose from missing out on intraregional Southeast Asia integration, with GDP gains cut to about a third and export gains at less than a fifth compared with the open regionalism scenario,\" it assesses.\n\nRemoval of tariff wall needed for an export boost\n\nThe lack of export diversification may be at least partly attributed to the country's protective trade regime.\n\nThe high level of protection, provided through high tariffs and complex and nontransparent para-tariffs, such as regulatory and supplementary duties, is a key reason for the static export basket, it identifies.\n\nBangladesh's average tariffs doubled from 14.7% without para-tariffs to 28.8% with para-tariffs in FY2021, incentivising industries to focus on the domestic market rather than exports, thus creating creating an anti-export bias, the study points out, suggesting that reduction in protective tariff rate by 3-5% every year in line with the Eighth Five Year Plan.\n\nAverage tariffs in Bangladesh are higher than its competitors. Average tariff rate on intermediate goods in Bangladesh is 18.8%, which is more than double the rate in China (7.4%) and almost double the rate in Thailand and Vietnam (9.6%) but closer to the rate in India (14.7%).\n\nModernisation of tariff regime by moving toward low and uniform tariffs and adopting a single rate for similar goods, irrespective of origin, gradual elimination of para-tariffs and making the tariff structure consistent with that of an upper-middle-income country can end the \"anti-export\" bias and help diversify exports, the report suggests.\n\nBenefit from US-China tariff war\n\nBangladesh could also benefit in the short term from trade diversion if the United States and China were to engage in sustained trade tensions and keep retaliatory tariffs in place.\n\n\"Even in the absence of any additional reform measures, GDP in Bangladesh is estimated to increase by 0.4 percent,\" says the report.\n\nAssuming that Bangladesh can capitalise on the opportunities provided by US-China trade diversion and expand exports to respond to these new sources of demand in the United States and China, exports could expand by 0.7%, it estimates.\n\nDr MA Razzaque, research director of Policy Research Institute, told The Business Standard that Bangladesh has already begun to enjoy some of the benefits of the US-China tariff conflict. The high growth in Bangladesh's garment exports to the US market over the past few months has been made possible due to the US-China conflict.\n\nHe said that China's share of the US RMG market is still about 25% which will decrease further in the coming days.\n\n\"For Bangladesh to export a portion of that, emphasis should be placed on man-made fibre, because a major part of China's RMG export is man-made fibre,\" he said.\n\nMA Razzaque said, due to the dollar crisis, the exchange rate has been left to the market, so there has been a major reform in terms of export competition.\n\n\"The export sector is getting its benefits. However, Bangladesh's export capacity will not increase unless customs, ports, trade facilities, cargo handling and internal transport systems are modernised. The bottom line is both business costs and time need to be reduced,\" he said.",

The benefits are manifold varying from maternal death and disability, newborn/child mortality and morbidity, unintended pregnancies to decreased abortion. Male and female condoms reduce sexually transmitted infections. Girls and women who can avail family planning have more opportunities to realise their potential; they can have education and contribute to the economy, leading to more prosperous, stable and equitable societies.\n\nEach year, September 26 is observed as World Contraception Day to focus on the rights mentioned above. This is also mentioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) under target 3.7, that states \"by 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.\"\n\nImproved access to low-cost contraception and its uptake through family planning programmes reduce high-risk pregnancies, maternal and child mortality, unplanned pregnancies, and improved child health and nutrition. Studies showed that contraceptive use may have reduced maternal mortality by over 40%. Along with the family planning goals, better and additional options are needed to sustain progress to fight HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe outcome of family planning is beyond health. It is multisectoral and even intergenerational. Improved child health and nutrition can positively influence academic performance and behaviour. On the other hand, education is a key determinant of the uptake and consistency in the use of family planning services. Contraception also expands the socioeconomic opportunities for girls and opens up more educational opportunities for adolescent girls.\n\nEstimates for the economic impact of family planning have found a return of $120 for every dollar spent. Countries must respect and protect vital principles of non-discrimination, equality and privacy, bodily integrity, autonomy, dignity and well-being of individuals, especially concerning sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\nWhile contraceptive use varies across the regions and women, low- and lower-middle-income countries face more obstacles to meet their contraception needs. Access to contraception is complicated and full of barriers for women experiencing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination – such as immigrants, women with disabilities, low-income women, and sex workers.\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, women and adolescent girls have been placed at heightened direction and indirect risks of unwanted and unsupportable pregnancies due to lockdowns, service disruptions, stockouts, financial hardships and an increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual violence. One year into the pandemic, 12 million women may have lost access to contraception, and 1.4 million unintended pregnancies may have occurred during 2020 across 115 low and middle-income countries, according to UNFPA estimates. These constraints have emerged in addition to the chronic obstacles, including lack of access to information on contraception, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, as well as harmful gender stereotypes and norms.\n\nAs demonstrated in several instances, contraception is not always as efficacious as indicated, and Governments and private companies should be held accountable in cases where defective contraceptives are circulated. Also, there are many cases where contraception methods fail. Therefore, access to safe and legal abortion services is crucial to ensure women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\nVictims or survivors of sexual violence should avail emergency contraception and safe abortion procedures when a pregnancy results. It should be a standard protocol – its absence represents a violation of women's human rights.\n\nBangladesh context:\n\nA Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) reports that 62% of newly married women aged 15–49 years in Bangladesh use contraceptive methods, and 54% use a modern method. The rate of contraceptive use has increased significantly from eight percent in 1975, to 62% in 2014.\n\nThe Government of Bangladesh's pledge at the London Summit on Family Planning includes increasing contraceptive access and use among poor people in urban and rural areas and improving the choice and availability of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs). The Government plans to increase LAPM use by increasing the supply of materials and instruments needed for LAPMs, targeting low-performing areas, raising awareness and outsourcing programs to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to cover hard-to-reach and low-performing areas.\n\nThe family planning programs in Bangladesh — which were once considered a role model for developing countries in particular — are facing daunting challenges in achieving the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) target of 75.0% by 2021 to achieve the low replacement level of fertility. The challenges are even more severe because, in some regions of Bangladesh, the CPR is much lower for several decades, despite continuous interventions by the Government and NGOs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe funding and investment in contraception is inadequate almost everywhere. Governments should implement the legal obligations under human rights standards, and ensure respect and protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health rights. They also should include a comprehensive and scientific sex education in the curricula.\n\nThe writer is a public health communication professional. E-mail: tareq.salahuddin@gmail.com",

    "Celebrating Bangladesh’s family planning success": "Bangladesh faced enormous challenges in 1971, grappling with poverty, limited resources, poor healthcare access, food insecurity, and a rapidly growing population. At the time, one in five children died before they turned five, more than five in 100 mothers died during pregnancy or childbirth, and women gave birth to an average of seven children.\n\nIn this context, the government of the young country prioritized family planning, a pivotal decision that set the stage for the economic growth and improved health and education outcomes that Bangladesh is known for today.\n\nOn World Contraception Day, September 26, the United States congratulates Bangladesh on developing a successful family planning program that helps families plan the timing and number of children with the help of a range of modern and effective contraceptive options. The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is proud to have contributed to this world-renowned success throughout our 50-year partnership.\n\nWhy does family planning matter and how did it help Bangladesh?\n\nAccess to voluntary family planning and reproductive health services provides families with the freedom to choose how many children they want to have, and when to have them. This is a crucial component for promoting safe motherhood and healthy families. Having children spaced too closely together can negatively affect the health of both mothers and children.\n\nWhen parents can focus on long-term goals for their children rather than focusing solely on survival, they invest in education and specialized skills training, save for their futures, and enable children to maximize their potential in life and become productive members of tomorrow’s workforce.\n\nThis benefits families, communities, and entire countries. No country has emerged from poverty in the last 50 years without expanding family planning access. This is why family planning matters.\n\nAs the world’s largest bilateral family planning donor, the US government provided expertise to support Bangladesh’s vision to expand access to high quality family planning methods. Alongside the government of Bangladesh, we worked with non-government organizations, the private sector, and other donors to build knowledge of and demand for family planning, while simultaneously helping the health system to deliver better quality services.\n\nHow did Bangladesh achieve their family planning goals?\n\nFirst, by collecting and using robust evidence. Where the global evidence was scarce, Bangladesh invested in research to build an evidence base. USAID worked with the government of Bangladesh for decades to collect demographic and health data to inform service delivery programs and reach out to people through popular radio and television campaigns.\n\nThese efforts helped elevate family planning from a taboo topic to an essential health service that has saved the lives of millions of mothers and children.\n\nSecond, Bangladesh expanded access to health services and commodities, even in hard-to-reach areas. The country proved to the world that rural women not only benefit, but can effectively deliver health services, including family planning, in their communities.\n\nThis model method became an essential vehicle to deliver health and family planning service delivery around the world.\n\nBangladesh continued to add different methods of family planning to the available services, understanding that men and women have different needs, and not every family planning method is right for everyone.\n\nNow, in addition to health workers providing family planning commodities in rural communities, many family planning methods are widely available in pharmacies, and clinical methods are offered from both public and private sector facilities.\n\nTo ensure a stable, steady supply of contraceptive products, USAID helped Bangladesh build a supply chain management system to effectively deliver family planning commodities when and where they are needed.\n\nBangladesh’s pioneering family planning program advanced global knowledge, and those lessons reduced maternal and child deaths in many other countries around the world. While Bangladesh’s family planning story continues to be written, it is clear that robust family planning programs helped lift an entire country.\n\nBeyond improving the health of women and children, access to contraceptives has given Bangladeshi families the freedom to choose the number of children they want to have and when they want to have them.\n\nThis opened educational and economic opportunities for millions of women. And when incomes and opportunities for women increase, entire communities and countries benefit.\n\nToday, most people say they want two children, which is the average family size in Bangladesh. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Bangladesh and those who have supported its vision over the past 50 years.\n\nKathryn D Stevens is Mission Director, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Bangladesh, United States Embassy, Dhaka.",
    "Millennials of Bangladesh: The generation that grew in democracy, neoliberalism and disparity": "Kazuyo Minamide, a Japanese anthropologist, stayed in Bangladesh for more than 20 years and observed a generation growing up and their transformation through the various stages of their lives - navigating things like life goals and identity politics.\n\nIn 2002, she studied in class four at a primary school in Jamalpur with 38 students. She refers to these 38 as her \"classmates\". Since then, she has documented how her classmates' lives took shape in the Bangladeshi socio-economic context.\n\nHer book Millennial Generation in Bangladesh examines how the characteristics and experiences of the generation born in the 1990s reflect broader changes taking place in Bangladesh.\n\nAlthough the book was published this year in March, the launching programme was held much later on 7 September.\n\nMembers of this generation were born during a political transition period and saw the revival of democracy after a series of military regimes, and they grew up in a society directly influenced by the global push toward neoliberalism. Their struggle represents the dilemmas of contemporary Bangladeshi society in the global setting.\n\nAssisted by eight erudite professors and researchers in the field, the eight-chapter book anthropologically describes different groups of Bangladesh's 1990s generation. Based on fieldwork experience, each author investigates their subjects and examines how they struggle with their specific set of circumstances.\n\nSince 1990, Bangladesh has undertaken various initiatives to ensure the rights of children. With approaches like reproductive care and child nutrition, the rate of infant and child mortality has subsequently declined, making 1990's kids the largest population cohort in the nation's history.\n\nSupported by international aid and other stakeholders, universal education has been a massive priority since Bangladesh's independence. Education became the arena where the aims of the global society for Bangladesh and national globalisation initiatives met. And this Y generation was at the centre of this union, making them the first globally educated generation.\n\nTherefore, the generation underwent many experimental phases. For example, after the 1990s, there were huge changes in every stage of education.\n\nEducation in Bangladesh has three main streams based on the language of education: the Bangla medium, the majority, the English medium, primarily for the economically privileged class, and the Madrasa, which is also divided into Qawmi and Aliya, based on Islamic education.\n\nFor higher studies, there are public universities, private universities and national universities. Again, the national university contains two different curricula for honours courses and degree courses.\n\nEducation by multiple providers and inconsistent policy has meant that not everyone has received a standardised education. The qualitative disparities and a lack of secondary education access have resulted in the majority of the 1990s generation only completing primary school.\n\nHuge qualitative inequality exists among all streams of education. As a result, the more the access to education increased, the more the disparity was exposed.\n\nHowever, the primary school enrollment rate of girls has dramatically increased and exceeded that of boys at the same time, thanks to the support and pressure of international aid. Formal education has created a 'youth period' that did not, at least for young women, exist for previous generations.\n\nMinamide's studies show that more than half of the 1990's generation left their education by the end of the 10th grade. Only 10% to17% remained enrolled in tertiary education. So, in order to fully understand the current situation of the 1990's generation, we, therefore, must look beyond their educational experience.\n\nThere are huge socioeconomic and cultural disparities between the majority cohort, those who received only primary education, and the rest who have got their higher education at universities.\n\nThe effects of globalisation also impact these groups differently. With the advent of global connectivity, a part of the generation became liberal while another group grew fanatic, resulting in events like the 2016 attack on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, commented Minamide.\n\nAlthough contemporary youth in Bangladesh are actively involved in cyberspace, the ways in which they use and communicate online vary significantly.\n\nOn the one hand, they are connected and consuming the global imaginary, while on the other hand, they are separated by the need to react and create their sociality.\n\nChapters 1 and 2 focus on working garment factories as the majority of wage labourers in this sector are members of the 1990s generation. For living, they moved to urban areas, and the author explores whether these youth, through their urban experiences, have urbanised their lifestyle or sense of belonging.\n\nEmployment allowed women to live independently or earn the primary family income, but the belief in an ideal marriage, in which the husband was the main provider, remained intact. According to Minamide the core circumstances for women haven't changed.\n\nThe following couple of chapters investigate the links between higher education and career aspirations among the generation, showing why these young cohorts consider government jobs as the only option that can give them a fair chance to move up both socially and economically.\n\nChapters 5 and 6 deal with the identity politics of urban youth. The final two chapters explore how online identities affected the generation. For the urban youth, the author notes, this online space became the means of debate, discussion, interaction and socialisation, which gave birth to many movements throughout the country.\n\nMinamide ends the book by providing limitations of their study and leaving aspects to be discovered by future researchers.",
    "Human Development Report 2021-22: Takeaways for Bangladesh": "The world has plunged into a confluence of calamities such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis, which are stacking up on the persistent threat of climate disaster. These are adding new layers of uncertainty that are quickly becoming the new normal. Three novel sources of volatile and interacting strands at a global scale are driving uncertainty: dangerous planetary pressures, sweeping societal transformation, and increased polarisation. With almost everyone everywhere feeling distressed, six out of seven individuals in the world feel unsettled and insecure today.\n\nThis was the key message coming out of the Human Development Report 2021-22, \"Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World,\" which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recently launched. The report also presents an index of human development for every country. The Human Development Index (HDI), which measures a country's average achievement along three basic human development dimensions – a long and healthy life, education, and decent living standards – saw nine out of 10 countries worldwide slipping in their performance for the last two years in a row. With human development falling back to 2016 levels, this indicates worrying reversals in progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHow is Bangladesh faring in these turbulent times? On the one hand, the country saw its HDI scores persistently improve over the past consecutive years, including in 2021. With a current value of 0.661, it ranks at 129 out of 191 countries and places among medium human-development countries. Bangladesh is also one of South Asia's better performers, with its HDI value above the regional value of 0.632. But additional indices in the report that add equity and sustainability perspectives unmask mixed results. Inequality is a major challenge: Bangladesh's HDI value falls to 0.503 when adjusted for inequality, resulting in a loss of 23.9 percent of its original HDI value.\n\nBangladesh fares quite well when accounting for planetary pressures. Findings from the report reaffirm the country as one of the world's lowest carbon emitters and with little material footprint. At COP26 last year, Bangladesh laudably pledged to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 6.73 percent by 2030. The energy sector is set to account for the bulk of the reduction. As one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries and as a second-time chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), this step reinforces Bangladesh's commitment to international solidarity and the cause of climate change. Nonetheless, it will require significant investments, especially in the energy and transport sectors, and the country is still far from attaining its national target for transitioning to clean, renewable energy.\n\nOn a more sobering note, gender parity is an area where Bangladesh has significant room for improvement, despite efforts over the years. A closer look into the Gender Development Index – a measure of disparities in the HDI by gender – presents stark findings. While women are likely to live longer than men, they trail behind when it comes to education and income per capita. On average, women receive 6.8 years of schooling compared to eight years for men. Also, gross national income per capita for Bangladeshi women stands at USD 2,811, compared to USD 8,176 for men.\n\nMoreover, Bangladesh ranks 131 on the Gender Inequality Index (GII), a measure of gender inequality along the dimensions of reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market. Globally, progress along these dimensions of GII has stagnated over the last three years with overlapping crises contributing to setting women back. In Bangladesh, women's participation in the labour market was stagnating even before the pandemic. Social norms are also influencing persisting gender inequalities: 88 percent of women and 91 percent of men worldwide show at least one clear bias against gender equality along political, economic, and educational dimensions, as well as in areas such as intimate partner violence and women's reproductive rights.\n\nFor Bangladesh, progress in its human development performance weighs heavily for Covid recovery and for realising ambitious goals. It is set to graduate out of the Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2026. The country has also expressed strong commitments to achieve the SDGs, become an upper-middle-income country by 2031 and a developed nation by 2041. In this context, how can UNDP in Bangladesh continue to support development initiatives to maintain and advance hard-won development gains, while exploring sustainable pathways from crises and vulnerability during uncertain times?\n\nThe future does not have to be bleak. Rather, in line with the recommendations of the report, UNDP has been working to promote policies and programmes around the three \"I\"s – investment, insurance, and innovation – to support the country to thrive in a world in flux. For example, with climate change presenting an existential threat to Bangladesh, we are supporting rural communities in climate-vulnerable areas to adapt to the impacts of climate change. and through an ongoing urban poverty programme across 19 cities and municipalities nationwide, efforts are undertaken to address the interrelated challenges around climate change, migration, and urbanisation, and ensure sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nWe are also supporting Bangladesh's ongoing national social security strategy reform agenda as it gradually adopts a lifecycle-based approach. The pandemic has already highlighted fractures in the current system, and has underscored the need for shock-responsive, urban social protection that includes developing national social insurance schemes. Much more remains to be done in expanding care systems. A gender-responsive social protection system will also be vital to promote gender equality by providing a lifeline to women to improve their income security and help narrow gender gaps in poverty rates.\n\nThere is no scope to be complacent as we strive to support Bangladesh in its efforts to double down on human development. Given the complex challenges confronting Bangladesh and humanity all over the globe, upholding human development through uncertain times will require new ways of engaging and working, connecting partners from across multiple sectors, reflecting the specificities of national and subnational contexts, and finding bridges between short and long-term imperatives. In the words of many of those attending this year's HDR launching, \"The best world is ahead of us if we make the right choices.\" The same applies to Bangladesh.\n\nStefan Liller is the resident representative of UNDP Bangladesh.",
    "Beijing to ask Myanmar to put an end to Bangladesh border violence": "Beijing to ask Myanmar to put an end to Bangladesh border violence\n\nBeijing will ask Myanmar to stop violation of Bangladesh's territorial sovereignty and speed up the tripartite mechanism for early Rohingya repatriation.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming made the assurance during a meeting with acting foreign secretary Admiral (retd) Khurshed Alam at the foreign ministry today (September 26, 2022).\n\nTalking to reporters after the meeting, Jiming said the recent incidents on the border are unfortunate.\n\nHe said they discussed ways for early repatriation of Rohingya refugees, recent incidents along Bangladesh-Myanmar border, and bilateral cooperation in other areas.\n\nEarly last week, foreign ministry organised separate briefings with the Asean diplomats and other foreign diplomats in Dhaka on the Myanmar-border situation and requested them to use their influence to stop Myanmar's repeated violation of border rules.\n\nSince late August, mortar shells landed in Bangladesh territory from Myanmar and helicopters flew over the border area where the Myanmar military and rebel group Arakan Army have been fighting since early August.\n\nNo representative from the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka was present in that meeting on September 20.\n\n\"We had informed the diplomats of the border situation last week. As no one from the Chinese Embassy was there, we informed them about it today,\" Khurshed Alam told reporters at the foreign ministry.\n\nHe said he sought China's renewed initiative to speed up the tripartite mechanism, which involves Bangladesh, Myanmar and China, for early repatriation of the Rohingyas. Not a single one of over a million Rohingyas could be repatriated since the biggest influx in 2017.\n\nHe said Li Jiming assured that China would raise the issue of Myanmar's border rules violation with Naypyidaw.\n\n\"Our goal is to start the Rohingya repatriation as soon as possible. The situation here is not good so the repatriation process needs to begin,\" Khurshed said.\n\nChina has constructed a number of houses in Rakhine State for sheltering the Rohingyas when they return. So, if the Rohingyas go there, Myanmar will ensure their safety and security, he added.\n\nAsked if the repatriation is possible as conflict is ongoing in Myanmar including in Rakhine State, he said, \"Yes, that's right. But there is no war where the Rohingyas will be taken.\"",

    "Myanmar, Bangladesh must solve border tensions peacefully": "Many Rohingya people fled from Myanmar a few years ago in fear of their lives, but recently the Myanmar army has had to face strong resistance from other independence-seeking rebels. Along with the Arakan Army, the military is in serious conflict with the Cochin Army, and elements of the Shan, Karen, Mong, Shin and Kaya peoples.\n\nAs a result, the Tatmadaw (military) has adopted a slightly different strategy from its persecution of the Rohingya to avoid international surveillance of its suppression of the rebels. As a part of this, it has mounted a campaign on the border with Bangladesh.\n\nMyanmar has been firing mortar shells into the area. By creating pressure, the Tatmadaw hopes the remaining Rohingya in Myanmar will go to Bangladesh or elsewhere. As well, it hopes to incite Bangladesh into joining its war on the rebels. This will further increase the persecution of Rohingya.\n\nMeanwhile, the Myanmar army is placing landmines one after another in the border areas in violation of international norms. Earlier, Rohingya were killed by mines, but now Bangladeshis are also falling victim. The presence of the army in the border area without a declaration of war is against international norms, but Myanmar does not comply with these.\n\nThe Tatmadaw has also repeatedly violated Bangladesh’s airspace. As the Myanmar junta has acted with impunity in the past, it is again showing the audacity to violate international norms.\n\nBorder tensions\n\nHowever, the law and order forces of Bangladesh are on alert at the border and the situation is under constant observation.\n\nBangladesh has a 271-kilometer sea and land border with Myanmar. About 1.2 million Rohingya are in Teknaf and Ukhia, two subdistricts of Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, bordering Myanmar.\n\nBangladesh must avoid getting involved in the conflict on the Myanmar border. Doing so would benefit both the Tatmadaw and the rebel Arakan Army. Bangladesh should therefore make all efforts for a peaceful solution to the problem.\n\nAcross the Naikshyongchari border in Bandarban, the Myanmar army is engaged in a fierce battle with the Arakan Army. At this time, mortar shells are falling in Bangladesh. Helicopters are also entering the airspace of Bangladesh.\n\nThere is concern in Bangladesh due to border tensions. However, the Myanmar army is not carrying out any attack targeting Bangladesh. The Arakan Army is attacking Tatmadaw military posts along the border. Because of this, the Myanmar army is conducting an operation mere meters from the border with Bangladesh.\n\nThe tension on the border has been going on for quite some time. The tension sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. Lately there has been an increase in shelling and airspace violations. This is because the Arakan Army has increased its activity. As a result, the Tatmadaw has launched a major operation.\n\nThe violation of Bangladesh’s border by the Myanmar army is going to increase in the coming days. Boundary violations can be reduced by demonstrating the power Bangladesh has, rather than using it. As Bangladesh’s military and national strength are not visible to the Myanmar forces, they do not care about them.\n\nBangladesh should make every effort to solve the problem peacefully. Bangladesh has summoned Myanmar’s ambassador four times. But strength must be demonstrated behind diplomatic language.\n\nThe biggest concern is the fear of more Rohingya entering Bangladesh. Moreover, the operation of the Myanmar army is not limited only to the Rohingya region. People from other ethnic groups in Rakhine may also enter Bangladesh under the pressure of the campaign. Thus some people from Myanmar entered Mizoram in India.\n\nIt is not right for Bangladesh to get involved in the problems of Myanmar. Bangladesh says it has increased Border Guard Police (BGP) and Coast Guard deployments. But it will not be right for Bangladesh to deploy the army along the border at this time.\n\nAppeal to UN\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is going to the United Nations General Assembly meeting and she is scheduled to address it on Friday. She will definitely raise the matter there. Besides, she should arrange a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping while both are in New York.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not going to the United Nations, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is. A K Abdul Momen, the foreign minister of Bangladesh, should arrange a meeting with him, as he is also going to the UNGA.\n\nFrom what can be understood from the international media, rebel groups in Myanmar claim that the army does not have control over 52% of the area in Rakhine state. The war with the Arakan Army has taken a prominent shape.\n\nMyanmar has proved in the past that it does not abide by international law or diplomacy. Therefore, Myanmar’s internal problems should be solved within the country and not outside. But Bangladesh has to internationalize this issue.\n\nProfessor Imtiaz Ahmed, of Dhaka University’s International Relations Department, said recently that internationalization of the issue needs to be increased.\n\nIf Bangladesh adopts a mixed strategy of demonstration of military power and diplomacy simultaneously, the Myanmar military can’t respond easily. Thus Bangladesh needs to pursue a peaceful diplomatic approach towards Myanmar.\n\nThe Myanmar military has little control over most of the remote mountainous areas except for the plains. The way the conflict is increasing in these areas, the junta government has indicated that elections next year will be very difficult.\n\nSheikh Hasina said recently that Bangladesh is showing maximum restraint on the Myanmar border. Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK opposition and head of the Labour Party, met with Hasina, who was visiting London on Saturday. At the time, she informed him about the growing burden on Bangladesh due to the prolonged presence of Rohingya from Myanmar.\n\nStarmer’s meeting with Sheikh Hasina discussed the recent escalation of armed conflict near the border with Bangladesh.\n\nShe said that despite the effects of the conflict in Myanmar spreading within the territory of Bangladesh, her country is exercising maximum restraint.\n\nIn order to assess the situation on the Myanmar border, Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Wednesday convened a high-level meeting with the country’s security and law-enforcement organizations at his secretariat office.\n\nThe minister declared after the meeting that Bangladesh’s army and other forces were prepared to defend the nation if given the necessary instructions.\n\n“We have seen a number of provocations,” he said. “We think Bangladesh has no role to play as long as there is an internal conflict where the Arakan Army is fighting with [Myanmar armed forces].”\n\nIn a different broadcast on Wednesday, Bangladesh Army Chief General S M Shafiuddin Ahmed stated that his troops were prepared to respond against Myanmar if necessary.\n\nForeign interests\n\nBangladesh is on the right track so far without stepping into Myanmar’s trap. Solutions should be sought in all other ways than engaging in conflict. At the same time, Dhaka should increase the pressure on Naypyidaw through more engagement with China, India and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nThere is a need to work hard with the ASEAN countries in this regard, because the victim of this conflict will be ASEAN in the future. War is not desirable for anyone. The Bangladeshi government’s diplomatic and military preparations need to be strengthened.\n\nDiplomacy also has different phases. One stage in this is the role of regional powers. They can play an effective role in ending this conflict. But so far they have shown little interest. So Bangladesh has to expand its diplomacy.\n\nMilitary diplomacy in addition to traditional diplomacy can help mitigate and de-escalate the tensions. In that case, a warning can be given to Myanmar by showing military force without getting involved in the conflict.\n\nIn the current situation, it is necessary to walk with prudence. All aspects including the Rohingya issue, national security and economic stability of Bangladesh must be calculated and considered seriously.",

    "Bangladesh’s Declining Democracy": "Bangladesh, a large and growing country in a geographically vital location, will be an important asset amid the great-power competition unfolding across Asia. U.S. policymakers would be well advised to begin paying closer attention to it – while also recognizing and contending with several significant challenges.\n\nBangladesh has continually experienced prolonged periods of political instability, corruption, and human rights violations. The country is facing a growing extremist threat, and its increasingly authoritarian government has exacerbated many of the problems that have stifled its potential to become an influential global actor. The United States can help Bangladesh overcome its democratic deficit by helping strengthen its state institutions, paying closer attention to the ruling party’s authoritarian excesses (including its reversal of secular values for the sake of political expediency), and supporting the fulfillment of vital humanitarian needs.\n\nPolitical Rivalries\n\nEast Pakistan, as Bangladesh was called when it came into being in 1947 with the British-administered partition of the Indian subcontinent, was primarily carved out of the larger state of Bengal, and it was separated from West Pakistan by over 1,000 miles of Indian territory. Growing disgruntlement over the hegemonic policies of its western wing finally led East Pakistan, led by Sheikh Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, to declare independence from its co-religionists in West Pakistan in 1971.\n\nBangladesh’s democracy is fragile, afflicted by rampant political violence. Its leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Mujeeb, also heads the ruling party known as the Awami League. Under Hasina’s leadership, the Awami League has demonstrated disturbingly authoritarian tendencies and has used all means necessary to quash its political opponents.\n\nThe Awami League is locked into a protracted rivalry with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the origins of which can be traced back to the military coup in 1975 that led to Mujeeb’s assassination. Zia-ur-Rahman assumed power after Mujeeb’s death, forming the BNP as a center-right nationalist party. Rahman’s widow now heads the BNP, which has used religious/political entities like the Jamaat-e-Islami to widen its base of support in opposition to the Awami League. The Awami League, in turn, has adopted an antagonist stance against the Jamaat-e-Islami. The Awami League resents the Jamaat-e-Islami’s longstanding alliance with the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami’s alleged support for West Pakistan during the 1971 war for Bangladesh’s independence.\n\nThe Awami League and BNP have alternated in government since the early 1990s, except for a military-supported caretaker regime that postponed 2007’s parliamentary elections. BNP’s Khalida Zia was prime minister twice (from 1991-1996 and again from 2001-2006). Hasina first became prime minister in 1996 and returned to office in 2008, where she has remained, leaving Bangladesh under the ever-tightening grip of one party led by one leader.\n\nThe Awami League has managed to remain in power with the support of a broad-based coalition of 14 political parties, known as the Grand Alliance. However, while the Awami League has kept this alliance intact, it continues to engage in evident political repression of its opponents, with ample evidence of ongoing political violence across Bangladesh. The International Crisis Group cited 14,000 incidents of political violence in Bangladesh from 2002 to 2013, which killed more than 2,400 people and injured 126,300. Widespread allegations of vote tampering and other irregularities followed general elections in 2014 and 2018.\n\nThe next general elections are scheduled for December 2023, but the newly formed Election Commission, which is meant to oversee them, does not evoke much confidence among the opposition parties, which were not consulted during its formation. The BNP has also alleged that the chief election commissioner is an Awami League loyalist. With Khalida Zia declining in health, the BNP could suffer another electoral blow in 2023. Smaller parties such as the Liberal Democratic Party seem unable to offer the Awami League any serious competition either. Bangladesh’s political landscape may thus remain under the shadow of a one-party authoritarian regime, which does not bode well for the democratic health and longer-term economic prospects of the country.\n\nErosion of Institutions\n\nOne-party rule in Bangladesh has been accompanied by an erosion of major institutions of the state, including the police and judiciary. Political interference in the recruitment, posting, and promotions processes within the police forces enable the Awami League to exert control over the institution and use it to pressure political opponents while blocking investigations of people associated with it. Political workers remain at severe risk of abuse in police custody, and Bangladeshi police are suspected of registering “fake cases” to harass political workers. In 2019, the BNP’s senior joint secretary claimed that the police had filed false cases of violence and rioting against as many as 2.5 million BNP affiliates over the preceding decade, just to prevent them from engaging in political activities. While the above cited number lacks substantiation, independent human rights entities do recognize that the Awami League relies on the state’s security apparatus to counter dissent.\n\nThe Rapid Action Battalion, an elite paramilitary force ostensibly created to contend with lawlessness and terrorism, has been politicized and increasingly come to symbolize heavy-handed and politically motivated law enforcement. The battalion has been repeatedly accused of detaining political workers in undisclosed locations for significant periods before filing formal charges and bringing them to court, of engaging in extrajudicial killings, and of enforced disappearances.\n\nThe Awami League has also subverted the judiciary. Several judges have been transferred or threatened with administrative action by law ministry officials for any perceived signs of leniency toward opposition members. The Awami League is also said to use violent student and labor wings (such as the Chhatra League and Jubo League) to attack its political opponents.\n\nTwo years after regaining power in 2008, the Awami League founded an International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) to put on trial those accused of having committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 conflict, when Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan. The ICT received hundreds of allegations, and by 2013 it began delivering verdicts branding BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami leaders as war criminals, with some even receiving death sentences. Every time the tribunal passed such a decision, it unleashed violent opposition across the country. Human rights agencies expressed concern about how ICT cases were being handled and called for amendments to the ICT rules to ensure that the trials complied with international standards, but these concerns were mostly brushed aside.\n\nIn 2013, the Awami League also used its leverage over the apex courts to revoke Jamaat-e-Islami’s status as a political party, and the Awami League-led government banned the Jamaat-e-Islami from contesting the 2018 elections. The Jamaat-e-Islami maintains political relevance through its alignment with the BNP, but this in turn is a major reason why Jamaat-e-Islami party affiliates continue to face repression.\n\nThe Awami League has even accused the BNP of aligning itself with extremist militant groups such as Jamatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, which aims to replace the government of Bangladesh with its own version of an Islamic state ruled by a myopic interpretation of shariah. The acrimonious power struggle between the Awami League and the BNP has cast doubts concerning the authenticity of such charges, especially given that the Awami League has been known to use state institutions and the imperative of fighting “terrorism” to persecute and discredit the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, which the Awami League has accused of being backed by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. After a high-profile attack in Dacca in 2016 by al Qaeda, the Awami League (including Hasina) underplayed the threat of the group’s Bangladeshi arm and instead pointed the finger at the BNP.\n\nWhile the Awami League persecuted Jamaat-e-Islami and BNP affiliates by accusing them of being terrorists, it has reached out to other right-wing religious parties to shore up support. In the lead-up to the 2018 elections, for instance, the Awami League reached out to groups like the Jatiya Oikya Manch, a grouping of rightist parties, as well as to Hefazat-e-Islam (HeI), a fundamentalist group advocating for the “Islamization” of Bangladesh. The Awami League’s strategic compromise with these right-wing extremist groups began to increase intolerance in Bangladeshi society, sparking repeated instances of violence against minorities. Hasina nevertheless continued to provide dangerous forms of appeasement to the HeI, such as removing a statue of a woman symbolizing justice from the Supreme Court in 2017 and arresting bloggers accused of blasphemy. However, the HeI’s increasing assertiveness, including its opposition to “un-Islamic” statues of Mujeb, has brought it to loggerheads with the government, leading to the arrests of several HeI activists on vandalism charges.\n\nBesides fueling internal intolerance, the HeI has also attempted to sabotage the Bangladeshi government’s relations with India due to its persecution of Muslims, and with western countries due to their alleged Islamophobia. HeI organized violent protests during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh last year that led to a dozen deaths. The group has been at the forefront of protests against publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad in western media, and it has pressured the Bangladeshi government to cut ties with countries that allow or defend the publication of such caricatures. Extremist groups such as the HeI are using violence to try to nudge the Bangladeshi state toward their myopic vision of Islamic governance.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the HeI may become a more threatening anti-state force despite major concessions granted by the AI, which will further erode Bangladesh’s founding democratic and secular principles. The persecution of mainstream politicians by the Hasina government has in fact created a vacuum in the Bangladeshi political arena, which is being increasingly filled by dangerous religious extremists. Analysts also blame the Awami League’s tight grip over Bangladeshi politics for increasing societal intolerance and random acts of violence as legitimate means to express dissent have been increasingly stifled.\n\nBangladesh’s 1972 Constitution lists secularism as one of its founding principles, but Islam was declared the state religion of Bangladesh in 1988, when the country was ruled by Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Despite calls for the restoration of the “secular” provision by progressive elements within Bangladeshi civil society, it is unlikely that Hasina will capitulate, fearing alienation of conservative blocs ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nIt is vital that Hasina’s chokehold over national politics is challenged and loosened. This does not mean that the Awami League must be defeated in the next general elections (chances of that happening remain slim), but it does mean that the international community needs to pay closer attention to the democratic deficit in Bangladesh instead of being overly impressed by the Awami League government’s seemingly secular credentials or the economic progress made under its authoritarian rule.\n\nSupporting Bangladesh\n\nThe United States has recognized the importance of Bangladesh in recent years, but engagement remains modest. In 2012, Bangladesh and the United States initiated a partnership dialogue intended to be held annually to discuss strengthening bilateral relations based on mutual national interest. To date, eight such dialogues have been held. Hasina visited the United States in 2021 in an effort to bolster the bilateral relationship.\n\nDiplomatic exchanges between the countries have led to increasing economic and security cooperation and equipping Bangladesh with the means to contend with the threat of climate change via affordable clean energy projects and by encouraging clean energy entrepreneurship. Climate change is not just a major threat for Bangladesh itself; climate-induced water scarcity also has the potential of creating friction with neighbors such as India, with which it shares border rivers, and which may experience an increase of Bangladeshi climate refugees if effective mitigation and resilience measures cannot be put into place. However, there is limited evidence that multilateral or bilateral donors like USAID are working on cross-border cooperation to contend with climate change in South Asia.\n\nBy taking a leading role in contending with Myanmar’s Rohingya refugee crisis, Bangladesh has received increased U.S. attention, but this remains an issue in which much more support is needed. Bangladesh has recently requested China’s support to exert its influence over Myanmar’s military junta to repatriate Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh, a move that could put the refugees in a precarious situation.\n\nAmerica’s interest in moderating the Chinese sphere of influence in South Asia offers another reason U.S. policymakers need to continue paying close attention to its bilateral relationship with Bangladesh. While Bangladesh has longstanding diplomatic relations with China, this relationship grew stronger after Bangladesh decided to join Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2016 – a decision that resulted in significant Chinese investment. Over 500 Chinese companies are currently working in Bangladesh, many of them are working on major infrastructure projects including seaports, a river tunnel, highways, and a $3.6 billion mega-project to construct a four-mile bridge across the Padma River. Bangladesh is a major importer of Chinese products, and China has also provided duty-free and quota-free access for select Bangladeshi products to the Chinese market, which has the potential of ramping up Bangladeshi exports to China.\n\nBangladesh’s growing relationship with China has coincided with the souring of its relations with India as the persecution of Muslims there expands. The 2016 passage of India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which was perceived as undermining the citizenship rights of Bengali Muslims in India, sparked major protests in Bangladesh. The United States, however, continues to provide significant aid to Bangladesh, and the country is now one of the largest recipients of American assistance in Asia. It remains in the U.S. interest to continue its engagement with and support for Bangladesh so that it does not become more dependent on China.\n\nHowever, its bilateral engagement need not be provided without discernment. While the United States remains the largest source of foreign investment into the country, President Barack Obama decided in 2013 to remove Bangladesh from the list of countries that can access trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences scheme due to its failure to guarantee workers’ rights. The current U.S. administration has also taken note of the ongoing political repression in Bangladesh. After years of human rights violations attributed to the Rapid Action Battalion, the U.S. Treasury Department in 2021 placed sanctions on several of its former and current officials. Bangladesh was also not invited to President Joe Biden’s Summit of Democracies.\n\nThe human security situation in Bangladesh remains precarious due to authoritarian rule, political violence, corruption, and discrimination against religious minorities and Rohingya refugees. Bangladesh is thus rightly considered “partially free” by Freedom House in 2022, and its score has declined from 47 to 39 out of 100 over the past five years. This situation may worsen in the lead-up to the 2023 general elections. Despite its ranking among the fastest-growing economies in the world, the global recession and soaring fuel prices have taken a toll. Dwindling foreign reserves prompted Bangladesh to join Sri Lanka and Pakistan in seeking financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Economic stress prompted by IMF-imposed austerity measures, combined with growing political friction, may further exacerbate Bangladesh’s already fraught human security situation.\n\nThe United States thus needs to pay close attention to the unfolding economic situation and domestic sociopolitical environment in Bangladesh. U.S. policymakers need to continue taking steps to nudge the country into fulfilling its potential as a major pillar of democracy and secular values in South Asia, which in turn would enable it to be a valuable U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific. For this purpose, the United States should continue to take punitive actions to curb the excesses of the ruling party as general elections approach and to draw international scrutiny to ensure they are peaceful, free, and fair.\n\nSimultaneously, USAID can continue to work on strengthening vital institutions of the state to offset authoritarian forces within the country. While the United States is committed to helping Bangladesh contend with climate challenges at home, it can try to foster much-needed environmental cooperation to help Bangladesh manage its transboundary rivers. Supporting such cooperation between Bangladesh and India specifically seems to be the most feasible option in a region where relations among other major states remain fraught. The United States could play a constructive role in helping the two, which still have reasonably amicable ties, to bolster the Ganges Water Sharing Agreement, for example, by helping create more effective water management mechanisms, providing the increased efficiency and resilience needed to contend with climate-related challenges. Doing so may inspire other countries, including Pakistan, Nepal, and even China, to develop similar cooperative mechanisms for sharing transborder waterways, an imperative becoming more urgent as ongoing Himalayan glacial melt seriously threatens regional water supplies.\n\nThe United States should also pay greater heed to the plight of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. It must apply pressure on Bangladesh to avoid forcible Rohingya repatriations to Myanmar and be prepared to commit more humanitarian assistance to help Bangladesh better cope with the refugees’ needs via multilateral agencies like the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, in addition to stepping up bilateral and NGO-funneled support.\n\nBy using a careful mix of punitive actions and supportive measures, the United States can play a constructive role in reducing political repression, offsetting authoritarian tendencies, and addressing human insecurity challenges within Bangladesh to help it attain its goal of becoming a stable middle-income nation in the foreseeable future.\n\nDr. Syed Mohammed Ali is a professor of anthropology, international development, and human security courses at Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, and George Washington universities.

    "Bangladesh: Allow UN to Assist ‘Disappearance’ Inquiries": "Click to expand Image Relatives hold portraits of their missing family members during protest rally on behalf of victims of enforced disappearance by security forces, in front of National Press Club in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 20, 2022. © 2022 Mamunur Rashid/NurPhoto via AP\n\n(New York) – Bangladesh authorities should heed international calls for transparent, independent investigations into enforced disappearances, Human Rights Watch said today on the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances. On August 14, 2022, Netra news – which is blocked in Bangladesh – published a whistleblower report revealing that Bangladesh officials were allegedly holding and torturing victims of enforced disappearance at a secret detention site called Aynaghar (house of mirrors).\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, during her three-day visit to Bangladesh in August, called on the government to establish a “specialized mechanism that works closely with victims, families and civil society to investigate allegations of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.” She offered her office’s support to create such a mechanism in line with international standards. Bangladesh’s strategic and trade partners have urged the government to step up measures to hold senior members of security forces accountable and prevent future abuses.\n\n“The evidence of Bangladesh authorities’ involvement in countless enforced disappearances is overwhelming,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Bangladesh government should stop feigning ignorance and work with the UN to provide urgent answers and effective accountability.”\n\nIn August 2021, Human Rights Watch published a report on enforced disappearances in Bangladesh alongside a webpage documenting 86 cases of apparently disappeared people. The Bangladesh government’s only response was to deny the allegations. Since then, it has not provided updated information to Human Rights Watch on any of these cases.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the US government designated Global Magnitsky human rights sanctions against Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and top commanders implicated in abuses, particularly enforced disappearances. In response, Bangladesh authorities initiated a campaign of threats and intimidation against families of victims of enforced disappearances. This was presumably intended to contradict and undermine the families’ allegations, although officials claimed they were only investigating the factual record.\n\nMaayer Daak, an advocacy group of families of victims of enforced disappearance, said that the authorities visited and threatened at least 10 victims’ families, in some cases forcing them to sign false statements that their relative was not forcibly disappeared and that they had intentionally misled the police. Some reporting on these reprisals has since been taken down from the internet, raising concerns of media censorship.\n\nIn February, UN rights experts urged the government to end reprisals and said that the ongoing acts of intimidation and harassment seemed “to indicate a concerted effort to silence families of victims and anyone who has been working to clarify the fate of the numerous individuals who have been forcibly disappeared over the years.”\n\nThe experts said they were concerned about:\n\nthe lack of serious progress in clarifying the fate and whereabouts of disappeared persons in the country.… Instead, the authorities appear to have shielded RAB officials and other security agencies from any scrutiny and from criminal responsibility. In this regard, we are particularly alarmed by the prevailing culture of impunity, which effectively undermines the rights of victims and their families to truth, justice, redress, and guarantees of non-recurrence.\n\nBachelet urged the Bangladesh government to invite the UN Working Group on Enforced Disappearances to visit Bangladesh to “show a commitment to decisively address this issue.” She also said that Bangladesh should ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.\n\nIn August, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan denied that there had been any enforced disappearances, repeating previous claims that those missing were in hiding to escape prosecution for criminal actions, to avoid debt repayments, or due to family disagreements. Of the 76 cases included by the Working Group on Enforced Disappearances, the minister said that most had been resolved and that 28 of them had absconded because they faced criminal charges. Families of the disappeared, he declared, had an “ulterior motive” for their protests.\n\nThe Bangladesh government has repeatedly failed to respond meaningfully to concerns raised by the UN, foreign governments, activists, and victims’ families regarding grave allegations of torture, enforced disappearance, and extrajudicial killings in the country, Human Rights Watch said. Other governments should consider joining the US sanctions against security force units and individuals to address the lack of accountability and prevent further abuses. The UN Department of Peace Operations should heed Bachelet’s warning that as “the biggest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping missions, Bangladesh should ensure it has a robust system in place for the careful human rights screening of security personnel.”\n\n“Families of victims of enforced disappearances have spent years being tormented by authorities’ flippant denials about the whereabouts of their loved ones,” Ganguly said. “The Bangladesh government should mark the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances by taking the first step toward accountability.”",
    "Bangladesh external debt situation and vulnerabilities": "The surge in the current account deficit in FY2022 pushed by global inflation has led to considerable public discussion and debate about the Bangladesh external debt situation and associated vulnerabilities. The unprecedented current account deficit has led to considerable pressure on the exchange rate, increase in short-term borrowings, and a depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Many see these developments as evidence of growing vulnerability of the balance of payments and the external debt situation. There is also a worry that the scheduled repayment of loans for a number of large infrastructure projects in the coming years will add to these pressures.\n\nThis is a healthy debate, but it is important that the discussions must be based on solid data and evidence. All efforts must be made to avoid speculative analysis that is not backed by evidence. This note seeks to provide an analysis of the external debt situation, and the underlying issues and challenges, with a view to clarifying the public debate on the facts of external debt and assisting the government's thinking on how best to move forward to stabilise the macroeconomy.\n\nThe evolution and current structure of external debt is shown in Table 1. Bangladesh has traditionally managed its external debt prudently. It has maintained a surplus or low deficit in the current account; it has largely relied on publicly-funded low-cost medium- and long-term foreign borrowing to finance its trade and investment needs; and the use of short-term credit has been modest. Combined with a major export drive in RMG and labour exports, Bangladesh external debt indicators, both short- term and long-term, have been comfortable.\n\nThe emergence of Covid-19 created some external sector difficulties through the loss of export earnings, but recovery happened fairly swiftly. In FY2021, the balance of payments and external debt indicators were all in the prudent zone. The long-term debt sustainability indicators (debt to GDP; debt to exports, debt service to exports) were all in the comfortable zone. The short-term vulnerability indicators (short-term loan to reserves and the combined short-term loan plus current account deficit to reserves) were within prudential limits (well below 1).\n\nThe advent of global inflation fuelled by the Ukraine War since March 2022 has exerted some serious pressure on the Bangladesh external sector reflected in the soaring value of imports. The Bangladesh exchange rate depreciated sharply as excess demand for foreign exchange along with an appreciation of the US dollar in the global markets pushed up the taka price of dollar. The import surge caused the current account deficit to rise to an unprecedented $18.7 billion in FY2022. The financing of this huge deficit required a resort to short-term borrowing as well as a substantial loss of reserves.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these developments was that the short-term debt indicators worsened sharply. The short-term debt to reserve ratio worsened from 30% to 50% between FY2021 and FY2022, while the ratio of short-term debt and current deficit to reserves weakened dramatically from a low of 38% in FY2021 to a high of 94% in FY2022. The medium-to-long-term debt indicators, however, remain in the comfortable zone.\n\nHow vulnerable is the current debt situation? From a medium-to-long-term perspective, there is not much need to worry if exports remain stable. Simulations show that the medium-to-long-term debt sustainability indicators remain within prudent limits. This is true even after accounting for the upcoming repayment schedule of a number of infrastructure projects including the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant (debt repayments of $569 million per year starting in FY2027), the Padma Bridge Rail Link (debt repayments of $176 million per year starting in FY2024), the Karnaphuli Tunnel (debt repayment of $53 million starting in FY23) and the Expansion and Strengthening of the Power System Network under the DPDC area ($67 million per year starting in FY2025).\n\nThe short-term debt risk situation is tricky and could present a challenge. The sharp deterioration in the short -term debt indicators in FY2022 noted above needs to be reversed and stabilised. While they are still within prudential norms (ratio of less than 1), given the uncertainties of the Ukraine War and global inflation, Bangladesh would be well advised to protect its foreign exchange reserves against any further decline, while seeking to lower the current account deficit in the immediate short term (FY2023). This will require keeping the current account deficit at a level that can be fully financed through net MLT loans and net FDI flows, and a roll-over of the $20.7 billion short-term debt at a reasonable cost. These in turn will require stabilising the macroeconomy by using a combination of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies.\n\nThe main policy reforms entail unification of the exchange rate at the market determined rate with one exchange rate for all transactions (exports, imports and remittances), doing away with subsidies on exports and remittances, removing the interest rate caps to lower demand through an adjustment in the interest rate, preparing for a major overhaul of the tax system to strengthen revenue mobilisation, reforming the state owned enterprises to eliminate operating subsidies and earning a reasonable rate of return on invested assets, and increasing expenditure on health, education and social protection.\n\nSadiq Ahmed is the vice chairman at Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh",
    "Bangladesh authorities arrest siblings of UK-based journalists": "Share this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nNew York, September 20, 2022 – Bangladesh authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez and Abdul Muktadir Manu and cease harassing family members of journalists who report from abroad, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Tuesday.\n\nOn September 13, officers with the detective branch of the Bangladesh police, in the Noakhali town of the southeast Chittagong division, arrested Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez, brother of Shamsul Alam Liton, editor of the privately owned United Kingdom-based Weekly Surma newspaper, according to news reports, a report by The Weekly Surma, a Twitter thread by Bangladeshi editor Tasneem Khalil, and a person familiar with the case, who spoke to CPJ by phone on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.\n\nThe September 13 police first information report, a document that opens an investigation, accuses the U.K.-based Liton of spreading anti-government propaganda on social media platforms and alleges that Pervez conspires with Liton to create “confusion and agitation” among the public.\n\nSeparately, on September 9, police in Moulvibazar town in the northeast Sylhet division arrested Abdul Muktadir Manu, brother of Abdur Rab Bhuttow, a special correspondent for The Weekly Surma and head of the privately owned digital news platform London Bangla Channel, according to news reports and a person familiar with the case, who spoke to CPJ by phone on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.\n\n“The Bangladesh government’s targeting of family members of critical journalists is an egregious form of retaliation that must not go unnoticed by its diplomatic partners and the international community,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator, in Frankfurt, Germany. “Authorities must swiftly and unconditionally release Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez and Abdul Muktadir Manu and cease subjecting family members of foreign-based journalists to detention, harassment, and other forms of reprisal.”\n\nThe September 10 police first information report alleges that Manu is conspiring with the U.K.-based Bhuttow to remove Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power and “destroy the image of the state.”\n\nBoth police reports cited a section of the Bangladesh Code of Criminal Procedure that allows authorities to conduct warrantless arrests if there is “reasonable suspicion” that an individual may commit an offense.\n\nThe arrests came days before the prime minister left on official visits to the U.K. and the United States.\n\nThe person familiar with Pervez’ case told CPJ that he is also the brother of Hasina Akhter, host of the U.K.-based political affairs talk show Table Talk with Hasina Akhter, and Shah Alam Faruq, editor of the U.K.-based, privately owned digital news platform Shoja Kotha. On August 14, Liton published an editorial for The Weekly Surma calling on Hasina to hold government officials accountable for alleged money laundering.\n\nCPJ’s source said they believed Pervez’ arrest was either retaliation for his sibling’s critical journalism or because of Liton’s organization of a protest in front of the British parliament in support of Bangladeshi victims of enforced disappearances on August 30. Pervez is the Noakhali district president of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, a socialist party associated with Hasina’s ruling Awami League party.\n\nSeparately, the person familiar with Manu’s case told CPJ that they believed his arrest was in retaliation for Bhuttow’s critical journalistic work, most notably two interviews he published on the London Bangla Channel in August 2022 with retired lieutenant colonel Hasinur Rahman, who received international attention for his allegation that Bangladesh’s military intelligence secretly detained him on two separate occasions in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThat person told CPJ that Bhuttow received several anonymous threatening calls and messages following the publication of these interviews, warning him to stop his critical journalistic work.\n\nManu is a government servant with a local administrative unit associated with the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, according to news reports and the person familiar with the case, who added that Moulvibazar jail authorities have denied Manu access to his family since his arrest.\n\nThe Bangladesh police, the Awami League, and the prime minister’s office did not respond to CPJ’s emailed requests for comment.\n\nPreviously, Bangladesh authorities detained Nusrat Shahrin Raka, sister of the U.S.-based Bangladeshi journalist Kanak Sarwar, from October 2021 to March 2022, and have repeatedly harassed the mother of Khalil, who is based in Sweden as the editor-in-chief of the Netra News website.",
    "Where in Bangladesh is the Indian FDI going?": "The venerable Indian think-tank, the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), recently organized a series of podcasts featuring different countries in South Asia.\n\nI was the guest last week in the podcast featuring Bangladesh.\n\nThe host was Sushant Singh, senior fellow at the Centre.\n\nA former deputy editor of the Indian Express, Sushant has also been a visiting lecturer in political science at Yale University.\n\nI went in expecting Sushant to ask me not only about Bangladesh -- its economy, politics and society -- but also about how we, Bangladeshis, view our large neighbour.\n\nI had a feeling that he will also ask about our relations with China; after all, that is a major subject of interest in India. My hunch proved right.\n\nI responded saying that a major driver of our China relationship is economic with a current focus on infrastructure, but, going forward, there was likely to be another important dimension to our economic relations with China.\n\nI expressed the hope that, in the coming years, there will be a quantum jump in FDI from China, and that a large part of this will be FDI that helps diversify our exports.\n\nBut that is China. What about India?\n\nI argued that on both fronts, i.e., infrastructure and export oriented FDI, China can only partially meet our needs.\n\nThere is thus considerable scope for other countries, India included, to step in and help Bangladesh achieve its infrastructural and export diversification objectives.\n\nOur economic relations with China should not be seen by others as a zero-sum game but a positive-sum one.\n\nWhile I understand that the world does not revolve around economics alone, I pointed out that these economic relationships are important for us and that geopolitics should not unduly cloud the discussion on this.\n\nThus, what India should worry about is not our economic relations with China but how Indian FDI can help Bangladesh achieve its economic upgrading and diversification objectives.\n\nCurrent context\n\nThis brings me to the Prime Minister’s recent trip to India where investment must have been one of the important subjects on the agenda.\n\nThe PM's delegation included a large contingent of business leaders and she had meetings with Indian private sector organizations.\n\nIt is likely that there was a call from the Bangladesh side for more Indian FDI.\n\nWe also know that land is being allocated for constructing an economic zone dedicated to Indian investment.\n\nSo, what kind of investment are we likely to get from India?\n\nFDI experts distinguish between three kinds of FDI:\n\na) Natural-resource seeking FDI where the foreign investor is primarily interested in exploring and exploiting natural resources (such as Chevron’s investment in Bangladesh)\n\nb) Market-seeking FDI where the investor is seeking to operate in a country in order to serve the local market (such as the FDI that has come to the power or mobile telecommunication sectors in Bangladesh)\n\nc) Efficiency-seeking FDI where the investor seeks to produce in a country in order to sell abroad (for example, Bangladesh may be viewed as a cost-efficient production base -- hence the term efficiency-seeking; an example is investment in garments.)\n\nOften, the market-seeking foreign investor has a history of selling certain products to a country from a production base in its home country or elsewhere.\n\nIt then decides to manufacture the products in the recipient country itself.\n\nWithin this category of market-seeking FDI, we may make a distinction between investment in tradable and non-tradable goods.\n\nA motorcycle or a TV is an example of a tradable good because such goods can be exported from one country to another.\n\nBy contrast, power generation will be considered largely non-tradable because power is usually sold within the country in which it is generated, although there are some exceptions.\n\nThe same is true for banking.\n\nIn the early years of Bangladesh’s existence as an independent country, much foreign investor interest was confined to exploiting natural resources and in providing traditional services such as banking.\n\nLater, with the domestic economy expanding, FDI inflows were dominated by market-seeking investment in infrastructure, such as power generation and mobile telecommunication.\n\nWhere the FDI goes\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, exactly half of the FDI stock was in gas and petroleum, banking, power, and telecommunications sectors.\n\nThe only other sector with substantial FDI is textiles and apparels, which have received about 18% of all FDI since independence.\n\nGoing forward, a key objective of FDI should be to help diversify our exports in order to reduce our dependence on garments and gradually shift towards more skill-intensive, complex products, a theme on which I had written earlier in this column.\n\nSo far, very little of the FDI inflow has gone into export-oriented industries and much of that too in the traditional sectors such as garments and leather goods.\n\nThus, while the move away from natural-resource seeking FDI to investments in infrastructure is welcome, the strategy going forward should be to attract more FDI inflows towards efficiency-seeking FDI that can help diversify our export basket.\n\nWill Indian FDI help us meet that objective?\n\nI don't have much information on the activities/sectors that Indian investors are showing interest in.\n\nThis is an area where government agencies such as The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) should have some information.\n\nHowever, I do have some data on the investment that has already come in.\n\nThis is from the Bangladesh Bank and is available on its website.\n\nThe data shows the stock of FDI as of March 31, 2022, i.e., the cumulative total of all FDI that has come into Bangladesh since independence (minus any disinvestment.)\n\nA sectoral breakdown is provided which allows me to categorize the FDI from various countries into the three categories I mentioned above.\n\nBefore going into the results for Indian FDI, let me mention that the categorization is a little arbitrary since the data is for broad sectors (such as textiles and apparels, oil and gas, telecommunications, etc) and not for specific activities within each sector.\n\nThus, for example, the data for the pharmaceutical or food sector FDI may include some market-seeking FDI and some efficiency-seeking FDI.\n\nI was not able to make that distinction within each sector.\n\nThus, the categorization is not perfect, but I think the big picture is valid.\n\nFor those interested in details, I have categorized FDI in the gas and petroleum sector as natural-resource seeking, those in the textile and apparel, leather and leather products, food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and agriculture and fishing, as efficiency-seeking, and the rest as market-seeking.\n\nThe chart below shows the results for India with China, Hong Kong and South Korea as comparators.\n\nI have left out the category \"natural-resource seeking\" because this is either absent or very negligible for these countries.\n\nWhat we see is interesting.\n\nMuch of the Indian FDI that has come in is of the market-seeking type and not efficiency-seeking.\n\nThis is similar to the composition of Chinese FDI but very different from the type of investment that is coming from Hong Kong or South Korea.\n\nA sizable part of FDI coming from these two jurisdictions is efficiency-seeking.\n\nThis is particularly true for Korean FDI.\n\nAs I said, this categorization is not perfect (we need more granular data) and this does not cover future FDI.\n\nWhat I wanted to do is start a conversation that will lead us to an important question: what is the type of FDI that we are getting in the near future and how consistent is it with our needs and development goals?\n\nThe investment decisions of foreign investors -- whether to invest in a country and, if so, in what sectors -- are shaped by their own motivations.\n\nThe role of public policy in the recipient country is to steer FDI towards activities that are desirable from the view of the country.\n\nIn some cases, the two sets of interest may match well without any public policy intervention.\n\nHowever, in most cases, some policy intervention is required to create the match.\n\nBut first, we must have granular data on where the investments are going, or likely to go.\n\nThe government needs to go beyond just talking about investor roadshows, general meetings with investors or about economic zones being developed for investors from specific countries.\n\nWe would like to see some data on the specific type of FDI that is being discussed.\n\nBoth Bida and Beza should come forth with such data.\n\nWe need public discussion on whether the planned FDI is aligned with our needs.\n\nAt the same time, countries seeking to forge closer relations with us, such as India, should be asking how much the FDI coming from their countries is aligned with Bangladesh’s development aspirations.\n\nThe author is an economist, previously with an international development agency",

    "Bangladesh's first e-bus service for students to launch in December": "The country's first environment-friendly e-bus (electric bus) service for school-goers is likely to hit Dhaka streets this December.\n\nThe Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) authorities are working to import the air-conditioned e-buses, which will operate in the Gulshan, Banani, and Baridhara areas of the city, officials said.\n\nInitially, students of four English medium schools -- Chittagong Grammar School-Dhaka, Scholastica School, Sir John Wilson School, and Bangladesh International Tutorial School – will be able to avail the service during the pilot project.\n\nAccording to the plan, all schools in Dhaka will gradually be brought under the project if it proves to be a success. Experts say a school bus service is an effective way to reduce traffic jams.\n\nThe DNCC has already completed preliminary work on implementing the initiative. At present, a technical committee is conducting a study that will end in mid-October. The committee will finalize the specifications of the buses, as well as fix fares and catchment areas.\n\n“The city corporation is closely working with the Power Division for setting up charging stations for the buses. The new e-buses will be air-conditioned and dedicated for use as a school bus service,” Md Selim Reza, chief executive officer of the DNCC, told Dhaka Tribune.\n\nTo ensure security, he said, the authorities will use modern technology, including CCTV cameras and tracking systems.\n\nThe DNCC initiated the project to reduce carbon emissions to a large extent and help reduce pollution in Dhaka -- one of the most polluted cities in the world.\n\nEarlier, the state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) introduced a special school bus service in January 2011 with 14 buses between Mirpur and Azimpur. But the service could not be maintained due to an absence of proper management.\n\nThe BRTC introduced the service mainly to reduce traffic jams, while the DNCC is moving ahead with the same objective since the problem has become more severe than before.\n\nExperts say many cities around the world have school bus services since they are safe and financially convenient.\n\n“The BRTC failed to maintain the catchment area for picking up students while guardians prefer door-to-door service,” said Dr Md Hadiuzzaman, a transport expert.\n\n“But the new initiative taken by the DNCC can be a success as it targets specific zones with specific students,” he told Dhaka Tribune.",
    "Tensions Escalate Along Bangladesh-Myanmar Border": "Shelling from Myanmar into the Bangladeshi side of the border has increased in recent weeks, resulting in death and injuries to Rohingya.\n\nActing Foreign Secretary Rear Admiral (Rtd) Md. Khorshed Alam briefs the Heads of Mission from South East Asian countries in Dhaka on September 19, 2022, on the prevailing situation in the areas along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn September 16, an 18-year-old Rohingya boy was killed, and five others injured when mortar shells fired from Myanmar fell and exploded in the no-man’s land near Bandarban’s Tumbru Bazar border area. Around 4,000 Rohingyas are reported to be living in this area.\n\nShells have been landing on the Bangladeshi side of the border over the last few weeks and so far, Bangladesh’s response has been rather mild. Soon after the death of the Rohingya teenager in the shelling, Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry summoned Myanmar’s Ambassador in Dhaka Aung Kyaw Moe to protest against the shelling and the violation of Bangladesh’s airspace.\n\nMyanmar’s ambassador blamed the Arakan Army for firing shells and bullets into the Bangladeshi side of the border. He avoided taking questions from the Bangladeshi media.\n\nFighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army is reported to have escalated in Northern Rakhine and Chin states since early August.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\n“We lodged a strong protest note against the violations of air and land space and warned Myanmar that such actions should not be repeated,” Rear Admiral (retired) Khurshed Alam, secretary of the Maritime Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said. Pointing out that “the conflict between Arakan Army and Myanmar military” is an “internal matter” of Myanmar and how Myanmar chose to “solve it” was up to that country, he stressed that shells falling into Bangladesh was not acceptable.\n\nEnjoying this article?

You have to take responsibility for that,” he said.\n\n“If even a brickbat lands on the Bangladesh side [of the border], it is a violation of international rules. Myanmar has to shoulder the responsibility,” said Major General (retired) Abdur Rashid, executive director at the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies.\n\n“As we do not want conflict, our efforts are underway to find a peaceful solution with Myanmar. We will do everything,” said Bangladesh’s Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. “We have repeatedly warned Myanmar through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but they did not heed the warnings.” He said that Bangladesh would inform the United Nations if Myanmar did not halt the firing near the Bangladesh border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis escalation in tension along its border with Myanmar will impact Bangladesh and the region in various ways.\n\nFirst, it will impact the repatriation of Rohingya refugees. Bangladesh is sheltering 1.2 million Rohingya who escaped the genocidal violence unleashed on them by the Myanmar military. This refugee population has become a major concern for Bangladesh. Dhaka has been engaging in talks with Myanmar to find ways to repatriate Rohingya back to Myanmar. However, the repatriation process has not yet begun as Myanmar’s military regime has laid down conditions for repatriation, indicating unwillingness on its part to take the Rohingya back.\n\nThe current border tension will impact repatriation efforts. As Professor Imtiaz Ahmed, an international relations expert based in Dhaka, has argued, Myanmar may be aiming to create a chaotic situation along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border so that repatriation will be delayed and forgotten.\n\nSecond, Bangladesh-Myanmar tensions will impact subregional cooperation in BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), an organization of member states including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, which are Bay of Bengal littorals. BIMSTEC came into being in 1997 but it was only in 2022 that member-states adopted a long-overdue charter. At a time when SAARC is not functioning due to the adversarial India-Pakistan relationship, countries in the region were looking to BIMSTEC to achieve the benefits of cooperation. Such hopes could be dashed if the Bangladesh-Myanmar tension along the border escalates.\n\nAnalysts are also pointing out that China’s geopolitical compulsions may be behind the rising tensions along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. With India and the U.S. pushing Bangladesh to join the Quad, China is keen that Bangladesh stays neutral and has asked Dhaka to join its nascent Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI).\n\nDuring his visit to Dhaka in the first week of August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had extensive discussions with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Geopolitical issues are said to have been the main item on the agenda of the discussions.\n\nA leading Bangladeshi political analyst told The Diplomat that there are strong links between China and the Myanmar junta and China wields considerable influence over the regime. It is possible that China is behind the recent tensions along the Bangladesh border, the analyst said, adding that through the shelling into Bangladesh China is signaling that it can create trouble for Bangladesh if it wants via the Myanmar border.",
    "How Bangladesh can protect its development gains through coastal resilience and a changing climate": "Mobilizing community participation\n\nKey to Bangladesh’s success has been the creation of the Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) – an early warning system with more than 76,000 volunteers, half of whom are women. In thousands of remote communities across the Bangladesh coastline and further inland, handpicked volunteers are trained in disaster preparation. Armed with up-to-date cyclone forecasting, volunteers go door-to-door - sometimes using megaphones from the turrets of local mosques – to usher households to cyclone shelters. For women, who are traditionally more vulnerable when it comes to cyclone and flooding risk, the CPP has saved countless lives.\n\nThe model is both deceptively simple and surprisingly effective in terms of its community based social mobilization scale. It is rooted in the government’s strategic effort to move disaster management away from relief and rehabilitation and towards risk reduction and is enforced by a series of legislative, institutional, and regulatory frameworks including the Standing Orders on Disaster, the Disaster Management Act, the National Plan for Disaster Management.\n\nVolunteers from the country's Cyclone Preparedness Program\n\nIn May 2021, when Cyclone Yaas made landfall, CPP volunteers directed local communities to the Char Chatkimara School in the southern coastal district of Bhola in Bangladesh. Built in 2018, the shelter is the product of the World Bank’s Multi-Purpose Disaster Shelter Project (MDSP) which is constructing and rehabilitating over 1,000 shelters and 550 kilometers of access roads. In the 1970s, the country had less than 100 shelters, now it has more than 5,000 – housing nearly five million people.\n\nShelters provide much more than an educational hub and safety from a storm. The paved roads have seen a rise in three-wheeled motorized vehicles, which previously could not traverse the dirt roads. In the cyclone off-season, shelters serve as a vibrant community focal point, morphing between meeting place, polling station, and sometimes medical office. Because of the school’s accessibility ramp, now children with disabilities can come to school.\n\nAlong with the MDSP, the World Bank’s Coastal Embankment Improvement Project-I and the Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project has supported coastal communities and continues to safeguard their livelihoods.\n\nIn 2018, the government approved the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which will invest two and half percent of the country’s GDP annually – approximately $6 billion – into shoring up its resilience and social and economic development. The ‘Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan’ will enhance resilience, grow Bangladesh’s economy, create jobs, and boost renewable energy while using action on climate change as the catalyst.",

    "Latest water-sharing deal between Bangladesh, India is ‘drop in the ocean’": "Bangladesh and India share 54 rivers that flow down from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, chief among them the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.\n\nManaging the flow of water both upstream and down is crucial for agriculture, navigation, inland fisheries, and keeping saltwater intrusion at bay in Bangladesh, but is undermined by a lack of water-sharing agreements.\n\nThe Bangladeshi and Indian prime ministers recently signed an agreement on sharing water from the Kushiara River for irrigation, but experts say this is nothing special in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThey’ve called on the governments of both countries to push for securing long-term treaties on water sharing from major rivers like the Ganges and the Teesta, which in the latter case has been hobbled by local politics in India.\n\nWater management experts have derided as “a drop in the ocean” an agreement between Bangladesh and India to share water from the Kushiara River, a minor waterway out of the 54 that flow between the two countries.\n\nIn a recent visit to India, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina signed a memorandum of understanding with her Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in which both governments agreed to withdraw the equivalent of 4.3 cubic meters (153 cubic feet) per second of water from the Kushiara during the off-monsoon season from November to May.\n\n“Bangladesh will irrigate 5,000 hectares [12,400 acres] of arable land with this water,” said Malik Fida A. Khan, a member of the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) , a technical body that advises the Bangladesh government on the management of transboundary rivers and water.\n\nTransboundary water experts in Bangladesh, however, say the new agreement is a “drop in the ocean.” They expressed frustration that India, sitting upriver, is unwilling to consider the interests of downstream Bangladesh when it comes to sharing of water from the major rivers flowing from the Himalayas down to the Bay of Bengal.\n\n“I personally do not consider the MOU for Kushiara a special one,” said Ainun Nishat, a former technical member of the JRC and professor emeritus at Bangladesh’s BRAC University.\n\n“Both countries are already withdrawing water from the middle of the river — which is an international border — for irrigation. While formalizing an existing consensus is good, there are several other major issues on transboundary rivers that Bangladesh has raised for a long time, which are not getting priority in India.”\n\nBangladesh is an active delta formed by sediments carried through the rivers flowing from the Himalayas. The two neighboring countries share at least 54 such rivers, according to the JRC, the most prominent among them being the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Agriculture, navigation, inland fisheries, and keeping saltwater intrusion at bay are all heavily dependent on the flow of water of these rivers.\n\nTreaties for major rivers\n\nTo date, the only ongoing long-term agreement on river management between the countries is the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. During PM Hasina’s recent visit to India, both governments agreed to conduct an assessment of the optimum utilization of water received by Bangladesh under the provision of the treaty, which ends in 2025.\n\n“We are looking at this as an ongoing process of getting the treaty prolonged,” said Malik Fida, who also serves as executive director of the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) and was part of PM Hasina’s entourage during the India visit.\n\n“This assessment should have been done right after the agreement was signed in 1996, as per the treaty,” said Nishat, who played a key role in bringing about the treaty. “But it never took place. It is good to see that it is finally going to happen.”\n\nBangladesh has been seeking a treaty to share the water of the Teesta River, another major common river, for several years.\n\nBut while India’s national government has been keen to arrive at an agreement, there’s been resistance from the state government of West Bengal, through which the Teesta flows before entering Bangladesh.\n\nThe two countries did reach a provisional agreement in 1983 to share the water of the Teesta during the lean pre-monsoon period, under which Bangladesh would get 36% of the water and India 39%, while 25% would remain unallocated. That agreement ended in 1985 and was extended to 1987, but there’s been no progress since then on reviving it.\n\nIn 2011, both the governments were ready to sign an agreement during a visit by then-PM Manmohan Singh of India. But it was canceled at the last minute after the West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, pulled out of the visit.\n\nSince then, the issue has been stuck in “discussions.”\n\n“The chances of getting a concrete decision on Teesta water share is very little because of political complexities in India,” Nishat said. “The West Bengal ruling party does not want to lose votes by agreeing to share the water, and at the same time, the ruling party in the Indian central government does not want to antagonize West Bengal voters as they are looking to increase their political stake in the state.”\n\nRole of the JRC\n\nActivists and experts say the Joint Rivers Commission, the body that’s supposed to facilitate discussions on sharing water between the countries, has been ineffective.\n\nThe JRC is meant to arrange a regular meeting at least once a year between officials from the two countries. But the latest JRC meeting, held on Aug. 25 this year, came 12 years after the previous one, held in March 2010.\n\n“The gap between the meetings should tell you how effective JRC is and what kind of priority it receives from the government,” said Sheikh Rokon, general secretary of the Riverine People, a river conservation group. He added the JRC in any case is only a facilitator, with no decision-making authority.\n\n“It is the government’s role to discuss and solve the crisis, not the JRC’s,” said Rokon, also a former JRC member. “The meeting is supposed to be held between the governments at the bureaucratic level.”\n\nNishat said he believes the lack of action on shared water management will lead to a crisis at some point as demand for water rises in both countries.\n\n“We need a comprehensive management plan for the entire basin area by conserving the monsoon water,” he said.\n\nBanner image: Boats on the Padma River, which is the main distributary of the Ganges flowing into Bangladesh.

    "Bangladesh: Islamists target cricketer Liton Das for Mahalaya greetings": "On Sunday (September 25), Islamists in Bangladesh denigrated the Hindu religious beliefs of cricketer Liton Das and asked him to convert to Islam. The development came after Das shared greetings on the occasion of Mahalaya, which marks the beginning of Durga Puja.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Bangladeshi batsman shared a picture of an idol of Goddess Durga with the caption, “Subho Mahalaya! Mother Durga is arriving.” Soon after, Islamists descended on his timeline and abused Das for being an adherent of the Hindu Faith. It is notable that according to beliefs, Mahalaya marks the arrival of Goddess Durga to Earth from Kailash Parvat.\n\nThe Islamists denounced idol worship and mocked the Hindu deity as an object ‘made of clay.’ Islamists, who dwell in their make-believe world of religious supremacy, also hoped that Liton Das would convert to the supposed ‘One True Faith’ aka Islam.\n\n“World’s best religion is Islam,” commented Miyad on Liton Das’ post on Mahalaya. “Let Allah provide guidance to everyone, and give them the wisdom to find the right path (Islam),” wrote Emrol.\n\nScreengrab of the Facebook comments\n\nIslamist N Ferdaus Zaman tried to play a spoilsport and remarked, “No religion other than Islam has any value on the face of the Earth.” Another fanatic wrote, “You guys must understand that these idols made of clay won’t do any good. Because these idols are meaningless. This is why you should believe in Allah, your Creator.”\n\nScreengrab of the Facebook comments\n\nOne KR TuRan wrote, “These stone idols cannot be sacred to anyone. Any rationale individual will not worship an idol carved in stone. I welcome you to the fold of Islam. Come to the right path.”\n\nOne Mohammed Abdul Lotif expressed hope that Allah provides guidance to everyone to tread on the ‘right path’ of Islam. The visceral hatred for Hinduism and the practices of idol worshippers is thus evident from the comments of the Islamists.\n\nScreengrab of the Facebook comments\n\nMuslim child spews hatred against Hindu cricketer\n\nHate towards religious minorities, especially the Hindu community, is not a new phenomenon in Bangladesh. Earlier, a video of a young boy went viral on social media where he turned down the idea of meeting Hindu cricketer Soumya Sarkar for the virtue of his religion.\n\n” Soumya Sarkar is a Hindu cricketer, I don’t want to meet him ” . When a Bangladeshi madrasa boy is asked which Bangladeshi cricketer he would like to meet. Then the boy answered. pic.twitter.com/NGsHgt5pvS — Voice Of Bangladeshi Hindus 🇧🇩 (@VoiceOfHindu71) August 18, 2022\n\nIn the viral video, a reporter could be seen asking the child about the cricketers that he wanted to meet. Responding to this, he says, “I want to meet Mushfiqur, Mustafizur Rahman, Taskeen Ahmed and Sariful.” When quizzed about Soumya Sarkar, the child said, “Soumya Sarkar is a Hindu cricketer. I don’t want to meet him.”\n\nThe Hindu community had to face the wrath of Islamists in Bangladesh, especially during last year’s Durga Puja, over false allegations of blasphemy.",
    "Lack of finance prevents Bangladesh farmers from diversifying their rice crops": "About 15 million farmers in Bangladesh grow just five to six rice varieties, despite the availability of more than 130 different rice varieties, giving rise to an effective monoculture that leaves farmers at higher risk from pests and diminishing yields.\n\nObservers attribute this to a lack of support from the government to help farmers explore other rice varieties, which typically have lower yields and fetch lower prices than the most popular varieties.\n\nLack of financial support means many farmers have to take out high-interest microcredit loans for their operational expenses, which in turn compels them to grow the most profitable rice varieties, locking them in a vicious cycle.\n\nObservers have called on the government to do more to incentivize farmers to diversity their rice crops, pointing to long-term benefits in the form of improved soil health and resilience to pest attacks.\n\nBangladesh is home to more than 130 different rice varieties, but a lack of economic incentives means farmers here grow only a handful of the higher-yielding types. This has given rise to a virtual monocrop system, which farmers and experts say threatens both long-run production and soil quality.\n\nMost farmers, meanwhile, blame a vicious cycle of dependence on high interest micro-credit for agro-input, which leaves them overdependent on high yield varieties, and little room to experiment with other varieties.\n\nAbdur Razzak,a 48-year-old farmer in the northern district of Dinajpur, has for the past 15 years grown the most popular varieties — known as BRRI-28 and BRRI-29 — which yield around 6 metric tons of rice per hectare of land, or about 2.7 short tons per acre.\n\n“A couple of years back we tried BRRI-35,” he says. “[We] dropped it the next year as it yielded only about 3 [metric] tons per hectare,” or 1.3 short tons an acre. Making matters worse, the market price of BRRI-35 and other lesser-known varieties is lower than that of the popular varieties because of the lack of demand.\n\nLike Razzak, some 15 million farmers in Bangladesh depend just on five to six rice varieties in an effort to maximize their output, cultivating them on 8.6 million hectares (21.3 million acres) of land. That’s made Bangladesh the fourth-highest rice-producing country in the world, churning out 36 million metric tons of rice annually to feed its 170 million people.\n\nOther popular varieties are BRRI-58, 50, 63 and 74, all named after the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute that developed them. But it’s BRRI-28 and 29 that dominate, accounting for around 50% of all the rice grown in the country, because of their better yields and market price.\n\nBoth farmers and researchers say the return on investment is the main reason for this practice, which has given rise to an effective monoculture. The high cost of production — ranging from irrigation and labor to fertilizers and pesticides — as well uncompetitive prices mean farmers have no incentive to explore beyond the dominant varieties.\n\nLack of access to affordable financing\n\nIn a country where agriculture is a mainstay of the economy and farmers play the chief role in ensuring food security, farmers have little formal access to low-cost financing for their operational needs.\n\nGenerally, there are three sources of financial support available to Bangladeshi farmers. First, there are dadon, local lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates on loans that must be paid back in weekly installments. Then there are nongovernmental organizations that provide microcredit loans, followed by state-owned banks.\n\nAlthough the latter, with their lower interest rates, would be the ideal option for farmers, most shy away from banks because of the convoluted bureaucracy. The government established the Bangladesh Krishi Bank in 1973 with the aim of supporting farmers, but even today it hasn’t gained much traction.\n\n“Unfortunately, bureaucratic tangles, involvement of third parties in the loan disbursement process, and political intervention has made the bank ineffective,” said Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed, deputy managing director of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF).\n\nBetween the dadon and the NGOs, farmers tend toward the latter. But even here, the loans aren’t cheap: the average annual interest rate is 31%.\n\n“We are forced to sell the paddy at a low price immediately after harvest to repay our loans,” said Dilip Kumar, a 40-year-old farmer from another northern district, Lalmonirhat. “If we wait to sell it, the interest on our loan will go up.”\n\nRisks of monocrop culture\n\n“If farmers cannot get a fair price for their produce and cannot access finance to meet their [production] needs on time, they will definitely go for varieties that have the best yield,” said Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, a researcher on environment and climate change issues.\n\nHe said that makes the predominance of monoculture the fault of the government, as it has failed to address the farmers’ interests by making it feasible for them to explore other rice varieties.\n\nA 2019 study suggested that adopting alternative varieties of rice could help Bangladeshi farmers avoid risks such as pest attacks and low yields in the long run — risks that grow the greater the overdependence on a few varieties.\n\nRepeated monocropping also degrades soil health, which Ahsan Uddin, who is a member of the Green Climate Fund’s Independent Technical Advisory Panel of the Green Climate Fund, also blamed on the government.\n\n“The farmers are not liable for the damage to soil health. It’s the state’s responsibility to ensure availability of technology, finance and cultivable varieties. The government has failed in this regard,” he said.\n\n“The government should introduce a mechanism so that farmers get a fair price for their production,” said Jibon Krisna Biswas, a former director-general of the BRRI. “Otherwise, they will continue to grow varieties like BRRI-28 and BRRI-29. This is leading to the monocrop culture, which will bring ecological ruin in the long run.”\n\nBanner image: Farmers with freshly harvested paddy.

    "Farmers in Bangladesh pump so much water it may help reduce floods": "Thanks to millions of farmers’ irrigation systems in Bangladesh, there is more space for monsoon water to go straight into aquifers, possibly mitigating flooding\n\nAn electric-powered irrigation well pumping groundwater to rice fields during the dry season in north-west Bangladesh M. Shamsudduha, UCL\n\nMillions of smallholder farmers in Bangladesh pump huge amounts of groundwater for irrigation, helping to triple the country’s rice production and possibly mitigate floods during monsoon season.\n\nIntensive irrigation and other agricultural improvements since the 1980s have enabled Bangladesh to produce enough food each year to be nearly self-sufficient. “In Bangladesh we rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation,” says Kazi Matin Ahmed at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. He says Bangladesh has a lot of groundwater but there are concerns it could be depleted.\n\nUsing millions of groundwater measurements from 465 sites across Bangladesh, Ahmed and his colleagues estimated how much groundwater was pumped by more than 16 million farmers between 1988 and 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, the farmers operate more than 1 million diesel and electric pumps to flood rice paddies during the dry season, which has enabled more food to be produced on more land. Thanks to irrigation and other agricultural improvements, rice production in the 2018-2019 season was more than triple what it was in the early 1970s.\n\nAt roughly 25 per cent of the sites, the records showed depleting groundwater levels. At around 40 per cent levels during the dry season and monsoon remained steady. In the remaining 35 per cent, levels declined during the dry season due to irrigation but aquifers were completely refilled during the monsoon.\n\n“In our part of the world there is a lot of rainfall, there is a lot of river flow,” says Ahmed. “Not all of that can find its way to the aquifers, because they first become full. When [farmers] extract more groundwater, the water level falls and it creates room for additional recharge.”\n\nThis additional recharge amounted to between 75 and 90 cubic kilometres of freshwater captured between 1988 and 2018. That is more than twice as much as is held back by the Hoover Dam in the US. Divided across 30 years, the annual additional capture is greater than the UK’s total annual water use, says Mohammad Shamsudduha at University College London.\n\nIn addition to boosting yields, this “Bengal Water Machine”, as the researchers refer to it, may have helped lessen flooding during monsoon seasons. “If there is no recharge, all the water would be on the surface. Then you have a bigger flood,” says Ahmed.\n\nPumping groundwater for irrigation is unsustainable in many places. In northern India, the western US, northern China and other dry places, pumping has depleted aquifers. Globally, most land irrigated in the past two decades is located in places without enough water to pump without eventually running dry.\n\nBut Bangladesh and other places with a similar geology and a seasonal monsoon, such as eastern India, Nepal and parts of South-East Asia, could see these dual benefits of increased food production and flood protection from more irrigation, says Aditi Mukherji at the International Water Management Institute in India.\n\n“What we don’t know enough is the long-term impact of climate change,” she says. Even as irrigation helps farmers protect against climate variability, prolonged drought or more erratic rainfall patterns could change the dynamics that make such “water machines” run.\n\nJournal reference: Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.abm4730\n\nHow plants survive from the poles to the tropics Yoseph Araya at New Scientist Live this October",

They can talk but they don't act,\" she told AFP on a visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\"The rich countries, the developed countries, this is their responsibility. They should come forward. But we are not getting that much response from them. That is the tragedy,\" she said.\n\n\"I know the rich countries, they want to become more rich and rich.

That year, $83.3 billion was committed, including through private sources, according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development figures.\n\nOne key issue facing the next UN climate summit, to take place in Egypt in November, is whether wealthy nations also need to pay for losses and damages from climate change -- not just to pay for adaptation and mitigation.\n\n\"We want that fund to be raised.

The campaign included house to house visits, through which more than 3,600 persons with specific needs were identified and referred to services in the camps.\n\nAs part of ongoing capacity building of Armed Police Battalion (APBn) in the camps, 192 APBn personnel, including 30 women were trained on refugee protection, including community policing, safe identification, confidential referrals, and gender and child-sensitive policing. APBn is responsible for safety and security in the camps.\n\nWith the support of the PSEA Network, UNHCR organized a one-day workshop for PSEA focal points of 22 different organizations. The workshop refreshed partners’ knowledge of the referral mechanism and case management for survivors.",
    "Opinion: Why Bangladesh is right to include India when counting threat perceptions": "How does a nation go about formulating its threat perception? Does popular perception play any role in it? Can there be variation in perceived threat and real threat? Does a country’s past activities help one to figure out the extent of perceived threat?\n\nThese are some of the questions that came to mind when I was going through an article recently written by an Indian scholar in which he mentioned that Indian security analysts are always surprised by Bangladesh’s threat perception when they find that India, even if not directly named, appears in the radar of Bangladesh. According to him, differences in perception of threat have made defence cooperation a non-starter between the two countries.\n\nI would say, however, that defence cooperation between Bangladesh and India has thrived in the past decades. A multitude of activities including various exchange programmes have been going on as part of it even before the current government’s coming to power.\n\nGeneral Hussain Muhammad Ershad was the first Bangladeshi officer to attend the National Defence College in India back in the early 1980s. In fact, this is a platform where officers at strategic levels interact with their counterparts on various aspects, covering wide ranging issues that affect national, regional, and global conflict, peace, security, and stability.\n\nThe National Defence College in Bangladesh, though a relatively new outfit, has come up very well. The beauty of interaction at such a level is that officers from even arch-rivals like Pakistan and India sit together, interacting and exchanging views on issues controversial and not so controversial.\n\nHence, the Bangladesh military has an advantage that allows them to sit across a table with both Pakistan and India, at least for academic purposes. We take pride in this venture that provides such a platform to both India and Pakistan, who usually would not get a scope of informal exchange of this kind.\n\nExchange programmes in institutions such as Defence Services Command and Staff College continued even during the rule of autocrats. We may not have been as fortunate as India in giving democracy an uninterrupted run ever since our birth as an independent country, but such exchange programmes continued even under autocratic or pseudo-democratic rule.\n\nThe Indo-Bangladesh border at Sitai in West Bengal.

Training of officers, exercises, and other exchange programmes are done very frequently. As part of informal military exchange, a good number of high ranking military officers of Bangladesh visited India a few years back. Exchange of know-how and experience remains a continuous process. Honouring the Indian veterans of our Liberation War also goes on to showcase the high level of defence-cooperation between the two neighbours.\n\nBangladesh’s achievement in anti-terrorist operations within our country is having visible impacts both within the country and across the border. India is a direct beneficiary to it. Peace in Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland, and Tripura has been greatly enhanced by fulfilment of our pledge that we shall not allow our territory to be used as safe havens by dissident elements of any origin.\n\nI would like to leave it to the readers’ judgement whether we can call it a “non starter” after having achieved all these.\n\nHowever, in the name of defence cooperation, if it is expected that Bangladesh’s armed forces should procure certain kinds of military hardware from its neighbours, that may amount to curbing our choice in this regard. It reminds me of the discomfort Indian strategists expressed when Bangladesh procured two submarines in 2017.\n\nThreat perception is something which is dealt exclusively at the core national level. Well-informed citizens can make efforts to visualise and a commonsense approach may not always be wrong.\n\nThere would be top-level defence analysts, strategists and planners who would do it by getting feedback from a host of relevant agencies. Besides government agencies, there could be other think-tanks who also devote their efforts into making their own threat perception. This remains a dynamic process.\n\nMilitary threat may form a small component of it while there could be many other ingredients of threat perception of a nation. A perceived threat may have multiple sources of origin as a result of actions on the part of the country in question. These could be socio-economic, environmental, common and shared resource-centric, and health and welfare-related threats to one’s security.\n\nOver-reliance on one source may itself become an insurmountable threat to a nation’s vital interest and well-being. The handling of Covid-19 by the Bangladesh government is a case in point. Had we relied only on our big neighbour for Covid vaccine, we would have faced dire consequences.\n\nThankfully, our government acted prudently by utilising other sources as well. This was a smart approach and deserves much appreciation. Hence, keeping options open may prove to be the best option in encountering a threat.\n\nIn aspects of defence, nations do cooperate in learning from each other, sharing information, experience, and expertise. But then again, there are issues. Notwithstanding a host of joint training and shared activities, there will be some exclusive segments for specialists and members of the armed forces of only the concerned countries to handle.\n\nDepriving Bangladesh of our rightful share of common rivers, namely Teesta and Padma, is a critical issue for our very survival. The devastating manifestations are only vivid in the desertification of a vast area, adversely impacting the lives of millions. Our rivers have grown shallow and wide, creating havoc by uprooting millions as a result of river erosion and unregulated flooding.\n\nA boat on the Teesta River in Bangladesh. Credit: Ahamed Rafid, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIt is a direct consequence of unilateral withdrawal of water upstream and diversion of natural flow. The number of internally-displaced people as a consequence of river erosion is on an alarming rise. This definitely is a reckonable existential threat which has its origin in India. Efforts from India could be fruitful if dialogues were arranged involving all stakeholders like Sikkim and West Bengal.\n\nUnabated border killing, even dishonouring Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina when she was visiting and having such cordial discussions with her counterpart, is another issue wherein lives of Bangladeshis are continuously put in harm’s way.\n\nWhen such arbitrary killing goes on and even being justified by our counterpart that only criminals are being killed, the idea of joint patrolling and border cooperation sounds rather unkind. Our border guards have definitely failed at playing their role in safeguarding our lives and their presence at the border did not produce any deterrence whatsoever on their counterparts.\n\nOne can only hope that Indian strategists and policy-makers would pay heed to these issues and let India take Bangladesh along in its win-win journey in all spheres of cooperation, including defence.\n\nBrig Gen Qazi Abidus Samad, ndc psc (Retd) is a freelance contributor.\n\n\n\nThis article first appeared on The Dhaka Tribune.",
    "SD Burman’s home in Bangladesh set to be converted into cultural complex": "Legendary musician and composer Sachin Dev Burman's palatial home in Cumilla district of Bangladesh is all set to be transformed into a cultural complex, with the Sheikh Hasina government having sanctioned Taka 1.10 crore ( ₹86 lakh) for the project. Also read: Rafi, Dev Anand, SD Burman gave incredible music: Amitabh Bachchan\n\nDev Burman, father of RD Burman, born in 1906, spent the first 18 years of his life in this South Chartha village rajbari (palace) in Cumilla, said Golam Faruk, an advocate and a prolific writer who edited a 596-page book on the musician.\n\n\"His musical talent was honed under the supervision of his father, who was a sitarist. Dev Burman completed his schooling from Cumilla Zilla School and graduated from Victoria Government College in 1924,\" Faruk, also a historian, said.\n\nHis father, a descendant of Tripura royal family, had moved to Cumilla to look after the princely estates.\n\nThe palace, where the music maestro was born and raised, was listed as a protected monument on Nov 30, 2017, officials in Bangladesh said.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina had visited Agartala to attend the convocation of Tripura University in 2012 and assured a delegation of writers and cultural activists there that the house would be preserved and converted into a cultural centre and museum, the officials said.\n\nIn May 2017, Hasina had visited Cumilla to attend the 116th birth anniversary of poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, and laid the foundation stones of seven projects, one of which was for the 'Sachin Dev Burman Cultural Complex’, they said.\n\nFaruk pointed out that the palace was built on seven acres of land, but a major part of it was encroached upon, over the years, as it lay abandoned.\n\n\"Cumilla MP AKM Bahauddin Bahar, however, was able to vacate the land to a considerable extent with the help of the district administration,\" he told PTI.\n\nThe MP, when approached, underlined that the government sanctioned Taka 1.10 crore for building the complex.\n\nThe district collector of Cumilla, Md Kamrul Hasan, said the administration was waiting to hand over the house to the archaeology department, have completed all repair work.\n\n\"The restoration work was completed long ago. Since the site is yet to be taken over by the archaeology department, the district administration is still looking after it. Two staff members of the district administration and the archaeology department are currently taking care of the house,\" he told PTI.\n\nFaruk, also a 'mukti joddha' (freedom fighter), said, \"Many geniuses, including renowned Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, had visited Dev Burman's house and played music with him.\"\n\nAn official said on the condition of anonymity that the abandoned house was used as a military warehouse during the Pakistan regime.\n\nAfter the warehouse was removed, part of the house was converted into a poultry farm, and since then, the place was known as 'Cumilla poultry farm', he said.\n\n\"Former cultural affairs minister and theatre personality Asaduzzaman Nur had earlier announced that a complex would be built around the house with a floating stage in the pond. A music library was also part of the plan. The poultry farm will have to be done away with,\" he added.\n\nDev Burman, popularly known as 'sachin karta', lived in Cumilla until 1924, said Faruk.\n\n\"He left for Kolkata that year to pursue higher education and then later to Mumbai in 1944. Those of the Dev Burman family, who lived in the Cumilla house, migrated to India after 1947,\" Faruk added.\n\nDev Burman’s first major breakthrough in Mumbai came in 1947 with Do Bhai. He went on to compose music for several epic Hindi films including Pyaasa, Kagaaz ke Phool, Guide, Abhimaan and Mili.\n\nHe also sang songs in semi-classical and folk styles of Bengal.

    "From Revolutionaries to Visionless Parties: Leftist Politics in Bangladesh": "Several indices on democracy have identified the current Bangladeshi political system as “semi-authoritarian,” “hybrid,” or only “partly free.” Despite showing promise of re-democratization from the early 1990s to the late 2000s, the country appears to have returned to its path of “democratic backsliding.”\n\nThe controversy in 2013 over the International Crimes Tribunal—which was instituted to prosecute the people involved in crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and other crimes under international law that occurred during the 1971 liberation war—accelerated democratic backsliding in the country, accentuated the rift between secular and Islamist parties (reflecting the left/right divide) in Bangladeshi politics, and led to two opposing mass movements. On the surface, pro-tribunal, leftist forces won this battle with the successful conclusion of the tribunal. Some experts claim that since the Awami League (AL) came to power in 2014, it has enacted policies that undermine freedom of expression, minority rights, and women’s empowerment, contributing to democratic backsliding and an overall rightward shift in the country. On top of this, others argue that the party’s policies have contributed to further marginalization of the opposition.\n\nToday, Bangladeshi opposition parties are struggling. The center-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) never quite recovered from its boycott of the 2014 election, and its party chair, Begum Khaleda Zia, was imprisoned in 2018 on corruption charges. Zia was granted bail on certain conditions through a government executive order in 2020. Although the government extended the bail for the fifth time in March 2022, BNP leadership still complains about repression. The other center-right party, Jatiya Party (JP), struggles to maintain its role as the main opposition party, holding only 26 out of 350 parliamentary seats. The far-right Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI) lost its registration status due to the leadership’s war crimes in the 1971 liberation war. Another far-right party, Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB), captured third place in the 2018 parliamentary election, but it failed to secure a single seat in parliament. Absent any electoral threat from right-leaning parties, the current conservative shift in Bangladeshi politics is perplexing, especially considering the AL’s electoral and executive alliance with some leftist parties.\n\nTahmina Rahman Tahmina Rahman is a visiting assistant professor of political science at Rollins College in Florida.\n\nThis paradox leaves observers wondering why leftist parties have failed to exert their influence and reverse the country’s rightward shift and creeping authoritarianism. In today’s Bangladesh, these parties have been relegated to what one expert called a “microscopic condition.”1 Although not monolithic in terms of nature and ideology, leftist parties in Bangladesh share institutional and ideological constraints that curtail their abilities to emerge as dominant political actors.\n\nThis article analyzes thirty-nine expert interviews, four focus group discussions with students at the University of Dhaka, and qualitative content analysis of the party platforms, manifestos, and publications of four leftist parties to explain those parties’ failure to aid democratic consolidation in post-1990 Bangladesh.2 It begins by tracing the history of leftist parties to the colonial era, examining the role of the country’s authoritarian past and how the parties’ habits of acting within larger parties limits leftist politics. Then, the article identifies ideological and organizational challenges that impede party success and grassroots mobilization, including leftists’ reputation of being “elitist” and “atheist,” their inability to engage civil society networks, and intraparty feuds. Finally, the piece closes with a discussion on the future of leftist parties in Bangladesh.\n\nHistory of Leftist Parties in Bangladesh\n\nLeftist parties in the Indian subcontinent have a well-documented history of participating in anti-colonial movements against the British. In the post-partition era, Bangladeshi leftists played an influential role in anti-authoritarian mobilization against Pakistani dictatorship. Though these parties were not allowed to operate openly, some worked through the AL. After the party spearheaded the liberation war in 1971, however, leftist parties suffered from internal feuds and confrontation with the ruling AL. Even when leftist parties became the only viable option for opposition politics when religion-based politics was banned in 1972,3 these parties still could not agree on how to initiate a socialist revolution. The military coup in 1975 removed the AL from office, but opposition politics were still restricted. After fifteen years of military dictatorship, the two centrist parties along with smaller leftist parties mobilized the nation and reinstituted parliamentary democracy in 1991.\n\nStill, leftist parties struggle in national elections. Well-known parties like Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JASAD) and the Workers Party of Bangladesh (WPB) have some parliamentary representation, but their constituencies and subsequent vote shares are very small. Focus group discussions (FGD) conducted among students at the University of Dhaka indicated that these parties have become so irrelevant that most young voters cannot even name more than two leftist parties or their leaders. Participants also admitted that they have very little or no clue about the political ideology of these parties, save the ones that occasionally end up as part of the governing coalition. Although in no way representative of the total voting population, remarks by student participants in FGDs indicate that leftist parties in Bangladesh suffer from a legitimacy crisis. Ultimately, this crisis has been a result of authoritarian rule and the left’s failure to popularize their agenda.\n\nPoliticking Through Bigger Parties: Erosion of Party Power\n\nMost experts interviewed by the author argued that Bangladeshi leftist parties lack a distinguishable voice compared to their moderate counterparts. Historically, leftist parties avoided the wrath of authoritarian rulers by politicking through more mainstream parties. Dictatorial rule and legal barriers necessitated their collaboration with mainstream parties to achieve common goals—such as independence from Pakistan and the end of military dictatorship—but this strategy also meant leftist parties existed under the shadow of their mainstream counterparts. Following the end of military rule in 1991, coalition politics exacerbated this dependency, further compromising leftists’ ability to push their agenda. A veteran leftist politician explained:\n\nThere are some benefits and profits of coalition politics. In fear of losing those benefits and profits, [leftists] sometime take a softer approach in speaking against oppression and unfairness and in favor of changing laws. I will call this an opportunist tendency. Because of this opportunism, sometimes they do not come off as active in the field, inside and outside the parliament, on the street as one expects them to. This is one shortcoming of forming an alliance with bigger parties.4\n\nThese explanations demonstrate that leftist parties in coalition often become less able to hold centrist parties accountable and push for alternative policy proposals. The leading parties, too, take advantage of this dependency by not taking leftist policy proposals into consideration.5 In its “political program” (রাজনৈতিক প্রস্তাব), JASAD recognizes that despite being a coalition partner of the AL, it is not treated well. Its official program reads,\n\nLeaders-activists-supporters of JASAD are not happy with the number of seats it received for being part of the 14-party alliance and the grand alliance in the past. All levels of party leaders-activists-supporters believe that the number of seats offered to JASAD as a result of electoral coalition is not respectable for the party. We definitely want this situation to change. However, reality is brutal. Whatever injustice has been done to the party in terms of seat distribution has happened because of party’s own weakness. Our own weakness has forced us to accept this compromise over seat distribution.6\n\nReputational Damage: The “Elitist” and “Atheist” Image\n\nBoth FGD respondents and experts emphasized that leftist politicians in the Indian subcontinent have a reputation for being elitist. Marxism became popular in nineteenth-century Bengal among a small but powerful section of educated, young Hindus known as Bhadraloks. This enlightened group was responsible for the Bengali renaissance in the nineteenth century but was also perceived as snobbish and clueless about the real world. This perception deepened after the 1947 partition when a minuscule number of Hindu communists chose to stay in East Pakistan instead of migrating to West Bengal, India, due to fears of communal violence. Those who stayed behind were mostly teachers, limiting leftists’ promotion of communist ideas within the “petty-bourgeoisie or lower-middle classes, and to students” and solidifying their elitist reputation. Legal restrictions further prevented these parties from operating freely in united Pakistan’s military dictatorship, eroding any chance to expand their platform beyond these classes.\n\nLeftist politicians and intellectuals are still viewed this way by students at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. When asked about leftist politicians and activists, FGD respondents described them as “snobbish” and “elitist.” A professor of economics at the University of Dhaka found the tendency to talk about revolution from the comfortable urban setting as one of the biggest reasons behind the leftists’ failure to emerge as an alternative political force. In his words:\n\nThey cannot sacrifice on a day-in day-out basis like Sheikh Mujib[ur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh] did. . . . Their tendency is to do good without challenging the status quo as much as possible. The mindset is like this: ‘I will not compromise [with my beliefs], but I will not sacrifice [for my cause] either. I will not take risks.’ Here by compromise I mean tactical compromise. But there is no such commitment as leaving the suit [that is, upper-class elite status] behind and explore Bangladesh from one end to the other for six months.7\n\nFGD responses indicate that this allegedly elitist attitude of the parties might have spilled over into student fronts of leftist organizations as well. This perception of young leftist activists perhaps comes from a deeply ingrained belief that not all people are equally capable of comprehending their political message, and hence their efforts should focus on the truly interested ones. Therefore, even within their historic area of operation—public universities—leftists have not been able to garner much support.\n\nOne leftist politician, however, contradicted this stereotype, claiming that the young generation of his party’s activists are still active in the countryside where they mobilize peasants and downtrodden people.8 While grassroots mobilization might not be at the level it reached during the 1980s, the tradition has not totally died. The politician did admit to a leftist proclivity to ahamika, the Bengali word for arrogance, which causes reputational damage and alienates leftist politicians from the people.\n\nLeftists in Bangladesh also have a reputation for being atheists. This label makes building strong grassroots networks and a stable constituency difficult, given existing anti-atheist stigma in the country. In Bangladesh, “if you go to the countryside and tell people that you are an atheist, they will look at you like they have seen a snake. Bengali Muslims are petrified by the term atheism.”9 Authoritarian rulers both before and after Bangladesh’s independence conducted propaganda campaigns against leftists, branding them as impious nonbelievers. One veteran leftist politician remarked that “this label [atheists] cannot be removed. It has always been there, still is, and will always be.”10 The FGD participants confirmed his frustration; most of them used words such as “hedonist,” “immoral,” and “atheist” to describe leftist political parties.\n\nSuch defamation grew stronger when the Shahbagh movement, which demanded capital punishment of 1971 war criminals and a ban on religious politics, emerged in 2013. Leftist students at the University of Dhaka received criticism from right-wing political parties for promoting a secularism tantamount to anti-Islamism. The term “atheists” came to be used to identify anyone sympathetic to the secular movement, although only a handful of activists involved were self-proclaimed atheists. This type of attack on leftist politicians has continued today; famous religious preachers label politicians as “atheist” for their sympathy toward minority sects. These leaders are called “murtads” (apostates), “atheists,” and “enemies of Islam” because their version of secularism calls for respect for all groups.\n\nLeftist political parties realize they must find a balance between staying true to their ideology and avoiding offending prevailing religious sensitivities. Instead of providing conceptual clarity of secularism and making it Bangladesh-oriented, most leftist politicians have opted for the strategy that the AL has been using since mid-1990s, showcasing the piety of their leaders to offset anti-religious allegations.\n\nThe FGD responses reveal that public displays of piety, like embarking on the holy pilgrimage to Mecca or referring to Islamic documents in political speeches, do not help the leftists much in removing the perception that they are anti-religious. Rather, these strategies give the impression that leftists are only trying to score political points. For example, one respondent commented, “We have seen these leftist parties, such as JASAD and BASAD, relying on a leftist vocabulary in protest demonstrations and rallies. However, when they participate in real politics, meaning election, they try to play the religion card as well. We have seen that leftist politicians, from Hasanul Haq Inu to Rashed Khan Menon presenting religious issues in their election manifestos, even using religious phrases like ‘Allah is the most powerful’ in their posters.”11 Another respondent further explained that “their core ideology might be Marxism. But they also have the opportunist tendency like all other [political] parties. Since Bangladesh is a Muslim majority country, they try to use religion to serve their interests.”12\n\nMobilizational Limitations: Lack of Issue and Organizational Linkages\n\nAs the successes of leftist parties in Greece, Portugal, and Spain over the last decade suggest, linkages with like-minded groups and civil society organizations help smaller parties garner support.13 Linkages provide these parties with legitimacy to establish themselves as integral to the party system and reinforce party messages. Parties have the choice to create, penetrate, and collaborate with civil society organizations to make themselves more “credible in the eyes of the electorate” and foster grassroots mobilization.\n\nHistorically, trade unions are the strongest ally of leftist parties in the civil society arena. However, leftist parties’ linkages with this vital civil society organization have gradually diminished over time due to the authoritarian-era legacy that restricted access to trade unions. After partition, East Pakistani jute and textile industries had been home to left-dominated labor unions until General Ayub Khan rose to power in the 1960s. To exert control over the working class and carry out an anti-communist campaign, Khan introduced factory-level unionism that benefited corrupt union leaders close to the regime. In independent Bangladesh, the politicization of trade unions continued: the AL administration (1972–1975) nationalized key industries and incorporated all labor unions within one single organization.\n\nMilitary rule further exacerbated this trend in two ways. First, Ziaur Rahman’s regime made it mandatory for all registered political parties to declare their own labor fronts.14 This measure introduced fractionalization within unions, and leftist parties lost their hegemonic access to the working class, their core constituency and base for mobilization. Second, the successor Hussain Muhammad Ershad regime intensified the denationalization of the economy, and the rising private sector was against union activities. This further shrank the room for maneuver for leftist parties through unionism.\n\nIn the post-authoritarian era, trade unions started mirroring polarization in Bangladeshi politics. The two bigger, centrist parties, the BNP and AL, took turns running the country. While in power, each party promoted their own labor fronts and union leaders instead of letting the working class organize their own interests. By this time, leftist parties were organizationally so weak that their presence in these unions could not match BNP and AL power. BNP and AL fronts outranked leftist ones, and leftist parties lost the ability to lead on important issues related to labor rights and welfare. This weakness has become painfully visible in recent years on issues of minimum wage and decent working conditions for readymade garment workers in Bangladesh.\n\nIt would be unfair to suggest, though, that leftist parties do not pay enough attention to their core constituency. Official documents from four leftist parties show a clear commitment to the betterment of the condition of the working class, with a particular focus on minimum wage and workplace conditions. However, the restriction of trade union activities makes it difficult for these parties to realize these goals. One leftist politician said that even though trade unionism has been greatly hampered by stricter laws of entry and the introduction of “dalals” (middlemen) and the “trade union mafia,” leftist parties are still trying to work through unions. From his point of view, leftists are also not solely focused on mobilizing factory workers. Since the khet-mojurs (farm laborers) constitute a vast majority of working-class people in the countryside, leftist parties now cast their net more broadly. However, he also acknowledged that grassroots mobilization remains less than ideal in present day Bangladesh. No leftist leader has been able to impress and inspire younger activists through a demonstration effect.15\n\nLeftist parties also share several goals with other members of Bangladeshi secular civil society, goals ranging from poverty alleviation to the betterment of human rights. However, the parties and civil society organizations disagree over how to achieve those goals, so there is hardly any formal or informal cooperation between them. Their relationship is also strained by political parties’ animosity toward civil society organizations for their interference in political processes. A seasoned leftist politician remarked that these civil society organizations have tried to “depoliticize” politics by bypassing political parties. Such sentiments do not bode well for collaboration between the two types of actors.16\n\nIn leftist circles, suspicion of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which form the bulk of secular civil society in Bangladesh, is strengthened by those NGOs’ dependence on foreign funding. Leftist parties in Bangladesh generally view these groups as puppets of imperial forces. The following excerpt from the political proposal adopted at the eleventh party congress of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, for example, explains why NGOs are not viewed as credible partners in social reform:\n\nToday, NGOs are running a big campaign in the country. Broadly speaking, NGOs are working as the “security net” for imperialism to offset the social unrest created by poverty, inequality, and unemployment borne by the anti-people policies of the very same imperialism. . . . In the name of poverty alleviation, they are offering micro-credit in the countryside. The high interest rate of these credit programs is forcing the debtors to take a loan from one NGO to pay back the loan from another NGO. Instead of getting rid of poverty, rural people are getting caught in a vicious cycle of debt. Therefore, the number of poor, stressed, loan-defaulting people has increased in the country. However, the NGOs that are involved in this business of micro-credit are making huge profits. NGO-led reform activities might bring some benefits in the short term. Although there is no reason to oppose these “reforms,” it is our obligation to fight against this reform-ism. We have to remember this about the NGOs. So it is safe to say that considering everything, NGOs are a negative and dangerous actor.\n\nThis sentiment has been echoed by the WPB in its 2018 election manifesto. The party pledged to “save the peasants and agriculture from the hands of loans of rural money lenders and NGOs, by taking practical and effective steps.” Documents from the leftist party Gana Samhati, too, portray NGOs as loan sharks preying on poor rural people. In its blueprint for action, the party declares its obligation to “save the peasants from the multinational corporations selling fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and also from the debt-traps of rural NGOs and mahajans [money lenders].”17 Some experts mention certain cultural organizations, such as Udichi or Chhayanot, as the true civil society of Bangladesh. They see prospects for collaboration with these groups, especially in reversing the rightward shift in politics and society. However, these experts also recognize that deliberate state policy during the dictatorial period promoted a conservative version of cultural Islam, limiting secular civil society’s ability to continuously and consistently mobilize supporters.18\n\nFractionalization\n\nExperts identify intraparty feuds and a lack of internal democracy as two of the biggest weaknesses of leftist parties. In the 1971 struggle for an independent Bangladesh, there was a split in leftist support for the AL. Today’s leftist politicians regret the lefts’ inability to unite at this defining moment of national politics. In post-independence Bangladesh, debates over the appropriate form of social revolution and personality clashes among party leadership only entrenched divisions. The lack of a coherent vision about the future course of politics became even more evident with the military’s 1975 intervention into politics. One leftist politician who was active at the time explained how this era further eroded the collective policy-shaping power of the leftists:\n\nWith the military intervention in Bangladesh, the leftists practically became more marginalized. They fell into the trap of disagreement over whether to engage in a strong anti-dictatorship movement or a somewhat tepid one. . . . Pretty much all leftists in Bangladesh suffered from this hesitation/indecision from post ’75 era through the entire decade of 1980s to 1990. Some of them supported Ershad while others supported Zia. Some even defected from the party to join Ershad’s party. At the end of the day, the leftists came out as the most damaged ones.19\n\nLeftist parties carried the legacy of factional politics into post-authoritarian Bangladesh as well. Some experts opined that party disagreements are still largely personal clashes masked as ideological rivalries. They also identified a lack of internal democracy, an inability to accommodate alternative views within the party, and an absence of strictly enforced party discipline as reasons why personal disputes become intractable, reinforcing fractures among leftist parties. However, one expert dissented and claimed that the capitalist media amplifies the division within the leftists and presents them as feeble to the voters.20 The majority of experts claimed fractionalization has affected leftist politics in three ways: it fragmented their voter base, reduced their organizational strength in terms of both manpower and money, and diminished leftist parties’ individual and collective bargaining power vis-à-vis the centrist parties in power.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nLeftists are not oblivious to the challenges they must overcome to reassert their politics. See more from the Communist Party:\n\nIn spite of so many attempts and successive efforts it was not yet possible to institute a structure of left unity. The influence and mass mobilization power of the majority of the left parties is weak. Besides, many of them have many defects, deviations and confusions. One part of the left is a partner of the “Mohajote”21 and therefore they still remain a part of the government. On the other hand, some left parties are suffering from the various kinds of weaknesses like, left sectarianism, revolutionary phrase mongering, confining oneself to ivory tower theorization completely estranged from mass people. . . . Till now there is also no visible influential, progressive, large, honest and patriotic political force outside the left who could unite with the left and form a left-democratic alliance.\n\nYet not many experts interviewed for this project were hopeful about a leftist resurgence in the near future. Many of them observed a puritan, ritualistic version of Islam gaining prominence in the country, making a secular, leftist ideology unpopular and a reversal of support for right-wing parties unlikely.22 One leftist leader expressed frustration over the younger generations’ unwillingness to take up the mantle of leftist ideology. From his perspective, an infusion of consumerist culture in Bangladeshi society and the normalization of conservative Islamic practices have led to a situation that makes leftist ideology unappealing to this generation.23 A few experts predicted the rise of a third force and the collapse of the two extremes on the political spectrum.24 However, when asked if they see any leftist political party in present-day Bangladesh that might transform into that third force, they could not offer a positive answer.\n\nSome leftist politicians and civil society members were hopeful about the creation of a new political agenda based on the changing socioeconomic needs of the people. They thought that climate change and environmental degradation in the natural disaster-prone country might be one issue on which the leftists could mobilize constituents. The protection and promotion of valuable natural resources like gas and coal could be another issue where leftists could rally support. However, even the most optimistic observers made cautious predictions about the left’s ability to lead. One leftist leader’s advice to fellow leftists was, “Organization! Organization! Organization!”25 He identified being active and visible in politics and participating in elections as the most pressing obligations for leftists. Leftist publications analyzed for this project also reveal this realization among the parties, where they emphasize ideological solidarity and organizational strength to stay relevant in Bangladesh.26\n\nHowever, almost all experts recognized that for leftists to do their job, procedural democracy through free and fair elections must be established in Bangladesh—the opposition should be allowed to operate freely. To quote one left-leaning expert, “We have failed to create a viable alternative force, something that we want. We do not have the kind of force that you need for the minimum level of democracy, secularism, and egalitarianism. You need social democracy, which is absent here.”27\n\nNotes\n\n1 Interview conducted at the expert’s office in Dhaka on February 20, 2020.\n\n2 The publications of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB), the Worker’s Party of Bangladesh (WPB), Jatiya Samajtantrik Dol (JASAD), and Gana Samhati were used for this purpose.
