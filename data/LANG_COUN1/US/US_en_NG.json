    "Policing Breakthrough in Nigeria": "Rising from a recent meeting in Abuja on the security situation in the region, the Northern Governors Forum and the Northern Traditional Rulers Council issued a communique calling for “the amendment of the 1999 Constitution to give legal backing to state police.” For a group that has consistently staked out a position against the idea, insisting that it can only incentivize ethnic entrepreneurs and stoke political division at the state level, the turnaround by northern political leaders was truly extraordinary.\n\nWhile the southern political elite may have grounds for grumbling that the northern about-face is born out of necessity rather than principle, for now, it seems only too glad to see its northern counterparts finally accept an idea that southern advocates have long regarded as a necessary step towards increased political decentralization. The clearest indication that now is not the time for nit-picking is the statement by the Southern Governors Forum “saluting the courage” of the northern leaders and reiterating “the fact of the incongruity inherent in an arrangement which purports to be federal, nominally, but whose observances stand at variance with the best practices espoused by climes considered advanced and progressing…”\n\nWhy the northern volte-face? In the first place, the region has borne the brunt of the escalating insecurity in the country, headlined by the Boko Haram insurgency, farmer-herder violence, and incessant banditry and kidnapping. According to the New York-based Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, more than thirty-five thousand people have been killed across northern Nigeria since the Boko Haram insurgency took off in 2009. Over the same period, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees puts the number of internally displaced persons in north-eastern Nigeria at well over 2.9 million. Other parts of the region have hardly fared better. The International Crisis Group estimates the number of civilians killed by “vigilantes, criminal gangs and jihadists” in the Northwest since 2011 at over eight thousand, with an additional two hundred thousand displaced.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

Among these are the Western Security Network (aka Amotekun), set up by the six Southwestern state governors in 2020; the Ebubeagu Security Network, set up in 2021 by their five Southeastern counterparts; the Eastern Security Network, the paramilitary group of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra; and the state-backed Hisbah, whose members have worked to implement and enforce the provisions of the Sharia law across several Muslim-majority northern states since 1999. Disarmed on paper, “former” militia leaders in the Niger Delta continue to maintain well-armed vigilantes. Indeed, a few of them are confident enough to flaunt their private militias, as Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, one-time leader of the Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force, was observed doing earlier this month.\n\nIn a nutshell, conditions on the ground effectively rendered northern opposition to state police redundant.\n\nTo say this is not to discount the possibility that the decision to reverse course may also have been taken as a last-ditch effort to protect northern political unity. While, as recently as January this year, President Muhammadu Buhari had maintained that “state police is not an option,” it was clear even then that the president was running the risk of being isolated from the majority of northern opinion. For example, several months before, in August 2020, the newly formed North East Governors Group (comprising the governors of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe, respectively) had made an unprecedented call on the federal government to “ensure the deployment of state-of-the-art military hardware to the region.” Significantly, the group also recommended “that the manpower deficit in the Nigerian Armed Forces should be bridged by allowing the police to carry state of the art weapons where necessary,” and that “the police should be equipped with strategic equipment like high-velocity tear gas, trackers, and Armoured Personnel Carriers.” Although the group just stopped short of calling for the establishment of state police, the governors’ frustration at the turn of events in their region was palpable.\n\nAdditional evidence that the tide was turning in favor of state police could be seen in the fact that, at the submission of its report in 2019, the Presidential Panel on Special Anti-Robbery Squads set up by Buhari in 2018 had recommended the establishment of both “state and local government police.” Lastly, addressing members of the highbrow Island Club in Lagos in October 2019, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo openly expressed his support for, inter alia, “the establishment of state and community police forces as well as state correctional facilities” with the ultimate aim of ensuring that “states must have more powers and more rights.”\n\nFormidable obstacles remain. For one thing, an amendment to the constitution will still have to be passed. For another, having states run their own security apparatuses without having to seek approval from the federal government is just one of the many problems besetting a Nigerian federal system that, two decades into civilian rule, continues to bear the imprint of military unitarism. For good or ill, the federal government continues to pull the financial strings of an economy reliant on oil to a sickening degree. Questions around jurisdiction, funding, and the proper distance between the states and the federal government can be expected to excite divergent political passions.\n\nNotwithstanding, the importance of this shift for Nigeria’s journey towards increased devolution of power from the center to the states cannot be overemphasized. In a country as complex as Nigeria, measuring success in inches rather than miles is the beginning of political wisdom.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

    "Nigeria is producing less and less oil. Here's why": "Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nNigeria's oil output was at the lowest since 1990 as its crude oil production fell below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in August 2022. And data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in early September showed that Angola and Libya have overtaken Nigeria as Africa's highest crude oil producers. The Conversation Africa's Wale Fatade asked Omowumi Iledare, professor emeritus in petroleum economics and policy research to explain what's happening.\n\nWhat are the drivers of the decline in oil production?\n\nProduction has been declining since 2012. It's a combination of a lot of factors.\n\nI think insecurity of assets is top on the list—and insecurity of life. Secondly, the maturity of the fields. Thirdly, moving away from onshore to deep water.\n\nThere is also a declining capacity to produce from a technical production point of view and from a market production point of view because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTechnical production is what is actually coming out of the wells and fields. This is obviously affected by the number of wells that are put into production and the less producing wells in a field at its peak, less the aggregate field output.\n\nMarket production is what the country is able to put into the international market and the domestic market.\n\nBoth of them are related, but the market fundamentals of supply and demand affect both of them differently depending on the inventory level. Inventory levels are what's kept in the tank farms where crude oil is stored while waiting for exports and pipeline movement to the refineries.\n\nWhat are the constraints on what's coming out of the wells?\n\nIncreasing technical production requires drilling more wells, finding more reserves and installing more infrastructure. When you have infrastructure decay, and field productivity decline, the technical production will decline.\n\nSince 2003 Nigeria has not put any bidding processes in place to meet exploration and development of fields. And it takes a lot of years before you can tie them up for production.\n\nThere have also not been any new leases. The last one was 2007 apart from the bidding for marginal fields in 2003. As a result we see the maturity of the basins. Playing and production capacity has remained static at about 2.5 million barrels per day.\n\nIn the Niger Delta, an investment of about $19 billion is needed to keep the level of production capacity stable, based on my own estimates.\n\nWe've not done beyond 2.5 million barrels per day production capacity since 2002.\n\nNigeria is fortunate that the deep water wells have been able to cover the decline in production from shallow water and the diminishing onshore production. This brought production in Nigeria up to 1.8 million barrels in 2016.\n\nBut now we have theft and vandalism that's affecting the market production—what Nigeria is able to export, what it's able to transfer to the refineries.\n\nHow does insecurity affect crude oil production?\n\nThere's asset insecurity. Almost 20% of the capacity of Nigeria is being stolen, about 400 to 500,000 barrels per day. But this isn't happening through pipelines. So there must be some type of conniving, because it is just unbelievable that you can move that much crude oil under the watchful eyes of the security agents—either the navy or the army, or whatever. Because there's no way someone can be stealing 500,000 barrels per day by tapping the pipes in the entire Niger Delta.\n\nSo that's what I mean by asset insecurity.\n\nWhat would it take for Nigeria to reduce its heavy reliance on oil?\n\nThe engine that will accelerate diversification of Nigeria's economy is oil revenue, and perhaps gas revenue in the future. This is what you can use to diversify the economy, if properly used. Unfortunately, that has not been so. Spending approximately a trillion Naira per year over the last 10–20 year, to subsidize petroleum product consumption, is not the best way to spend oil money.\n\nThe diversification of the Nigerian economy requires the federal government letting go of its hold on some sectors in the economy. They have their hands in so many things. One is power. It is not the responsibility of the federal government to generate power for the nation. It is the responsibility of the federal government to just develop policies that will allow investors to invest in the power sector value chain.\n\nThe responsibility of the central government is to create an enabling environment. They are not doing that well because of provincialism.\n\nSecond, the diversification of the economy requires the removal of energy subsidies at the consumption end of the energy value chain with zero value addition. The government is spending so much money on the petrol subsidy it is unable to do what really matters. This includes spending money on infrastructure so that goods and services can be moved from the source to the market.\n\nThe physical infrastructure that is supposed to be the responsibility of the government is bad because it is not doing what it's supposed to do with its oil money.\n\nThe government too should not cloud out domestic investors. The government is borrowing too much money. It should think more about manpower development. It's the government's responsibility to make skill workers available for the industry. But Nigeria's universities have been closed for seven months.\n\nSo the economy has not been diversified at all. Oil is contributing a lot to government revenues but not to the economy as a whole. Nearly 80% of exports is accounted for by oil. That's why the economy is not growing. Nigeria's economy grew by 3.54% in real terms in the second quarter of 2022. If you have infrastructure deficiency, skilled manpower deficiency, and road infrastructure deficiency, you won't get economic growth.\n\nThe government must begin to think in terms of decentralizing so many things that they take on.\n\nWhat could the government do to reverse the trend?\n\nYou need to make more leases available quickly so that people can begin to get the rights to produce and export.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is attacks on pipelines and criminality. The government must have the courage to prosecute those stealing crude oil and those vandalizing the pipelines. If it continues to reward criminality, crime will continue to expand and the oil and gas industry may collapse.\n\nIn the process, it must also remove the cloud of uncertainty in oil and gas in Nigeria where energy transition is putting a dampener on investment. Also, the government should put more effort into the use of natural gas for domestic expansion. I don't subscribe to this emphasis on exports of natural gas from Nigeria. I'm a believer that using gas for domestic economic growth is the way to go.\n\nThat's why the Petroleum Industry Act is so good. It is very supportive of domestic gas development for local economy.\n\nI want to emphasize also the need for Nigeria to have a transformation leadership mindset. Transformation leadership is not transactional. Such leadership mindset encourages the heart, inspires shared vision, and motivates others in the management team to act.\n\nIt is a leadership style that is authoritative but not authoritarian in modeling the way to go. It is not averse to challenging traditional management processes that are not optimal.\n\nExplore further Study explores how Nigeria can achieve its fish production target\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "POLL-Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "By Vuyani Ndaba\n\nJOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.\n\n(Reporting by Vuyani Ndaba; Editing by Alison Williams)\n\n((vuyani.ndaba@thomsonreuters.com; +27 11 775 3157;))\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "Workers of Nigeria, unite!, By Felix Oludare Ajiola": "Given the class dynamics of the protracted ASUU strike, it is important that the struggle be prosecuted with the full mobilisation of the entire working people of Nigeria across all trade unions. This is germane, because the capacity of Nigerian students to carve out a future for themselves has been severely constrained by the educational crisis and insecurity they face daily. Nigerian students face severe challenges of dilapidated teaching and research infrastructures, limited job opportunities after graduation, an impoverished social welfare system and a political domain marked by corruption and mismanagement.\n\nSimply put, the Nigerian industrial climate is due for a general strike!\n\nGiven the class nature of the present ASUU strike and government’s unwillingness to fund public education, it is imperative for the entire working people of Nigeria, under the aegis of the various labour unions, to embark on a comprehensive general strike that would compel the government to definitively end the ongoing ASUU strike. It is obvious that Nigeria is a class society. But the class relations through which the citizens are exploited involve both the internal political class and their international capitalist collaborators. Given this fact, class action by the poor requires that they organise themselves to act directly in their own cause, perhaps ultimately culminating in a People’s Revolution against the parasitic thieving ruling class. In embarking on collective action for the resolution of the current impasse, this would not be the first time that a class struggle would be prosecuted against imperial agents, neoliberal actors and authoritarian leadership. Indeed, there have been instances when the entire working class mobilised in solidarity with their counterparts across diverse sectors.\n\nFirst, a general strike became necessary under colonial capitalism during the famous “Cocoa Pool 1937-1938”, when Nigerian workers fully mobilised in solidarity with Nigerian cocoa farmers. In this case, 41 registered trade unions with a total membership of 17,521 downed their tools in solidarity with the cocoa farmers. This radical struggle was initially spearheaded by the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM), which organised several protests and revolts against the British-imposed Cocoa Agreement. A delegation of the NYM made an extensive tour of Western Nigeria to ensure that the general strike was comprehensive and effective. In Lagos, the NYM organised mammoth rallies against the Cocoa Pool. Thereafter, a resolution was passed condemning the formation of the Cocoa Pool, with full solidarity expressed for the impoverished cocoa producers. The working class sustained the general strike until the government dissolved the Cocoa Pool.\n\nSecondly, the Great COLA General Strike of 1945 is another notable example of working class solidarity against an unjust law, as well as deplorable conditions of service. What started out as a labour crisis by railway employees in June 1945 eventually spread to other unions in the civil service, with private sector workers later joining their counterparts in the public sector. Like the previous general strike, the 1945 strike, which involved 17 labour unions and up to 200,000 workers, lasted 45 days and caused a total shutdown of the economy. Given the class dynamics of the protracted ASUU strike, it is important that the struggle be prosecuted with the full mobilisation of the entire working people of Nigeria across all trade unions. This is germane, because the capacity of Nigerian students to carve out a future for themselves has been severely constrained by the educational crisis and insecurity they face daily. Nigerian students face severe challenges of dilapidated teaching and research infrastructures, limited job opportunities after graduation, an impoverished social welfare system and a political domain marked by corruption and mismanagement.\n\nThe Nigerian university system and university teachers are currently gasping for breath owing to the deliberate attempt by government, in concert with neoliberal institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to ground public tertiary education in the country. Inadequate funding, resulting in dilapidated teaching and research infrastructure, lack of modern equipment and resources, in addition to miserable remuneration, have eroded the past gains and glory of the Nigerian public university system. The university is meant to generate ideas for solving societal problems and challenges, leading to qualitative growth and development of the country.\n\nHow can Nigerian university teachers play their part in this process if they have to contend with the perennial problem of miserable salaries, especially under conditions of hyperinflation? How can academics working under such conditions of severe stress compete with their counterparts in other climes? It is unacceptable for university teachers to be placed on salaries that shame their labour! There can be no denying the strong link between cutting-edge scholarship and the material well-being of scholars, as instanced by an environment that is conducive to learning and research.\n\nYoung academics are increasingly recoiling from the nightmare to which they had, perhaps unknowingly, committed themselves, especially when they critically examine the current conditions of their own former teachers. Little wonder they have been migrating in their numbers to Europe and America and sometimes to other African countries that invest more seriously in education. It is troubling that the Nigerian government has turned a blind eye to the suffering of Nigerian university academics. The situation is even worsened by a series of cruel neoliberal policies that seek to transform public education from a public service into a commodity. Indeed, we must ask: How can a people struggling with endemic poverty, misery and disappearing livelihoods afford the commercialisation of education at this time?\n\nIt is clear that the political class only represents power, money and policies skewed towards its inordinate and prebendal accumulative tendencies. The title of a popular book on Nigeria by Karl Maier, This House Has Fallen, is quite illustrative. The author, of course, borrowed the phrase from the Nigerian novelist, Chinua Achebe, whose words he quotes at the beginning of the book: “This is an example of a country that has fallen down; it has collapsed. This house has fallen.” While Achebe’s work reflected a moment of postcolonial pessimism about state and society in Nigeria and Africa in general, today such pessimism is reinforced and it has found particular expression with regard to Nigeria’s working people, whose common patrimony is being looted by a parasitic and shameless ruling elite. Nigerian politics under President Muhammadu Buhari has taken the shape of ‘prebendal politics’, similar to Ekeh’s qualification of the two publics. Political instrumentalisation of disorder is a way in which political actors under the regime maximise their returns on the state of confusion, uncertainty and sometimes even chaos that characterises the polity. The term ‘disorder’ here refers to the lack of institutionalised legal frameworks for bureaucratic statecraft or the supplanting of such frameworks by political actors, thus allowing for prebendal strategies.\n\nWith regards to the economy, the country’s economy has stagnated since Buhari came to power in 2015 owing to a plethora of problems, including the lack of capacity to expand productive enterprises, enhance small and medium manufacturing, promote macroeconomic stability, expand utility grids through public infrastructures such as transportation and communication networks, education and public health. Other issues include removing the impediments to business startups and cross-border flows of commodities and capital. It can be stated unequivocally that this regime is in fact the country’s worst political experiment and historical accident, with its brazen display of lack of micro- and macroeconomic knowledge, its encouragement of corruption as well as its ignorance about the structural workings of the modern global financial system. Undoubtedly, the Nigerian economy has also suffocated intensely owing to the absence of innovation toward price stability, fiscal balance and several essential macroeconomic indicators without which the country is unlikely to transcend the stalemate between extreme poverty, inequality and limited growth.\n\nIndeed, the Buhari government has left the country in a terrible mess as cliques usurp governance to serve their selfish ends. This government has taken us back to the 1980s, with its unrestrained corruption, opaqueness and perfidy, as well as reckless management of collective resources. The attraction of easy oil money and misplaced government policies have diminished investment and interest in Nigeria’s educational, health and agricultural sectors. The currency has crashed and has been devalued at various times. Under this government, industrial productivity is slumbering and the nation is sinking into a static economy. Put bluntly, the Buhari administration has strengthened centralisation of the accumulation of wealth at the level of the capitalist political elite and thereby enhanced the politics of prebendalism and neo-patrimonialism.\n\nThe dominant interest of the comprador bourgeoisie is no longer productivity and aggregate benefit but the individual aggrandisement of a select few. As systemic sabotage and corruption continues unabated under the Buhari administration; revenues that the country should receive from her resources remain unearned, as cartels and oligarchs have captured key public institutions for their primitive accumulative interests. The mother of all corruption is taking place on a daily basis in the oil industry owing to an unholy alliance involving the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the government and their foreign partners. Interestingly, this is a sector where the president doubles as the Minister of Petroleum.\n\nIn the light of such disturbing evidence, one cannot but conclude that only a drastic working class-led revolution can end the monumental corruption in the oil, maritime and aviation sectors, followed by subsequent deployment of these resources and wealth towards the funding of education, employment and sustainable development. Put mildly, a drastic general strike by the Nigerian working class is expedient, as the Buhari regime has failed in representing the interests of the vast majority of citizens. A general strike is overdue, given the class dynamics of the struggle and government’s refusal to fund public education in Nigeria. This is important because revolutions or social transformations are not made by the masses and peasants but by intellectuals and the working class whose expectations are not met by the political system in which they exist. As Professor Olorode has noted, there is need for “the reinstatement of collectivism, public purpose and democratic control of plans, programs and processes which used to be guaranteed by the underlying ethos of inclusive and affordable social services such as public education, health and housing and transportation.” A stable political future will continue to elude Nigeria as long we shy away from building an inclusive political and democratic system on a firm and robust foundation of sustainable investment in education and empowerment of the intelligentsia and professionals.\n\nFinally, the social economic development of the working people in any country depends on the existence and degree of strength of labour unions to challenge the exploitative practices and policies of the bourgeoisie. When these are lacking, weak or subjugated by forces of capitalism or authoritarianism, there will be poverty, misery, lack of human dignity and slavery. It requires a continuous struggle and long-term process to achieve some kind of humanitarian life, lasting peace and human dignity. It should be the common objective of all workers to eradicate the exploitation of humans by humans, if we are ever to reach that goal of building an inclusive society. As Mitchell Foucault has noted, “history is not a predictable mechanism, but a most problematic site of often random struggle, viciously articulated in a cruel world of capitalist-socialist, bourgeoisies-proletariat, oppressor-oppressed, rich and poor’s relationship.”\n\nThe current struggle between Nigerian academics (ASUU) and this present prebendal capitalist government is glaringly a class struggle requiring unflinching solidarity from the masses, artisans, market men and women, youths, workers and labour unions. The defeat of ASUU would be a devastating one and humiliation for the working class as a whole. Education can be adequately funded if the issues of wasteful governance, corruption, oil theft and dwindling revenues, etc., are seriously addressed. As Lai Mohammed noted in 2013 (Daily Post, 21 August, 2013), “If the Federal Government would reduce its profligacy and cut waste, there will be enough money to pay teachers in public universities, as well as fund research and upgrade infrastructure in such institutions. Hungry teachers can neither teach well nor carry out research. And poorly-taught students can neither excel nor propel their nation to great heights.”\n\nI conclude by noting as follows: Education is our future and we cannot afford further decay beyond what we already have.\n\nWorkers of Nigeria, unite!\n\nFelix Oludare Ajiola is a lecturer and researcher in African History and Political Economy at the Department of History & Strategic Studies, University of Lagos, Nigeria.

    "Nigeria presidential hopefuls open campaign in tight race": "With Nigeria’s economy struggling and insecurity rife, four top presidential candidates start campaigning this week for next February’s election in an open race to replace President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLess than five months before the ballot, no clear frontrunner has emerged with major candidates all confronting challenges on their path to the top political seat in Africa’s most populous country.\n\nAfter two terms, Buhari steps down with Nigeria battling high inflation, oil production at record lows and security forces battling jihadists, separatist gunmen and criminal gangs across the country.\n\nTop candidates lining up are Bola Tinubu, a former Lagos governor and stalwart of the ruling All Progressives Congress or APC and opposition Peoples Democratic Party or PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president on his sixth bid.\n\nTwo other candidates are challenging the dominance of the APC and PDP: Peter Obi, a former state governor generating a following among young Nigerians and another ex-state governor and former minister Rabiu Kwankwaso.\n\nCampaigning starts officially on Wednesday, but five months is an unusually long time for Nigeria, analysts say, increasing risks that party infighting and the north-south ethnic and religious divides will complicate the election buildup.\n\nSince returning to democracy after military rule in 1999, Nigerian elections have often been marked by violence, delays, fraud claims and court challenges.\n\nVoter turnout has also been generally low in Nigeria — 33 percent in 2019 — and the two main parties have fielded older candidates seen by many younger Nigerians as offering little change.\n\nThat has left room for third party candidates to tap into growing anti-establishment feeling in what analysts see as a highly competitive electoral race.\n\nThere are 18 presidential candidates, including one woman. Voters will also elect Senate and Congress lawmakers in the February 25 ballot.\n\n“Unlike the previous six election cycles, the 2023 vote is not likely to be the usual two-horse race,” said Dapo Thomas, history and political science teacher at Lagos university.\n\n– Divisions, splits –\n\nNigeria’s constitution requires candidates to win a simple majority and 25 percent of the vote in two-thirds of the country, a nod to the ethnic and religious makeup.\n\nNorth Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, the south is mostly Christain and there are more than 200 ethnicities, the largest being Yoruba, Hausa/Fulani and Igbo.\n\nRelated News\n\nIn an unwritten, power-sharing agreement known as “zoning”, the presidency has also traditionally rotated between north and south.\n\nAfter two terms under Buhari, a Muslim from the northwest, it was widely expected major parties would select a presidential candidate from the south.\n\nBut the PDP broke with zoning by naming Atiku, a northern Muslim. APC also broke with practice by going with a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Tinubu is a southern Muslim and his vice president candidate Kashim Shettima is also a Muslim.\n\nThe APC says Tinubu’s time as Lagos governor shows his political experience. But the ruling party must contend with discontent over management of the economy and tensions over its Muslim-only candidates.\n\n“Strong anti-establishment sentiment will lend opposition candidates Atiku and Obi strong momentum at the start,” Eurasia Group said in a research note.\n\n“But divisions among the opposition, incumbency advantages for the ruling party and strong campaign messaging by Tinubu will likely give the ruling party a boost.”\n\nPDP’s team says Atiku has the public office experience and the business acumen to tackle Nigeria’s economy.\n\nBut the PDP is struggling with a major split. Atiku’s victory has upset a core part of southern supporters, including Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike, an influential PDP stakeholder who has broken ranks.\n\nPDP and APC “are dealing with quasi existential issues of their own, and important political and vote mobilisation blocks which are disaffected,” SBM Intelligence analyst Ikemesit Effiong said.\n\nObi’s campaign hopes their candidate can keep up his early momentum as an alternative. But his Labour Party does not have the political structure to match the APC and PDP nationwide.\n\n“The 2023 general election will be a really difficult but seminal point in Nigeria’s evolving experiment with democracy,” SBM’s Effiong said.\n\n“It has the hallmarks of ending well or ending really badly.”\n\nAFP",
    "Nigeria’s economic outlook uncertain, welfare worsening – W’Bank": "The World Bank has said that Nigeria’s economic outlook is uncertain and its ability to attract domestic and foreign investments is also crashing.\n\nIt also noted that the condition of welfare in Nigeria was worsening despite the economic recovery from recession.\n\nThe Washington-based bank said this in its draft report for State Action on Business Enabling Reforms, which is available on its website.\n\nThe bank report read in part, “Although the Nigeria’s economy in 2021-2022 recovered from recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices, growing by 3.6 per cent in 2021 with an expected growth of 3.2 per cent in 2022, welfare has continued to deteriorate.\n\n“The country’s economic outlook remains uncertain and threatened by many issues including the impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy, lower-than-expected oil production due to technical inefficiencies; heightened insecurity; higher uncertainty on policy direction arising from the upcoming February 2023 general elections; and worsening fiscal risks related to the PMS subsidy deductions.”\n\nThe global lender stressed the need to catalyse private investment in order to boost growth and create jobs, noting that this type of investment was declining in the country.\n\nThe bank said, “Besides, Nigeria’s ability to attract domestic and foreign investment is low and declining compared to its peers. Private sector investment’s contribution to growth has declined as a consequence of macroeconomic and financial policies that constrain exports and foreign investment.”\n\nThe World Bank further emphasised the need for a more flexible and transparent foreign exchange management regime, accelerated revenue-based fiscal consolidation, strengthened expenditure and debt management and improved business-enabling environment.\n\nThe PUNCH reported earlier in September that 32 states failed to attract foreign capital in the second quarter of 2022, according to a Foreign Direct Investment data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nOf the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, only Lagos, Abuja, Anambra, Ekiti, and Kogi witnessed capital inflows.\n\nCumulative capital inflows totalled $1.54bn. Lagos ($1.05bn) attracted the most capital in the period under review, followed by Abuja at $453.95m, Anambra at $24.71m, Kogi at $2m, and Ekiti at $500,000.\n\nIn the first quarter, only six states attracted a total of $1.57bn as capital importation. The states included Abuja, Anambra, Katsina, Lagos, Oyo, and Plateau.\n\nNigeria’s capital importation has been steadily declining, with investors cautious with releasing their money into the economy.\n\nReacting to this, an ECOWAS Common Investment Market consultant, Prof. Jonathan Aremu, said Nigeria lackws attractive factors for investors.\n\n“One thing about investment is that it is crisis-shy. Investment doesn’t go to places where there are crises. This is because investors want stability and predictability of their investments, particularly having returns on their investments.\n\n“When an economy is witnessing what we are going through currently, despite the investment potential of that kind of economy, investors will wait and see whether the factors that can guarantee predictable and sustainable investments will finally be available.”\n\nA Professor of Economics at Onabisi Onabanjo University, Prof Sheriffdeen Tella, said that investors had no confidence in the Nigerian economy due to poor economic policies.\n\nHe said, “Part of the problem has to do with the exchange rate. The exchange rate is very high. Investors don’t have much confidence in the economy anymore. We have to change policies.”",
    "2023: North already has idea of who Nigeria's president is, won't vote religion, tribe - NEF": "THE Northern Elders Forum (NEF) says the northern part of the country already has an idea of who the next president should be, noting that the region will not vote along religious and ethnic lines in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nNEF’s spokesperson, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, disclosed this on Sunday, September 25 while speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today.\n\nThe ability to solve the region’s problems, Baba-Ahmed said, would be one of the foremost considerations when the region goes to the polls next year.\n\nNEF said it would support a southerner if it was convinced he would solve the problems of the northern people.\n\n“We have ideas about what the next president should look like, what is important for the next administration.\n\n“First of all, we need to secure the country. Secondly, we need to ask basic questions about why the economy is failing and what they intend to do. Then, we want to ask what their plans are, or what their thinking is about all the clamour for restructuring,” he said.\n\nThe North, according to him, would be interested in knowing what plans the presidential candidates have for education, particularly for the out-of-school children in the northern part of the country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBaba-Ahmed listed certain qualities as representing the basis upon which the North would be supporting a candidate.\n\n“We want to know what he intends to do in terms of satisfying us that he has the mental capacity, the physical capacity, the intellect, the willingness to tap into the best and the brightest brains available, and sensitivity to a number of key issues that are central to our survival as a country,” he said.\n\nWhile dismissing insinuations that the North would not support a candidate from the region, the group said it would not allow and encourage the region to vote on primordial interests.\n\nHe, however, added that the group would support a northerner if it believed he was the best for the job with the ability to do justice to all parts of the country.\n\nBaba-Ahmed noted that the group was already designing a template that includes the issue of the North’s security, economy, education, and co-existence of Nigerians, and then interrogate our various presidential candidates very seriously in terms of their thinking and what they plan to do.\n\nHe stressed the North would not repeat the past mistakes in choosing the next Nigerian president.",

    "Renovation reignites routine immunisation in Oyo State, Nigeria": "The Bode Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) is one of over 500 PHCs in Oyo State, Nigeria, but until recently, when walking by, one could be forgiven for not recognising it as a health facility.\n\nDue to a lack of maintenance, the health facility had deteriorated to the point where it had no burglary protector, gate, window net, bed lining or chairs for women and their children to sit during immunisation and antenatal visits. The internal doors to some of the rooms were damaged and there was an inadequate supply of essential drugs.\n\n“Our people want to see Bode PHC in good shape. We are determined to ensure that no woman has to suffer to vaccinate their children. The government has put in the facility, and we will keep maintaining it for the people living in the community.”\n\n“This led to a low turnout of patients. Most women in the community did not know there was a health facility right in front of them. They would spend, not just money, but their time, to visit the next PHC, which is a bit far from the community,” the Matron of Bode PHC, Busari Modupeola, says.\n\nBusari Modupeola educating women at an immunisation class.\n\nCredit: Royal Ibeh\n\nFor instance, Modupeola says, in the month of June there were only a handful of visitors ,with no pregnant women coming through for Antenatal Care. Immunisation coverage was very poor as well, she adds.\n\nThese poor health outcomes were the main reason the federal government of Nigeria set up the Primary Health Care Provision Fund (PHCPF) and the Midwives Service Scheme (MSS) in Nigeria following the enactment of the National Health Act in 2014.\n\n“We are so grateful to the federal government and the Oyo state government for selecting Bode PHC. We have been able to access about 600,000 naira (around US$ 1,400) which has been used to fix the gate, put doors in rooms where essential drugs, including vaccines, will be stored, and purchase essential drugs and a megaphone for community outreach programmes,” the Matron reveals.\n\nBode PHC before the renovation.\n\nCredit: Royal Ibeh\n\nThe fixed gate at Bode PHC.\n\nCredit: Royal Ibeh\n\nIn July, the Matron says they started an immunisation and health education campaign, going from house to house and to marketplaces, to inform people about the services rendered at Bode PHC.\n\nShe adds, “With the renovation at the PHC and the campaign, more women are now bringing their children for immunisation and accessing quality healthcare services. The government has given us a midwife to take care of pregnant women to complement the three health workers and two ad hoc workers at the PHC.”\n\nBimbo Akinyele, who brought her baby for immunisation, says, “I got to know about Bode PHC when the Matron with some nurses came to my shop at the marketplace to inform me about the services the PHC are providing for the community members, at little or no cost. Some of us spend up to 500 naira (US$ 1.16) to take our children to other PHCs for immunisation. In addition to the transportation cost, we spend the whole day there because of the crowds. Now that we are aware of Bode PHC, which is close to us, we are happy to bring our children here because we can save money and have our children immunised within a few minutes.”\n\n“Our people want to see Bode PHC in good shape.

    "Fewer than 100 oncologists practicing in Nigeria – ARCON": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Association of Radiation and Clinical Oncologists of Nigeria (ARCON) has predicted a major crisis in the treatment of cancer patients in Nigeria due to the shortage of manpower to attend to millions of Nigerian cancer patients.\n\nThe association disclosed that there are fewer than 100 Radiation and Clinical Oncologists in Nigeria, a figure far below the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nPresident of ARCON Nwamaka Lasebikan, who addressed reporters on the state of cancer in Nigeria, lamented the inadequate response being received from government, corporate organisations and philanthropists regarding cancer response and treatment in Nigeria, even when the disease is killing many people silently or otherwise.\n\nShe was particularly concerned that Nigeria is lagging behind when it comes to manpower that would attend to increasing number of cancer patients in Nigeria.\n\n“IAEA standard is that we should have one Oncologist to a hundred thousand population, but that’s not the case in Nigeria, where we have less than 100 Oncologists attending to the needs of millions of patients,” she explained.\n\n“Ideally, in a country like ours with over 200 million population, we should have at least 2,500 Oncologists attending to the needs of cancer patients. This is as recommended by IAEA but the case is not so. However, while there’s shortage of manpower, many of our colleagues are being enticed with mouth-watering offers abroad, and they are falling to it. Undoubtedly, we are highly overstretched.”\n\nShe said the association will partner with religious and community leaders, schools and other relevant stakeholders at the community levels to carry out massive enlightenment and advocacy campaign for improved health seeking behaviors.\n\nSecretary General of the Aasociation Dr Olalade Kehinde, in his remarks, added that Nigeria is not only suffering from shortage of manpower, but also lagging behind on issues of radiotherapy machines.\n\nHe explained: “It’s a known fact that there’s shortage of radiotherapy machines in Nigeria. The global standard is that there should be one radiotherapy machine to a million people, but that’s not the case in Nigeria. We have less than 20 radiotherapy machines in Nigeria, and only less than 10 of them are functional. So, patients are forced to travel from far places to locations where they could access the services.”\n\nHe lamented the issue of out-of-pocket payment for services, adding, “a regular comprehensive treatment of cancer costs between N500, 000 to N1.5 million. That’s a huge on the kind of economy we are in now, and sadly, over 70 per cent of the patients pay out-of-pocket. It’s a very big challenge.”\n\nHe, thus, appealed to their employers, private and public, to provide a good working condition for them to function well so they are not lost to foreign interests.\n\n“Many of our colleagues are enticed with irresistible offers to join services in the other parts of the world and they are leaving. So, we suffering in two ways in Nigeria. People that are being trained are trying to move out of Nigeria, while people who have been trained are also trying to move in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\n“However, for some of us that have chosen to stay, we request that a good working condition is provided for us to work effectively and efficiently.”",
    "The Deep Roots of Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Problem": "Earlier this year, in July, David Hundeyin, an independent Nigerian journalist, also reported a possible compromise of emails belonging to the Lagos state government and the sale of these emails in the dark market. The Lagos state government and Nigeria’s cybersecurity agencies remained quiet over Hundeyin’s claims, neither responding nor denying the alleged breach.\n\nBy not communicating, these agencies fail to equip their customers and other stakeholders with the information they need to protect themselves and provide actionable advice to anyone exposed by a potential breach. The lack of communication, Staveley says, along with many bad cybersecurity practices, undermines cybersecurity and data protection in Nigeria, and creates a severe lack of trust and capacity.\n\nMany IT infrastructure and data processes in Nigeria do not factor in security and protection, says Staveley, who's worked and consulted with various banks and government agencies in a cybersecurity capacity. “Organizations do not even understand the weight that comes with collecting data. They do not see the data they collect as something that needs to be protected, and so they don’t thoroughly consider encryption and security in their data pipelines.”\n\nNigeria's National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) is in charge of cybersecurity and data protection, and it has established regulations and guidelines requiring organizations that process personal data to be secure in collecting, processing, and storage of that data, and to perform data security audits annually. The 2020 Data Protection Bill also states that personal data should be “processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and access against loss.”\n\nIn practice, however, data collection and processing in Nigeria remains largely unmonitored, and protection is often an afterthought. Sensitive data such as addresses, mobile numbers, financial details, and even identification digits are asked for in queues, malls, and office receptions—places where such data are not necessary, and where they are left accessible to anyone with enough curiosity to check the often public records. “Most people do not even know the importance of their personal data, and no one bothers to tell them that it’s important,” says Staveley.\n\nThere's also a talent-retention problem, mainly due to poor remuneration and the lack of value placed on the work of cybersecurity specialists. According to a mail exchange between Website Planet and a spokesperson for Nigeria's Computer Emergency Response Team obtained by WIRED, PLASCHEMA seemingly lacked the access or technical expertise to fix the problem immediately. “The organization seems to not have the access or the technical ability to remediate the incident promptly,” read the June 27, 2022, email.\n\n“We don't appreciate cybersecurity in this country, for now,” says Moses Joshua, a cybersecurity specialist and founder of Diary of Hackers, a cybersecurity community that, among many other things, tells the stories of hackers. Due to problems with compensation and the lack of tools and incentives needed to perform properly, cybersecurity professionals find it hard to work for Nigerian firms or organizations.\n\n“It’s hard to find a veteran hacker working for Nigerian firms. At most, they’re used as transitions—to gain experience—and once they [cybersecurity specialists] get like two to three years of experience, they leave. It makes no sense to stay in a place where you're paid less, there's little to no career projection, and you have limited access to important trade tools,” Joshua says. (Staveley also raised this concern.) This leads to a lack of cybersecurity talent, but also a darker shade of the same problem. It means available talent has a shallow knowledge of the industry because many do not stay long enough to learn. It means every generation has to start over.",

    "2023 poll: APC, PDP rendered Nigeria world poverty capital, alleges Kachikwu": "The Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) Mr Dumebi Kachikwu says Nigeria has been reduced to the level of the poverty capital of the world due to poor governance under the people’s democratic party (PDP) and the All progressive congress (APC) led administrations.\n\nKachikwu’s presidential campaign council in a statement in Abuja called on Nigerians to reject both parties during the 2023 general elections.\n\nKachikwu alleged that the two parties are synonymous with greed, avarice, corruption and cluelessness and therefore should no longer be entrusted with the task of managing the rich human and material resources of a potentially great country like Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented that the country has continued to lag behind in all indices of development since 1999 when PDP assumed power which it handed over to APC in 2015.\n\nHe accused both parties of ruining the economy and impoverishing Nigerians with living conditions becoming unbearable and nosediving negatively on a daily basis.\n\nHe insisted that it is shameful, inhuman, ungodly, wicked and anti-people for both PDP and APC to be jostling to renew their hold on power during the 2023 general elections in spite of the fact that all indices of good governance anchored on the rule of law have remained negative since 1999 till date.\n\nKachikwu said: “Today, the inflation rate has rallied to a 17-year high of 20.5 per cent up from 8.06 per cent in 2014 before the APC took over the reins of power at the centre in 2015, notwithstanding the humongous debt the party has amassed for the country through reckless borrowing.\n\n“This rate of inflation simply means that the average Nigerian cannot afford their basic daily necessities like three square meals due to skyrocketing food prices and other essential services like healthcare and education for their children.\n\n“While the cost of diesel and petrol are at an all-time high, thus leading to phenomenal increases in transportation cost with its concomitant negative effect on rising prices of goods and services, yet the minimum wage remains a paltry N30,000 per month, a far cry when compared with the jumbo pay of present political office holders.\n\n“The APC administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari like its predecessor has shown great incompetence and cluelessness in prosecuting its three-pronged agenda, namely: Security, Economy, and Anti-Corruption.\n\n“On the economic front, Nigerians have never had it this bad. Life has become a nightmare despite unprecedented budgetary allocations to defence and security agencies by the administration in the last seven years.\n\n“Corruption has continued to grow and fester rather than abate, despite Buhari being awarded a medal as Africa’s anti-corruption champion by the African Union (AU).\n\n“On the other hand, the anti-corruption war is being waged hypocritically as recently alluded to by the Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, in his speech during a workshop organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Anti-corruption, with the theme; ‘Corruption As Threat Security In Nigeria.’\n\n“The recent revelation by the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited’s claim of that Nigerians consume 60million litres of petrol daily with over N6trillion in subsidy payments was a ruse shows that corruption yet dwells in a ministry where Buhari is a minister.\n\n“It is heartrending to note that between 2010 and 2023, the national grid collapsed 216 times, 94 of which occurred in the last seven years under Buhari.\n\n“This unacceptable situation has not only killed once thriving small-scale businesses in the country but has regrettably led to major industries relocating to neighbouring countries that have created a growing army of unemployed Nigerians.\n\n“Notwithstanding the APC administration’s avowed target to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, the reverse has been the case as no fewer than 95.1 million persons in the country would slide into extreme poverty at the end of 2022, according to the World Bank in its recent report titled: ‘A Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment.”\n\nHe urged Nigerians to reinvent the progress of the country by voting in competent parties like the ADC that have the vision and candidates with the know-how to turn the fortunes of the country around for the better.\n\nHe said a situation where Nigerians are daily confronted with unmitigated hunger, poverty, and poor access to healthcare and education due to the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities are all symptomatic of an uncaring and failed governance being foisted on the nation by APC and PDP.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to reverse the trend in 2023 by voting to terminate the stranglehold on the destiny of Nigeria and Nigerians by the APC and PDP.",
    "Nigeria to rethink aquatic potential on World Tourism Day": "Considering the several kilometers of coastline, untapped waterways, deep sea and other tourism potential that abound in the country, Nigeria is rethinking its aquatic tourism with the aim to make it more accessible, viable and alluring.\n\nThe emphasis is timely, especially now the country is looking to diversify from its crude oil-based economy to other non-oil revenues.\n\nIt is also in line with the theme of this year’s celebration, ‘Rethinking Tourism’, which is endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).\n\nFollowing all these, the Federation of Tourism Association of Nigeria (FTAN), the umbrella body of the tourism private sector, is leading in the effort to make the aquatic potential of the country count.\n\nOn that note, FTAN is hosting the Nigerian-leg of the World Tourism Day 2022 in Lagos, and particularly Takwa Bay Beach.\n\nSpeaking recently at Eko Hotel and Suites Lagos, at a media parley heralding the event scheduled for September 27, 2022, Nkereuwem Onung, national president, FTAN, said the untapped potential can generate revenue for the states along the coastline and Nigeria amid creation of job opportunities for Nigerian youths.\n\n“It is time to show the world the business of tourism, we want to assess the water economy in Lagos State; we want people to see that lots of revenue can be generated on the waterways through tourism,” Onung said.\n\nAccording to the FTAN president, in the next one year, the federation would be committed to promoting aquatic tourism across states along the coastline and ensuring that jobs are created through the sector.\n\n“We are looking at how the government can look into that aspect of the economy, woo more investments, make the waterways safe and earn a lot of revenue from such effort”, he said.\n\nRead also: Curbing the effects of insecurity on tourism in Nigeria\n\nSpeaking on the theme for this year’s World Tourism Day, ‘Rethink Tourism’, Onung said it was time for the government and the private sector to channel a cause and promote the business of aquatic tourism.\n\n“We have the right to express ourselves and create benchmarks that will help us see the improvement in the sector,” he said.\n\nReeling activities of the day’s celebration, Gani Balogun, founder, Tarzan Boats and chairman, 2022 World Tourism Day Planning Committee, said the celebration would afford visitors the opportunity to experience boat rides at the Takwa Bay Beach, venue of the celebration in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Balogun, who doubles as the president, Association of Tourists Boat Operators and Water Transporters of Nigeria, (ATBOWATON), Takwa Bay was chosen as the venue because of its minimal water waves and the neatness of the water.\n\nHe noted that apart from FTAN’s hosting of the biggest boat cruise in Nigeria, there are many exciting activities on the beach that day to thrill visitors, while assuring of security with the joint vigilance of the Nigerian Navy and the Marine Police.\n\n“We can also have boat cruises like those experienced in Florida and some other developed nations because we have all it takes, this is what we want to show to the world on September 27, during the World Tourism Day celebration”, Balogun said.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to make it a date to get educated on how revenue could be generated on the waterways, as experts would be engaged to talk briefly on the business aspect of aquatic tourism.\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel Alabi, Board of Trustees chairman, Federation of Tourism Associations of Nigeria, will be leading the tourism private sector to a colourful outing that day.\n\n“As BOT chairman of FTAN and a member of the state chapter of the federation, it is important that I lead the way. I will be there on Tuesday and use this opportunity to call upon all lovers of tourism to come out in great numbers”, Alabi said.",
    "Nigeria battling floods ‘beyond control’ as warning given of dams overflowing": "Nigeria is battling its worst floods in a decade with more than 300 people killed in 2022 including at least 20 this week, as authorities said the situation is “beyond our control.”\n\nThe floods in 27 of Nigeria’s 36 states and capital city have affected half a million people, including 100,000 displaced and more than 500 injured, Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nThe disaster has also destroyed thousands of hectares of farmland, worsening fears of a disruption of food supply in Africa’s most populous country.\n\nSince 2012, “this [the flood-related deaths] is the highest we ever had,” said Manzo Ezekiel, a spokesperson for the disaster management agency.\n\nNigeria sees flooding every year, often as a result of non-implementation of environmental guidelines and inadequate infrastructure. Authorities are blaming the floods this year on water overflowing from local rivers, unusual rainfalls and the release of excess water from Lagdo dam in neighbouring Cameroon’s northern region.\n\nThe Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency predicted more floods in 2022 than last year due to “excessive rainfalls and contributions from external flows” such as the dam in Cameroon.\n\nOn Monday, Nigeria’s disaster management agency alerted more than a dozen states of “serious consequences” in the coming weeks as two of the country’s dams started to overflow.\n\n“I want to advise all the governments of the frontline states to move away communities at risk of inundation, identify safe higher grounds for evacuation of persons and prepare adequate stockpiles of food and non-food items,” said the head of Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency, Mustapha Habib Ahmed.\n\nIn the north-west Jigawa state, floods killed more than 20 people in the last week, Yusuf Sani Babura, head of the Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency, told the AP. The state has recorded 91 deaths from flooding this year – more than any state in the country.\n\n“We are facing devastating floods beyond our control,” said Babura. “We have tried our best and we couldn’t stop it.”\n\nThe floods have also destroyed crops, mostly in Nigeria’s northern region, which produces much of what the country eats, raising concerns that they could further affect food supplies already disrupted by armed conflict in the country’s north-west and central regions.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just sand filled up and the rice has been washed away,” the 30-year-old said.\n\nAkintunde Babatunde, an Abuja-based climate analyst, said the main cause of Nigeria’s annual flooding problem was the poor infrastructure of roads, drainage and waste disposal.\n\n“Unusual rainfall is evidence of the changing climate,” he said.",
    "2023: Don’t engage in activities that threaten Nigeria’s unity – Abiodun tells Nigerians": "As the country inches closer to another general election, the Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has, appealed to Nigerians not to engage in actions capable of threatening the peace and unity towards the conduct of the 2023 poll.\n\nThe governor who made this appeal at the 62nd Independence Anniversary Church Service held at the Cathedral of St. Peter, Ake, Abeokuta, stressed the need for continued peaceful co-existence among Nigerians for the socio-economic and political development of the country.\n\nAbiodun represented by his deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, acknowledged the anxiety generally expressed by Nigerians whenever general election is about to take place, noting that “this is because an average citizen fears that this is the time the unity of the nation is always threatened”.\n\nHe, therefore, solicited the cooperation of all Nigerians to preserve the oneness of the country.\n\nThe governor noted that the independence celebration is an opportunity to reflect on the nation’s hopes and aspirations, adding that the period would also enable citizens to acknowledge gains made and understand why others have not been achieved with a view to moving the country forward.\n\nHe said: “Celebration of our nationhood is the celebration of oneness of Nigeria, of the security of her people and the fulfilment of individuals aspirations.\n\n“In Ogun State, we have built a harmonious society where different ethnic groups and religions live together in peace, run their businesses and bring up their families. In fact, in Ogun State, we have multi-generational families who have made our state their home and conduct their businesses without fear.\n\n“In Ogun State, there are inter-marriages between our citizens and others across the country. We believe this is what Nigeria should be. We serve as an example to other parts of the country”.\n\nAbiodun pointed out that his administration in the last three and a half years, has continued to develop the state by ensuring a peaceful environment for enduring economic development, which has attracted more people to the state.\n\nWhile reiterating that his government would not promise what it would not fulfill, the governor assured that with the support of the people, all promises made during the 2019 campaigns would be kept.\n\nHe, however, called on Nigerians to be their brothers’ keepers and desist from hurting one another, saying “this act of love and care will engender enduring peace and help build a nation that all Nigerians will be proud of”.\n\nIn his sermon, the Diocesan Bishop of Awori, Rt. (Revd.) Johnson Akin Atere, expressed his dismay that Nigeria which was once the giant of Africa, is now begging for bread, saying disobedience, oppression, ungodliness, hatred on the part of individuals, families and governments are some of the sins that have brought the country to her knees.\n\nSpeaking on the topic ‘What is Troubling You’ and taking his text from 2 Kings 6: 24 -27, the cleric said Nigerians, over the years, have been tormented and traumatized for long as “operation no mercy” is now the order of the day, adding that this has caused havoc in the land.\n\nWhile calling for an end in the shedding of innocent blood, hatred, and all forms of sins, he said God was about to do something new in Nigeria, but needed all citizens, including the leaders to renew their minds and faith in God and be their brothers and sisters’ keepers.\n\nAtere urged Nigerians to be wise during the forthcoming general election by choosing the right people to lead the nation, positing that Nigerians do not have the moral right to blame the government if they refuse to do the needful in 2023, which he said is another opportunity to restore the nation’s hope.\n\nHe, however, solicited the inclusion of traditional rulers in running the security architecture particularly at the grassroots.\n\nThe cleric also called on the church to continue to pray for the peace and development of the nation, noting that the current challenges confronting the country would be a thing of the past if all Nigerians play their parts.\n\nThe service had in attendance top federal and state government officials, security chiefs, traditional rulers, captains of Industries, among others.",
    "Hundreds of Schools in Nigeria Closed Because of Safety Concerns": "The new school year started in Nigeria this month, but more than 600 schools are still closed because of a surge in kidnappings and attacks by armed gangs, according to authorities.\n\nIn the small town of Sabo, south of Kaduna state, a group of schoolchildren are united by a common enemy: armed conflict. Most of the children arrived at this temporary shelter with their parents last November, after their villages were overrun by armed gangs.\n\nOne resident, Abayo Iliya, said it was the last time his 6-year-old son attended school.\n\nIliya said his village was attacked, and their homes, farms and the school were burned. Iliya's son's school has since been closed.\n\nIliya's wife, Alheri, said they would like to enroll their son in a safer school but cannot afford it. They lost everything, she said, so they don't have the money to go to another school.\n\nThis month, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, better known as UNESCO, reported that more than 20 million Nigerian children are out of school, up nearly 2 million compared with a similar survey announced by UNICEF in May.\n\nBut Nigerian authorities dispute the figures, saying the situation has improved and that the government has been spending much more on education.\n\nAuthorities also say UNESCO's estimates did not capture the number of children attending unconventional schools in northern Nigeria.\n\nBut Abdulsalami Ladigbolu, the head of UNESCO's Read and Earn Federation in Nigeria, said many factors that contribute to the problem were considered before publishing the report.\n\n\"It's a complex situation. Really, insurgency can be part of it. Secondly, the death of their parents or guardian responsible for tuition. Another factor we can consider is early marriage,\" Ladigbolu said, adding that that issue is specific to girls.\n\nLast week, dozens of worshippers were kidnapped in Kajuru, and their abductors are demanding more than $450,000 as ransom.\n\nNigerian authorities have been intensifying crackdowns on armed gangs and say there has been some success, including a recent airstrike that killed about 200 suspected bandits in the north.\n\nBut until insecurity is addressed, the threat will remain and people like Iliya will have a hard time educating their children.\n\n",
    "Will Obi Reinvigorate the Nigerian Labor Movement?": "Of the various elements that make the political ascendance of former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi compelling to watch, the chemistry of his relationship with the Labour Party is particularly intriguing. Perhaps due to the rise of the “Obi-dient,” the assemblage of disaffected youth whose propulsive energy has bolstered Obi’s claims as a legitimate presidential contender, the contradictions of Obi’s relationship with the party—whose ideology he notionally embodies—have received scant attention. Yet, a closer examination throws a light on both Labour and Obi’s pedigrees, as well as simmering ideological tensions between the standard bearer and his adopted party.\n\nUntil Obi’s defection to the Labour Party following his unexpected exit from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) less than three days to the latter’s presidential primary, the Labour Party was, not to put too fine a point on it, a marginal factor in the race for the Nigerian presidency. Pre-Obi, its most prominent figure had been Pat Utomi, a political economist and management expert. Like Obi, Utomi too was an exile from one of the two major political parties, having failed in his attempt to secure the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial ticket for Delta State in the 2019 general election. Utomi was instrumental in the Labour Party’s successful courtship of Obi and would eventually step down for the former PDP front runner to emerge unopposed as Labour’s presidential candidate.\n\nThe Obi-Labour Party liaison is the textbook marriage of convenience. Having quit the PDP in a huff, citing “recent developments” which made it “impossible for me to continue participating and making constructive contributions,” Obi needed a party where he and his supporters would immediately head to the front of the line. For its part, the Labour Party needed a standard bearer with national name recognition. Utomi and the party may have been in accord on the need to challenge the PDP-APC duopoly, but Utomi, although a one-time presidential aspirant and well-known political commentator, has never held political office, and his chances of becoming president were next to nil.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

Labour can feel justified in thinking that, but for the party, Obi, having lost out in the high-stakes contest within the PDP, might have wound up politically homeless. In addition to giving him a political refuge, Labour has furnished Obi with a ready-made platform from which he could launch his ambition.\n\nWhile this is more or less true, Obi will, in turn, feel that without him, the Labour Party would be nowhere today. A spin-off of the Party for Social Democracy (PSD), the Labour Party in the Nigerian Fourth Republic (1999-) has been little more than a political afterthought, a platform of convenience for aggrieved candidates from the PDP and the APC who quickly move on as soon as their immediate purpose has been served. This was certainly the case with Olusegun Mimiko, who ran successfully as governor of Ondo State under the banner of the Labour Party for a period of two terms (2009- 2017), only to return to the PDP in 2021. While defections are par for the course in Nigeria’s ideology-free politics (the PDP flag bearer Atiku Abubakar has previously run for the country’s highest office on both sides of the political divide), the point remains that the Labour Party is largely regarded as the last option for those in desperate need of a party platform.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Mimiko’s success remains the apex of the Labour Party’s overall showing in the Fourth Republic. The party currently has no elected representatives in the lower and upper legislative chambers. Amid unconfirmed rumors that Usman Zaki, its presidential candidate in the 2019 presidential election had stepped down for the APC’s Muhammadu Buhari, Labour won a meager 0.019 percent of the total votes cast.\n\nThe latter is one reason for many analysts’ continued pessimism about the party’s chances in the 2023 election, the passion of the Obi-dient for its standard bearer notwithstanding. Can a party that won less than one percent of the vote just three years ago suddenly catapult its candidate to the peak of political power? Will the fervor of the Obi-dient suffice to transform Peter Obi from a formidable third force to a realistic election winner?\n\nOther grounds for pessimism inhere within the antecedents of the labor movement, especially when viewed in the wider context of the changing (or rather declining) fortunes of Nigerian civil society. While military rule unwittingly brought out the best in the labor movement by enabling an alliance between trade unions and pro-democracy forces, the military’s malign machinations also saw to it that the labor movement was stripped of its old ardor. Few Nigerian institutions have survived the military’s wholesale attack on civil society intact; labor, together with the intelligentsia and the student union movement, came off worst. Its travails are replicated in other African countries, most poignantly in places where, at the peak of its power, the labor movement was the vanguard of social movements and a veritable laboratory of democratization.\n\nThe enervation of the Labour Party mirrors the devitalization of the labor movement in general. Short-handed and starved of resources, the party can least afford the luxury of scrutinizing the records of those who have come to it in desperation, lest it finds them morally indigestible. Ironically, Obi, and to a lesser degree Utomi, are precisely the kind of establishment figures the old labor movement would probably have distanced itself from. Not only was Obi the PDP vice presidential candidate in the 2019 presidential election (when he addressed the Nigerian Bar Association Annual General Conference last month, he could still be heard referring to Atiku as “my leader”), he, as recently as May, sought the nomination of the same party he now reflexively disavows at every turn. Reacting last month to criticism that the Labour Party lacks the structure to carry their presidential nominee to success, Obi accused both the PDP and APC of “sharing Nigeria’s patrimony to (sic) vested interests and influence peddlers.”\n\nThe discordance between Obi and the Labour Party appears most clearly in the latter’s economic program. According to its manifesto, Labour’s core principles are “humanistic, patriotic, pan-African and socialist…” Accordingly, the party shall ensure an “activist developmental role of the state in the economy by being a major player in the strategic sectors of the economy…” Will Obi, a successful businessman with a big footprint in the banking sector, endorse his party’s socialist agenda?\n\nThe question begs larger ones: what does Obi actually believe? What are his economic and political fundaments? These questions matter because, at the moment, what he is willing to sign on (beyond a vague championing of “good governance”) is anybody’s guess. His extemporaneous public speaking offers little by way of clues, and when offered the opportunity (his interview last week with CNN is a case in point), he has come across as tentative and unprepared. In this respect, he is very much like his PDP and APC counterparts.\n\nObi’s inability to check the traditional Laborite boxes may not count for much in the short term. He needs the party as much as it needs him, and both seem willing to overlook the other’s faults while the political wind remains favorable.\n\nThe tenor of their partnership is bound to change as the election draws closer and Obi is forced to show his ideological hand.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",
    "Meet the lawyers bringing foreign direct investment back to Nigeria": "Events in Nigeria this summer could hardly have inspired confidence in foreign capital source markets. In August, an announcement from Emirates, stating that the Central Bank of Nigeria had trapped $85m of the airline’s funds, signalled the realisation of investors’ greatest anxieties over the West African country’s crippling shortage of foreign exchange.\n\nInflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Nigeria have experienced a prolonged and acute descent since peaking at $8.84bn in 2011. In 2021, FDI inflows totalled just $699m. But as Nigeria’s struggle to attract FDI reaches its apogee, an oft-overlooked structural factor continues to unnerve potential investors: the law.\n\nRelated article\n\nAfrican lawyers go global\n\nThe London office of Lagos-based Olaniwun Ajayi LP (OALP), launched in December 2021, hopes to induce a significant reversal in Nigeria’s FDI woes and help build investor confidence in projects across the African continent.\n\nMaking the step up to an international practice is a significant landmark for Nigeria’s largest law firm as it strives to position itself as a key conduit for capital imports. Chuks Ibechukwu, who chairs OALP’s corporate practice in London, tells African Business that “We have an amazing task of trying to convince international investors that a Nigerian firm can provide English law services. Overcoming the limiting perceptions of the past will be a challenge, so finding the right talent and deploying a confident business model will be crucial.”\n\nFor private equity firms and venture capitalists looking to acquire African assets, accessing appropriate legal instruction which covers both cross-border and local jurisdictional regulations has historically been a convoluted process. Ibechukwu explains: “The traditional model meant that an African sponsor or business looking to attract international investment had to approach two law firms: one based in the UK or US, which provides cross-border legal services, and another one that is comfortable operating within the local jurisdiction being targeted.”\n\nIbechukwu hopes that by establishing a single point of contact for African investors under an English law regime the new office will make this system an anachronism. “For the first time”, he says, “we are able to sit down as a single team with clients going in, and have a discussion which takes into account both the English law framework of their investments and the commercial and regulatory risks that will impact their investment in Nigeria.”\n\nIt is hoped that this model will help foreign investors to structure their capital inputs and ensure that target businesses and borrowers have foreign currency liquidity. Lenders who have been wary of startups that generate naira revenue will now be able to act in the confidence that their activities will not fall foul of cross-border or jurisdictional regulations and that they will be able to realise the dollar value of their investments, he says.\n\n“Fintech and healthtech investors especially are looking not just for local support, but for guidance on how to structure their offshore investments in hubs like Mauritius and how to funnel FDI into Nigeria while remaining confident that they will be able to get their investment returns and exit the market.”\n\nRelated article\n\nCan regulators keep pace with the digital revolution?\n\nAs Nigeria’s capital-hungry startup scene looks to attract FDI and bring increased dynamism to the flailing economy, lawyers have a further role outside of coordinating cross-border investments. Recent years have yielded notable improvements in the regulation of commercial activities, but much work remains to be done on the domestic front.\n\nIn an era of rapid technological transformation, Nigeria’s traditionally turgid regulators are facing unprecedented challenges in keeping up with a changing business environment. Nosa John Garrick, managing partner at Lagos-based F.A. Garrick & Co., tells African Business that lawyers play an indispensable role in modernising the regulatory domain.\n\n“By continuing to engage in conversation with regulators and identifying loopholes in existing regulations, lawyers can advise the government on how to make changes where necessary. This gives the regulators a sense of direction as to what is necessary in the business space. We interact more with the people that the regulations affect, and are able to leverage this to create a more inclusive business environment. This will help attract foreign direct investment by making it easier to establish companies in Nigeria and propel the economy forward.”\n\nOpen consultation with regulatory stakeholders has been a key feature of Nigeria’s ongoing commercial transformation, which has gathered pace under the auspices of the federal government as Muhammadu Buhari’s second and final term as president approaches its conclusion. Garrick recounts that town hall meetings, where regulators call for advice from stakeholders including commercial lawyers, played an instrumental role in the development of the 2020 Companies and Allied Matters Act.\n\nAs a result, Nigeria’s biggest commercial law shakeup in three decades bears all the hallmarks of thorough public consultation: much-needed provisions for single membership companies, a simplified registration process and consistent auditing procedures have injected life into the country’s startup ecosystem.\n\nRelated article\n\nEnergy sector will be crucial\n\nIbechukwu and Garrick concur that the energy sector must be a focus for Nigeria’s federal government as startups look to modernise both renewable power sources and service delivery across the industry.\n\nThe government has long recognised the value of its domestic energy sector as a driver of economic growth but has historically failed to provide effective leadership to the industry. Power generators and distributors have long suffered from the effects of poor policy enforcement, regulatory uncertainty, a fluctuating gas supply, transmission constraints and oversights in centralised planning which have held back the establishment of commercial viability.\n\nDistribution is the sector’s greatest weakness: Nigeria has extensive reserves of oil and gas, and a national grid capable of generating 12,522 MW, but on most days can only deliver around 4,000 MW to its population of over 200m people. Eighty-six percent of connections are in urban areas and 40% of the population lives off-grid. This is the state of play more than a decade after the inauguration of the federal government’s Renewable Energy Master Plan, designed to fill in gaps in rural electrification by encouraging solar, wind and hydroelectric projects.\n\nRelated article\n\nBut where there are shortfalls, there are opportunities for startups. Ibechukwu points to the high proportion of domestic stakeholders in the energy sector as a cause for optimism: “The oil and gas sector is much more robust in terms of local participation than other sectors. In Nigeria, content regulations have meant that a significant local capacity has been developed over many years in terms of service delivery in that industry.”\n\nGarrick, who works with startups delivering power to rural areas, says that private service deliverers can access profits and scalability, so long as they can navigate a convoluted patchwork of generation, distribution and trading licences at the state and federal levels. Directing sales away from cities and towards rural areas with deficient transmission infrastructure will be a “major issue”, with operators wary of becoming entangled in the regulatory net.\n\nSo long as they can navigate regulations, operators offering renewable solutions will not struggle to attract financing. In the runup to Cop27, Nigeria is looking to attract $10bn foreign investment to kickstart progress towards its target of reaching net zero by 2060. Ibechukwu, who headed up the International Finance Corporation’s advisory unit for private equity in Africa before joining Olaniwun Ajayi, is optimistic that investors will heed the call.\n\n“At the World Bank, I saw a lot more investment being directed towards climate projects including renewable or offgrid solutions to electrification as large investors look to satisfy their own net zero objectives.”",

    "Gunmen kill 14 villagers in northcentral Nigeria": "Nigerian authorities say gunmen have killed 14 people in attacks targeting two communities in the country's northern region\n\nABUJA, Nigeria -- Gunmen attacked two communities in Nigeria’s north-central region, killing 14 people and injuring many others, authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe attackers stormed the communities in Logo council area of Benue state Wednesday night, opening “unprovoked” fire on residents, said Paul Hemba, the state's top security official.\n\nPolice in Benue confirmed the attack. The assailants shot 12 people to death in one community then moved on to another where they killed two more villagers, Hemba said. He said 15 people were “seriously injured.”\n\nHe identified the attackers as “Fulani herdsmen,” a group of mostly young pastoralists from the Fulani tribe caught up in Nigeria’s conflict between host communities and herdsmen over limited access to water and land.\n\nIn Nigeria’s middle belt and central regions, deadly clashes between local communities and herdsmen continue in a cycle of violence that has defied government measures, although security forces have recently announced some arrests and seizure of arms.\n\nA similar attack in another part of Benue targeted a convoy of soldiers of the Nigerian army, but they were able to repel the assailants, Hemba said.\n\nMany of the attacks in rural areas are similar. Motorcycle-riding gunmen often arrive in the hundreds in areas where Nigeria’s security forces are outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nAuthorities have in the past admitted that the inadequate number of security personnel in many of the affected areas is one of the major reasons the attacks have continued.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who came into office in 2015 on a wave of goodwill after promising to end the nation's protracted security crisis, leaves office in 2023. Those security challenges are back on the front burner as political campaigns for next year's election begin.",
    "Post-2023: Setting agenda for rethinking Nigeria’s dysfunctional federalism": "There is no doubt on the minds of discerning Nigerians, including the political class, that what is needed to empower the protracted Nigerian national project is the urgent need to reset Nigeria’s federalism through a crucial restructuring. This is exactly why the outcry concerning restructuring and the issue of Nigeria’s anomalous federal system has been on the agenda of public discourse for so long, from Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the numerous national constitutional conferences, to the #EndSARS protests.\n\nThere is no way we all would not agree that every legitimate attempt, since 1960, to get Nigeria functioning for the well-being of Nigerians has been frustrated thoroughly by the dysfunctional constitution that foist a unitary logic on federal realities. And so, we have been struggling with the possibility of unity in diversity since we attained independence. And what is more, it is within the vicious cycle of opportunistic politicking that keeps constraining transition from election to governance and to performance, that elite nationalism has broken down from achieving transformational leadership to a mere satisfaction of selfish interests through primitive accumulation.\n\nAnd so, as is to be expected, in the pre-2023 electoral moment we all are in now, the process of leadership recruitment has become one of endemic bitterness and anxiety for Nigerians. In most of my previous public commentaries, I have warned about the three possible options or scenarios available to the Nigerian political class. Within the first scenario, we can continue with our do-nothing, ostrich attitude with its non-value-added logic until the entire world leaves Nigeria behind in the blighted space of underdevelopment. In the second possible scenario, we might equally allow the downward degeneration of the polity in ways that might eventually combust into a similar situation that characterize the former USSR, Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia. The last scenario calls on the political elite to proactively act to restructure Nigeria’s profligate political space into, say, manageable regional economic corridors that generate a competitive but mutually reinforcing fiscal federalism.\n\nIn this piece, I will be exploring preliminary constitutional issues that could serve as think pieces for reflections on what is involved in really restructuring the Nigerian state. The 2014 National Conference, inaugurated by President Goodluck Jonathan, remains one of the most recent attempts at understanding and engaging with Nigeria’s convoluted national trajectories. And the relevance of that Confab is reiterated most recently by the publication of a new book, The National Conversation: Interests and Intrigues that Shaped the 2014 National Conference, written by Akpandem James and Sam Akpe.\n\nThe authors were both media advisers to the Conference. Their reprise of the events and issues that agitated the Conference will enable me highlight some of those complex and contradictory elements of Nigeria’s national question that should constitute the essence of our collective interrogation and discursive attention as we approach 2023 and beyond. These issues, it would seem, ought to be at the core of the present discussion around possible leaders that will mount the pedestals of responsibility across the country.\n\nCurrently, there is a level of listlessness and confusion within the polity that is not helping to focus the fundaments of what we need to be discussing. This is even more critical once we note that these critical constitutional issues are not as straightforward as we would want them to be. This is one of the sobering takeaways from the book I am headlining in this piece. The authors are convinced that achieving national consensus through the critical issues at stakes will be a daunting matter. And this is why so many past leaders have kept shying away from these core matters.\n\nAny potential leader of the Nigerian state, I think, must have thoughts and strategies on these issues so as not to be confounded nor overwhelmed. The first fundamental point of constitutional worry is: How is the new Nigerian federation to be envisioned? Should the boundary be redrawn to reflect the 1967 twelve-state structure created by Gen. Gowon, or the recent six geo-political zones? Or should we even revert further back to the original regional arrangement Nigeria adopted at independence?\n\nIndeed, that regionalism has been at the core of the agitation by the southwest for rethinking Nigeria’s federalism. But then the matter becomes complicated once we relate it to the thorny issue of resource control and revenue sharing that have made the relationship between the center and the federating states very acrimonious. How should resources generated in a specific part of the federation be perceived and shared? Is the resource owned by the federating unit or the center? Does land belong to the Nigerian state or to its parts?\n\nThis is what led to the establishment of the Executive, Concurrent and Residual lists in the Constitutions. But then we are all aware of the inherent dis-enablement created by these lists. Take a most fundamental issue, item 39 on the Executive list—mineral and natural resources: oil fields, minerals, natural gas and mining.\n\nCan policy decisions be made that will restructure the constitution in ways that transfer items on the executive list to either the concurrent or the residual list so that ownership and exploitation of the resources can be placed in the hands of the sub-nationals in whose spaces they are found; like oil being owned by the south-south? This would imply reflecting on and rethinking the constitutional arrangement, like section 143(2) of the 1960 Constitution and section 140(1) of the 1963 Constitution which provided for regional control of minerals, and insist that 50% royalty be paid to regions from where any minerals is extracted. Such reflection will demand that we conceptually differentiate between derivation, resource control and the onshore-off-shore dichotomy in revenue sharing.\n\nWe are thus faced, still following the logic of the federal argument, with the point of whether local governments should be stripped off their status as the third tier of government. Even within the current constitutional arrangement that places almost all significant items that conduces to development on the exclusive list, the developmental and democratic imperatives inherent in the local governments have already been undermined. The residual list has become a mere constitutional ornament.\n\nOne of the possible implications of this idea is that the states will then be left to become creative with their need for local governments, within the available models of grassroots development they might want to operate with. This already implies that the joint state-local government account should be scrapped and be replaced by the state’s version of the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission, with representations from the various local governments.\n\nThis assessment leads to the constitutional assessment of state independent electoral commissions, in relation to their capacity to credibly conduct elections into local government.\n\nWhat models should determine the constitutional structure that should be in place for the conduct of elections?\n\nAnother derivative of the constitutional anomaly that troubles Nigeria’s federal dynamics is the idea of state police. The significance of this issue is corroborated by the current state of (in)security in the Nigerian political space. Kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and all sundry security matters have transformed the Nigerian state into a state of nature. What makes the situation even more dire is the fact that, on the one hand, the Federal Government has no will to firmly and strategically deal decisively with the incidence. And on the other hand, the constitution effectively disempowered the state governors within whose space the insecurity manifests.\n\nIt is then a surprise that we still draw back from a constitutional review of this anomaly. Should the law enforcement apparatus be centralized when the reality on ground dictates a different approach? Should the possibility of the governors abusing the power conferred by their position as the chief security officers of their state be sufficient to detract from the inherent urgency of enabling the governors to protect the Nigerians within their state boundaries? The same federal impulse demands that we reflect on the constitutional need to create a multiple locus for the efficient functioning of the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation.\n\nIn other words, one dimension of that office will be set in charge of managing the account of the Federal Government, while other dimensions of the office will be put in charge of disbursement from the federation accounts, as well as the efficient administration of funds prescribed by the Constitution. In terms of fiscal consciousness, how should we begin to reconstitute the Sovereign Wealth Fund in ways that will make it a reservoir for managing Nigeria’s development needs during raining days?\n\nThe same constitutional logic demands that we also look at the nature of the National Planning Commission, and how its function could be made more efficient if decentralised. We also must not fail, at this moment when 2023 is becoming a moment of make-or-mar, to start serious reflection on the nature of Nigeria’s presidentialism and its propensity to generate waste and redundancies.\n\nConsidered as one of the most wasteful in the world, this presidential system and its cost of governance requires consistent effort to rehabilitate through institutional redesign and innovative restructuration informed by local political culture.\n\n2023, the way I see it, should not only be seen in terms of political succession. It is a year that should determine Nigeria’s readiness to jumpstart its greatness through the election of credible leaders willing to take the bull of development and restructuring by the horn. 2023 should be Nigeria’s year of redemption, and a trajectory into the future.\n\nOlaopa is a retired Federal Permanent Secretary and Professor, National Institute For Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, Jos. tolaopa2003@gmail.com\n\n",
    "Nigeria must own vessels to become producer of maritime services – Ihenacho": "By Steve Agbota\n\nChairman Integrated Oil and Gas Ltd., retired Capt., Emmanuel Ihenacho, has said that Nigeria needs to become a producer of maritime services rather than remain a consumer.\n\nIhenacho states this at the Maritime and Offshore Award (The OMIS) held in commemoration of the 2022 World Maritime Day in Lagos, said that if Nigeria don’t have its own vessels, then outsiders can come in and say that the much they know about Nigerian trade is piracy and this opens Nigeria as a nation to exploitation.\n\n“We should look at measures to ensure that all of the things we are missing are in place, and this will help us become producers rather than consumers of maritime services,” he said.\n\nIhenacho, who received the OMIS Lifetime Achievement award added that Nigeria could not continue to be a nation that consumed services produced elsewhere.\n\nHe said the country had able bodied people, intellectuals and other resources to buy infrastructure for producing oil and shipping services.\n\n“We should have people at the policy level that should be thinking about these strategies and tell us how to go about it, marshal all these resources so that we will equalise the consumption with production.\n\n“On the consumption side, yes we are using maritime services to the fullest but we should be able to add value to economy output by being able to produce maritime services,” he said.\n\nAlso, Dr Ify Akerele, former Director General, Nigerian Chamber of Shipping, said the Nigerian maritime sector was not where it should be but was making progress.\n\n“Awareness is getting out and that is why we are here today. This is a high class selective award, separating the boys from the men, the chaff from the wheat.\n\n“I am one of the judges and I saw the criteria, it was tough. A lot of people pride themselves as maritime operators but they really don’t meet the criteria.\n\nBut looking at the nominees, I will tell you that we have come a long way,” she said.\n\nAccording to Akerele, indigenisation of the sector was of essence, and required patriotism as well as professional.\n\nShe said the country had professionals but that most of them worked abroad, hence there was need to open up the shores so that they could come back.\n\nEarlier, Mr Femi Da-Silva, Coordinator of OMIS, said all winners deserved their awards as the most qualified entries were picked based on set criteria.\n\nOther winners are the Niger Benue Transport Company Ltd. who received the OMIS logistics/transport provider of the year, while CMA CGM received that of the shipping company of the year.",
    "Nigeria is banning foreign actors and models from its ads as of Oct. 1": "Nigeria is banning foreign actors and models from its ads as of Oct. 1\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nBeginning next month, advertising in Nigeria may have a different look and sound - at least that's what regulators hope. In what is believed to be the first-of-its-kind regulation, Nigeria is planning to ban the use of foreign models and voiceover artists in advertising, as of October 1. In a tweet, the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria, which created the ban, said it is aimed at developing the country's talent pool in the advertising industry and to make its growth more inclusive. We wanted to hear more about what this law would mean for talent and booking agents and how people in Nigeria are responding, so we've called Tolulope Kolade. He is an award-winning voiceover artist, podcaster and all-around broadcasting talent. He's known professionally as Tcode, and he is with us now. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nTOLULOPE KOLADE: Oh, yeah. Thank you very much for having me here. It's an honor to be here.\n\nMARTIN: Well, thanks for that. Help us get a little perspective on advertising in Nigeria. It's Africa's largest economy. There's a population of over 200 million people. I think people - a lot of people are familiar with Nigeria's, you know, enormous film industry, which is called, you know, Nollywood, sometimes, you know, colloquially.\n\nKOLADE: Yeah. Nollywood, yeah.\n\nMARTIN: And I understand that, because I've seen you interviewed on this, that you make a living as a voiceover artist.\n\nKOLADE: Yes.\n\nMARTIN: So tell me - give me just some sense of it.\n\nKOLADE: All right. So the advertising industry is broad, not just for the voice actors. It actually also has the models involved, the video editors. And, you know, many creatives feed off from the advertising industry in Nigeria. But - and it's a very big one because the entertainment space is really booming in Nigeria. Attention is coming to the country. Local companies and even international companies are finding that spotlight right now. If you look at the music scene, Afrobeats is the main thing right now. There is a lot of activities going on in the advertising space and, of course, it's one of the reasons why we're having a kind of response or reaction that we just witnessed from ARCON, which is the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria. Now, that council, that regulatory body, used to be called APCON. But regardless of the name, what they're supposed to do is to regulate the advertising industry in Nigeria to ensure that the proper adverts are used and to monitor the kind of adverts that are used - on radio, on TV, on broadcast platforms - and ensure that these follows the guidelines.\n\nMARTIN: OK. So tell me, what's your reaction to the decision?\n\nKOLADE: You know, personally, when I saw it at first, I thought it was a good - a very good, brilliant decision because - as it was written that - to promote local talent, which, of course, is something that everybody would applaud. However, having spoken for - with a couple of talents here in Nigeria, there are certain fears amongst voice actors. The fact that if this - as it has been done - I mean, the policy means that foreign voice actors and models cannot be used for commercials and adverts in Nigeria. What will be the consequence, or would we see a ripple effect in terms of the international markets, the international bodies, advertising bodies, deciding to do the same?\n\nMARTIN: But I don't know - what problem is this meant to solve? Do you know? Is there one? Because one of the reasons we called you is that, No. 1, you are an award-winning voiceover artist. In fact, as I understand it, you won a competition - a Nigerian competition, the Nigeria voice acting contest. And you are a - I don't know - I would say, kind of a mentor in your field, in the sense of encouraging other people to earn a living and telling people that it is possible to earn a living from voice work in Nigeria now. So, I mean, obviously, you're at the top of your game, but what problem are they trying to solve here?\n\nKOLADE: The base of this problem is the fact that a couple of advertisers tend to believe that the Western elements, in terms of accents or models that look, you know, Western - I'm talking about their hair or their looks, their skin color - those are things that drive target audience to buy. Now, to an extent, they may be right. But, I mean, of course, we still have that mentality, even as Black people, when we see the foreigners or the Westerners that - you know, they present to us the idea of quality. And that ideology is why some advertisers are stuck to that model. So you hear voiceovers from - that is meant for the Nigerian market, and you hear them in an American accent.\n\nMARTIN: Is this about race and color as much as it is about accent? I mean, is this intended to sort of suggest that white people are getting advertising jobs that many people would prefer go to people who are of color? Because I actually have to say, there are white Nigerians, are there not? I mean, there are white Nigerians, and as you pointed out, Nigeria is a multilingual, multiracial, multi-religious country. So, I mean - OK, I'm pushing you here, but what's the real issue here? Is it a perception that there is a colonial - let me just be plain - is that there's a colonial mindset that says white people are preferred as the face of the country - as the face of the country's projects? Is that really the perception here or is it something else?\n\nKOLADE: I know as a Nigerian, having lived in Nigeria all of my life, that we grew up seeing white people as the special people. And so when you see a white person around, there's a way you tend to want to treat a white person. And, you know, we grew up exposed to a lot of foreign content, especially animation, for instance. So our own idea of what an animation should sound like is heavily influenced by the white. That mentality is why, to a very large extent, people accept when it is coming from the white man. However, in the past one decade, from what I have observed as well, we have begun to celebrate and accept our own. Now, if we say we're banning the white guys from \"taking our jobs,\" in quote, then we need to develop ourselves so much so that the local advertisers can confidently - and not by force, but by choice - decide that, oh, we will use this local talent because they're good enough. Why going outside the country?\n\nMARTIN: But Nigeria is banning actors from taking these roles in a way that no other country is doing. That is the question. There is no regulatory body in the United States saying that Nigerians cannot play American roles.\n\nKOLADE: Personally, I feel like, even though they have the best interest of the local talents in mind, there are better ways to get around it. Because at the end of the day, we are global talents, so we shouldn't limit how far we can go. So I'm not totally in an alliance with the fact that we are cutting off foreign talents, no. But I - personally, I am of the opinion that we, the local talents, we best express the realities of our locality. So if you're bringing an advert to Nigeria, the way I will express it as a local Nigerian talent would be more relatable to the common man on the streets than when I bring a white man. Because our realities and our experiences in life are different. In the place of who is best to play that role, we can consider the fact that the experiences and the person is closer to this locality. The person has that experience. But to cut off the international community entirely is not something that I totally support.\n\nMARTIN: Before we let you go - is this too corny? - but can I just have a little bit of the - what? - how you won or why you won the Nigerian voice acting contest, if you remember what some of the - I just want a little bit of the flavor of...\n\nKOLADE: OK.\n\nMARTIN: ...How you won the top prize. May I have - what year was that, by the way?\n\nKOLADE: That was last year, 2021.\n\nMARTIN: 2021.\n\nKOLADE: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: Is there any way you could kind of give us a little bit of that award-winning flavor?\n\nKOLADE: Talk is cheap, but your voice can be expensive. You know, so...\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter) I love it. I love it.\n\nKOLADE: (Laughter) Yeah, voiceover is - yeah...\n\nMARTIN: I love it. Tolulope Kolade is the founder of Coded Voiceovers. He's known professionally as Tcode, and as you might imagine, he's a voiceover artist, actor and a broadcast personality. Tolulope, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nKOLADE: You're welcome. Thank you so much for having me. This was a pleasure talking about voiceovers with you, and I hope to, you know, sometime again, we do this.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Opinion: 'The Woman King' speaks loud and clear to this Nigerian feminist": "Opinion: 'The Woman King' speaks loud and clear to this Nigerian feminist\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ilze Kitshoff/Sony Pictures Ilze Kitshoff/Sony Pictures\n\nAs a Nigerian feminist, I have always been curious about how feminism has evolved in my country and culture. So naturally, I was curious to see The Woman King, the new movie about an all-female troop of warriors in a 19th-century West African kingdom.\n\nWould this movie, starring the amazing Viola Davis as General Nanisca, speak to the issues faced by West African women like me? What challenges did they face and how do these relate to today's world?\n\nI'm not surprised by what I saw. But I am sad to report that the inequalities faced by the women in the movie do indeed reflect the struggles that women today face in many parts of the world, including West Africa.\n\nThe Woman King tells the story of the Agojie, an all-female troop of warriors of the real-life West African Dahomey kingdom, today's Republic of Benin. \"Agojie\" was another name for the Dahomey Amazons, known for their bravery.\n\nBy exploring the lives of these bold women, the film illustrates how the lack of equal rights for women is a problem that has lasted for centuries. While I was deeply inspired to see an all-female army led by a strong woman, I was also dismayed by the inequalities that these soldiers had to suffer. Unlike their male counterparts, the Agojie women were not allowed to marry or become parents as in theory they belonged to the king.\n\nEven today, women around the world often have to choose between a fast-paced progressive career or slowing down to start a family. I hope that the movie inspires more people to recognize the strength of women and create opportunities that allow them to build their career while growing a family — or frankly to embrace any choice they prefer to make. And to be honored for charting their own path.\n\nIn one scene, a male member of the king's cabinet expresses his anger at Viola Davis' character for getting the king's attention and influencing his decision to go to war with the opposing Oyo Empire. She says, \"If the king respects me, it is because I have earned it.\" More women need to get the respect they have earned.\n\nNawi, a character played by Thuso Mbedu, is equally inspiring. She reminds me of comments made by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie in her famous TEDx talk \"We should all be feminists.\" In her speech, Adichie sums up the way the world treats women: \"We say to them [girls] you can have ambition but not too much otherwise you will threaten the man.\" Nawi was happy to threaten men.\n\nNawi is a strong-willed and intelligent character, refusing to buckle down to the pressure of being married off early. In one scene, she dares to speak back to an old man who wants to marry her. He hits her – and then she fights back, shoving this prospective husband.\n\nHer father sees her as a threat to potential suitors and gives her out to serve the king.\n\nNawi is presented with the choice of joining the Agojie and remaining celibate or serving the palace in other ways. She chooses the path of becoming an Agojie and proved to be one of its best soldiers.\n\nShe breaks free of the gendered shackles that society at large places upon women – young and old.\n\nLike Nawi, strong-willed women today are often taunted. They're told their feistiness will make them unattractive to \"real men.\" Personally, I have been told by male acquaintances that buying a car or getting a doctorate while unmarried will make me less attractive to men.\n\nThere is a deep-seated struggle to not be the \"angry black woman\" for many of us who fight back against what is wrong. The movie feels like a much-needed reminder to never stop speaking about the inequalities that women face. If we do not continue to speak up about the challenges we face every day, society will never be fair to women. As Nawi states when she was confronted for standing up to the Viola Davis's mighty General Nanisca, \"If I do not speak up, she will not see me.\"\n\nAnother inspiration in this movie comes from King Ghezo, the role played by John Boyega. Although young and inexperienced, King Ghezo leads with humility. He listens to General Nanisca's advice — leading to some jealousy among male members of his cabinet.\n\nThat doesn't bother him. In fact, his cabinet includes other women in addition to General Nanisca. He did not engage in tokenism.\n\nI endorse his openness. I believe very strongly that women must have a seat at the table whether to discuss politics and governance or health and development issues such as what I do as a policy and partnerships manager in a global health institution.\n\nThis kind of representation does not mean that only one or two women are selected for a conference as we typically see today but a deliberate attempt to hear from women. Whether in traditional settings or workplaces, more women are desperately needed as leaders and as advisers. I have only to look to my own country to see the bias we face: In Nigeria's history, no woman has ever been appointed to head any of the three military branches.\n\nI am glad that more stories are being told about West Africa for global audiences. I left the theater deeply reflective of the challenges faced by Africans during the colonial days but also deeply inspired by the role of female armies like the Agojie. The next time someone says to me that being a feminist is a \"new generation thing,\" I will tell them the story of the Agojie, our female warriors from the 19th century.\n\nOyeronke Oyebanji is a Nigerian public health professional and senior fellow at the Aspen Institute.

    "Nigerians too hungry to bother about their religious faiths in 2023 election – Keyamo": "A spokesperson of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, says Nigerians are too hungry to be swayed by their religious faiths in the choice they will make in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nMr Keyamo stated this during an interview with Channels Television on Sunday night, against the backdrop of the criticisms that have continued to trail the party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe ruling APC is fielding Bola Tinubu, a South-west Muslim and Kashim Shettima, a North-east Muslim, as its presidential and vice presidential candidates in the February election.\n\nDespite the kicks from groups, organisations and persons of Christian faith, the ruling party has not backed down on promoting the ticket, insisting that it is the best for Nigerians.\n\nIn reiterating this position, Mr Keyamo, argued that Nigerians would like to see policies that will address their hunger rather than bothering about their faiths.\n\n“Nigerians are hungry, they want to see how that hunger will be addressed, not how their Christian or Muslim faiths will be addressed.\n\n“They want to see our policies on agriculture and what Asiwaju has done before as governor of Lagos State, how he improved Lagos and how he will bring that kind of posterity to Nigeria as a whole,” he said.\n\nMr Keyamo also seized the opportunity to react to the condemnation of Tinubu/Shettima ticket by the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN).\n\nThe Christian group said it has no affiliation with clergymen under its umbrella that met with Mr Tinubu in Abuja on Friday. They also rejected the same faith ticket of the party.\n\nThe APC campaign spokesperson criticised the PFN for its comments on the decisions of his party.\n\n“They should not be coming to question the decision of our party publicly. The purpose of pastors or their duty is to lead people to heaven not to lead people to villa.\n\n“If I go to church every Sunday, I want to hear the sermon of God and I don’t want to hear the sermon of politics or who should rule me. I want to hear the sermon of God and what will lead me to salvation and not what to lead me to the villa,” Mr Keyamo argued.\n\nWhile President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has continued to face strong criticisms from some individuals and groups for poor performance, the 2023 APC presidential candidate, Mr Tinubu, has promised to build on the incumbent’s legacy.\n\nThe same ruling party rode into power in 2015 by promising to effectively tackle insecurity, infrastructural decay and economic downturns but the reality differs.\n\nAs political parties gear towards the official commencement of campaign on 28 September, similar promises are already rolling not only from the APC candidates but also from candidates contesting under the other 17 political parties.",
    "Nigeria's public debt rises to $103 billion in second quarter": "Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nABUJA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Nigeria's total public debt rose 3% to $103.3 billion in the second quarter of this year, largely driven by local borrowing to finance the budget deficit, the Debt Management Office (DMO)said.\n\nNigeria's deficit has grown this year due to the high cost of a fuel subsidy at a time when oil revenue has fallen due to crude theft and vandalism of pipelines.\n\nThe DMO said in its latest data, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, that public debt increased from $100.07 billion as of March this year to $103.3 billion by the end of June.\n\nAlthough the debt constitutes 23% of the country's gross domestic product - within the government's self-imposed limit of 40% - Nigeria's debt repayment costs are rising while revenues are shrinking.\n\nBetween January and April, Nigeria spent more money to service its debt than it raised as revenue.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Camillus Eboh Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe Editing by Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Hardship may fuel protests in Nigeria, others –Report": "Social unrest in Nigeria and other African countries over challenging socio-economic conditions is likely to intensify in the year ahead, a new report has said.\n\nThe report, documented by a consultancy group – ControlRisks for Oxford Economics Africa – is titled, “Africa Risk Reward Index 2022.”\n\nIt said incumbent governments and political elites should be wary of these cost-of-living protests and closely monitoring public sentiment.\n\nAccording to the report, security forces had so far prevented unrest from escalating. Nonetheless, further unrest was likely in the year ahead, as socio-economic conditions would remain challenging.\n\nIt read in part, “The latest surge in dissatisfaction has highlighted the inefficiencies in government and stark inequalities across many African countries. In recent years, people across the continent have mobilised in large numbers on various issues in sometimes unexpected ways.”\n\nThe report further noted that despite having debt ratios much lower than other African peers, Nigerian debt borrowing costs were expected to absorb around one-thirds of fiscal revenue this year.\n\nIt said that given the proportion of revenue directed towards borrowing costs, and considering how much the government spent on public sector salaries and wages, there was very little scope to redirect spending in order to provide additional economic support without accruing additional debt.\n\nGlobal risk aversion would make it harder for African countries to gain access to the affordable debt necessary going forward, the report noted.\n\nIt further said that this might accelerate fiscal consolidation efforts, implying that short-term fiscal support measures implemented to cushion the impact of the war could be cut short, which would further exacerbate the growing civil discontent that had emerged across much of the continent.\n\n“Faster fiscal consolidation might mean that governments will have to rein in their public investment initiatives and therefore dash their economic growth projections.”\n\nPerhaps an even less favourable outcome would be that governments are unphased by rising borrowing costs and continue down an unsustainable fiscal path, which would require much deeper and more painful consolidation in a few years’ time,” the report further read.\n\nThis year, large-scale protests have already been reported in Guinea, Uganda, Malawi and Sierra Leone between June and August.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, massive protests have occured in recent months due to economic hardship, a development which forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign and flee the country after a mob broke into his residence in the capital.",
