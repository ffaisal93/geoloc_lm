    "When asked about China, Australians tend to think of its government, not its people": "Official relations between Australia and China have been strained in recent years. The two countries have been involved in a trade dispute since 2020, when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and China responded by imposing new tariffs. The worsening relationship has also been evident in public opinion surveys: Australia saw the sharpest increase in negative views of China of any country surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2020, and those negative views remain widespread in Australia today.\n\nTo better understand how Australians think about China, the Center asked Australians in a 2021 survey to describe – in their own words – the first thing that comes to mind when they think of China. Researchers then analyzed the 1,127 responses with a focus on the first five topics that Australians mentioned.\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to get a better sense of Australians’ attitudes about China at a time of tension between the two countries. The analysis examines responses from Australians who were asked to describe, in their own words, the first things that come to mind when they think about China. To do this, we surveyed 1,127 Australians from March 15 to 29, 2021, and coded their responses. We coded the first five mentions in each open-ended response using a researcher-developed codebook. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAustralian adults most frequently mentioned the political system when thinking about China (29%). Some specifically critiqued the government. For example, one Australian man said, “Chinese leadership is a threat to the rest of the world.”\n\nOther Australians listed government actions, such as one woman who referenced “punishment for those who speak out about the government.” Some comments about the government were more neutral, such as “Different forms of government need to be respected.”\n\nA public focus on China’s government – rather than its people – is consistent with other recent Pew Research Center findings about China, including in the United States. The Center has also found a similar pattern in survey respondents’ views of countries other than China: Americans, for example, are more likely to have a negative view of Israel’s government than its people.\n\nIn Australia, the share of respondents who brought up China’s political system in their open-ended responses included 15% who described how political power was distributed across or exercised in the country. Many simply used labels such as “undemocratic,” “authoritarian” and “oppressive.” One Australian man called it a “totalitarian one-party state.” An Australian woman described a “strongly focused government that will seek conformity from citizens.” Another 9% of respondents specifically pointed to communism or the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which is set to convene its National Party Congress in October, when President Xi Jinping is expected to assume a third term.\n\nA country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you. Australian woman\n\nIn other responses to the Center’s survey, nearly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%) mentioned some perceived threat that China poses to the world, their region, Australia or China’s own people. Most responses in this category focused on China’s general quest to be the most powerful country (7%) or its perceived poor international conduct (7%), including mentions of manipulation and bullying on the world stage. One Australian woman said she thought of China as “a country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you.”\n\nThreats were more commonly top of mind for Australians ages 60 and older, as well as those who support Australia’s governing party – which, at the time of the survey, was the Liberal-National coalition, led by former Prime Minister Scott Morrison. (The current prime minister is Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party.)\n\nFor some Australians, China poses an economic or military threat (referenced by 4% each). Perceived economic threats included “working their way into different countries by lending,” using “trade sanctions to try and force their way or take revenge,” or simply “economic manipulation.” Mentions of China’s military included phrases such as “military strength,” “a military threat” or “military expansion.”\n\nFor roughly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%), human rights abuses were one of the first things to come to mind when thinking of China, and 11% specifically mentioned lack of freedoms in the form of government repression and censorship. One man described the country as “a powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition.” Words like “conformity” and “thought control” also came up, as well as mentions of restricted freedom of expression for Chinese citizens.\n\nA powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition. Australian man\n\nThe share of Australians who mentioned human rights included 4% who mentioned the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghur people, an ethnic minority group in the Xinjiang region of northwest China. Some explicitly used the word “genocide,” and others referenced “concentration” or “re-education” camps. One Australian woman said, “I have grave concerns about the Uyghurs and the way they are being rounded up and put into the so-called re-education centers. It seems as if there is another holocaust happening with these people.”\n\nRoughly a fifth of Australian adults who offered an answer (18%) brought up the economy when thinking about China, including 4% who described the current state or growth of its economy. An Australian man referred to China as an “economic powerhouse that managed to bring a billion people out of poverty in a few decades with cheap labor.” Others focused on China’s manufacturing prowess (3%), including an Australian woman who called China “the world’s factory.” An equal share of Australians (3%) mentioned trade, including China’s tariffs on some Australian goods. Fewer mentioned topics such as cheap or poorly manufactured products, or China’s status as an economic powerhouse.\n\nAbout one-in-ten Australians who provided an answer (8%) mentioned the size of China’s population in their responses. For example, one woman said, “Big population,” and another referenced “population overflow.”\n\nA similar share of Australian respondents (7%) offered generally positive evaluations of China. Some of these respondents identified things associated with China, such as one woman who wrote, “pandas, the wall of China, dumplings.” Others mentioned China’s culture and history, including another woman who mentioned China’s “rich artistic, economic, trading and scientific history.” Positive responses were more common among Australians ages 18 to 29 than those 60 and older. When it comes to overall favorability of China, younger Australians also have more favorable views of China than older ones.\n\nAustralia called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020, and a small share of Australians who volunteered an answer mentioned COVID-19 in their answers (6%). This included references to the origins of the coronavirus with mentions of “wet markets” and “Wuhan,” as well as references to China’s response to COVID-19. Others said they held China responsible for the pandemic due to insufficient containment efforts or alleged that the Chinese government engaged in a cover-up to conceal the country’s role in the spread of the virus. One woman said, “The first thing that comes to mind is selfish! If they had come forward when they were first aware of the risks of the virus and shut their borders to contain it, the world would not be suffering the way it is now.”\n\nThe people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry. Australian woman\n\nAnother 6% of Australians who offered their views about China brought up the Chinese people. One woman said, “The people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry.” Another woman said, “[I] have worked with some lovely Chinese people but have concerns about the attitude of the country’s ruling party towards other countries and their policies.”\n\nSome specifically referenced Chinese nationals abroad – especially those living in Australia – and a perception that they failed to assimilate to local culture. Others spoke to the long-standing history of people of Chinese origins living in Australia, such as one woman who said, “[There are] many Chinese living in Australia and have been for a long time and are part of our history. White Australia has often been racist towards Chinese.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government received largely negative evaluations in Australians’ responses, only 1% of responses expressed negative views of the Chinese people (compared with the 4% of responses that described the people of China in a positive light). Negative responses included words such as “selfish” and “unsympathetic.” In contrast, positive sentiments mentioned traits such as “hard-working,” “ingenious” and “family oriented.”\n\nA small share of Australian respondents (3%) brought up China’s environmental impact. One woman said she’s “been to China on business & for personal reasons. I’ve been north, south, east and a reasonable way west. I’ve never seen the horizon, because of the ever-present pollution.”\n\nAnother 3% of respondents spoke about China as a general or political world power. These included an Australian woman who called China a “world power with serious potential.”\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nTopic China Global Image",
    "To Save Its Renowned Nature, Australia Invests More in Indigenous Management": "Australia is a continent that faces unique pressures, particularly from introduced species and catastrophic wildfires exacerbated by rapidly changing climate. Indigenous Australians have lived throughout the continent for millennia and know best how to manage many of those pressures. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have developed an intimate understanding of their homelands’ nature and seasons, including the role that fire has in the natural world’s regeneration and preservation.\n\nIn recent decades, the Australian Government has been moving toward recognising the knowledge and leadership Indigenous Australians have shown in protecting more of their lands through the highly successful Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) program. Under the program, which started in 1998, the country has designated 81 IPAs covering more than 85 million hectares of land and 4 million hectares of sea country.\n\nBut with more than 20% of Australia held, in some form, by Indigenous peoples, more IPAs are needed. These land and sea areas include some of Australia’s most exceptional natural environments, rich with native plants and animals—including many threatened species—that require ongoing care to survive. These areas are also home to some of the oldest artistic and cultural sites in the world.\n\nFortunately, the Australian Government recently announced new funding commitments for IPAs and for the country’s Indigenous Ranger Program—a welcome step toward ensuring both programs’ continued success.\n\nIPAs are partnerships led by Traditional Owners (Aboriginal people with certain rights and responsibilities in relation to land or sea) and supported by the Australian Government. They build community and strengthen local governance—for example, by supporting people in applying Indigenous ecological knowledge, fostering cultural ties within Indigenous groups, passing knowledge from Elders to younger community members and protecting sacred sites.\n\nDecision-making, conservation planning, and management work within IPAs is led by Traditional Owners through their local land and sea management organisations, in agreement with the Government. IPA plans also prioritise the management of key Outback environmental threats, such as feral animals, invasive weeds and destructive wildfires. Work can also include protecting rock art, collaborating with researchers, managing fires for the best outcomes for people and nature, and welcoming visitors.\n\nFurther, IPAs typically create a highly productive means for Traditional Owners to develop and strengthen partnerships with state and federal agencies and other stakeholders, such as non-profit conservation groups, local industry and research organisations. As the leaders and primary managers of IPAs, Traditional Owners are the central drivers of key decisions applying to their estates.\n\nIn September 2021, the Government announced consultation funding to develop 7 new IPAs encompassing 3.7 million hectares. The proposed IPAs stretch from the Torres Strait and Cape York regions of Queensland across to the Kimberley and Pilbara areas of Western Australia; developing full management plans will take several years.\n\nOver the coming years, with millions of more hectares of IPAs planned, these areas are expected to make up more than 50% of Australia's National Reserve System and will be key to the country meeting its domestic and international responsibilities to manage nature and protect important cultural values.\n\nLong-term work by the Country Needs People partnership of more than 40 frontline Indigenous land and sea management groups has backed the growth and development of the IPA network, community-based Indigenous ranger jobs and protected area co-management initiatives around Australia. The Pew Charitable Trusts is proud to be a key supporter of Country Needs People.\n\nIndigenous rangers are funded principally through the Australian Government’s Indigenous Ranger Program, which supports Traditional Owners in combining Indigenous traditional and local knowledge with other techniques to protect and care for the land and sea.\n\nIn a separate but related move, in March 2022 the Australian Government committed to doubling Indigenous ranger jobs throughout Australia, over time, with a $636 million investment in the program. The ambitious commitment to doubling ranger jobs by 2030 and increasing funding for IPAs was reiterated by the newly elected government in May, as part of its longstanding policy position.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia are driven by a strong will to sustain culture and connection to Country. Their work managing pressures on the landscape through locally driven organisations and initiatives such as Indigenous ranger programs are key to ensuring a viable future for sustainable management of Australia’s land and sea.\n\nIndigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous rangers are world-leading examples of how governments and others can partner with Indigenous leadership in land and sea management. These programs are vital to local communities—for cultural, economic and environmental reasons—and Pew applauds the Australian Government for its continued commitment to these programs’ success.\n\nMichelle Grady directs Pew’s Outback to Oceans program in Australia.",
    "UN Rights Body Rules Australia Failed to Protect from Climate Change": "Click to expand Image A woman walks past palm trees on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait, August 9, 2006. © 2006 Andrew Mears/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee on September 23 found that the Australian government had violated the rights of Indigenous Torres Strait Islanders by failing to adequately protect them against the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nThe groundbreaking decision of the committee, an independent expert body that monitors state compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), establishes important protections under international human rights law for climate-affected communities.\n\nThe complaint was the first legal action brought by climate-vulnerable inhabitants of low-lying islands against a state. Eight Australian nationals and their children, Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait region, alleged that Australia failed to implement an adaptation program to ensure the long-term habitability of the islands.\n\nThe committee heard that changes in weather patterns harmed the Islanders’ livelihoods, culture, and traditional way of life. Severe flooding caused by tidal surges destroyed family graves, while heavy rainfall and storms degraded the land and reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming.\n\nThe committee found that despite construction of some seawalls on the islands, the Australian government had not taken sufficient steps to protect the Islanders’ homes and livelihoods. The committee also found that that the government had not provided the Islanders with a way to maintain their traditional way of life and transmit their culture to their children.\n\n“States that fail to protect individuals under their jurisdiction from the adverse effects of climate change may be violating their human rights under international law,” said Hélène Tigroudja, a committee member.\n\nUnder the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, states have an obligation to provide those whose rights have been violated with an effective remedy. The committee ruled Australia should pay adequate compensation to the claimants and secure the communities’ “continued safe existence” on the islands.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee decision paves the way for further legal action and compensation claims by other climate-affected communities around the globe. It sends a clear warning to all governments that they need to protect citizens from climate harm, and failure to do so may make them legally liable. To avoid similar violations in the future, the government should immediately adopt robust and rights-respecting climate mitigation and adaptation policies consistent with the best available science.",

    "Australia mulls tougher cybersecurity laws after data breach": "The Australian government says it's considering tougher cybersecurity rules for telecommunications companies and blamed the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, Optus, for an unprecedented breach of personal data from 9.8 million customers\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government said on Monday it is considering tougher cybersecurity rules for telecommunications companies and blamed Optus, the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, for an unprecedented breach of personal data from 9.8 million customers.\n\nOptus said last Thursday it had become aware the day before of the cyberattack which obtained the details of 9.8 million people — of Australia’s population of 26 million.\n\nCybersecurity Minister Clare O’Neil told Australian Broadcasting Corp. the hack was an “unprecedented theft of consumer information in Australian history.”\n\nFor 2.8 million current and former Optus customers, the breach involved “significant amounts of personal data,” including driver’s licenses and passport numbers, O’Neil said.\n\nThose 2.8 million people are at significant risk of identity left and fraud, she said.\n\n“The breach is of a nature that we should not expect to see in a large telecommunications provider in this country,” O’Neil told Parliament.\n\nIn some countries, such a breach would result in fines “amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars,” O’Neil said.\n\nAustralian law doesn’t currently allow for Optus to be fined for the breach.\n\n“A very substantial reform task is going to emerge from a breach of this scale and size,” O’Neil said.\n\n“One significant question is whether the cybersecurity requirements that we place on large telecommunications providers in this country are fit for purpose,” she added.\n\nAustralian Federal Police said in a statement that reports the stolen data had already been sold were under investigation.\n\nAustralian investigators are working with overseas law enforcement agencies to determine who was behind the attack and to help shield the public from identity fraud, the statement said.\n\n“To protect the integrity of the criminal investigation, the AFP will not divulge what information it has obtained in the first few days” of the investigation, police said.\n\nJeremy Kirk, a Sydney-based cybersecurity writer, said he used an online forum for criminals who trade in stolen data to ask someone who claimed to have downloaded the Optus information how it was accessed.\n\nOptus appeared to have left an application programming interface, a piece of software known as an API that allows other systems to communicate and exchange data, open to the public, she said.\n\n“It looks like it was a failure to secure the software system, so anybody on the internet could find it,” Kirk told Ten Network television.\n\nO’Neil didn’t detail how the breach occurred, but described it as a “quite a basic hack.”\n\nOptus had “effectively left the window open for data of this nature to be stolen,” she said.\n\nO’Neil called on Optus to offer compromised customers free credit monitoring to protect them from identity theft, a request that the Sydney-based company complied with later on Monday.\n\nOptus announced it was offering its “most affected” customers free 12-month subscriptions to Equifax Protect, a credit monitoring and identify protection service.\n\nOptus said the information that had been accessed by an unidentified third party included customers’ names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nPolice and other government security agencies worked through the weekend to protect affected customers, O’Neil said.\n\nGovernment agencies were also working with the banking sector to protect customers.\n\n“This is complex. It’s legally and technically complex, but we are working on a solution,” O’Neil said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese described the breach as a “huge wake-up call for the corporate sector.”\n\nAlbany foreshadowed potential changes to privacy provisions so that banks can move more quickly to protect their own customers after such a breach.\n\n“We know that in today’s world there are actors — some state actors, but also some criminal organizations — who want to get access to people’s data,” Albanese said.\n\nOptus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said in a statement last week that, “We are devastated to discover that we have been subject to a cyberattack that has resulted in the disclosure of our customers’ personal information to someone who shouldn’t see it.”",

    "Analysis: Australia - a land of promise and hurdles for offshore wind developers": "A fence is seen in front of wind turbines that are part of the Infigen Energy Capital Wind Farm located on the hills surrounding Lake George, near the Australian capital city of Canberra, Australia February 21, 2018. REUTERS/David Gray\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies Net zero push stokes hopes for offshore wind projects\n\nVictoria state aims for 9 GW offshore wind by 2040\n\nSector needs new regulations, to lure technology suppliers\n\nIndustry also set to face environmental, landowner concerns\n\nMELBOURNE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Under a new government, Australia is shaping up to be the next big market for offshore wind developers, attracting interest from the likes of Shell, Denmark's Orsted and Norway's Equinor. But the industry, starting from scratch Down Under, faces a slew of challenges.\n\nAfter more than a decade of weak climate action under conservative leaders, Anthony Albanese's new Labor government has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 - a goal that aligns with states' renewable energy goals.\n\nTo meet that target, the country will need 96 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2035, replacing coal-fired plants that are set to close, and offshore wind will have to be part of that mix, Shell's (SHEL.L) Australia chair Tony Nunan told Reuters in an interview.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nOnshore wind power accounts for 10% of Australia's electricity needs but the groundwork needed for offshore farms - which are much bigger and far more productive - is only just starting to fall into place after a law setting out a framework for their development was passed late last year.\n\nThe government has, however, moved quickly to launch a process for identifying offshore zones to be opened up for licenses. The first area proposed is off Victoria state's Gippsland coast, with a final decision expected before the end of the year.\n\n\"We're at the fairly early stages and a lot has happened in the last few weeks much faster than people expected and that's attracted a lot of global attention,\" said Tim Sawyer, chief international officer at Flotation Energy, which has a proposed project off the Gippsland coast.\n\nTo many in the industry, Australia could well become the next boom market for offshore wind.\n\nEquinor (EQNR.OL), for example, sees Australia as one of its top three Asia-Pacific markets for offshore wind, behind Japan and South Korea and plans to use its South Korean projects as a template for Australia, said Lars Nordli, Equinor's vice president for business development renewables Asia & Pacific.\n\nTHE HURDLES\n\nHowever, the sector will need new regulations and beefed-up government departments to handle licensing and approvals. It will also have to develop a supply chain as well as workers' skills for thousands of jobs in construction, operations and maintenance, industry executives said.\n\nProjects, which typically take eight to 10 years to complete, will likely also need to overcome potential opposition from landowners concerned about transmission lines needed to hook into the grid onshore.\n\nCommunity concerns about the impact of wind turbines on bird life, such as orange-bellied parrots, and sealife, such as fish and whales, are also expected.\n\n\"Each project will be assessed individually to make sure we protect our precious biodiversity while we harness our world-class offshore wind to generate clean energy,\" Victoria's energy minister, Lily D'Ambrosio, said in comments emailed to Reuters.\n\nThe industry must also lure suppliers of vessels, turbines and other related technology away from rapidly growing offshore wind markets in Europe and Asia - suppliers who may only come if there are several projects being developed around the same time.\n\n\"There's only a limited number of vessels in the world that can be used for erecting turbines offshore. So you need to attract those vessels to Australian waters,\" said Charles Rattray, CEO of Star of the South, the country's most advanced proposed offshore wind project.\n\nFlotation Energy sees opportunities to speed up development and cut costs by using oil and gas assets that are coming to the end of their lives in waters off Victoria, such as vessels that will be deployed for decommissioning oil and gas platforms.\n\n\"There's a lot of opportunities from a petroleum industry that's got 50 years of heritage in the region...to take part of that and evolve it into offshore wind,\" Sawyer said. \"I'd prefer we're not taking 10 years to build a project.\"\n\nFOCUS ON VICTORIA STATE\n\nShell (SHEL.L), Orsted (ORSTED.CO) and France's ENGIE (ENGIE.PA), through its Ocean Winds venture with EDP Renewables, said they are watching the Victorian process closely.\n\nVictoria state's Gippsland coast first in line\n\nThe state, which has spearheaded the country's offshore wind push, plans to procure 2 gigawatts (GW) of offshore capacity with supply due by 2032, enough to power 1.5 million homes. It is also targeting 4 GW by 2035 and 9 GW by 2040.\n\nThe 2.2 GW capacity Star of the South, on the drawing board for 10 years and now majority owned by Danish wind giant Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, aims to be up and running in 2028.\n\nNew South Wales has also sought bids for renewable energy projects for the Illawarra region south of Sydney, attracting eight offshore wind proposals with 12.9 GW of capacity worth A$35 billion ($23 billion).\n\n\"New South Wales has got much better options.

    "Australian business schools count on return of international students": "Australia’s higher education system has been one of the country’s worst hit sectors during the pandemic, as the stifling effects of border closures on international student numbers cut its revenue in half.\n\nCovid-19, and the government’s response of strict border controls — part of its “Fortress Australia” policy — choked off the flow of overseas students. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, revenue from that vital resource for universities shrank to A$20.2bn ($13.8bn) in the year to June. That compared with A$38.7bn for the same period in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\n\nUniversities and their business schools were quick to switch courses online and devise ways to maintain engagement with students who were locked down and with no way of returning to their home countries. Nonetheless, enrolment from overseas slumped.\n\nGovernment data show there were 956,773 international students enrolled in Australian universities in 2019, with more than 750,000 of them paying full fees on a student visa. That number has dropped to roughly 446,000 this year.\n\nEliza Littleton, an economist with the Australia Institute public policy think-tank, says the sector had become “increasingly reliant on international student fees, casual employment, and the underpayment of staff — dysfunctions which were exacerbated by the pandemic”.\n\nShe notes that Australian universities recorded revenue declines for the first time in eight years in 2021 which led to 35,000 job cuts — almost one in five — across the higher education sector.\n\nInternational students at University of Sydney say online classes meant they ‘lost the real meaning of studying abroad’ © Loren Elliott/Reuters\n\nRoy Green, emeritus professor and former dean of the business school at University of Technology Sydney, says this added pressure on academic staff to increase their teaching workload. Meanwhile, research projects — often funded from international student fees — have been cut, prompting many postdoctoral students and early-career researchers to move overseas. “It led to a demoralisation in the higher education sector,” he adds.\n\nThe geopolitical tension between Australia and China has also hit universities that had depended on a steady flow of international students.\n\nXiao Qian, China’s ambassador to Australia, was keen to stress the importance of the educational ties between the two countries, in a speech in June at the University of Technology Sydney. He pointed out that there were 131,400 Chinese students in Australia, accounting for 28 per cent of the country’s international student population.\n\n35,000 Number of job cuts in Australia higher education prompted by the pandemic\n\nThat number, according to Australian government data, is up to 20 per cent lower than in the previous year — which is a steeper decline than that for students from other countries.\n\nHowever, there are now signs that Chinese students could be returning in force. Jon Chew, global head of insights at consultants Navitas, says visa data for the first six months of the year suggests there has been a “full recovery” in the number of Chinese students. Roughly 40 per cent of those were returning students.\n\nBut Chew adds that the auditor-general in New South Wales has highlighted this dependence on Chinese fee-paying students. Seven out of 10 of the universities in the state now report that China is the leading source of overseas student revenue, creating a concentration risk.\n\nThe drop in Chinese students has been less acute for business schools, though, as the growing number of Indian, Nepalese and Indonesian students enrolling in recent years has reduced the reliance on Australia’s largest trading partner for revenue.\n\nMoreover, domestic demand unexpectedly soared during the pandemic. Mark Barnaba, who sits on the board of University of Western Australia Business School and was its chair for almost two decades, says business schools proved the unlikely beneficiaries of the country’s strict lockdown protocols.\n\n“The domestic market increased as people isolated at home [and] opted to study during lockdown,” he says. “Companies looking to retain labour also encouraged that and helped with fees. It was an unusual dynamic that, overall, benefited Australian business schools.”\n\nAndrew John, associate dean of the Melbourne Business School, points out that, while its executive education business declined during lockdown, the institute had one of its largest ever intakes for part-time students from September 2020. “This did not surprise us,” he says.\n\nThe main change for Melbourne Business School has been a slowing “study rate”, with fewer students taking two subjects at once. “We are not sure if this is temporary, perhaps reflecting the pressure and burnout that, at least anecdotally, is being felt across the workforce in Australia, or whether it is a permanent shift,” John says.\n\nAustralia’s aim is to draw more international students back to its shores, with plans to cut visa complexity — not only to boost numbers, but also to tempt more of them to become permanent citizens.\n\nDeparting students have become a source of concern, for the higher education sector and the wider economy. If Australia loses its best students overseas but also fails to retain international students after study, it risks a ‘brain drain’. At the same time, with unemployment at near-50 year lows, the country faces a labour shortage.\n\nThe government has responded with proposals to lengthen visa durations and extend the right to stay and work for student visa holders — a key attraction for more international students to enrol.\n\nAnd Barnaba, who is also deputy chair of mining group Fortescue and sits on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia, believes the strict lockdown measures that froze out so many international students could even prove a boon, now that borders have reopened.\n\n“Australia’s strict Covid restrictions kept fatalities low,” he says — “and, combined with the strength of the economy and general view of being a safe and enjoyable country to live in”, this could make Australia appear an attractive country in which to study.\n\nDespite the “background noise” of geopolitical tension, Green suggests Chinese students will continue to have an important role in Australia and the funding of the higher education sector. “It’s like iron ore,” he says. “If someone said ‘let’s not deal with China,’ then the economy would go down the spiral. It’s the same in higher education.”",
    "Bitcoin Down Under: Australia Bags 4th Spot In Global Crypto Adoption – Survey": "Bitcoin adoption has always been the subject of rigorous debates in many countries today.\n\nWith financial powerhouses such as the U.S. and China still taking a hard stance against cryptocurrencies, it remains to be seen if the adoption of crypto by different nations will reach its peak in the near future.\n\nAfter all, the respective governments of the above-mentioned countries continue to associate digital assets like Bitcoin with illicit affairs.\n\nBut this does not necessarily mean that other countries will follow suit. In fact, there are nations that are slowly making the necessary steps to properly adopt crypto into their financial system.\n\nAustralia, for example, is already turning heads in crypto space after it recently catapulted itself to be among the top nations as far as crypto adoption is concerned.\n\nAustralia Moving Up In the Rankings\n\nA September 2022 report from Finder puts Australia in 4th place among 26 nations that were surveyed about crypto adoption.\n\nThe country’s cryptocurrency ownership rate stood at 23%, just few points below 1st-placer India which boasted a rate of 29%.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Cardano were the popular cryptocurrencies held by people Down Under.\n\nThe report shows 14% of the 272, 257 surveyed people in the country owned Bitcoin. Meanwhile, 10% of the survey participants revealed owning Ethereum.\n\nDogecoin and Cardano barely made the cut, garnering 5% and 4% respectively.\n\nIs Australia A Bitcoin Country?\n\nThe global average of Bitcoin ownership is 36%. Australia’s is way above that with its 60% average. It’s probably safe to say it is a Bitcoin country.\n\nAfter all, it is just normal for those investing in this kind of asset to go for the top of the class.\n\nMoreover, the survey also found out that men in Australia are more likely to own crypto as compared to women.\n\nAmong those surveyed owners of digital currencies, 62% were men and only 38% were women. Australia is not that far from the U.S. where 74% of crypto owners are men.\n\nThere are about 4.6 million Aussies who own cryptocurrencies. They are relatively young, as shown in the survey.\n\nBased on the Finder’s findings, 57% of crypto owners are of ages between 18 and 34.\n\nMeanwhile, the study also found out that Aussies who are 55 years old and above are less likely to own any digital currency.\n\nBTC total market cap at $361 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com\n\nFeatured image from Envato Elements, Chart: TradingView.com",
    "Van der Poel pleads guilty to assault but leaves Australia after Worlds hotel altercation": "Mathieu van der Poel has been allowed to leave Australia after pleading guilty and paying a $1,500 fine for his alleged altercation with two teenagers the night before the elite men’s road race at the World Championships in Wollongong.\n\nAccording to Dutch broadcaster NOS (opens in new tab), who followed the court proceedings and spoke to Van der Poel’s Australian lawyer, the rider is already on a flight home after paying the fine and obtaining his passport. Van der Poel's lawyer plans to appeal against the sentence, aiming to set aside the convictions.\n\nThe New South Wales police said on Sunday that a man at the hotel where the Dutch team is staying was allegedly involved in a verbal altercation with two teenage girls who were aged 13 and 14.\n\n“It’s further alleged the man then pushed both teenagers, with one falling to the ground and the other being pushed into a wall causing a minor graze to her elbow,” said NSW police in a statement sent to Cyclingnews.\n\n\"Officers from St George Police Area Command attended and arrested a 27-year-old man shortly after. He was taken to Kogarah Police Station and charged with two counts of common assault.”\n\nVan der Poel gave his version of events in an interview with Sporza before the start of the road race.\n\n\"I went to bed early and many children in the hallway of my room found it necessary to knock on the door continuously. After a few times I was done with it. I didn't ask so nicely to stop. Then the police were called and I was taken,\" Van der Poel explained to Sporza.\n\nVan der Poel started the men’s road race but quit after an hour. He was reportedly held at the police station until 4:00am, sleeping little before the start of the race. He was expected in court on Tuesday but expedited his exit from Australia after pleading guilty and paying a $1,500 fine.\n\nThe Southerland local court magistrate ordered that he pay fines of $1,000 and $500 for the two common assaults on the two girls.\n\n“Under pressure to perform, everyone makes mistakes,\" Van der Poel's lawyer Michael Bowe told NOS.\n\n\"His partner was in tears and he himself was very disappointed with the result,\" the lawyer said after the hearing. \"He told me that he feels like he has disappointed his country and his team.\"\n\nVan der Poel refused to speak to Dutch and Australian television after the court hearing and dashed to the airport for his flight home.

    "Electric Utes for Australia & New Zealand": "While EV enthusiasts in Australia and New Zealand might be holding out for a Rivian or a Ford F-150 Lightning, they may have to make do with the Chinese LDV T60 EV (eT60) instead. The vehicle is available for order in New Zealand now and should be launched late this year or early next year in Australia, being distributed by Ateco Group. It will tow your boat and it won’t ruin your weekend.\n\nIt is an electrified version of the LDV T60 Ute that we are already seeing on Australian and New Zealand roads.\n\n“While pricing is yet to be revealed, LDV has opened up orders online, and will take a $1,000 deposit to secure an electric Ute. On that same topic, it was confirmed that at least one model of the EV T60 will be eligible for the $8,625 clean car rebate in New Zealand.”\n\n“LDV Group Limited, formerly Leyland DAF Vans, was a British van manufacturer based in Washwood Heath, Birmingham. Historically part of Rover Group and Leyland DAF, it was later a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian GAZ Group. Owing to the global recession and a lack of long-term investment, production was suspended at the LDV factory in December 2008.”\n\nThe intellectual property rights were sold to SAIC Motor in 2010, with its Maxus subsidiary commencing production in China in March 2011. SAIC also owns the MG brand. LDV has been a success story in Australia, going from 214 sales in 2014 to over 15,000 last year. It is well placed to bring electric utes to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe eT60 boasts a range of 325 km from a 88.5 kWh battery. A home charging cable is supplied. Current models will be available in 2WD, with a single electric motor mounted on the rear axle producing 130 kW and 310 Nm of torque. Payload capacity is 980 kg, and it can tow up to 1 tonne. However this will reduce the range by ~50%.\n\nIn New Zealand, the LDV eT60 is listed at NZD$79,990 drive-away, which equates to about $72,000 in Australian currency based on today’s exchange rates — or about 45 per cent more than a top-of-the-range T60 twin-turbo diesel. It is the same price as a Toyota Land Cruiser.\n\n“We are endeavoring to have the LDV eT60 in Australia late this year or early next year, once right-hand-drive production commences. While Australian timing and pricing are yet to be confirmed, we are very excited about the future rollout of electric LDV vehicles,” says Dinesh Chinappa, General Manager LDV Australia.\n\nThe LDV eT60 has half the range and towing capacity of its diesel variant. It only comes in 2WD and it costs 45% more. Why would you buy one? Perhaps because diesel is over $2 a litre in Australia and almost $3 a litre in NZ. It won’t take too many kilometers to make up the difference.\n\nShhh, don’t tell Sussan Ley that there are electric utes for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppreciate CleanTechnica’s originality and cleantech news coverage?

    "Mega-polluting coal plans clash with Australia’s climate goals": "The future of the country’s $63 billion coal export industry is a dilemma for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who took office in May with a promise to improve a weak record on climate action. Though his government has tightened emissions reduction targets, Albanese has also signaled support for new gas and coal developments amid a global energy crisis that’s seen buyers scramble for the country’s exports and swelled profits for fossil-fuel producers.\n\nGlobal electricity generation from coal jumped about 8.5% last year to more than 9,600 terawatt-hours, the first increase since 2018, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. Climate groups have raised concerns over the potential impact on efforts to curb emissions as nations revert to using the dirtiest fossil fuel.\n\nAlbanese’s government “is talking the talk that Australia is back on climate, but it’s got all these coal mines that are under review,” said Fahimah Badrulhisham, a spokesperson for Move Beyond Coal, the campaign group that produced the data. “We cannot allow new mines to be dug in 2022.”\n\nMinisters currently have no legal obligation to consider climate impacts when authorizing development of new mines, and campaigners in March lost an attempt to block a Whitehaven Coal Ltd. proposal over its projected emissions. Members of Australia’s Green Party and pro-climate independent lawmakers have called for existing environmental laws to be tightened.\n\nEnvironment Minister Tanya Plibersek is reviewing current laws, her office said. Coal mine applications are being assessed on a “case-by-case” basis, she said in July. Mining tycoon Clive Palmer was refused approvals in August for a the Central Queensland Coal project over the potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nMining giants including BHP Group, Glencore Plc, and Peabody Energy Corp. are among producers with projects in Australia being considered by the government. BHP and Mitsubishi Corp.’s proposed Blackwater South metallurgical coal mine in Queensland is seeking approvals to cover a 90 year lifespan. That would equate to 1.98 billion tons of emissions, according to Move Beyond Coal’s estimates.\n\nBHP declined to comment on the emissions forecast. Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry previously suggested the mine would be unlikely to operate for the duration set out in approval documents.\n\nGlencore’s Valeria thermal and metallurgical coal mine in central Queensland has a proposed lifetime of 35 years and would emit 1.39 billion tons of carbon dioxide, Move Beyond Coal said.\n\nThe release of 17 billion tons of carbon dioxide from all the proposed mines would account for 4% of the world’s remaining “carbon budget” of 420 million tons — the point at which planetary warming of 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes the most likely scenario, according to the Global Carbon Project.\n\nA total of 31 coal mine projects were at the committed stage, where a final investment decision has been taken, or undergoing feasibility studies, Australia’s resources ministry said in a report in December.\n\n(By James Fernyhough, with assistance from Andrew Janes)",

    "The Taste With Vir: Visiting Australia? Don't go only for the food": "This was my third trip to Sydney (and my fourth to Australia). On all of the previous occasions I had been invited by the Australian government to show off Australia’s food scene. This was right after the TV success of the Australian Masterchef and Tourism Australia wanted to establish that Australia was a great food destination — which indeed it was.\n\nOne trip was linked to a pop-up in Sydney by Copenhagen’s Noma in which the chef, Rene Redzepi, used local ingredients to create new dishes that accorded with the Noma philosophy. Another was for the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival.\n\nSince then, a lot has changed. Even before the pandemic, some of Australia's most celebrated chefs were accused of underpaying/mistreating/cheating/exploiting their staff and huge scandals followed. George Calombaris, a celebrity in India because of his role as a judge on Masterchef Australian got into trouble and was booted off Masterchef. The two other judges followed him out and the show now has a new line-up.\n\nNeil Perry, one of Australia’s best known chefs also got into trouble and gave up control of some of his restaurants. So did many of the top Australian restaurant groups.\n\nEven as the sleazy underbelly of the Australian restaurant industry was being exposed, the pandemic hit and Australia shut down. So extreme was the lockdown that the country closed its borders, preventing people from going out or coming in. Of course, like all such restrictions, it was of very little use. Covid arrived in Australia anyway.\n\nAnd now, the country has swung to the other extreme. There are no Covid restrictions visible to visitors. Nobody asks for vaccination certificates, nobody wears masks, and social distancing is a joke.\n\nAlso Read | The Taste With Vir: Kung Pao vs Gong Bao Chicken, reality of food globalisation\n\nBut the pandemic seems to have left its mark. In common with many other countries, Australia has difficulty coping with the influx of visitors. Visas can take weeks to come through. The queue at immigration was long; it took me 90 minutes to negotiate Sydney airport when I landed. And though most Australians remain warm and friendly, the airport is run a little like a penal colony. (No. I am not going to make the obvious joke.) I had got into what seemed to be the shortest of the queues when an aggressive woman who was, I guess, the airport version of a traffic warden instructed me to move to another, longer queue. “If you don’t move to that queue,” she barked, “we won’t let you in”.\n\nEven by the notorious standards of US immigration, this was remarkably offensive and unnecessary. That said, the immigration officials themselves were fine. And on the way back when the immigration checks were automated, the process was painless. Nevertheless, if you are planning to go to Australia, it might be worth considering delaying your trip till things settle down a bit. This is not the best time.\n\nThat option was not available to me because I had to be in Sydney for the World Class cocktail championships. This is an annual drinks competition organised by Diageo and I have been one of the judges of the Indian leg for years. Besides, who would turn down an invitation to a four-day-long cocktail party?\n\nThe last World Class competition was held in the grim environs of Glasgow (the next one is in Sao Paolo which sounds more exciting) so it came as a surprise to me to discover that Diageo had taken over the Four Seasons, Sydney for this year’s World Class. It’s a beast of a hotel (around 500 rooms of which World Class had booked over 400), which is huge for a Four Seasons.\n\nBut perhaps because it is run by two Indians (my old friend Uday Rao is the general manager and Kartik Kapoor is the hotel manager) it operates with the efficiency of the best Four Seasons properties, despite its size and the laidback attitude to service of most Australians. Every single request is met with split-second efficiency, the concierge team is fabulous and they manage to personalise the service for 500 room guests. God alone knows how they do it. But then, I guess, that’s why it is a Four Seasons.\n\nThe Four Seasons also has the best views in Sydney. My room overlooked the harbour and each time I looked out of my window I saw the stunning Sydney Opera House and the iconic Harbour Bridge. Nothing, seemed to be more than a 10-minute walk away so the location was great too. For instance, when I took an Uber to the lovely Botanical Garden, I was embarrassed to discover how near to the hotel I was and just walked back along the seafront.\n\nThough my weather app had assured me it would rain every day, I woke up to bright sunshine on my first Saturday in Sydney. Robin, the Four Seasons concierge, found me a wonderful bay-front table at a good French restaurant (a seven-minute walk from the hotel) called Whalebridge where my wife and I ate Sydney Rock Oysters washed down with a Chardonnay from Australia's Mornington Peninsula.\n\nThe previous night Uday Rao had taken us for dinner to the buzzy and trendy Nomad, where much of the food had Middle Eastern influences. We ate empanadas stuffed with wild mushrooms and bone marrow, a flatbread with Middle Eastern flavours, burata with fennel jam, a dry aged pork cutlet and an unusual lamb’s neck pie.\n\nOn Saturday night, Robin suggested Rockpool Bar and Grill. I had been to the original Rockpool (which I don’t think exists any longer) when it was Neil Perry’s flagship restaurant. Perry started the Bar and Grill as a steakhouse but he is not associated with it any longer. It’s a large, dark, special occasion restaurant. We ate a wood-fired chorizo with vegetables (including bhindi) home-made sausages and a rump steak from David Blockmore’s farm. Given Blackmore’s reputation, the steak should have been better.\n\nMr Wong is the Chinese restaurant everyone recommended. Owned by the massive Merivale group, this may be Sydney’s most popular Chinese place. Though it has 240 seats, it was jam-packed when I went and everyone seemed to be having a good time.\n\nI wouldn’t say I had a bad time but I won’t be going back. The dim sum had no delicacy. They were of takeaway restaurant quality, the kung pao chicken was neither the Sichuan original nor the global, Americanised version, the Angus beef in pepper suffered from the overcooking of the expensive beef (it's hard to get wok timings right when you are feeding 240 guests at once), and my wife thought that the ma pao tofu was ‘odd’. Which it was: It was a layer of a custard-like tofu on which a sauce had been poured. Odd but interesting. The French beans with minced pork, a Sichuan standard, must have been a Wong variation because it had none of the powerful flavours of Sichuan food.\n\nBut we kept going. We had lunch the next day at China Doll in Woolloomooloo. Some of the food was very good: oysters with a Thai dressing and steamed scallops Chinese style were delicious. There was a fun (but very large) version of Sesame Shrimp Toast and unusual chicken samosas, described as fried dumplings on the menu.\n\nMy quarrel was with the Australian contempt for delicacy. Though the dim sum were a lot better than the ones at Mr Wong, they were so huge that you couldn’t really pop a whole dim sum in your mouth. So, you had to cut them in half which destroys the point of dim sum.\n\nWe did one more (very good) big dinner at the Middle Eastern Nour, one of Uday’s favourites, before retreating to watching TV and eating room service burgers. But I was determined to go back to some of the places I had liked on my previous trips.\n\nAria is owned by Matt Moran, one of Australia's best known chefs. I remember having a quite stunning Peking Duck soup there six years ago. This time around, it was only a set menu at lunch and the soup was not on it. The food was fine: European techniques with Australian ingredients but not one dish was startlingly good or memorable.\n\nI went to Firedoor by accident in 2016 after the Manager of Quay, one of Australia’s best restaurants, recommended it. We sat at the counter and watched Lennox Hastie, the chef, cook on the open fire. Lennox told us how he looked carefully for the sources of all the ingredients and cooked us what must have been one of the best steaks either my wife or I had ever had.\n\nSince then, Lennox has become famous: Hee has his own Chef’s Table episode, and Firedoor is a global destination. Which is great, but I was disappointed to find that it had dispensed with the a la carte menu and only served a set menu, on which steak did not feature. You could get one but it came as an extra.\n\nI guess that’s fine. All restaurants evolve and it was good to see a young Indian chef at the pass (Ahana Dutt from Calcutta) and the fire burned just as brightly as it had when we first went.\n\nThere was a fairly large Indian contingent at World Class: Diageo managers, judges, chefs, restaurateurs, media etc. At the end of our stay we compared notes.\n\nCould you eat well in Sydney?\n\nYes, we all agreed. You could.\n\nWas it one of the world’s great restaurant cities?\n\nNo, we were unanimous on that one.\n\nIt could be that we went to all the wrong places and that we were not there for long enough to judge. But between us, we had done all of the city’s best-known restaurants. Speaking for myself, this was very different from my two other trips where I had been blown away by the food in Sydney.\n\nAnd then, a surprise. On our last night in Australia, Uday suggested we eat at Mode. This is a very well regarded modern Australian restaurant but because it is run by the Four Season, I had been slightly dismissive of it and had not bothered to eat there.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThe food was stunning: The best meal I ate on the whole trip. We started with plates of delicious oysters from all over Australia. Then we had a roughly chopped tartare of Backmore Wagyu (it lived up to its reputation this time), there were potatoes with caviar; a top-notch asparagus risotto made with Acquerello rice and the single best steak I ate on the whole trip. I asked to see the person who had cooked it and he turned out to be a young Indian chef who had once worked with the Oberoi group.\n\nSo, this great food had been there in my hotel, all this time! And I had just been too stupid to notice.\n\nWell, live and learn.\n\nDo visit Sydney. Australia is a lovely country and Australians are very nice people. But don’t rush. Australia is not ready to receive visitors. And don’t go only for the food! Find other things to do.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",

Over the next decade, Australia’s old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to the working-age population) will change from about four workers to three workers for every retiree.\n\nLower tax receipts and higher spending on pensions, health and aged care may cost around $40bn every year (about 8% of the budget).\n\nGiven concerns about debt levels and budget repair, government revenues must better align with outlays if Australians want continuation of expected benefits, cost-of-living relief and expenditure on ameliorating the rising costs of more frequent climate change induced weather events.\n\nAustralia’s overall taxation level at 28% of GDP is below the OECD average of 34% and at least 10%% less than that of Germany, France and Scandinavia.\n\nAddressing the tax take and how it is raised is a pressing issue.\n\nAustralia’s tax base is narrow, dependent on personal income taxes which at 42% of all federal tax revenues is also below the OECD average of 49%, after adjustment for social security payments which many countries levy to fund unemployment support, age and disability pensions.\n\nGiven Australia’s reasonably progressive tax scale and a highest marginal tax rate of 47% (including the Medicare levy), scope for increases is limited if the country wishes to attract and retain skilled talent.\n\nCorporate taxes (about 17% v the OECD average of 10%) are difficult to increase because of Australia’s industrial structure and high overseas ownership of businesses (about 79%) with earnings accruing overseas.\n\nA side-effect of globalisation and Australia’s open economy is that personal and corporate income tax increases need to stay globally competitive in what is increasingly a race to the bottom. This may make increased consumption and wealth taxes unavoidable.\n\nAustralia’s GST, at about 12% of total tax revenue, is below the OECD average of 20%. Increases in the rate and coverage are one alternative.\n\nAs at March 2022, total Australian household wealth reached $14.9tn ($574,807 a person). Since March 2020, it has risen 35%, due to increases in residential property values (up 40%) and superannuation balances (up 22%). Since the abolition of death duties in 1979, this wealth accrues largely tax free except for concessional capital gains imposts.\n\nWhere to raise more taxes?\n\nOptions include revising the capital gains tax regime and introducing inheritance taxes – Australia is one of few countries that does not tax bequests.\n\nUltimately, primary residences and superannuation balances will need to be taxed or applied against post-work aged care and healthcare expenses. Wealthier Australians cannot continue to use their homes and superannuation as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle with the capital preserved at death for beneficiaries.\n\nIrregularities and anomalies need to be reduced.\n\nGovernment support must be targeted to ensure intended recipients benefit.\n\nAustralia’s childcare subsidies, for example, are available to families with income up to $356,756. Frequently distortionary, regressive and expensive concessions for investment in equipment that would be bought anyway, dividends, capital gains, superannuation and property must be reconsidered.\n\nSimplification of Australia’s complex tax code of tens of thousands of pages is essential. It enables legal structuring of affairs to minimise tax liabilities. A simpler principle rather than detailed rule-based system and allowing retrospective penalties, where the legislative policy or intent is ignored, would reduce tax planning opportunities.\n\nBut significant tax changes in Australia are difficult.\n\nWill Labor make the move?\n\nThe GST, ultimately introduced by stealth, took decades. The ALP attributes its loss at the 2019 election to modest proposed alterations to taxation of dividends and negative gearing, since abandoned.\n\nUnwilling to attempt serious tax reform, governments rely instead on bracket creep – increased tax revenue from rising nominal incomes due to inflation which put taxpayers into higher tax categories. This has pushed up the average personal income tax rate from 24% in 2016-17 to about 27% now. Inflation indexing thresholds would force governments to be transparent about tax revenues. Understandably, it faces bipartisan opposition.\n\nComplexity facilitates pork barrel politics with governments tweaking concessions and provisions to placate different constituencies.\n\nA large tax advice industry of questionable productive value resists simplification as an existential threat. Voters are likely to reject proposals that adversely affect them financially.\n\n\n\nWithout radical tax reform, Australia faces an insoluble public finance problem – demand for spending which cannot be met by taxes. The only other course of action is to wind back the country’s cherished welfare net.\n\nAs the old pre-metric saying goes: “You can’t get quarts out of pint pots.”",
    "Kohli and Yadav steer India to T20 series win over Australia": "Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav scored sublime half-centuries to give India a six-wicket win and series victory over Australia in the third and final T20I in Hyderabad.\n\nQuickfire innings from the opener Cameron Green (52 off 21 balls) and Tim David (54 off 27) set up a score of 186 for seven for Australia on Sunday after they lost the toss.\n\nIndia, the No 1-ranked side in the world, lost their openers inside the first four overs, but a third-wicket stand of 104 between Kohli (63 off 48) and Suryakumar Yadav (69 off 36) gave them the initiative.\n\nNeeding 11 off the final over, bowled by Daniel Sams (2-33 off 2.5 overs), Kohli blasted a six over long on but was caught at extra cover off the next delivery.\n\nOnly one came off the next two balls but Hardik Pandya (25 not out off 16) edged the fifth delivery outside off stump to the boundary to secure the win.\n\nKohli middled the ball well from the start of his innings, producing a couple of sumptuous cover driven boundaries.\n\nHe then took a back seat as Yadav bullied the Australia attack, smashing five fours and five sixes.\n\nKohli had a life on 23 when leg spinner Adam Zampa spilled a sharp return catch\n\nYadav played shots around the wicket, bringing up his half century with a wristy six over long on off Zampa and blasting another maximum over cover of the spinner’s next delivery.\n\nGreen, who also impressed with the ball, conceding just 14 from his three overs, stuck seven fours and three sixes, two of them off successive deliveries from Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nHe dominated the early stages of the Australian innings, scoring all but 10 of their runs before he was dismissed off the final ball off the fifth over.\n\nHowever, he was the only one of Australia’s top four to reach double figures with Aaron Finch (seven), Glenn Maxwell (six) Steve Smith (nine) all falling cheaply as the visitors slipped to 84 for four in the 10th over.\n\nDavid provided much needed momentum in the later overs, combining with Sams (28 not out off 20) for a seventh-wicket stand of 68, after Australia slumped to 117 for six.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He struck twice in the 14th over, having Josh Inglis (24 off 22) caught at backward point and then taking a smart low return catch to dismiss in-form Matthew Wade for just a single.\n\nThe leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal (one for 22 off four) also did good job of putting the brakes on Australia before David and Sams lifted the tempo.\n\nAustralia will play two T20I matches in early October against West Indies, on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, before the World Cup later that month.",
    "Australia Commits to the Clean Energy Demand Initiative’s Goals with Corporate Partners": "Today in Pittsburgh, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry joined the Government of Australia as it signed a Letter of Intent between the Australian government, represented by Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen, and nine companies – Akamai, Amazon, Cisco, Google, Iron Mountain, Lululemon, PepsiCo, Salesforce, and Unilever – to support the clean energy transition by working to procure clean energy in Australia and around the world. Together, these companies seek to unlock between $2.2-$2.8 billion in Australia’s clean energy infrastructure arising from commercial and industrial sector operations, working together with the Australian government as part of the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI). Many of these firms are already working with their supply chain partners in Australia and confirm the desire to support their suppliers with clean energy procurement as more options become available.\n\nCEDI serves as a platform for stakeholder engagement and country partnerships and creates a venue for companies and countries to signal investment potential in clean energy, share experiences, and support each other on policy reform that contributes to affordable and resilient energy systems that drive economic growth. Globally through CEDI, 75 interested private sector partners, representing a wide range of sectors, including technology, manufacturing, retail, and health, have indicated interest in unlocking up to $100 billion in clean energy infrastructure across 14 countries, as a complement to broader sectoral investment.\n\nThe experience and expertise of Australia’s regulators, utilities, and private sector, and the Australian government’s active engagement on regional energy security, will be valuable additions to CEDI’s efforts around the world. Australia’s policy actions – including large-scale generation credits, corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs), and renewable retail contracts – may serve as a model for other countries working to expand corporate procurement of renewable energy. Australia is a committed partner of the United States in efforts to unlock these markets globally, and its participation in the CEDI platform will help institutionalize and amplify its expertise.\n\nToday, Australia and corporate partners have clearly signaled their support for key principles to enable corporate renewable procurement, lending considerable weight to the ongoing effort to ramp up clean energy deployment and accelerate the energy transition in support of global climate goals.\n\nA fact sheet on CEDI is available here.\n\nFor further media information, contact ENR-PD-clearances@state.gov.",

(Photo by Phil Noble - WPA Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nAn Australia Marketplace was held in Los Angeles last month. Its mission was simple; to promote trade and tourism from the United States coming out of two years of COVID-19.\n\nAustralia has a way to go to return to its 2019 numbers, when one million U.S. and Canadian travelers visited, spending $3 billion. Currently demand is estimated at about 65% of 2019 travel.\n\nTravel from outside Australia was shut down for almost two years, several planes from Qantas and other carriers are still parked, and Australia is dealing with a worker shortage in tourism.\n\nHowever, Australia has a significant advantage in addition to the country’s beauty. Unlike certain international and US destinations, Australia really, really wants tourists to come back, and is investing in its tourism industry.\n\nWe spoke with Donald Edward Farrell, Minister for Trade and Tourism. He was frank about the issues facing the country as a destination. “My job is increasing the number of flights. We have a short supply of aircraft. There are still three or four planes [Qantas] still sitting out in the Mojave Desert.”\n\nDonald Edward Farrell, Australian Minister for Trade and Tourism AUSPIC DPS\n\n“We want more Americans to come back. We have a very close relationship,” he added. “But over the period of COVID people stopped traveling. So now there’s lot of unmet demand; Australian travel is something that lots of Americans would like to do.”\n\nOne of the most popular trips is what Australians call “Sydney-rock-reef.” Such journeys might start in the bustling city of Sydney. Uluru or Ayers Rock, the largest monolith in the world, is known for its mesmerizing paintings and carvings. “Reef” of course refers to exploring the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTo get some idea about the distances involved, Sydney to Uluru is a 5½ hour flight or 30-hour drive of almost 1800 miles. Similarly, to get from Sydney to the land side of the Great Barrier Reef is 1250 miles.\n\nWe did a quick search for an economy flight to Sydney from LAX. The lowest price we could find for a roundtrip economy ticket from October 31 to November 11, round trip was $1,969. As Farrell put it, “We had a roundtable with the aviation industry—we want more seats!”\n\nBut the flights are coming. According to Chris Allison, Vice President of Tourism for the Americas, “Air lift is recovering strongly. Our data shows that air capacity from the USA will be back at 79% of 2019 levels by end of 2023. Airlines are continuing to expand to Australia. And as capacity continues to increase airfares will continue to normalize.”\n\nOn October 28, Allison said United will launch new services from San Francisco to Brisbane in addition to re-launching services from Houston to Sydney and Los Angeles to Melbourne. In December, Qantas will launch new services from Dallas to Melbourne. And for those who really like to see Oceania (or spend quality time on a plane), Qantas will launch New York to Sydney services via Auckland next June.\n\nQantas is also promising the arrival of Project Sunrise, non-stop flights from New York and London to Melbourne and Sydney, by 2025. A fleet of twelve Airbus A350-1000 will make the 19-hour ‘hop,’ with just 238 seats providing plenty of room to stretch. (Also, plenty of room for extra jet fuel.)\n\nHONG KONG, CHINA - 2020/03/08: A Qantas Aribus A350 aircraft lands at the Hong Kong International ... [+] airport. Airlines across the globe have cancelled flights, postponed or adjusted their services in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Several years ago, Qantas ran a promotion where the airline would pay for a US passport for passengers who purchased airline tickets. The long-departed deal highlighted a reality; as of 2021 just 37% of American adults say they have a valid and unexpired U.S. passport. But as Farrell put it, “Even at 40% that’s a lot of Americans with passports.”\n\nEven better news for Australia is that two-thirds of Americans (64%) with household incomes above $100,000 have a valid US passport. For many, Australia is a bucket list destination. And GenZ backpackers with more money than time are also good candidates for Australian travel, as 58% of college grads have passports.\n\nFarrell was more focused on hospitality staffing, a familiar issue around the world. “We are hoping to address the labor shortage; we have issues of staff shortages.” Farrell, who started working in the hospitality industry in Australia’s Northern Territories in the 1970’s, added, “Long term we want to train young Australians to work in the tourism industry.”\n\nAustralia was closed to Americans during the pandemic. Another significant group, Chinese travelers, have yet to return. But the hospitality industry focused on internal travel, much as the U.S. did. While there remains a worker shortage, many new hotels and restaurant launched throughout Australia.\n\nThis picture taken on March 7, 2022 shows the current condition of coral on the Great Barrier Reef, ...

Farrell said that in Australia the pay is higher than US. The issue was more, “the unreliability of work, furloughs, and layoffs. Every time there was a lockdown—you lost your job. People wanted to do something more reliable.”\n\nBut Australia sees tourism as part of the solution, with significant career possibilities. To get there, there is a focus on investing in skills training and in allowing in more immigrants with needed skills.\n\n“We think we’ll have our hospitality workers back by October,” said Farrell. “We encourage Americans to come over. For young Americans you can get a work visa—my daughter has a work visa in NY.”\n\nIn Australia, at least, he says, “Travel and tourism is an aspirational industry.”",

    "Should I stay, or should I go? Australia’s nurse retention dilemma": "Even before the pandemic, Australia faced nursing shortages, caused in part by a shrinking supply of nursing-school graduates and a decline in the number of nurses migrating from other countries. In the immediate future, the Australian health system could see further shortages due to the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These short-term demands are superimposed on longer-term demand caused by Australia’s population growth and ageing demographic. Furthermore, many nurses have told us they plan to leave the profession, and this will only compound the situation.\n\nThe McKinsey 2021 Future of Work in Nursing Survey found that one-fifth of Australia’s registered nurses say they intend to leave their current role in the next 12 months. Forty-one percent of these nurses say they are planning to move countries or leave direct-care roles entirely (Exhibit 1). By 2025, anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 nursing positions could be left unfilled. An earlier McKinsey global survey of nurses in Australia, Brazil, France, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States found similar results.\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nSurveyed nurses cited a desire to seek higher pay as the number-one reason driving them to leave the profession. However, having a positive work environment—caring teammates, a safe space, and a sense of purpose—is important to nurses who said they want to stay. The same was true in the global survey. The 2021 survey also found that Australian aged-care nurses are more likely to be ambivalent about remaining at their jobs compared with non–aged care nurses, suggesting the former segment of the workforce is even more at risk.\n\nMitigating the risk of severe nursing workforce shortages requires a comprehensive approach. The challenges revealed by this survey are complex and resolving them will require time and sustained efforts. We encourage governments, industry groups, and employers to deploy a three-pronged strategy—build, excite, and utilise—to begin to address the challenge.\n\nBuild. Building up the workforce can create a positive feedback loop, because increased staffing levels facilitate retention practices. A comprehensive, long-term effort to redesign the training pipeline could attract greater numbers of potential nurses to Australia and the sector. To facilitate employment, providers and industry groups could also work together to further streamline and digitalise recruitment.\n\nExcite. Retention is the most powerful lever to address the short-term supply gap. However, merely offering competitive compensation won’t be enough. To excite and better engage nurses, stakeholders need to work together to pilot practices to increase nurses’ autonomy, recognise them more effectively, and build goodwill (Exhibit 2). Offering opportunities to provide virtual care through increased roster and location flexibility may also be attractive.\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nUtilise. Employers need to consider the composition and capabilities of care teams to better utilise existing skill sets and qualifications. Tasks could be redistributed to nursing-support workers when appropriate to ensure nurses can work nearer to the top of their practice scopes. Additionally, to attract nursing staff and provide rostering flexibility, employers, the health industry, and governments need to foster better ways of working—an approach that became more common during the pandemic.",
    "Will Australia Go Into Recession?": "Everywhere across the world, recession warnings abound. In just the last week, the World Bank has warned of “devastating” consequences “as more countries fall into recession,” and transport business FedEx slashed its forecasts for growth, with the CEO saying he sees the start of a global recession.\n\nIn the US, the central bank has indicated it prioritises fighting inflation over maintaining growth. That suggests the US Federal Reserve will lift official interest rates high enough to cause a recession if required to bring inflation down from its current record highs.\n\nThe US bond market is flashing one of the clearest warning signs of a recession. Yields on two-year bonds are higher than yields on 10-year bonds, when in usual times they would be lower. That indicates the market expects the longer-term to be safer than the shorter term and implies the short-term will include a recession. The phenomenon is known as an “inverted yield curve”.\n\nChina has been pursuing a zero-covid strategy that has strangled its economy, and at the same time is trying to recover from damaging financial excesses by its property developers.\n\nIn this increasingly integrated global economy, is there any way Australia can dodge a recession? Prior to 2020, Australia went 30 years without a recession. Could we really have two in three years?\n\nIf you look at the ANZ Roy Morgan consumer confidence data, you could barely conclude otherwise. People’s confidence in the economy this time next year is low. We are gloomy about the outlook—as gloomy as in 2020 when vaccines were yet to be developed and the shock of the virus was still new\n\nGloom is justified from one perspective: The RBA is working very hard to cool economic growth. It has lifted interest rates extremely swiftly, from 0.1% to 2.35% in a three-month span. It is expected to lift them more.\n\nRate hikes work to slow the economy down, and tackle inflation, in multiple ways:\n\nHouseholds pay more on their mortgage, leaving less for discretionary spending.\n\nThe Australian dollar appreciates, making imports cheaper and discouraging people from buying local.\n\nThe return to saving is higher, encouraging people to save not spend.\n\nThe cost of borrowing is high, making businesses less likely to borrow and spend.\n\nHow does a slower economy reduce inflation? The rate hikes are designed to divert money from spending at local businesses, making those businesses feel they can’t raise prices and wages. The RBA’s job is to keep inflation between 2 to 3% each year on average, and right now inflation is far above that target, as the next chart shows.\n\nAustralia’s yield curve is not inverted, unlike America’s. That is a sign the bond market has confidence the RBA will not push things too hard and inadvertently crush the economy.\n\nBut the World Bank is less confident central banks know what they are doing. Usually when a central bank tightens monetary policy, it is reacting to local conditions and acting more or less alone. But this time there is “synchronicity,” the World Bank warns. Every central bank is doing the same thing at once, as the next chart shows, and that might mean each actor needs to do less than they think.\n\nHere is the World Bank’s Acting Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions, Ayhan Kose: “Recent tightening of monetary and fiscal policies … could be mutually compounding in tightening financial conditions and steepening the global growth slowdown.”\n\nThe market expects the RBA may overshoot its target and reverse interest rate hikes. It is pricing in a 50% chance of a rate cut in 2023. Commonwealth bank has a bolder prediction: two rate cuts (each 25 basis points) in late 2023 as the RBA realises its work is well and truly done.\n\nWatching the Data\n\nThe RBA has said it will watch the data to see how many more rate hikes are needed to cool down inflation without crushing the economy. The problem is most data refers to periods some months ago, before the rate hikes gained much traction. It takes a while for interest rates to take effect—some 18 months, according to monetary policy researchers. That means the full effect of actions already taken cannot be known before decisions have to be made about the next action to take. This is why the RBA boss describes his task as being “clouded in uncertainty”.\n\nIn such a situation, “leading indicators”: become very useful. Of course, statisticians can only tell us about the past, but at least they can measure how people were planning for the future at that time.\n\nOne example of a leading indicator is job advertisements. By looking at the strength of job ads we can find hints about the future strength of the labour market. What we see in job ads is that while hiring is still strong, it has ceased getting stronger. Meanwhile, the OECD composite leading indicator is falling.\n\nSuch indicators imply the odds of a recession in Australia are higher now than they were before inflation forced the RBA’s hand. But would it be that bad?\n\nOne hope is that if we do have a recession it is merely a “technical recession.”\n\nExpect the technical versus actual recession debate to be had in a number of countries. In Australia there is a good chance we will also register a technical recession early 2023, but with unemployment unlikely to rise much, it will feel more like a soft landing than a recession — Warren Hogan (@_warrenhogan) July 27, 2022\n\nThe standard definition for a recession is two consecutive three-month periods where output shrinks – i.e. two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\n\nBut that doesn’t always mean heavy pain. If unemployment doesn’t surge, and if we recover quickly afterward, Australia could get back to the sweet spot: low unemployment, strong growth, and inflation under control.\n\n",
    "Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing": "Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says.\n\nThe country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export.\n\n“We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.”\n\nRenate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms.\n\n“You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.”\n\nThe Covid pandemic helped spur demands for more local manufacturing capability when Australia struggled to secure supplies of vaccines and medical equipment.\n\nOngoing supply chain disruptions, particularly as China maintains its Covid-zero policies, have given added impetus to calls for more domestic production capability.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand buy most of our consumables from overseas, particuarly China. And China is the dominant world supplier for many of our key imports.

To achieve that, we will need to produce much more solar capacity on shore as well as having a diversity in our international supply chains.”\n\nThe present trade tensions between Australia and China exacerbated “the potential threat to supply restrictions or sudden price changes”, the APVI paper said.\n\n“Adding to this risk is the growing concern over the possible use of forced labour in parts of China, where much of the silicon, wafers and steel used in PV components are produced,” it said.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The country wouldn’t need to make all of the components in modules but could specialise.\n\nLocal firms could make glass, aluminium frames, polymers or the electronics such as inverters, while leaving production of polysilicon – a key raw material – to others.\n\n“I think it’s at the top end of silicon refining and then module assembly,” Egan said. “We need to be making some smart decisions and deploying at scale.”\n\nThe paper cited existing suppliers including Selectronic – one of the world’s oldest makers of inverters.\n\nSunDrive is a firm considering commercial-size silicon-based solar cell fabrication in Australia, while 5B is aiming at fast low-cost PV deployment to supply some of the multi-gigawatt-sized solar farms planned for northern Australia.\n\n“To succeed on a global scale, these emerging companies would benefit from market certainty and a coordinated effort to reach scale,” the paper said.\n\nCustomers could include Sun Cable, a venture supported by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, that aims to build a 12,000-hectare solar precinct in the Northern Territory with 17-20GW capacity and 36-42GW-hours of energy storage.\n\nForrest’s Fortescue group said last week it was planning 2-3GW of renewable energy using solar and wind plants between 2024-28. It was also working to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the global supply of decarbonisation technologies and was building the world’s largest electrolyser facility for the production of hydrogen in Gladstone as part of that effort.",
    "Australia’s growth revised lower, but AAA rating steady": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the global economy was in a “difficult and dangerous place” – with slowing global growth, rampant inflation, falling real wages, and extreme uncertainty.\n\n“These challenges are intensifying, not dissipating, and Australia is not spared from this darker and more dangerous global outlook,” he said.\n\nThe largest downgrades were in the Eurozone, with a recession now on the cards in Russian gas-reliant Germany. The US is expected to eke out 0.5 per cent growth next year, while the United Kingdom will stall or contract.\n\n“Australia [has] somewhat stronger growth momentum currently than Europe and the United States,” the OECD said. “But that is projected to wane over the coming quarters, in part due to softer external demand.”\n\nRatings agency S & P also revised down its 2023 Australian economic outlook on Monday, slashing expected growth in gross domestic product by a full 1 percentage point to 1.8 per cent for the year due to a sharp upward revision in the outlook for the official interest rate to 3.1 per cent by year’s end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony Walker, director of sovereign ratings at S & P, said higher interest rates would “narrow” Australia’s servicing costs headroom within the AAA rating band, but despite some headwinds there was plenty of wiggle room.\n\n“Which means that we don’t expect the rating to change at this point,” Mr Walker said, adding the next major trigger point for Australia rating would be Labor’s first federal budget next month.\n\nHSBC Australian chief economist Paul Bloxham said while there were headwinds, Australia would likely avoid a recession.\n\n“Australia’s economy is doing well,” Mr Bloxham said. “Spending is strong, the unemployment rate remains low and the labour market is strong.\n\nThe OECD called for “short-term fiscal support” to cushion the most vulnerable households being hit by high-energy prices, but warned against moves that could put upward pressure on inflation.\n\nDr Chalmers said next month’s budget would be about providing cost-of-living relief without spurring inflation and forcing interest rates even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with the Coalition’s temporary $6 billion halving of the fuel tax set to expire on Wednesday night, the Treasurer pushed back against calls for the relief to be extended for a further three months at a cost of $3 billion.\n\nAfter slumping about 20 per cent from July peaks, the national average petrol price edged 10.4¢ higher last week to $1.73 a litre, the largest lift in more than 18 weeks after hitting a nine-month low the week before.\n\nThe removal of the fuel tax cut will add about 22¢ a litre at the bowser.\n\nBut fears of a global downturn pushed global oil prices down recently, which will help offset the hit to household budgets. Brent crude fell by $US4.31 ($6.6) or 4.8 per cent to $US86.15 a barrel on Friday",
    "The safeguard mechanism: Australia’s emissions trading scheme in all but name": "Climate policy can sometimes seem like it is being spoken in a different language. Take the issue of the moment in Australia: the safeguard mechanism.\n\nFor people deeply embedded in the mechanics of how governments plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the safeguard mechanism has become a reasonably familiar subject since it was introduced by the Coalition six years ago – even though the Morrison government and its predecessors didn’t like to talk about it much.\n\nIts relevance increased significantly in May, when the Albanese government was elected promising to make it a centrepiece of its pledge to ramp up climate action. But I suspect for most people, even those paying regular attention, the details are hazy.\n\nFrom the time it was created under then prime minister Tony Abbott, the story of the safeguard has been one of obfuscation and marketing.\n\nIts awkward name is a relic from the era when Abbott and his environment minister, Greg Hunt, were pledging “direct action” on climate change. Their promise was that farmers and businesses would be paid by the government to store carbon dioxide, mostly in vegetation and soil. The cash would be drawn from an emissions reduction fund, then worth $2.5bn.\n\nThe safeguard mechanism was meant to stop pollution at industrial sites from increasing and cancelling out any cuts paid for through the fund. It set a baseline – a limit – on the biggest 215 polluting facilities based on their historic emissions. The idea was the limits would safeguard the reductions bought by the government.\n\nPolluters that emitted more than their baseline would have to pay, either by buying carbon offsets or facing a fine. Hunt’s plan was that this would eventually evolve into an emissions trading scheme. Polluters that emitted below their limits would earn carbon credits and could sell them to companies that pumped out more than their limit, creating an incentive to act.\n\nIn 2015, Hunt declared the safeguard would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. But his Coalition colleagues didn’t agree, and the evolution never happened. Instead, companies were often allowed to increase emissions without penalty. RepuTex, the firm that modelled Labor’s climate policies, found industrial emissions under the safeguard jumped 7% under the Coalition. Which, not unreasonably, led industry leaders and climate activists to wonder what the point was.\n\nLabor decided there could be a point, and last year promised to transform the safeguard mechanism into something that actually cut pollution. The ALP didn’t necessarily believe the safeguard mechanism was the best possible policy. It made a political decision about how it could minimise the chance of a dishonest scare campaign over climate before the election, and give it something to work with if it won. So it adopted a suggestion by the Business Council of Australia that it should take the failing Coalition policy – an emissions trading scheme in all but name – and make it functional.\n\nAchieving that will likely mean withstanding the sort of rent-seeking claims by industry that hindered Labor’s development of carbon pricing systems more than a decade ago.\n\nThe good news is the world has moved significantly since then. A majority of industrial polluters now have commitments to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Are they going to argue they need handouts or carve outs to protect them change they have already promised? Almost certainly, but it will be a harder case to make.\n\nThe climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has set a short deadline to revamp the scheme, promising a new model will be in place by July. Submissions to the government from experts and interest groups are rolling in, and setting out a long list of difficult issues to unpick. But a few stand out.\n\nThe government says it expects emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism to be reduced by between 3.5% and 6% a year by gradually reducing baselines. A major question will be who carries this load, and who doesn’t.\n\nThe Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents funds that manage more than $3tn, is one of several groups arguing that the cost will be higher on everyone else if unsustainable industries that will inevitably shrink in a net zero economy – coal and gas mining and production – are protected from short-term action on the grounds they compete in overseas markets.\n\nThey say assistance should be mostly limited to industries that have a future - renewable energy, critical minerals and green steel, hydrogen and aluminium – and designed to drive transformational change that starts now, rather than delays it.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will Labor’s changes guarantee that industrial emissions start to come down?\n\nThe government appears to favour a design that sets a limit for polluting facilities based not on their absolute emissions, but their emissions intensity – that is, how much they emit per unit of production. At first blush, this sounds a bizarre step, given it could lead to companies that expand operations increasing their emissions even if they become more efficient. But there are arguments for it.\n\nMany companies have had baselines set well above what they actually emit. Resetting baselines based on emissions intensity could be a relatively simple way to remove this “headroom” and ensure limits are real before a path is set to reduce them to zero. An emissions intensity baselines also mean companies are not rewarded if pollution falls due to a slump in production. Instead, they would have to make genuine changes in how they operate to stay within their limits.\n\nThe downside is that it could still lead to emissions increases in the short-term. The Australian Conservation Foundation argues a way around this would be to set two baselines for each facility – one based on emissions intensity and the other absolute emissions – and require companies to meet whichever was lower or pay for their excess pollution.\n\nA third substantial issue is what to do about new coal and gas developments. There are several fossil fuel proposals in the pipeline, and Labor has rejected calls for a moratorium. An alternative put forward by some groups would be to set sector-wide emissions limits that are reduced over time so that any new project would have to fit into a declining industry total, not add to it. Otherwise, hopes of meeting emissions targets could quickly evaporate.\n\nManaging these and other thorny questions about the safeguard’s design – including the extent to which companies should be allowed to rely on carbon credits, rather than cut pollution onsite – will be politically challenging.\n\nThe ultimate test, though, will be whether the final model is robust enough to help Australia play its part in meeting the goal that Bowen stressed in a speech in the US on Friday - limiting the rise in global heating since pre-industrial times to as close to 1.5C as possible.\n\nThat will require it to be able to be ratcheted up to deliver faster cuts in emissions than currently proposed. We will get a sense pretty soon whether it is up to the task.",

    "What global technology trends will bring for EVs in Australia": "Australia finds itself in a unique position when it comes to EV policy, infrastructure and uptake.\n\nAs other countries are ahead in this journey, we have the opportunity to learn from the successes and failures of others. And while policy may be one of the most critical elements to ensuring the success of the transition to EVs, innovation and technology are equally important.\n\nIf we take a step back and look for cues in other markets, there are four global technology trends that will play a role in Australia’s EV future.\n\nSmart charging\n\nSmart charging is an intelligent form of EV charging which optimises energy consumption. By enabling communication between a vehicle and the grid, charging can be automated to capitalise on cheaper electricity tariffs. It can also be used to restrict charging to minimise stress on the grid.\n\nIn Europe, high energy prices have seen smart charging technology grow rapidly. Ohme is a UK company, which has taken smart charging one step further, offering the option to charge when renewable energy generation on the grid is at its highest – helping to lower CO2 impact.\n\nIn Australia, companies including AGL and Origin are progressing at pace. In March AGL installed 200 EV smart chargers in homes as part of a trial. And more recently, Origin agreed to supply 100 per cent renewable power for an ARENA-funded project triallling on-street chargers for homes without parking facilities.\n\nAs more EVs connect to the grid, the domestic need for this technology is expected to grow. And over time it will become the standard charging technology for homes and businesses.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nBeyond self-driving vehicles, EV companies and manufacturers are still looking for ways to use AI effectively, but early research points to applications which may prove useful here.\n\nResearch by US company Volta is using machine learning to identify the optimal locations to place charging stations. The technology analyses data including EV adoption rates in areas, demand and expected utilisation. It also analyses demographics to predict infrastructure needs.\n\nResearchers from Idaho National Laboratory are using machine learning to reduce electric vehicle charging times. The scientists have discovered how to create new charging protocols which allow lithium-ion batteries to be charged to 90 per cent within ten minutes. These intelligent technologies will become increasingly important as the Australian Government rolls out its first National Electric Vehicle Strategy.\n\nHome and business integration\n\nAs more EVs come online in Australia, both homes and businesses – especially those that provide public charging stations – will see an increase in demand for electricity. This will require the integration of renewable energy to minimise energy costs and CO2 emissions, as well as increase energy supply.\n\nIntegrating solar panels into charge point power supply is one option. Another approach is to integrate battery storage.\n\nWe are likely to see both rolled out in Australia. In the US, EVgo is an early adopter of using batteries and smart energy management to provide a stable EV charging service. Power is fed into the batteries from the grid off peak, or from onsite renewables, and then released to charge EVs during peak times.\n\nCompanies in Australia are making moves in this space. For example. Chargefox’s ultra-rapid sites are backed by 100 per cent green power, which is also catering to an increasing demand from EV owners to reduce their emissions footprint. In many instances, they also add solar and batteries on site to enable charging via solar energy.\n\nIntegration makes clear business sense for Australian homes and companies and expectations among consumers to charge their vehicles using clean energy are expected to rise.\n\nBattery and vehicle design\n\nLithium-ion batteries are not ultra-efficient and research is underway to find better ways to power EVs. Cell-to-pack batteries are an innovation we can expect to hear more about.\n\nCell-to-pack refers to the direct integration of cells into a battery pack. Instead of flat packs of battery modules laying across the base of a car’s chassis, they can instead be integrated into it.\n\nThis design decreases the weight of the vehicle and can increase cabin space. The upside is quicker and less frequent charging and an increased driving range.\n\nChinese battery company CATL claims its latest iteration of this tech can deliver 13 per cent more power than Tesla’s latest cells. Leapmotor has developed a cell-to-chassis (CTC) battery technology. The CTC tech uses the car’s underbody as a battery box and then integrates the cells into the vehicle’s frame.\n\nSolid state batteries are another innovation close to being market ready. With the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of EV battiers up to 39 per cent, they are expected to be in production from 2025 with OEM testing imminent.\n\nAn eye in the future\n\nAustralia is only on the cusp of starting its EV journey. Policy and EV supply are two barriers which need to be addressed first, but by keeping an eye on innovation around the globe, we can work towards a smart transition.\n\nPaul Sinclair is Telematics Solutions Advisor at RACV’s mobility technology company, Intelematics.",

    "Australia defeat Serbian rivals": "The Seven Consulting Opals have recorded back-to-back victories with a strong defensive performance over a tough Serbian side.\n\nA pumped-up Australian side displayed some of their best basketball of the tournament in front of 9,329 vocal fans at Sydney SuperDome, to take a reassuring 69-54 win over Serbia.\n\nAustralia’s Bec Allen led the way with a player of the match performance posting 16 points, five rebounds, two steals and two huge blocks. Marianna Tolo started her first game of the tournament to finish with 12 points. Serbia’s Yvonne Anderson was on fire in the first half with 14 points, finishing with 16 and seven rebounds, six assists and two steals.\n\nIn the first half, Australia showed grit and intent, forcing Serbia into six-shot clock violations and found their flow at both ends of the floor.\n\nAs the Australians continued to limit Anderson’s attempts, Serbia struggled to score throughout the second half under the smothering defence.\n\nThe Seven Consulting Opals finished with four players in double digits; Lauren Jackson not far behind on nine points. In the final minutes of the game, Allen left the court with injury in the only blow to an impressive Seven Consulting Opals outing.\n\nSteph Talbot was pleased to see Australia take a win over the strong Serbian side, having gone down to them in the February Qualifying Tournament.\n\n“I think we came out and wanted to make a stance on how we want to play and how we want to play the rest of this tournament”, said Talbot. “We did that in the first half where they had a handful of 24-second shot clock violations and that’s how we want to play. We need to take that forward into the next game.”\n\nSeven Consulting Opals’ Head Coach Sandy Brondello praised Talbot for leading the team defensively.\n\n“Steph did a really good job on Anderson,” said Brondello. “It’s good that she stayed on court today. She is one of the best defenders no matter where she plays. She is our defensive anchor, and it really starts with her and her energy. Serbia has a good team and holding them to 54 points is a good effort.”\n\nDisappointed about Allen’s potential rib injury, Brondello added: “I think she got crushed and got hit, it would be really unfortunate if she doesn’t play.”\n\nSerbian Head Coach Marina Maljkovic knows her side has more work to do to go further into the tournament.\n\n“We had some very nice moments coming from our young and experienced players, but we also had a lot of mistakes,” said Maljkovic. “We have yet to reach the point where we play for 40 minutes, and we must do that in the next two games. We will do the best we can. In this type of tournament, you must think from game to game.”\n\nMaljkovic also noted the impact of the intense schedule on all players at the tournament.\n\n“The schedule this year is very complicated,” Maljkovic noted. “The quality is great basketball, that’s why I feel sad. That we can’t see players at their best at the moment because of a very tight schedule.”\n\nSTATISTICS:\n\nAUSTRALIA SERBIA 1st quarter 18 10 2nd quarter 36 28 3rd quarter 53 43 Full time 69 54\n\nAUSTRALIA:\n\nPlayer Pts Reb Ast Stl Bec ALLEN 16 5 2 2 Marianna TOLO 12 2 5 3 Steph TALBOT 10 6 2 2\n\nSERBIA:",

    "Building up Australia’s vaccine manufacturing capacity": "Onshore manufacturing has an obvious advantage during a pandemic, as importing products from international manufacturers can face competition from other countries. This was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Australia falling far behind​ other developed countries in vaccination campaigns and struggling to receive vaccines from abroad.​\n\nBy 2030, Australia wants to be in a position where it has onshore vaccine manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure for clinical trials across a diverse range of vaccine technologies: with the infrastructure designed to be ready to pivot swiftly towards large-scale pandemic manufacturing if required.\n\nRecent investments\n\nAustralia does possess inactivated virus and live attenuated virus manufacturing capacity through Melbourne-headquartered CSL.\n\nOnshore manufacturing is currently heavily complemented by partnerships with international vaccine manufacturers to secure supply of vaccines, including Pfizer and Moderna. Australia also has a range of research institutes and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) that further develop candidates for manufacture at a scale to support clinical trials.\n\nBut scaling up to pandemic-scale infrastructure comes with its challenges: the long lead times in developing infrastructure, skills and processes; ongoing investment to maintain supply chains and keep facilities ‘warm’; and an appropriately trained workforce.\n\nRecent investments have been starting to boost onshore manufacturing capacity: such as Moderna's decision to build a mRNA facility​​ in the country and Seqiris / CSL's investment in a cell-based influenza manufacturing facility.​​\n\nA new report from CSIRO, Australia's National Science Agency, sets out two key recommendations: to diversify onshore manufacturing capabilities across vaccine types; and secondly to boost clinical trial scale manufacturing to create a pandemic-ready infrastructure.\n\nDiversifying vaccine types\n\nThe report, 'Strengthening Australia's Pandemic Preparedness', recommends diversifying manufacturing capabilities across vaccine types, including recombinant protein and viral vector technologies.\n\n“Australia’s population scale manufacturing capabilities are limited to live attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines technologies,\"​ notes the report.\n\n\"These technologies are likely to continue to play a role in global vaccine products and be supported by planned mRNA manufacturing capacity. ​\n\n“However, other vaccine technologies may be the most effective at responding to Disease X.\"​\n\nDiversifying onshore manufacturing to include additional vaccine technologies, therefore, could help prepare for the next pandemic.\n\n\"Based on Australia’s established population scale manufacturing capabilities, planned mRNA manufacturing capabilities, and technologies that are not currently commercial (i.e., DNA and self-amplifying RNA), recombinant proteins and viral vector technologies should be prioritized for future investments.​\n\n“Manufacture of recombinant proteins and viral vector technologies have varied inputs, scale of production and required infrastructure. Recombinant proteins are often complex products as they require mass purification of intermediatory products and often require an adjuvant (a substance that enhances the immune response) to be developed. Conversely, there are more than 10 different vectors that can be used in viral vector technologies and therefore infrastructure requirements vary. ​\n\n\"While it is unlikely Australia will be able to produce multiple additional vaccine technologies at population scale without significant government investment, Australia could export vaccine components across a variety of vaccine technologies if the nation diversifies its small-scale manufacturing capabilities. ​\n\n\"For example, there is potential between pandemics for Australia to value-add by exporting drug substances for fill and finish to be conducted offshore for international markets. Leveraging offshore markets can support scale-up between pandemics; however, this will carry a risk for securing supply in a pandemic.”​\n\nBuild up CDMO capacity\n\nThe second key recommendation is to expand the number of contract development and manufacturing facilities to support Phase I to III trials for vaccines.\n\nAt the moment, fewer and fewer late stage clinical trials remain in Australia and intellectual property value is lost offshore due to high input costs and a comparatively small population to support trial patient enrolments.\n\nAustralia also faces barriers to onshore manufacturing at population scale due to high input costs and limited export opportunities, as the surrounding region is well serviced by existing manufacturers.\n\n“Increasing the number and breadth of CDMO facilities, including in technologies where Australia does not have established population scale manufacturing, can attract and offer flexibility to companies looking to bring emerging vaccine technologies to market,\" ​notes the report.\n\n“Access to versatile CDMO infrastructure can reduce the timelines and cost to vaccine developers, as it reduces financial risk until the vaccine is shown to be effective in late-stage clinical trials. ​\n\n“Existing Australian CDMOs have competing commercial pressures in a pandemic and are unlikely to be suitably reliable for national needs. Further, it is not feasible for government to provide ongoing financial support for new CDMO facilities across all available vaccine technologies, particularly between pandemics. ​\n\n\"Public‑private partnerships provide an alternative to the status quo in Australia. A public-private model would assist with securing the supply of vaccines in a pandemic as multiple facilities would have existing partnerships with government. ​\n\n“Such CDMO facilities could service Phase I to III clinical trials and small end commercial manufacture (e.g., cancer vaccines or vaccines for small scale infectious disease outbreaks) with batch sizes in the low millions.\"​\n\nOne such example of this is a 2013 capital investment from the Federal and Queensland Governments to set up a new mammalian cell culture facility. This investment attracted international manufacturer Patheon, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, to develop a CDMO business at this facility in Brisbane. The site specializes in good manufacturing practice (GMP) for clinical (Phase I to III) and small-scale commercial manufacturing and is co-located with the Translational Research Institute. The facility collaborates with domestic universities on development of mammalian cell lines and has grown local advanced manufacturing jobs.\n\nReady to scale up\n\nSuch facilities should target commercial opportunities, particularly in between pandemics, to keep infrastructure ‘warm’ and pivot capacity to respond to a pandemic.\n\n\"The scale of production (i.e., the size of the bioreactor) for clinical trials varies across vaccine technologies. For example, a 50-litre bioreactor can produce millions of doses of a mRNA vaccine, but a recombinant protein would need a much larger production scale. Greater analysis is required to determine the ideal scale of these CDMO facilities and which vaccines technologies initial facilities should focus on.​\n\n“As the number and scale of manufacture of CDMO facilities increases, opportunities to attract international companies will also increase. This will be enabled by proven process validation at a facility and gaining international regulators’ approval for safety by meeting stringent current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. Engagement with international companies can improve knowledge and expertise in delivering commercially ready manufacturing services.”​",
    "Could a politician from Australia help usher in the far right in Italy?": "There’s an election in Australia this Sunday and a small, yet passionate, group of voters across the country could determine who leads Italy. The Italian parliament has four overseas electorates, one of which is the vast Africa-Asia-Oceania-Antarctica (AAOA), home to some 250,000 voters who hold Italian passports. Australia is within its borders.\n\nItalian electoral candidates have spent the past six weeks in Australia discussing healthcare, strong borders and the importance of cultural exchanges between the two countries, in an effort to win the votes of Italian-Australians.\n\nVoting is not compulsory – at the last election only 30% of the roughly 140,000 eligible Australian residents sent in their ballot papers.\n\nBut this time round, things are different.\n\nSunday’s election is expected to usher Italy’s far-right coalition, led by the Brothers of Italy party, into government.\n\nThe AAOA has been held by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) since its creation in 2006. But this year the Brothers of Italy’s candidate, Joe Cossari, is hoping support for the rightwing party at home will spread to Australia.\n\nBrothers of Italy espouses traditional family values, has roots in neofascism and last week was forced to oust a candidate for praising Hitler.\n\nThe party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, is only 45. If it wins, Meloni would be Italy’s first female leader and its first far-right leader since the second world war.\n\n“It is certain that Giorgia will win,” Cossari told Guardian Australia. “She’ll be the first female PM in Italy since the inception of the republic, which is good. Some people say, ‘oh a woman’ but everyone needs a say, ‘we need a change’.”\n\nBrothers of Italy candidate Joe Cossari is hoping to win the vast Africa-Asia-Oceania-Antarctica electorate. Photograph: Joe Cossari\n\nOn Thursday, as the deadline for postal votes was coming to a close, 75-year-old Cossari was in his back yard in Melbourne, tending to his fig trees. He has been the mayor of Knox city council and is a well-known figure in the city’s Italian-Australian community. He has stood as a candidate for the AAOA several times for different parties.\n\nHe shrugged off the suggestion the Brothers of Italy supports fascism and said Meloni did the right thing by booting out a pro-Hitler candidate.\n\n“We get nutters all over the place, don’t we?” he said. “You have to face the reality of the situation. I wouldn’t praise Adolf.”\n\nIf elected, Cossari said his priorities would be facilitating a closer relationship between the two countries and helping Italy enact a border protection policy that mirrors Australia’s.\n\n“I say to my fellow Italians, ‘you come into Australia, at customs they want to know who you spoke to, what you did, what you had for breakfast – and after the interrogation, they say ‘have a good day’,” he said. “That’s democracy.”\n\nWhen the votes are counted on Monday evening Australia time, Cossari will likely be asleep but he has friends who will be acting as election scrutineers in Naples.\n\n“I’m reasonably confident,” he said. “I’m calm, cool, collected and watching my fig trees.”\n\nThe overseas electorates have previously played a key role in the formation of Italian governments, most notably in 2006 when they provided the centre-left coalition with a slim majority.\n\n“Should the election not produce a very clear outcome, or Meloni’s coalition collapses, the handful of MPs from overseas could become crucial, if there was a situation where just a few seats were in play,” Swinburne University politics expert Dr Simone Battiston said.\n\nBattiston said Cossari is the only far-right politician in with a chance, but that the electorate favours candidates from the centre left.\n\n“The Democratic party is more entrenched in the Italian-Australian community and the incumbents, they seem to represent the broad church,” Battiston said.\n\n‘The handful of MPs from overseas could become crucial,’ says Simone Battiston, a senior lecturer at Swinburne University. Photograph: Simone Battiston\n\nDario Nelli, the managing editor of Australian Italian-language publication Il Globo, has followed every election in the AAOA closely. He said interest has gradually dropped off but many in the community think it’s still important to have the right to vote.\n\n“The first campaign had huge interest,” Nelli said. “Now it’s become something like a routine.”\n\nNelli has watched the candidates perform over the past six weeks, even hosting the official debate. He says the big issues are universal healthcare, teaching Italian abroad and economic ties between the two countries.\n\nThe incumbent senator for the PD, 64-year-old Francesco Giacobbe, has been in parliament for two terms and is seeking his third.\n\nHe spends about 41 weeks of the year in Rome and the rest visiting his constituents across the AAOA. When he can, he flies home to Sydney to see his wife, children and two new grandchildren.\n\n“My wife should be given an award for coping with me,” Giacobbe said.\n\nFrancesco Giacobbe, seen with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, is seeking a third term in Italy’s parliament. Photograph: Francesco Giacobbe\n\nGiacobbe has spent the past six weeks flying around the country, campaigning in Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nThe former accountant said the Italian government “is strong enough to withstand” fascist forces.\n\n“I’m not worried about the fascists. I think the democracy is mature enough to withstand that threat,” he said. “But it’s the risk of Italy becoming an isolated country closed in on itself that scares me.”"
