    "Italy election results set up first far-right government since Mussolini": "Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nROME — Italian voters shattered several precedents Sunday, backing parties that are now set to form the country’s farthest-right government since the fall of Mussolini, led by its first female prime minister. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight A near-complete tally of votes showed a clear victory for a coalition that includes two far-right forces, including the Fratelli d’Italia party of Giorgia Meloni, a once-marginal figure who vows to defend “traditional” social values, close off pathways to undocumented immigrants and push back against the “obscure bureaucrats” of Brussels.\n\nThe outcome jibed with predictions throughout the month, which suggested that the right would sail to victory — mainly because its parties are unified as a coalition while the left is not.\n\nMeloni’s opponents warn that her rise could turn into an epochal event in European politics, pushing Italy into an illiberal bloc with Poland and Hungary, and causing tensions that cut through the heart of the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, Meloni posted on Facebook that Italians had entrusted her with an “important responsibility.”\n\n“Now it will be our task not to disappoint them,” she wrote.\n\nIt’s easier to gain power in Italy than to stay on long enough to change it. The typical government lasts no more than 400 days. Political zigzags are the norm. If confirmed as prime minister, Meloni would face immediate tests at home and in Europe, given fatigue over soaring energy prices and divisions within her own coalition on Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe vote Sunday only fills the seats of Parliament; the prime minister will be chosen later, indirectly. But because Fratelli d’Italia appears to have emerged with the most votes of any party in the fragmented system, it gives Meloni — a 45-year-old Roman who quotes pop songs and delights in bashing the “woke” left — the best shot at receiving the mandate from Italy’s president to form a government. That process figures to take at least a month.\n\n“Fratelli d’Italia is now the dominant party of the coalition,” said Gianfranco Pasquino, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Bologna.\n\nIf Meloni indeed becomes prime minister, she’ll gain a level of power that has, so far, been out of reach for comparable figures in Europe’s major economic powers like France and Germany. Her ascent comes just after Swedish voters delivered a narrow majority to a group of right-wing parties, including one with a neo-fascist past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her decade as leader of Fratelli d’Italia — Brothers of Italy — Meloni has espoused some extreme positions. She has advocated for the dissolution of the euro zone. She has warned, conspiratorially, that unnamed forces are guiding immigrants en masse to Italy in the name of “ethnic substitution.”\n\nBut she has clearly tacked toward the center on some issues as her party has widened its support. She says Italy belongs in Europe but will fight for its interests. She promises to maintain Italy’s Atlantic alliances and says the country won’t take an authoritarian turn. In an interview with The Washington Post this month, she also pledged financial stability and said “people abroad” would see her government’s seriousness “once we’ll present our first budget law.”\n\nHer party’s rise is the culmination of a decades-long process of image rehabilitation — and moderation — of a political wing started by Mussolini loyalists soon after World War II. Fratelli d’Italia is a descendant of an earlier, more extreme post-fascist party. Meloni has said that the Italian right long ago handed fascism “to history,” but her opponents say that her party still includes some fascist sympathizers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nItaly’s right-wing parties, in banding together, gave themselves an overwhelming electoral advantage over the fragmented left, which failed, amid infighting, to create a comparable coalition. The right-wing coalition secured around 44 percent of the overall vote, with Fratelli d’Italia receiving support from around one-quarter of all voters. Given Italy’s complex system for filling seats — a mix of proportional and first-past-the-post calculations — that would be enough to give the right a solid majority in both houses of Parliament.\n\nTo the extent there were any surprises, it came from the vaguely anti-establishment Five Star Movement, whose support rate climbed into the midteens as it defended its signature welfare program — which Meloni wants to cut.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the leader of Italy’s left-center party, Enrico Letta, argued that if Italians handed power to the right, they would be doing a favor for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has tried increasingly to sow strife in Europe — primarily by withholding energy exports — as his invasion of Ukraine has faltered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebora Serracchiani, a senior member of the center-left Democratic Party, said the hard right’s apparent victory in the election Sunday was “a sad day for the country.” Her party now has a “big responsibility” in opposition, she added.\n\nThough Meloni has consistently backed Ukraine, other figures in her coalition have shown affection for Putin. Matteo Salvini has worn a shirt with Putin’s face on it and in 2017 signed a cooperation deal with the ruling United Russia party; he recently questioned the effectiveness of sanctions. Silvio Berlusconi once gifted Putin a duvet cover of the two men shaking hands, and days ago he suggested, falsely, that Putin was merely responding to the popular will of his people when he invaded, and intended to replace the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky with “decent people.”\n\nBut there was further potential blessing for Meloni in the vote outcome Sunday: Salvini’s League fared so poorly that analysts quickly speculated that the party might replace him as leader. That would reduce the odds for strife in Meloni’s coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are reasons, beyond Russia, that Europe is on edge about the prospect of a right-governed Italy.\n\nWithin Meloni’s party there’s a deeply held sentiment that European integration should be limited, and that nations should be able to define themselves rather than taking directives from Brussels. That could in theory spark Italy to play a more obstructionist role on key issues such as migration or foreign affairs.\n\nAny differences would be jarring because, for the last year-and-a-half, Italy has been led by Mario Draghi, a former central banker who helped save the euro zone from crisis a decade ago and has a sterling reputation in Brussels.\n\n“It will be the first time that one of the big E.U. countries is under the mold of somebody who is not pro-Europe,” Letta told The Post.\n\nOn Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe has the “tools” to contend with Italy if things go in a “difficult manner,” in an apparent reference to the proposed fund cuts aimed at Hungary over corruption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeloni would face natural constraints in Europe, given that many of the wealthy right-wing business interests in Italy prefer a stable relationship with Brussels. Mountainous national debt means any government, with missteps that scare investors, could edge toward a financial crisis. That would make for high incentive for Meloni tread cautiously.\n\nBut she and her allies would have leeway on the issue of immigration. When Italy was led in 2018 and 2019 by a populist coalition that included Salvini’s League, the country routinely denied landing permission to boats that rescued undocumented immigrants from sinking dinghies in the Mediterranean.\n\nFor voters, though, immigration has receded as a hot-button topic, given the general decline in attempted crossings since a record wave seven years ago. Some of that decline is owed to controversial work, carried out by Italian governments on the left and right, to equip Libya’s coast guard with the resources to halt would-be immigrants before they get very far toward Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on data Sunday evening, voter turnout sank from the level of previous national elections in 2018, a reflection of skepticism in a country that has had 11 governments in 20 years, and where household wealth has scarcely improved in a generation. The rapid turnover of governments — generally before leaders have time to follow through on promises — has amplified a sense of alienation. Twice in the last three years Italy staved off snap elections with backroom deals to form new coalitions, as parties shape-shifted, joined hands and then bickered with each other.\n\nThe last such deal brought about Draghi in a broad-based government that included every party but Fratelli d’Italia. While Draghi was personally popular, his coalition was undone when several parties withdrew their support.\n\nTo visit polling stations across Rome on Sunday was to be reminded why Italy is so hard for anybody to lead. Italian voters, rather than cleaved neatly between left and right, are instead cut into countless little slices — each with their own narratives about the ills of the country. Ballots on Sunday had more than a dozen party logos on them, and even so, many voters said they weren’t particularly enthused about any of the options. Some turning out for Meloni said her party seemed the most clear-eyed — but even they had jumped to her party only recently and weren’t sure she could retain her coherence in a coalition. Many others said they worried about how she might guide the country.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going back to 1920, but that is the underlying inspiration,” said Rita Taggi, 59, a tax consultant.\n\nRachel Pannett in Sydney contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "The Italy That’s Revealed by Italians on Social Media": "Italy is, in part, a photographic invention, a mirage of tourist snaps and magazine spreads of decadent Venetian palazzi, sauvage Sardinian beaches, and almost pornographic closeups of creamy Roman carbonara. “Pictures from Italian Profiles,” a project born on Facebook and recently published as a book with the same title, shows us something different: what its creator, Stefano Frosini, refers to as “a marginal Italy,” moving beyond “the glossy rhetoric of the Belpaese that ends up cannibalizing all other possible narratives.”\n\nAs its title suggests, the project gathers images from the social-media profiles of Italians and, as the page’s following has grown, images submitted from photo albums and personal collections. The photos are selected by Frosini, a twenty-nine-year-old teacher from Pistoia, in Tuscany, for their strangeness or improbable beauty, for their absurdity or grotesqueness. These are photographs without pretensions, even “made in error or with no particular ambition,” Frosini told Emiliano Ceresi in an interview. He chose an English name for the group to avoid the impression that he was somehow guided by smug patriotism, and these pictures do more to satirize and complicate any national myths than to reinforce them.\n\nSome are obviously Italian self-mockery, like the tableau of the policeman taking a moment away from his official duties (or perhaps eminently fulfilling them) to lift up caution tape so that a woman and her child can carry home some pizzas, a rare shot that Frosini says was taken by a professional journalist—or the various pictures of babies with cigarettes in their hands (in one case, on the lap of a priest). Some are baffling, like an unforgettable picture of a man in a Spider-Man T-shirt, staring with feigned astonishment at the camera, next to a bed on which sit dozens of eggs. But many are Italian in a way that only grows more meaningful, and more nuanced, as you spend time in the untouristed places where most people actually live, and experience for yourself the christenings and funerals, the smell of the pine trees by the seaside, the eerie emptiness of the big cities on the Ferragosto holiday in mid-August, and everywhere the weight of the past. The pictures exhibit the earthiness of proverbs rather than the shiny facility of stereotypes.\n\nFrosini’s eye gravitates toward the kinds of pictures that his parents and grandparents used to look at in the lazy hours after a holiday meal. His page collects the stuff of family albums, anonymous yet vivid pictures of “school trips, New Year’s Eve parties, Easter Mondays, last-minute birthday parties, small town festivals,” the occasions at which, Frosini writes, “the person who takes pictures does so sincerely, renouncing the techniques of aesthetic sublimation that flatten his or her taste to a single norm, seen elsewhere and consciously reproduced.” Although Frosini’s project was made possible by social media, it is not quite of it.\n\nRather, “Pictures” revels in the kind of uninhibited sharing that took place in the early days of posting photos online, before every image became an act of self-fashioning. The pictures are marked by the carelessness of the disposable camera and, Frosini has said, an earlier era of digital photography, when it was easy and cheap to take hundreds of pictures, but before the scripts, postures, and carefully considered iconography of social media had solidified. Though all the photographs are anonymous, Frosini was drawn to the photography of digital non-natives, those people we all know who tend to overshare both online and in person, and who, in Italy, often flavor their language with dialect as they recount the forgotten story of some roguish uncle or a now entirely unfunny joke or an obscure local feud whose causes you just can't get straight.\n\nThere’s nostalgia in this approach, but also more than a dash of mockery: at first, Frosini would visit the comments section of online newspapers, find “the most extreme and caps-locked” comment, and look through the Facebook profile of the person who made it, “because language is always a good place to start,” he told Ceresi. (Frosini himself writes in a markedly careful, correct, and occasionally bookish Italian.) Though he rethought his methods when the group became popular, above all to insure the privacy of those portrayed, “Pictures” is not without its ugly moments, particularly in its portrayal of the elderly; sometimes, the total artlessness of a picture makes it seem as if we’re merely being invited to make fun of both the photographed and the photographer. But, at its best moments, “Pictures” is marked by the wit, the gentle pathos, and the stranger-than-fiction unexpectedness of Diane Arbus.\n\nAlthough the chronology of the book is wide, extending from the black-and-white era through the grainy early days of digital to the twenty-two-megapixel present, most of the pictures date from the nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, when Frosini was a little kid. (He was born in 1993.) Frosini might as well be the boy chowing down on some pasta in his messy bedroom while “Futurama” plays on TV, beneath a poster of the Azzurri, Italy’s national soccer team, with a box of ACE juice on the windowsill and a little Charizard decal on the side of his desk. Photos like these are “all abysses of our country’s collective nostalgia, objective correlatives of entire phases of youth,” Frosini has explained. He’s said that, at the beginning, he’d include a picture just because of “the marked resemblance of an unknown person with someone I knew,” and it could easily be one of his friends who, responding to a dare or just egged up on youth itself, flies from a swing past the crooked arm of a gnarled old tree, off into the future.\n\nA recurring preoccupation is the contrast of old age and youth—the defining social dynamic in Italy, where there are two elderly people for every child. In one unforgettable image, which sits near the center of Frosini’s printed collection, an elderly woman holds a PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy X on the table with both hands, a bemused expression on her face. In the background, a young girl—presumably her granddaughter—smiles and gives two thumbs up. In the hazy, washed-out Polaroid image, whose very coloration evokes a lost world, the old woman stares out from what feels like the deep past. She may well have no idea what she’s holding or why it’s important. The image is amusing in the way that the foibles of the elderly can be. But, at the same time, it’s ominous. In a country increasingly under the burden of its elderly, and where the eighty-five-year-old Silvio Berlusconi is vying for yet another term in national office, nostalgia can be mixed with fear, anger, frustration, and disgust.\n\nThe nonni of these pictures are sometimes charming but just as often grotesque; they often sit uneasily with the youth around them, and with the presumably youthful viewer. The bare-chested, white-haired man eating Bolognese for lunch doesn’t look like he’s saying anything particularly nice; the white tiles on the wall and floor, and the white door behind him, only bring out his red-flushed face and sunburned chest. In another photo, a slightly confused-looking old man, wearing his trilby indoors, sits and holds a handwritten note reading “non devi morire”—“you don’t have to die.” Frosini generally does not comment on the images he posts, and here this image, though perhaps funny at first glance, quickly slides into an uncomfortable ambiguity.",
    "Italy will soon be led by the most far-right government it's had since Mussolini": "Italy will soon be led by the most far-right government it's had since Mussolini\n\nGiorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy emerge as the single largest party. Her coalition will be able to form the next government, and Meloni is expected to become Italy's first female prime minister.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nBig changes in Italy. Italians have voted in what will be their first-far right government since World War II.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nYeah. Yesterday's vote saw Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy emerge as the single largest party. Her coalition of right-wing parties will be able to form the next government. And Meloni is expected to become Italy's first female prime minister. The move comes as the European Union struggles to remain united as Russia's invasion of Ukraine fuels economic turmoil in the continent.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Joanna Kakissis is following all of this from Rome, and she joins us now.\n\nGood morning, Joanna.\n\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: Is this result a surprise in Italy, or had things been leaning in Meloni's direction for a while?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah. Things had been leaning her way for quite a while. For weeks now, in public opinion polls, her party had been leading. Her party, the Brothers of Italy - they ran as part of a coalition that includes the hard-right, anti-immigrant party called the League, which is run by former interior minister Matteo Salvini, and Forza Italia, which is run by three-time prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. But make no mistake; Salvini and Berlusconi - these are fading political figures. Meloni is the big winner now and the new star of Italian politics.\n\nMARTIN: So before we talk about the consequences of that and this far-right party coming into power, just tell us about the woman at the center of this. Who is she?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah. Meloni is young. She's 45 years old. And she grew up in this working-class neighborhood in Rome that's actually known for left-wing politics. Yet when Meloni was a teenager, she joined the local youth chapter of a movement founded by supporters of Benito Mussolini after World War II. And she stuck by this ideology for years. But she also had big ambitions. When she took over the brothers of Italy in 2018, it was a minor party. Now it's number one. And she made this happen in part by rehabilitating her own image, transforming from this young firebrand with a scary past into this reasonable everywoman fighting to save Italy's identity.\n\nMARTIN: So she made a...\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: ...Transformation of herself, her political identity, but also her party's, clearly, in some way. Explain how she managed all this.\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah. So I spoke to this Italian political scientist, Domenico Fracchiolla. He says Meloni is a gifted politician who can read the room and learn from her mistakes. And that's how she campaigned.\n\nDOMENICO FRACCHIOLLA: She was selling herself as a moderate, a defender of the family values, as ardent supporter of Ukraine and also of NATO, and as she likes to say, as a woman, mother and Christian.\n\nKAKISSIS: And we stopped by her old neighborhood, Garbatella, this leftist neighborhood. And I even met voters who just shrugged off Meloni's past.\n\nHere's advertising manager Tiziana Pipistrello.\n\nTIZIANA PIPISTRELLO: (Speaking Italian).\n\nKAKISSIS: She's saying, \"Enough with this fascism business already. That's all in the past.\" You know - but many others, you know - they told me that, you know, they worry Meloni will roll back abortion rights or crack down on immigrants and the LGBT community.\n\nMARTIN: So Italian politics, Joanna, as you know, are such that prime ministers don't necessarily like this that long. Governments can crumble...\n\nKAKISSIS: That's right.\n\nMARTIN: ...Really fast. How is she going to prevent that?\n\nKAKISSIS: So, yeah. So she is going to prevent that by trying to unite the country. And she says that her aim is to bring together Italians. And she alluded to that in her victory speech last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGIORGIA MELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nKAKISSIS: And she's got a lot of uniting to do because only 64% of Italians voted on Sunday. And that's the lowest turnout for a general election in nearly 50 years.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Rome.\n\nThank you.\n\nKAKISSIS: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "The Italian Far Right Is About to Meet Italian Bureaucracy": "“They knew how to get things done—and we didn’t,” Fioramonti recalled. “They would be the ones writing the laws, changing the laws—they were the real doers.” He began to perceive this malign influence as a manina, or “little hand,” that would act under the auspices of his ministry without his own say. “There were bills and norms that were written that we were not even aware of,” he said. In the end, he was able to enact precisely none of the policies the party had campaigned on. He quit within four months.\n\nFioramonti rapidly discovered what happens to idealism in the Italian political establishment. Over the first weeks of government, he gradually became aware of a vast and entrenched technocratic civil servantry, mediated through an elaborate web of veteran chiefs of staff assigned to inexperienced new ministers. He watched helplessly as, slowly but surely, the bureaucrats overtook him, assuming direct responsibility for his own ambitious mandate. Each of his attempts to enact flagship policies was quietly amended, stalled, or killed.\n\nIt was 2019, and Lorenzo Fioramonti, the new Italian minister of education, had big plans and bold ideas. The Five Star Movement, an Italian political faction making waves with an almost impossibly broad brand of populism, had entered government the previous year with a far-reaching supposedly radical mandate. Fioramonti, a left-leaning political scientist, believed this was as good a chance as any to nurture the ailing Italian political system back to good health through courageous reform and the application of clear and honest principles.\n\nIt was 2019, and Lorenzo Fioramonti, the new Italian minister of education, had big plans and bold ideas.

In the end, he was able to enact precisely none of the policies the party had campaigned on. He quit within four months.\n\nFioramonti was somewhat rare among Five Star politicians in that he actually wanted to implement something. The country’s politics have generally become a superficial, hopeless affair, a competition among violinists to scratch out the loudest tune over the din of a sinking cruise ship.\n\nThis month’s Italian elections made for a timely case in point, pitting an alarming far-right alliance headed by Brothers of Italy, a party with deep fascist roots and a set of far-right policy proposals—which include defending Italy’s onerous blood citizenship laws and proposing an anti-immigrant “naval blockade” of the Mediterranean—against a bumbling and divided center-left.\n\nIn the Sept. 25 election, the Brothers of Italy-led alliance is projected to have secured 42.7 percent of the vote, and it will almost certainly form a government. But despite the prospect of the far right in power, the political mood felt pretty much the same as ever during the election period. Identitarian posturing trumped careful economic planning. Internal strife dominated headlines. Losers competed to see who could humiliate themselves the quickest via an alliance with the enemy. This year, it’s the right-wing League party allying itself with its rival Brothers of Italy; last election, it was the anti-establishment Five Star allying itself with the entire establishment.\n\nMeanwhile, though Brothers of Italy has a clear path to government, it will, as others have before it, quickly come to discover that its ideas are essentially impossible to implement—thanks to an entrenched civil servantry, an implacable economic status quo, and, inevitably, the likely reality that it never had any ideas in the first place.\n\nItaly has been effectively written off by its electorate as unchangeable—and it produces parties unwilling to even make the attempt. It’s not hard to see why. Since at least the 1970s, politicians have had to subordinate fiscal decisions to the will of international markets—first through the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, then through the European Central Bank, both of which demanded precise control over spending. Then, in the 1990s, widespread corruption scandals tainted the entire political class.\n\nThen there’s the power of the manina that Fioramonti referred to. In a widely read book published in 2020 called Io Sono il Potere (“I Am the Power”), an anonymous public official traced the roots of Italy’s civil servantry back to the late 19th century. Ever since then, he said, occupants of the powerful sinecures of state—including courts, universities, and political departments—have stood as the sole link between the political class and the massive bureaucracies they preside over.\n\nA large portion of Italian society is in thrall to ancient fonts of institutional power. Only in 2021, courts ordered homeowners in a Southern Italian town to shell out back pay to a baron who claimed ownership over what was still technically a “fief”; incredibly, the noble won the case using a legal precedent dating back to the Middle Ages.\n\nThis double whammy of deep disempowerment and stagnation has served to kill off faith in politicians—first in their competence, then in their virtue. Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the early League, founded in 1991, capitalized on this mid-1990s political apathy, producing what we see today: a ceaseless proliferation of half-baked parties that build their success on attacking corrupt elites, before the public lumps them into that category themselves. Political debate has steadily conformed to the diminishing scope of possibility, focusing on partisan, identitarian issues over economics.\n\nThe new parties keep coming, however, sustained only by the Italian public’s hatred for the old. Fioramonti, the disillusioned former Five Star minister, said that from this perpetually defeated national psyche springs a kind of misplaced optimism. “Italians’ nature is to believe in magic—the leader who’s going to get things done,” he said. “That means they’re way more way more prone to believing in these populist parties, and even though they fail, Italians are keen to keep voting for them.”\n\nThe exemplar of this doomed roundelay of political failure is Five Star itself, which after four painful years in office is now frozen out of government, having collapsed from a high of around 30 percent of the vote share to 16 percent today. Though many of its politicians have been ambitious and well-meaning, its general platform was always “populist” in the most superficial way possible—and it couldn’t be anything but.\n\nAs chronicled in investigative reporter Jacopo Iacoboni’s L’Esperimento, the movement debuted in the wake of the financial crisis as an expression of popular anger against an amorphous class of politicians and journalists: the center-left stalwart Democratic Party, the major TV networks.\n\nBut Five Star made few gestures toward the real architects of that crisis, failing to recognize that many of the ills endemic to Italian society—spiraling debt, cycles of underinvestment, dangerously unsupervised and over-integrated financial markets—were the result of policies implemented by politicians long gone. It was little surprise, then, that its iconoclasm quickly deteriorated as it entered government.\n\nFrom 2018, it presided over a series of abortive coalitions with its historical rivals: first the League, then the Democratic Party, then the establishment figure par excellence Mario Draghi, all of whom had a hand in worsening the country’s malaise. Its politics were spotty and contradictory, appealing at once to progressives in Piedmont, industrialists in Milan, and right-wing cardinals in Rome. It focused above all on its unique style of governance, a heady tech-infused online voting platform, over political substance.\n\nThis combination of weakly held principles and a destructive instinct born of an impotent rage at an irremediable socioeconomic reality all came back to bite the movement. In July, it collapsed the Draghi coalition and annihilated the last vestiges of its credibility among allies on the center-left, leaving ample room for a reactionary government.\n\nAhead of this grim scenario, Five Star inaugurated its electoral campaign with a pedantic internal debate over some ancient party principle about candidates running for third terms: the final triumph of the idealized “form” of good policymaking over its mere content. It then alienated its only viable political ally, the Democratic Party, arguably costing the center-left the election.\n\nAnd yet Five Star went on to run a surprisingly successful summer campaign, grounded in the defense of its broadly popular “citizens’ income,” a program that was instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic and lifted countless people out of poverty. That gambit won the party votes in the depressed south, and Five Star emerged from the election much better than expected. But it was too little, too late: Years of dithering had ensured the party would not be able to profit from its lone policy accomplishment.\n\nThink this is a one-off? Take a look at the other unfortunates who participated in the September elections, a gloomy roster of rudderless knockabouts if there ever was one. There were the center-left stalwart Democrats, whose platform was a continuation of the legacy of recently ousted premier Draghi—but, crucially, without Draghi. Support in the Democrats’ traditional heartlands dissolved, in no small part due to an electoral law that the party itself had enthusiastically drawn up while in office.\n\nBerlusconi’s Forza Italia, meanwhile, won a pittance of votes on a bid for lower taxes and nostalgia for its namesake’s halcyon days, while Matteo Salvini’s League was overwhelmed by the fallout from its participation in the Draghi coalition and saw most of its base practically run off in horror. Both nevertheless reluctantly signed on as junior coalition partners to the far more popular Brothers of Italy, whose rise was largely down to its decision to not participate in the Draghi coalition—an expression of principle that it is already undermining.\n\nBrothers of Italy has its roots in the Italian Social Movement, a party founded by wartime Mussolini loyalists. Its leader, Giorgia Meloni, offers culture war palliatives: She has demanded fewer foreign faces in classrooms and proposed a wide-ranging crackdown on crimes supposedly perpetuated by migrants.\n\nOn the more tangible causes of Italy’s ills, however, Meloni is disappointing. Once a bellicose champion of Italian Euroskepticism, Meloni is now at pains to present herself as a sensible guardian of European interests, and her proposed economic and education reforms are generally in service of the demands of industry: lower taxes, for instance, and schools that focus exclusively on so-called vocational subjects. She’s more in line, as Italian newsweekly L’Espresso put it, with the interests of employers’ federations than disaffected voters. Even her fascist roots are passe and unremarkable; way back in the early aughts, Berlusconi’s own winning coalition included Brothers of Italy’s post-fascist forerunner.\n\nNotably, the Brothers also seek a rollback of Five Star’s citizens’ income program. The newest candidate of change is going after the policies of the last one.\n\nThe overwhelming mediocrity of Meloni’s platform was made painfully evident on Sept. 22, three days before her victory, at a garrulous rally held in Rome’s antique Piazza del Popolo. Before swelling crowds and diaphanous Brothers banners blowing in the wind, the trio of Berlusconi, Salvini, and Meloni took to the pulpit to cover the usual ground: anti-wokeness, tax cuts, a big “No!” to drugs. The rest was a roll call of weak compromises and lowbrow right-wing grievances: Meloni blasted the left and the mainstream newspapers, while Berlusconi offered enthusiastic reassurances that the winning coalition would be on good terms with the United States. The activists gathered were not exactly inspired.\n\nAnd though the right-wing alliance now has its majority, it was a marginal victory. Voter turnout was a low 64 percent, down from over 70 percent at the last election. And with Meloni and her counterparts’ eagerness to pay lip service, as Five Star did, to two incontrovertibly opposed groups—the disillusioned electorate and the powers that disillusioned it—this populist coalition du jour is likely to meet the same fate as its predecessors.

    "How a party with neo-fascist roots won big in Italy": "The Brothers of Italy party, which won the most votes in Italy’s national election, has its roots in the post-World War II neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.\n\nKeeping the movement’s most potent symbol, the tricolor flame, Giorgia Meloni has taken Brothers of Italy from a fringe far-right group to Italy’s biggest party.\n\nA century after Benito Mussolini’s 1922 March on Rome, which brought the fascist dictator to power, Meloni is poised to lead Italy’s first far-right-led government since World War II and become Italy’s first woman premier.\n\nHow did post-fascism begin in Italy?\n\nThe Italian Social Movement, or MSI, was founded in 1946 by Giorgio Almirante, a chief of staff in Mussolini’s last government. It drew fascist sympathizers and officials into its ranks following Italy’s role in the war, when it was allied with the Nazis and then liberated by the Allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1980s, the MSI remained a small right-wing party, polling in the single digits. But historian Paul Ginsborg has noted that its mere survival in the decades after the war “served as a constant reminder of the potent appeal that authoritarianism and nationalism could still exercise among the southern students, urban poor and lower, middle classes.”\n\nThe 1990s brought about a change under Gianfranco Fini, Almirante’s protégé who nevertheless projected a new moderate face of the Italian right. When Fini ran to be mayor of Rome in 1993, he won a surprising 46.9% of the vote — not enough to win but enough to establish him as a player. Within a year, Fini had renamed the MSI the National Alliance.\n\nIt was in those years that a young Meloni, who was raised by a single mother in a working-class neighborhood of Rome, first joined the MSI’s youth branch and then went on to lead the youth branch of Fini’s National Alliance.\n\nDoes that mean Meloni is neo-fascist?\n\nFini was dogged by the movement’s neo-fascist roots and his own assessment that Mussolini was the 20th century’s “greatest statesman.” He disavowed that statement, and in 2003 visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel. There, he described Italy’s racial laws, which restricted Jews’ rights, as part of the “absolute evil” of the war.\n\nMeloni, too, had praised Mussolini in her youth but visited Yad Vashem in 2009 when she was a minister in Silvio Berlusconi’s last government. Writing in her 2021 memoir “I Am Giorgia,” she described the experience as evidence of how “a genocide happens step by step, a little at a time.”\n\nDuring the campaign, Meloni was forced to confront the issue head-on, after the Democrats warned that she represented a danger to democracy.\n\n“The Italian right has handed fascism over to history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws,” she said in a campaign video.\n\nHow did Brothers of Italy emerge?\n\nMeloni, who proudly touts her roots as an MSI militant, has said the first spark of creating Brothers of Italy came after Berlusconi resigned as premier in 2011, forced out by a financial crisis over Italy’s soaring debt and his own legal problems.\n\nMeloni refused to support Mario Monti, who was tapped by Italy’s president to try to form a technocratic government to reassure international financial markets. Meloni couldn’t stand what she believed was external pressure from European capitals to dictate internal Italian politics.\n\nMeloni co-founded the party in 2012, naming it after the first words of the Italian national anthem. “A new party for an old tradition,” Meloni wrote.\n\nBrothers of Italy would only take in single-digit results in its first decade. The European Parliament election in 2019 brought Brothers of Italy 6.4% — a figure that Meloni says “changed everything.”\n\nAs the leader of the only party in opposition during Mario Draghi’s 2021-22 national unity government, her popularity soared, with Sunday’s election netting the party 26%.\n\nBut what about the party’s logo?\n\nThe party has at the center of its logo the red, white and green flame of the original MSI that remained when the movement became the National Alliance. While less obvious than the bundle of sticks, or fasces, that was the prominent symbol of Mussolini’s National Fascist Party, the tricolor flame is nevertheless a powerful image that ties the current party to its past.\n\n“Political logos are a form of branding, no different than those aimed at consumers,” said Rutgers University professor T. Corey Brennan, who recently wrote “Fasces: A History of Rome’s Most Dangerous Political Symbol.”\n\nHe recalled that when Almirante made his final MSI campaign pitch to voters in the 1948 election at Rome’s Spanish Steps, he put the party’s flame symbol on top of the obelisk and illuminated it with floodlights.\n\n“You can make whatever you want out of a flame, but everybody understood that Almirante was making a deeply emotional appeal to keep the spirit of fascism alive,” he said.\n\nHow do Italians feel about it?\n\nIn general, the party’s neo-fascist roots appear to be of more concern abroad than at home. Some historians explain that by noting a certain historical amnesia here and Italians’ general comfort living with the relics of fascism as evidence that Italy never really repudiated the Fascist Party and Mussolini in the same way Germany repudiated National Socialism and Hitler.\n\nWhile Germany went through a long and painful process reckoning with its past, Italians have in many ways simply turned a willful blindness to their own.\n\nHistorian David Kertzer of Brown University notes that there are 67 institutes for the study of the Resistance to Fascism in Italy, and virtually no center for the study of Italian Fascism.\n\nIn addition, Mussolini-era architecture and monuments are everywhere: from the EUR neighborhood in southern Rome to the Olympic training center on the Tiber River, with its obelisk still bearing Mussolini’s name.\n\nThe Italian Constitution bars the reconstitution of the Fascist party, but far-right groups still display the fascist salute and there continues to be an acceptance of fascist symbols, said Brennan.\n\n“You don’t have to look very hard for signs,” Brennan said in a phone interview. “Fully a quarter of all manhole covers in Rome still have the fasces on them.”\n\nDoes that mean Italians support fascism?\n\nIf history is any guide, one constant in recent political elections is that Italians vote for change, with a desire for something new seemingly overtaking traditional political ideology in big pendulum shifts, said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute of International Affairs.\n\nTocci said the Brothers of Italy’s popularity in 2022 was evidence of this “violent” swing that is more about Italian dissatisfaction than any surge in neo-fascist or far-right sentiment.\n\n“I would say the main reason why a big chunk of that — let’s say 25-30% — will vote for this party is simply because it’s the new kid on the block,” she said.\n\nMeloni still speaks reverently about the MSI and Almirante, even if her rhetoric can change to suit her audience.\n\nThis summer, speaking in perfect Spanish, she thundered at a rally of Spain’s hard-right Vox party: “Yes to the natural family. No to the LGBT lobby. Yes to sexual identity. No to gender ideology.”\n\nBack home on the campaign trail, she projected a much more moderate tone and appealed for unity in her victory speech Monday.\n\n“Italy chose us,” she said. “We will not betray it, as we never have.”",
    "Italian lawyer vows to fight gender-segregated electoral voting queues": "A lawyer has pledged to fight in court a decades-old Italian election law that in widespread implementation on Sunday led to thousands of voters, including trans people, being forced into gender-segregated queues.\n\nHundreds of LGTBQ+ activists denounced discrimination at polling stations in Sunday’s general election. Many told of their experiences on social media, citing how the binary queues failed to consider the “complexity of thousands of voters in Italy whose identity cards do not reflect their gender” and forced them to publicly identify themselves as trans people.\n\n“Gender-segregated queues are a violation of privacy of all those who are making a gender transition,” said Cathy La Torre, an LGTBQ+ activist and lawyer. “Enough is enough. I am not a trans person and I cannot sue the state for violating my privacy, but I am a lawyer and I can launch a battle to change this law.”\n\nVoting procedures in Italy are regulated by a law dating front 1967 that allows for the infrequently implemented separation into men-only and women-only queues at polling stations and states that electoral lists must also be divided by gender. The law, which has never been repealed, also provides for a married woman to be identified at a polling station with her husband’s surname.\n\nLa Torre said she asked her polling station to make an official record in their minutes of her belief that the “subdivision in lists of men and women is a violation of privacy rights and personal dignity”, but while the police accepted her request, one ballot counter insulted her by calling her “crazy” in front of other voters. La Torre has sued him for defamation.\n\nCathy La Torre attending the 79th Venice International Film Festival in September Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty Images\n\n“Thousands of trans people are forced to stand in a queue different from their gender and therefore forced to let everyone present know that they are trans people,” La Torre said. “And if you ask the authorities why, the answer is always the same: it has always been like this. And for those who tell me that these are trifles, I say feeling humiliated is never a trifle.”\n\nLa Torre said her goal was to take the case to the constitutional court and ask for the abrogation of the law. Italian trans people have previously campaigned against the 1967 law, and a petition to repeal the law was first launched in 2018.\n\nGender-segregated queues are not a regular feature of Italian elections and many on Sunday reported being asked to stand in them for the first time.\n\nElectoral authorities have not given an official explanation, but according to some sources, the decision to implement them was intended to better manage long queues at polling stations with waits of an hour or more to vote.\n\nMedia reports suggested the sluggishness was due to the “anti-tampering sticker”, a system devised to counter the possibility of switching the ballot while voting. The perforated and rectangular sticker has an alphanumeric code and is applied to a corner of the ballot. An authorised worker at the polling station removes it before inserting the ballot in the ballot box.",

    "Opinion | Britain has replaced Italy as Europe’s problem economy": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nAt the start of this month, doom-mongers looking for the next financial crisis in Europe were pointing at Italy. Just as the pessimists predicted, Italians have elected a populist coalition led by the post-fascist Brothers of Italy party. But a funny reversal has occurred. Italy’s economy seems provisionally stable. Britain has emerged as the weak power in Europe.\n\nWhat gives? Intellectual fashion has been running against globalization for several years, so it’s easy to miss the answer. But the Italy-Britain inversion underlines an old lesson. Sacrificing some sovereignty and submitting to the rules of international organizations are not necessarily bad things. If the rules work reasonably well, doing so can be an advantage.\n\nDespite junking the responsible government led by economist Mario Draghi, and despite replacing him with an unsavory populist coalition, Italy is in reasonable shape because of the European Union. However loudly the populists used to denounce Europe’s Germanic orthodoxy, they now promise to implement the economic plan drawn up by Draghi and approved by the E.U. — not least because it comes with almost $200 billion of post-pandemic recovery aid from Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nItaly’s populists also want the European Central Bank in their corner. Over the summer, fearing another euro-zone crisis triggered by the price shocks from the Ukraine war, the central bank created a bond-buying program to protect wobbly countries from short-selling hedge funds. To retain access to this support, Italy has to avoid crazy policies.\n\nIn short, this is not the Europe of a dozen years ago. Rather than reacting belatedly and grudgingly to signs of stress, the continent is trying to preempt problems. Italy has deep structural fragilities, ranging from demography to debt, and much could still go wrong. But for now the smart money is on its stability.\n\nMeanwhile, having left the E.U., and having never been a member of the euro zone, Britain is in the opposite position. The new Conservative government led by Prime Minister Liz Truss faces almost no constraints. She was expected to be bold. She is turning out to be bonkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sign came with her response to soaring natural gas prices. To protect low-income Britons from a choice between heating and eating, Truss had to deliver subsidies. But she opted for a monstrously expensive remedy, trampling her party’s reputation for budgetary prudence. The Truss subsidies are due to last for fully two years. They are especially generous to the rich. By the U.K. government’s own estimates, they will cost more than $60 billion in the next six months, a whopping 4.7 percent of GDP over the period. Because of their design, they will end up costing even more if natural gas prices experience another upward hit.\n\nBut that was just the rehearsal. On Friday, in a Reaganesque bid for higher growth, the Truss team announced a ruinous package of unfunded tax cuts. It did this despite the obvious danger that the stimulus would add to inflation, which is at 9.9 percent and expected to rise. It did this despite the impact on Britain’s national debt, which is forecast to hit 90 percent of gross domestic product in 2024-2025, up from 75 percent before the pandemic. And it did this without allowing the government’s Office of Budget Responsibility to model the impact of its giveaways.\n\nNot surprisingly, financial markets panicked. Interest rates on two-year government bonds hit 4 percent, up from 0.4 percent a year ago, adding to the government’s prospective debt burden. The pound fell 3.4 percent against the dollar by day-end Friday, its steepest drop in two years. Over the weekend, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng signaled that he might cut taxes some more. The pound promptly fell a further 4.7 percent when Asian markets opened Monday, sinking briefly to its lowest level since the system of floating currencies began in 1971. The pound then rallied on the hope that the Bank of England would step in to stabilize it. When the bank said it would not hold an emergency meeting, the currency headed down again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did the Bank of England disappoint the traders? It has only a modest stockpile of foreign currency reserves, so it cannot prop up the pound by stepping in to buy a ton of it. Its only option is an emergency interest rate hike, on top of the 0.5 percent it delivered last week. This would help the pound, and by dampening import prices it would mildly restrain inflation. But higher interest rates would drive the economy into a ditch and raise the cost of servicing the national debt. Given the Truss team’s reckless bent, it might lash out against the central bank and undermine its independence.\n\nWhen the Brexit referendum damaged Britain’s access to its key export market, an economic penalty was inevitable. But this is the first time that being in the currency union has looked more attractive than being outside it. The European Central Bank is in a far stronger crisis-fighting position than the Bank of England.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Italy braces for far-right victory in elections": "Italy braces for far-right victory in elections\n\nItalians head to the polls Sunday in what could be a pivotal election with far-right candidate Giorgia Meloni poised to be Italy's first female prime minister.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAnd now to Italy, where voting is set for tomorrow in one of the most consequential elections for the country in decades. Public opinion polls show that a far-right party, the Brothers of Italy, is expected to win the most votes. Its leader, a young firebrand named Giorgia Meloni, seems poised to be Italy's first female prime minister and the first to come from the far right since fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. NPR's Joanna Kakissis is in Rome following developments, and she's with us now. Joanna, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Michel.\n\nMARTIN: So Giorgia Meloni - tell us a little bit about her and her background.\n\nKAKISSIS: Right. So Giorgia Meloni is 45. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Rome that is staunchly leftist. But instead, she joined the youth chapter of the Italian Social Movement, which was created by the supporters of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the aftermath of World War II. This youth group was heavily influenced by fantasy novels like J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord Of The Rings,\" and Guido Calderon (ph), a journalist who covers the far-right in Italy, he told us why.\n\nGUIDO CALDERON: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKAKISSIS: So he's saying that reading Tolkien gave these young people new ways to talk about their ideology, where they were not the bad guys, where they lived in a community whose traditions they were protecting.\n\nMARTIN: That's really interesting. So the views of the young Meloni, does she still hold them?\n\nKAKISSIS: Now, Meloni was much more explicit about her hardline views in her youth. But, you know, as she has grown, she's tried to maybe mute them a bit. At the start of this campaign, for example, she took pains to reassure Italians and the world of her party's pro-European and pro-Atlantic stance. But in some closing rallies in the last few days, her tone and content has been much more stridently nationalistic. And I should note here that her party, the Brothers of Italy, is not set to govern alone. They're expected to form a coalition with at least two right-wing parties, and one of them is led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nMARTIN: How are people reacting to all this and her views in particular to the election and sort of more broadly? What are people saying?\n\nKAKISSIS: So yeah - so we wanted to find out. So we checked out the public mood at the Trionfale market in an upscale neighborhood in Rome. All the shoppers, they seemed unhappy at the prospect of a right-wing coalition in power. Middle-class professionals like Simona Romeo (ph), who works in the movie industry, was one of them. She called Meloni divisive and exclusionary.\n\nSIMONA ROMEO: She is a new evolution of fascism. I mean, Giorgia Meloni and her entourage is going to be like in United States, like in your country, when, you know, Trump - and people is angry. That's the mood.\n\nKAKISSIS: But the Romans running the stalls at the market called Meloni a hero. And Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini, who leads another party in her coalition, they call those two the two angels at her side. And those are the words of Manuela Ciarrone (ph), who sells gourmet mushrooms.\n\nMANUELA CIARRONE: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKAKISSIS: So Ciarrone is saying Meloni will be focused on caring for Italians, not migrants, and that she will fight for the working class by pushing to provide better health care and lower electricity prices.\n\nMARTIN: So let's go back to something you mentioned earlier, her relationship to Europe. Is that a factor in the campaign? I mean, she does blame the EU for watering down the national identities of member nations like Italy. How is that whole issue playing out?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah, we heard a lot of concern about that in the market from the shoppers, of course. One person I spoke with said Italy really needs Brussels with all the debt the country has. And Guido Calderon, the fascism expert, he told us that Italians are also concerned that Meloni could take Italy down the path of illiberal democracy like Viktor Orban's Hungary. He says that may not be the fascism of Mussolini, but it is a very real threat that may soon present itself in Italy.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Rome.

    "The Man Who Explains Italy": "In the middle of August, my wife and our two small children went to visit her family in Milan. We arrived at Malpensa Airport at dawn and proceeded to passport control, where the immigration officer, as is customary with public servants in Italy, seemed vaguely put out that we’d interrupted whatever important business he was conducting on his phone. My wife handed over two Italian passports, for herself and our five-year-old, and two American ones. The officer’s mood immediately improved: now we were no longer simply an unwelcome distraction from his private affairs but in the much more interesting category of people he was legally obligated to reprimand. Our two-year-old, he explained gravely, was in violation of the law. As he was an Italian citizen by birth, he required an Italian passport; American passports, he went on, do not carry the names of the parents, and thus he had no way to know that the child, who has my surname, was in fact hers.\n\nMy wife, long accustomed to such bureaucratic snares, produced a scan of our son’s birth certificate. The process of obtaining an Italian passport, she explained with a series of complex hand gestures, was so arcane and so onerous! Our two-year-old was born in the first year of the pandemic, she went on, and you know how Italian administrative procedures were: you had to go to one office to get this form, and then another office to get the proper stamp, and the consulate in New York seemed only to be open for such services on every third Wednesday. The man at last permitted himself a commiserative smile: he knew how it was. Look, he allowed, he was a nice guy, so he was going to let us through this time. But we needed to be careful! If we had the misfortune to encounter a more severe officer on our way out, we might be denied exit from the country. When we departed, some two weeks later, we encountered another unusually availing guy willing, of course, to bend the rules just this once.\n\nLord Byron once remarked that, in Italy, “there is, in fact, no law or government at all; and it is wonderful how well things go on without them.” Today, Italy has a large government with a dazzling number of laws—more than ten times as many as Germany—and the country is full of bright, industrious people who spend an enormous amount of time and energy creatively breaking them. This problem has been a recurring theme for Francesco Costa, a thirty-eight-year-old journalist, who has, over the last few years, become a new-media phenomenon. The Italian media, like the Italian government, is largely made up of stodgy, insular institutions—places more interested in themselves, and the preservation of their own status, than they are in their readers. Costa, who began as an outsider blogger and podcaster, has been credited as a modernizing influence on the role of the reporter in Italian civil society.\n\nCosta’s daily podcast, “Morning,” which is pronounced with a non-rhotic “R” and a phantom vowel at the end, attracts an intensely devoted audience, especially (but not exclusively) among the country’s liberal élite. The show, which appears under the auspices of Il Post, the news site where Costa serves as deputy editor, is subscriber-only—a rarity in a country where media properties have been slow to adopt new business models that have become common elsewhere. The young Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico told me, “There are journalists who have been caught copying pieces from elsewhere who are still writing front-page editorials in the main newspapers—it’s such a different culture that it’s hard even to explain. Costa’s journalism would be at a high level in the U.S., but in Italy it’s way above what ninety-nine per cent of the other outlets offer. It’s like he appeared from outer space.” The conceit and the operation of the podcast are simple: Costa’s alarm goes off at 4:45 A.M., he reads up to ten daily papers in the next hour and a half, and he sits at his home computer to record a summary, with dry but opinionated commentary, of the day’s news. He edits out the ambulance sirens from outside his apartment, cuts the episode to thirty minutes, and exports the file himself. “The goal is to come out at 8 A.M.,” he told me recently. He continued, with the national shrug, “Sometimes it’s eight, sometimes it’s five minutes early, sometimes it’s five minutes late.” In a country riven by intergenerational frustration, he has an unusually broad subscriber base: he is at once respected by boomers and parasocially stalked by the youth. (When my wife texted her group chat of Italian expat professionals to say I was writing about him, the response was a flood of heart-eye emojis.) Luca Sofri, one of Italy’s first prominent bloggers and now a colleague of Costa’s at Il Post, told me that it is chiefly Costa’s singular talent that gives what seems like a mere press review such an unusual sway over his audience. “Francesco is simply bravissimo,” he said.\n\nIn a perpetual moment of Italian political turmoil, Costa not only aggregates and processes perplexing news—about gas prices or electoral procedures—with rare clarity but also comes at national politics from oblique directions, speaking to the country’s spiritual state with candor and dark humor. I had arrived in Milan at the tail end of the August holidays, when anyone of means abandons the cities to the tourists, and Costa dedicated the prefatory remarks of his podcast one morning to a typical story of Italian coastal melodrama. The episode was called “No Need for a Law for Everything.” Law enforcement had recently begun a “blitz,” scouring the public beaches for illegal “reservations”—places where vacationers have arrived before dawn to put down their towels or umbrellas before going home to sleep until midday, such that people who arrive at the beach at a reasonable hour can’t find a place to take the sun.\n\nThe story, he went on, provoked him to consider the activity of law-enforcement personnel who had to conduct these “blitzes.” It wasn’t just the time that they spent finding the offenders but the tremendous waste to follow:\n\nAn enormous amount of paper, of signatures, of stamps, of authorizations, of service orders to seize fifteen umbrellas, and then for each of these fifteen umbrellas imagine the amount of senseless paperwork required to say, “We have seized on date X an umbrella with a design of little hearts and flowers,” and imagine this entire operation repeated for every single umbrella, towel, and beach chair that had been seized, on every single beach where the forces of order, instead of dedicating themselves to things we would call much more important, had to devote themselves to these inspections?\n\nImagine all of that, he instructed his listeners over their morning brioche and coffee, “multiplied for all the other superfluous, redundant, costly bureaucratic operations we’re forced to confront on a daily basis.” His voice, though still dry and deadpan, took on increasing urgency. “We have a law that simply says you can’t put your umbrella on the beach at night but that you can after 6 A.M. But is there a need for a law—must there be a law for us to adopt a comportment of banal manners, that is, don’t occupy a place you’re not using, on a free beach, and do it neither the night before nor at 6 A.M.?” He continued, “Does law enforcement in Norway have to carry out such ‘blitzes’?” He asked, “Or does it not happen because it doesn’t occur to anybody to do such a thing?”\n\nHe begged his listeners’ pardon for something that might seem so irrelevant, but he hoped that he had been understood in the spirit he intended. “We’re in an election campaign, every day we’re confronting and adjudicating promises to approve this or that other law,” he said. In the background, “Morning” ’s theme, “Gimme Shelter,” began to play. “Are we sure that all of this comportment—matters of civility and banal good manners—could or should have to be imposed by a law?” Couldn’t it just be up to us, he concluded, “to avoid a situation where law enforcement has to go to the beaches to verify who put his umbrella, or her beach chair, or his towel, on a public beach to unduly occupy a place? In other words, why not just try to regulate ourselves? This is ‘Morning.’ Let’s begin.”\n\nA day or two after that episode aired, I met Costa, who is slender and bald and speaks with a pronounced Sicilian accent, one morning for coffee. We sat at a bar not far from his office, in Milan’s Zona Tortona, an old industrial district renovated to support the fashion and design sectors. He told me, “You can tell we’re journalists because we’re the worst-dressed people at lunch,” though he himself has adopted an offhandedly smart Milanese style. Unlike traditional Milanese brass-and-marble bars—where you can get a coffee in the morning and a drink at night, or vice versa—this was an airy, high-ceilinged space with large tables set out for the laptop cohort.\n\nCosta was raised and educated in Catania, at the base of Mt. Etna. In 2008, he dropped out of journalism school in Rome and pitched a tent in a lakeside holiday community, where he blogged about Obama’s first campaign with unqualified enthusiasm. He sent out letters of inquiry to dozens of newspapers, but at the time he lacked the personal connections necessary to join the media class. Like many other young people of ambition from the impoverished south, he moved in his twenties to Milan, where he mixed with an entrepreneurial cohort of migrant upstarts. He developed a reputation as a young journalist who explained America to his generation of Italians. (His third book about the States, on the problems facing California, came out last week, and is already atop the best-seller lists.) In relatively short order, he was able to sustain his blogging with crowdsourced donations. Inspired by the success of shows such as “Serial,” he turned to audio, first with “Da Costa a Costa” (“From Coast to Coast”), a pun on his name, which became Italy’s first native podcast sensation.\n\nLast year, he started “Morning,” which he describes as a side gig to his role at Il Post, an online-only news organization whose motto is “Cose spiegate bene”—or “Things explained well.” Though he noted that the site, which Sofri founded in 2010, predated the establishment of Vox by four years, he told me that his innovations were nothing new. “I wasn’t being a genius. I was just in touch with what was happening in the U.S., on blogs and in podcasts, and just copied what was working elsewhere.” In Italy, however, this came as a revelation. It was taken for granted that the establishment media wrote largely to and for itself. “They use jargon that people never use and don’t understand,” he said. “They provide no context.” Publications routinely made errors, which they rarely bothered to apologize for or correct. More important, they made no secret of their political affiliations—a center-left senator once described La Repubblica as “our Pravda”—and rarely dwelled on the routine hypocrisy that’s long been endemic to Italian political life. The business model of Il Post was basic precision, firmness, and comprehensibility. “We set out to explain everything like the listener is five years old,” Costa said. It did not take long for him to become one of the few sources that Italians could turn to for straightforward explanations of the deliberately illegible machinations of national politics. In July, the generally popular caretaker government of Mario Draghi—the third unelected banker-technocrat recruited to run the country since the nineteen-nineties—was brought down by the abrupt (and, given that almost all of the parties are now running on a continuation of his economic policies, largely pointless) withdrawal of support by the junior coalition partners, and overnight Costa found himself delivering daily coverage of the snap elections, which are to be held on September 25th.\n\nFor anyone who has paid even passing attention to the Anglophone press’s treatment of the political situation in Italy, Costa’s riff on umbrellas and banal good manners might seem like a glib reaction to an impending crisis for European democracy. In the past decade, Italy, along with many of its peer countries, has been destabilized by populist movements on the right and the left. Now it seems to many foreign observers that Italy’s next government will be a Fascist one. Polling has been stable, and a decisive victory is almost assured for a so-called center-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni, who would be Italy’s first female Prime Minister. It’s not hard to gather why Meloni brings Fascism to mind. The Party that she co-founded, Fratelli d’Italia, arose from the ashes of Italy’s Movimento Sociale Italiano (M.S.I.), the postwar reconstruction of Mussolini’s base. Her party occupies M.S.I.’s former headquarters in Rome, she has retained its symbolism—a tricolored flame—and she frequently refers to “Dio, patria, famiglia,” or “God, country, and family.” Many of her followers have taken up the stiff-armed Roman salute associated with Il Duce, on the flimsy pretext that it’s a hygienic development in the wake of COVID. Mussolini’s granddaughter Rachele is a Party member, and a member of Rome’s city council.",
    "Italy veers right and away from EU’s centre of power": "This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter, exceptionally free to read today. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday and Saturday morning\n\nGood morning and welcome to Europe Express.\n\nItalians followed Giorgia Meloni’s advice and made history at the polls yesterday, securing her rightwing bloc a comfortable victory of more than 40 per cent of the total vote. While waiting for the final result, which will define the balance of power within the ruling coalition, we’ll look at how Meloni’s relationship with the EU is shaping up in comparison with that of her predecessor, Mario Draghi.\n\nOver the weekend, EU ambassadors held their group “confessionals” with European Commission officials testing the red lines, wish lists and possible landing zones for a new round of Russia sanctions. The centrepiece of this package was thought to be a price cap on Russian oil, in line with G7 plans, but diplomats are now uncertain that the legal text will be ready this week.\n\nEqually uncertain is the outcome of Friday’s extraordinary energy council, even though it is seen as the last chance to come up with solutions to the energy crisis in time for the heating season. We’ll bring you the latest on the REPowerEU funding quarrels.\n\nAnd later today, agriculture ministers are having their own showdown about pesticides, with eastern member states demanding extra studies that will take into account the war and this summer’s drought.\n\nUpheaval in Italy\n\nFor anyone who had any doubts left, yesterday’s Italian election confirmed that Giorgia Meloni is the complete opposite of her predecessor Mario Draghi. A worsening relationship with the EU is likely to be one of the results, write Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan and Valentina Pop in Brussels.\n\nExit polls put Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party ahead at 22-26 per cent of the vote, compared with only four per cent at the last election in 2018. When counted together with the other rightwing parties, Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini’s League party, Meloni’s coalition is expected to secure between 42 and 49 per cent of the total vote.\n\nLong gone are the days when Draghi shaped the bloc’s response to the Russian aggression, having US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen on speed dial or co-authoring op-eds with France’s Emmanuel Macron.\n\nInstead, an early glimpse of Italy’s diminished role on the EU stage was offered late last week in a question-and-answer session at Princeton University, when EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen put Rome in the same basket with Budapest and Warsaw.\n\n“If things go in a difficult direction,” she said when asked about the Italian elections, “I’ve spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools”. This was a reference to the rule of law disputes and funding freezes that both countries have experienced.\n\nThis sparked outrage in Rome, particularly in the rightwing camp, and online in the MIGA (“Make Italy Great Again”) circles, where von der Leyen was accused of interfering in the election. ​​Salvini, leader of the rightwing League party, said that von der Leyen should either apologise or resign for “threatening a sovereign country on the eve of an election”.\n\nMeloni herself was more measured, saying: “I don’t think she referred specifically to Italy, or it would be an unprecedented interference,” though she did point to the risk of the commission losing credibility.\n\nBut the ultimate proof that Meloni, who doubles as the president of the European Conservatives and Reformists party that includes Poland’s ruling party, Law and Justice (but not Hungary’s Fidesz), is the antithesis of the soft-spoken, apolitical central banker, came yesterday. Given that campaigning was banned on election day, 45-year-old Meloni took to TikTok and Instagram, where she posed with two cantaloupes (Meloni in Italian means melons, but is also slang for breasts), winking and saying “25 September, I said everything”. Draghi she most definitely is not.\n\nChart du jour: IMF record\n\nThe IMF’s lending to troubled countries has hit a record high, amid simultaneous crises that have pushed at least five countries into default — with more expected to follow.\n\nLast chance council\n\nWith the winter “heating season” fast approaching, the stakes at Friday’s emergency energy council could not be higher: if ministers fail to come to an agreement, action may materialise too late to help consumers and businesses on the brink, writes Alice Hancock in Brussels.\n\nRevisions by member states to the commission’s plan to bring down energy prices leave more wriggle room for national plans, according to the latest draft seen by Europe Express. EU governments can decide not to implement the so-called “solidarity contribution” on oil and gas-fired power plants if they already have a similar measure in place.\n\nWhen it comes to the revenue cap on non-gas power generators, allowances have been made for coal, which has become an important source of energy for Germany and eastern European states as they have been steadily cut off from Russian gas.\n\nBut the EU is already falling well behind on its existing scheme for overhauling the bloc’s energy sector — namely the REPowerEU plan, announced in May.\n\nHuge REPowerEU banners were unfurled over the commission’s headquarters last week (replacing the NextGenerationEU advertising for post-pandemic recovery funding). But implementing the measures is proving much harder than giving an advertising company more work.\n\nThe EU commission’s headquarters were redecorated last week to signal a shift in priorities © Valentina Pop\n\nOne key question is where find the €210bn to fund REPowerEU as member states continue wrangle over it. An original plan to fund €20bn of REPower through selling permits that cover carbon emissions (pushing down the cost of polluting) has caused outcry among climate conscious member states.\n\nA revised proposal by the Czech EU council presidency, seen by Europe Express, suggests that part of that €20bn should come from selling extra emissions allowances but part should also come from the EU’s innovation fund, which is meant to put money towards low-carbon technologies.\n\nUnofficially the Czechs have suggested 80 per cent could come from the innovation fund and the remaining fifth from the emissions permits, according to two EU diplomats.\n\nBut “too large a group for the presidency to ignore” is against using the reserve emissions allowances in the format currently suggested, one of the diplomats said. The other said more than 20 countries were in favour of using part of the innovation fund.\n\nThe document also proposes a revision of the way that the overall money — which otherwise comes from leftover recovery and resilience funds set up during the pandemic — is allocated.\n\nUnder the original legislation, financing would be granted on the basis of how badly a member state had suffered economically during the pandemic. This meant that although Germany received about half of its gas from Russia, it would only receive about 8 per cent of the Covid recovery funding.\n\nThe Czechs have instead suggested an allocation based on a calculation that includes the share of fossil fuels in energy consumption, which would favour Germany but leave Italy, Spain and other southern European states out of pocket. Given the conflicting interests, finding a compromise solution will be quite an achievement.\n\nFans of pesticides\n\nMember states opposed to an EU crackdown on pesticides will launch a fresh assault on the proposal at today’s agriculture council, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.\n\nA draft regulation on “sustainable use” of pesticides under discussion seeks to reduce the chemicals by half across the bloc by 2030. But a group of 10 member states are demanding a fresh impact assessment for the proposal.\n\nThe countries, mostly eastern members including Poland and Romania, say the commission’s original assessment predates the war in Ukraine and the drought this summer, which has reduced food supply and increased prices.\n\nAccording to their position paper seen by Europe Express, they want a fresh analysis of:\n\nthe impact on food production in the EU\n\nthe increased dependence on food imports\n\nthe reduction of the EU’s resilience to crisis events disrupting supply chains, such as war in Ukraine, the pandemic or the severe drought\n\nthe impact of banning any use of plant protection products in sensitive areas like parks and nature reserves\n\nthe impact of phasing out some active substances categorised as “harmful” given the lack of alternatives\n\nthe differences in climate, crops and pests between member states\n\nThe policy paper criticises the decision to measure pesticide by kilogrammes per hectare rather than toxicity levels. Organic farmers use natural substances that are less damaging, but sprayed in larger quantities.\n\nAn EU official said there was no procedure to revisit an impact assessment so the real motive might be to torpedo the proposal altogether. Its passage through the council of member states has already been slowed and will stretch at least into next year.\n\n“We have a common goal of the reduction of inputs [such as pesticides]. But we are facing a difficult situation. We need to find a balanced approach between reduction and production,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nWhat to watch today\n\nECB chief Christine Lagarde speaks in the European parliament Agriculture ministers meet their Ukrainian counterpart in Brussels European parliament presents candidates for Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\n. . . and later this week\n\nVoting in the so-called referendums organised in the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia ends tomorrow Economy ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the single market emergency instrument on Thursday Energy ministers meet for another emergency council on Friday\n\nNotable, Quotable\n\nWe have communicated directly, privately at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia\n\nNuclear contingencies: US and its allies are increasing their nuclear vigilance and deterrence, even as western officials believe that Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats are unlikely to materialise.\n\nLNG für Deutschland: The United Arab Emirates has agreed a deal to supply liquefied natural gas to Germany during a visit by chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is seeking to drum up alternatives to Russian energy.\n\nFT webinar: Italy’s 2022 election\n\nJoin FT correspondents and guests tomorrow (1-2pm UK) for a subscriber-only virtual briefing on the Italian election results and what’s in store for Italy and Europe.

    "I Am Tired of Watching People Go to Italy": "Everyone is in Italy this year — including Alison Roman, whose new cooking series will, like half the people my Instagram feed, take us on a tour of the Amalfi Coast. CNN announced yesterday that Roman’s four-episode (More Than) A Cooking Show, which was originally slated for the now-defunct CNN+, will hit CNN this fall. The show will invite audiences into Roman’s New York kitchen and to join her on her travels abroad. Sure, that sounds fun, if a bit familiar.\n\nBetween Bobby and Giada in Italy; Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy; episodes of Chef’s Table, Somebody Feed Phil, Top Chef, and Salt Fat Acid Heat, I can’t help but feel a little Italy-ed out in recent years, like I’ve hit my capacity for watching clips of cheesemaking or people eating perfectly crisped Neapolitan pizza. (And that doesn’t even include Italy’s dominance over fictional food-adjacent shows like Netflix’s upcoming From Scratch and the second season of HBO’s hospitality-themed The White Lotus.) Now, I’m no stranger to dreaming up my own Eat Pray Love spaghetti scene, and the green-eyed monster and I were in close company this summer as I scrolled past so many friends and influencers’ Lake Como weddings and rented villas.\n\nYet it’s all starting to feel repetitive, especially when one considers how infrequently this in-depth treatment is given to other countries. Italy and France, for that matter, are countries and cuisines whose regionality is given its due in the food landscape of the United States — while so many places in the world remain simplified in the culinary imagination: a visit in a food series episode here and there, usually relying on the same biggest-name cities and chefs.\n\nIt’s as though major networks, wanting a guaranteed hit, see the success of all this Italy-centric TV and think, great, let’s do that again — which is almost certainly what’s happening (streaming overload led Time to claim last year, “Welcome to TV’s era of peak redundancy”). CNN is a perfect example of that: Not only is Roman’s Italy show dropping this fall, featuring the Amalfi Coast, but so is the continuation of Tucci’s, which will explore Italy’s regions further after going to Tuscany, Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Rome, Bologna, Milan, and Sicily last year.\n\nIt all feels a little safe: Showing potential travelers from the U.S. food that is already pretty familiar, in a country that feels like a safe bet, thus reinforcing Western expectations about which cuisines are valuable and which countries worth traveling to. I’m happy to imagine Italian beach moments a la The Talented Mr. Ripley, but what other daydreams could we have if food travel shows dared to delve deeper into places less frequently depicted?",
    "Italy appears likely to elect its most right wing leader since World War II": "Italy appears likely to elect its most right wing leader since World War II\n\nItaly heads for a historic election. If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party wins Sunday's election, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nItalians vote on Sunday. It seems likely they'll elect the country's most right-wing government since World War II. If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy Party comes out on top, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister. Adam Rainey reports from Rome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGIORGIA MELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nADAM RAINEY, BYLINE: Giorgia Meloni's Twitter feed is full of scenes like this, taking the stage in Italian cities across the country. They all look similar - dozens, sometimes hundreds of people waving flags for her Brothers of Italy party as she sprints to the stage. Milan, Palermo, Genoa - the feed is like a map of Italy meant to show her national, not just nationalist appeal. Although her party has roots in Italy's postwar neo-fascist movement, Meloni, who is 45, is making great pains to distance herself from fascism.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: Speaking on one of Italy's main evening newscasts, Meloni sarcastically jokes that her opponent on the left don't seem to realize that fascism ended 30 years before she was born. Just this week, though, her party suspended a member after an Italian newspaper revealed he had made statements supporting Adolf Hitler on social media eight years ago. The fascism label may trouble Meloni. Hard-right positions clearly don't. Here she is in August.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: She's saying her party supports a naval blockade to stop illegal immigration from North Africa. And here she is, fired up on stage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: She says she has a dream that Italians won't have to lower their heads in shame or worry they'll lose their jobs for their political beliefs, a clear message to people who support her party's pro-Catholic, anti-immigrant, anti-woke positions, as she has called them. Some Italians fear a Meloni government would move to outlaw abortion, legal in Italy since 1978. But she has gone on the record saying she has no plans to do so.

Meloni has long been a Eurosceptic but has repeatedly promised she'll work with the EU and can be trusted as a steady hand to manage 200 billion euros in European pandemic recovery funds.

    "MATCHDAY: Hungary, Italy fight for spot in Final Four": "Hungary hosts Italy with both teams fighting to finish first in their group and qualify for the Final Four tournament in June next year. Hungary upset Germany 1-0 on Friday, and Italy beat England by the same score. Hungary only needs a draw to advance. It tops Group A3 with 10 points, two more than Italy, ahead of the last round of games, meaning the Italians need to win in Budapest. England hosts Germany at Wembley Stadium with their coaches under increasing pressure ahead of the World Cup. England is already certain to finish bottom and drop out of the top tier of the Nations League. Germany can no longer reach the Final Four following its loss to Hungary in Leipzig. That brought an end to Hansi Flick’s unbeaten run as Germany coach. England coach Gareth Southgate’s side is five games without a win.",

    "Italy election: Energy woes prompt voter apathy, anguish": "The prospect of a harsh winter is overshadowing the Italian vote, with many worrying about how to pay the bills.\n\nRome, Italy – Loredana Longo has little time for Italy’s September 25 election. What is dominating her thoughts instead is how she will be able to pay her sky-high gas bills in the coming winter months. “The situation is catastrophic,” she said.\n\nA teacher at a nursery school in Ciampino, on the outskirts of Rome, Longo makes 1,000 euros ($990) a month. With more than half of her salary going to a mortgage, the 48-year-old single mother of a teenage son has long struggled to make ends meet – but was always able to get by.\n\nNow, with an energy crisis gripping Italy – and the whole of Europe – caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Longo faces difficult choices.\n\n“I have to decide whether to put food on the table, or pay the bills,” she said. Her case is not an isolated one. According to the European Union’s statistical office, Eurostat, nearly 12 million Italians are on the brink of falling below the poverty line – meaning those whose salary is 60 percent lower than the median income.\n\n“This segment of the population is at risk,” said Nunzia De Capite, a sociologist and researcher for Caritas, a leading Catholic charity active across the country. De Capite said that this group, at risk of joining the already 5.6-million poor in the country, include those belonging to the middle class, with small savings and daily jobs, but who are struggling to pay bills and can’t afford any economic shocks.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, combined with Italy’s huge dependency on Russian gas which accounted for 40 percent of imports, is proving the perfect unforeseen storm. The price of electricity for an average household increased by 94 percent in the first trimester this year compared with 2021, while the cost of gas jumped by 131 percent compared with the same period, data from the Italian energy regulator ARERA shows.\n\nThe energy crunch has significantly hurt families’ purchasing power and slowed down industrial production in what could be a worrying mix, Gianfranco Viesti, a professor of applied economics at the University of Bari, told Al Jazeera.\n\nInflation has climbed to nine percent, the highest in decades, hitting the most vulnerable. Studies show that low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on domestic energy costs due to less efficient housing and the use of cheaper but more energy-consuming electricity appliances.\n\n“It is the poor who pay for this energy crisis, not the rich,” Viesti said, sounding the alarm over the risk of a social breakdown. “The number one challenge of the future government will be how to preserve social stability in a tired and discouraged country after 20 years of anaemic growth, with huge inequalities,” he said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, candidates have sparred about the best strategy to tackle the crisis.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy whose coalition is expected to win the elections, has pledged not to increase Italy’s already record-high debt – following the monetary policy of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Italy is the second-most indebted country in the eurozone, with the Bank of Italy recording the country’s highest debt in its history at more than 2,700 trillion euros ($2,635 trillion) this year.\n\n“I won’t ask for more money,” she said during her closing campaign rally in Rome on Thursday. She insisted, once again, on the need to cap gas prices and decouple the price of gas and energy, two proposals that also mark a continuity with the approach of the current government.\n\nMeloni has toned down her Euro-scepticism since the prospect of becoming prime minister became more concrete, in an attempt to reassure markets that she will not be a danger to the European Union’s stability.\n\nBut Meloni’s coalition partner, the hardline and anti-migrant chief of the League party Matteo Salvini, has been pushing for a 30-billion-euro ($29bn) state subsidy to help businesses to cap energy costs – a move that critics warn would make Italy more vulnerable to financial markets and to higher interest rates. The League was polling at nearly 13 percent, according to the latest polls on September 10, nearly half of what Meloni’s Brothers of Italy was predicted to win, suggesting that her policy proposal might prevail.\n\nEnrico Letta, the leader of the Democratic Party, is also in favour of capping gas prices, as well as providing needy families with tools and funding to produce energy from renewable sources, increasing tax credit to compensate for a non-domestic energy price rise and to incentivise businesses to invest more in renewable energies.\n\nBut many Italians are not convinced by the options available. As the pool of people slipping into poverty has increased throughout the years, so has the number of those disenchanted with politics.\n\n“You know what, I am going to write a poem on the voting card,” said Mauro Spadolini, age 21, while serving coffee at a bar in Rome’s working-class neighbourhood of Garbatella. Nearby, Liliana Cortellesi, the owner of a small grocery store, snaps back: “I’m gonna write Draghi across it,” the 72-year-old said, explaining she had no idea who to vote for.\n\nThey are just among the millions of people – more than 40 percent of the eligible people according to a September survey – who say they will abstain from the ballots or are still undecided about who to vote for after a chaotic electoral campaign.\n\nDraghi’s tenure, in power since February 2021, was widely perceived as a moment of stability in Italy’s usually tumultuous politics. But it collapsed in July, becoming the latest government to fall victim to political infighting. Italy has had three governments in the last four years – seven in the last 11 – and this, experts say, has further disenfranchised the populace.\n\n“The public opinion thinks the vote is not that useful considering what parties then do with it,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco, the founding partner of polling firm YouTrend, adding that voter turnout is expected to be the lowest in the history of Italian elections.\n\n“My hands are trembling,” Meloni said when asked how she felt about governing during the campaign. My hands are shaking too, Longo said. But she was thinking about the upcoming winter bills.",
    "Italian voters shift sharply, reward Meloni’s far-right party": "ROME (AP) — A party with neo-fascist roots, the Brothers of Italy, won the most votes in Italy’s national elections, looking set to deliver the country’s first far-right-led government since World War II and make its leader, Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s first woman premier, near-final results showed Monday.\n\nItaly’s lurch to the far right immediately shifted Europe’s geopolitics, placing a euroskeptic party in position to lead a founding member of the European Union and its third-largest economy. Right-wing leaders across Europe immediately hailed Meloni’s victory and her party’s meteoric rise as sending a historic message to Brussels, while Italy’s left warned of “dark days” ahead and vowed to keep Italy in the heart of Europe.\n\nNear-final results showed the center-right coalition netting some 44% of the parliamentary vote, with Meloni’s Brothers of Italy snatching some 26%. Her coalition partners divided up the remainder, with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini winning 9% and the more moderate Forza Italia of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi taking around 8%.\n\nThe center-left Democratic Party and its allies had around 26%, while the 5-Star Movement — which had been the biggest vote-getter in 2018 Parliamentary elections — saw its share of the vote halved to some 15% this time around.\n\nTurnout was a historic low 64%. Pollsters suggested voters stayed home in protest, disenchanted by the backroom deals that had created the last three governments.\n\nMeloni, whose party traces its origins to the postwar, neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, tried to sound a unifying tone in a victory speech early Monday, noting that Italians had finally been able to determine their leaders.\n\n“If we are called to govern this nation, we will do it for everyone, we will do it for all Italians and we will do it with the aim of uniting the people,” Meloni said. “Italy chose us. We will not betray it as we never have.”\n\nWhile the center-right was the clear winner, the formation of a government is still weeks away and will involve consultations among party leaders and with President Sergio Mattarella. In the meantime, outgoing Premier Mario Draghi remains in a caretaker role.\n\nThe elections, which took place some six months early after Draghi’s government collapsed, came at a crucial time for Europe as it faces Russia’s war in Ukraine and the related soaring energy costs that have hit ordinary Italian pocketbooks as well as industry.\n\nA Meloni-led government is largely expected to follow Italy’s current foreign policy, including her pro-NATO stance and strong support for supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend against Russia’s invasion, even as her coalition allies stake a slightly different tone.\n\nBoth Berlusconi and Salvini have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While both have distanced themselves from his invasion, Salvini has warned that sanctions against Moscow are hurting Italian industry, and even Berlusconi has excused Putin’s invasion as foisted on him by pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas.\n\nA bigger shift and one likely to cause friction with European powers is likely to come over migration. Meloni has called for a naval blockade to prevent migrant boats from leaving North African shores, and has proposed screening potential asylum-seekers in Africa, before they set out on smugglers’ boats to Europe.\n\nSalvini made clear he wants the League to return to the interior ministry, where as minister he imposed a tough anti-migrant policy. But he may face an internal leadership challenge after the League suffered an abysmal result of under 10%, with Meloni’s party outperforming it in its northeastern stronghold.\n\nSalvini acknowledged the League was punished for its governing alliances with the 5-Stars and then Draghi, but said: “It’s a good day for Italy because it has five years of stability ahead of it.”\n\nOn relations with the European Union, analysts note that for all her euroskeptic rhetoric, Meloni moderated her message during the campaign and has little room to maneuver given the economic windfall Italy is receiving from Brussels in coronavirus recovery funds. Italy secured some 191.5 billion euros, the biggest chunk of the EU’s 750 billion-euro recovery package, and is bound by certain reform and investment milestones it must hit to receive it all.\n\nThat said, Meloni has criticized the EU’s recent recommendation to suspend 7.5 billion euros in funding to Hungary over concerns about democratic backsliding, defending Viktor Orban as the elected leader in a democratic system.\n\nOrban’s political director, Balazs Orban, was among the first to congratulate Meloni. “In these difficult times, we need more than ever friends who share a common vision and approach to Europe’s challenges,” he tweeted.\n\nFrench far-right leader Marine Le Pen praised Meloni for having “resisted the threats of an anti-democratic and arrogant European Union.”\n\nSantiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox opposition party, tweeted that Meloni “has shown the way for a proud and free Europe of sovereign nations that can cooperate on behalf of everybody’s security and prosperity.”\n\nMeloni is chair of the right-wing European Conservative and Reformist group in the European Parliament, which gathers her Brothers of Italy, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, Spain’s Vox and the Sweden Democrats, which just won big in elections there on a platform of cracking down on crime and limiting immigration.\n\n“The trend that emerged two weeks ago in Sweden was confirmed in Italy,” acknowledged Democratic Party leader Enrico Letta, calling Monday a “sad day for Italy, for Europe.”\n\n“We expect dark days. We fought in every way to avoid this outcome,” Letta said at a somber news conference. While acknowledging the future of the party and his own future required reflection, he vowed: “The PD will not allow Italy to leave the heart of Europe.”\n\nThomas Christiansen, professor of political science at Rome’s Luiss University and the executive editor of the Journal of European Integration, noted that Italy has a tradition of pursuing a consistent foreign and European policy that is in some ways bigger than individual party interests.\n\n“Whatever Meloni might be up to will have to be moderated by her coalition partners and indeed with the established consensus of Italian foreign policy,” Christiansen said in an interview.\n\nMeloni proudly touts her roots as a militant in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, or MSI, which was formed in the aftermath of WWII with the remnants of Mussolini’s fascist supporters. Meloni joined in 1992 as a 15-year-old.\n\nDuring the campaign, Meloni was forced to respond after the Democrats used her party’s origins to paint Meloni as a danger to democracy.\n\n“The Italian Right has handed fascism over to history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws,” she said in a multilingual campaign video.\n\n___\n\nColleen Barry contributed from Milan.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "This Italian Island Will Pay You $15,000 To Move There": "If you’ve ever dreamed of living in Italy, your wish is about to come true. And even better: You could get paid to move to Italy.\n\nThe stunning Mediterranean island of Sardinia is prepared to pay people €15,000 each (approximately $14,976) to move there. It’s hard to imagine that a place so beautiful would need to pay people to relocate to its shores, but the intention is to attract new residents in order to combat dwindling population numbers.\n\nAnd the Sardinian government is serious about it, setting aside €45 million—enough to subsidize 3,000 grants of up to $15,000 each.\n\nOther parts of Italy are using similar promises of money to lure a new population, from the region of Calabria—which is giving a handful of new residents about $33,000 each—to the village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio, which offered people up to $52,500 in grants to move there and work.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been similar programs, with regions and cities and states paying people to move there.\n\nThe Italian island of Sardinia is paying people to move there. Pictured here: a Costa Paradiso ...

As with any of these programs, there’s a catch. To be eligible, you have to move to a Sardinian town with a population of less than 3,000 residents. The money must also go toward renovating a home. You must live there full-time (sorry, no vacation villas allowed). And within 18 months, you need to register Sardinia as your permanent residence.\n\nA view of the village of Bosa in Sardinia, Italy. getty\n\nBut what a pay-off it is.

    "Italy’s League: sovereignty without constraints, with EU money": "Ahead of Italy’s snap election on 25 September, EURACTIV Italy takes a closer look at how the party programme of Matteo Salvini’s League party relates to the EU.\n\nRead the original article in Italian here.\n\nThe programme presented by the League party presents a nationalistic and anti-EU position that is in line with the party being part of the far-right Identity and Democracy group in the European Parliament, and it ignores the pro-EU and pro-Western stance it presented to get into the government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nStill, the programme reaffirms Italy’s participation in the EU and NATO, but only dedicates three of 202 pages to the EU.\n\nIn its programme, League portrays the EU as an “increasingly bureaucratic and distant reality for the people” and takes particular aim at EU climate policies – like the Green Deal and Fit for 55 – which the party says targets the “Made in Italy” brand and is “a danger to the competitiveness of businesses and the lifestyle of Italian citizens.”\n\nThe programme does not mention Next Generation EU but only parts of the national recovery plan, even though Italy is the largest beneficiary of these funds.\n\nStill, the party makes the bold statement that no Italian government was able to influence EU institutions in the past 20 years despite League being part of the government during many of those years and many Italians, like former European Commission President Romano Prodi and the EU’s former top diplomat, Frederica Mogherini, obtaining top spots at EU level.\n\nOn the economy, the programme also lacks references to the single currency or the Economic and Monetary Union despite negotiations on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and European economic governance being set to start in autumn. This comes as a surprise since League’s head of economics, Alberto Bagnai, and Claudio Borghi before him, both oppose the Euro. This omission could be explained by League’s fear of losing votes if it were openly against the euro, or that such an announcement could impact the markets and thus increase public debt – which was the case when Italy was under the helm of the eurosceptic and euro-critical first Conte government.\n\nOn Russia’s war in Ukraine, League calls for a peace conference without saying if it is favour of maintaining sanctions against Russia or providing Ukraine with military assistance along with the rest of the EU and NATO.\n\nOn extending the EU’s competences and putting an end to unanimity voting procedures, as proposed by the Conference on the Future of Europe, League says it is in favour of preserving unanimity and opposes increasing the competences and powers of the Union.\n\nTo face the US, China and Russia, League says joint EU action is not necessary, and instead calls on Italy to revive its role “to safeguard the national interest” – a concept the party does not clearly define in its programme.\n\nHowever, some of the programme’s sections, notably on the economy, implicitly refer to the EU, and in particular to the national recovery and resilience plan, EU structural funds and EU programmes more generally, as these would be essential to fund League’s proposals.\n\nIn what appears to be a somewhat contradictory programme, League wants Italy to regain absolute sovereignty without EU constraints, but still considers EU funds to be necessary for the implementation of its proposals, and is even proposing to strengthen Italy’s permanent representation in Brussels and to create better coordination between the representation, the ministries, the national Parliament and Italian MEPs.\n\nIn short, the League despises the EU, but implicitly recognises that Italy cannot do without it.",

    "Italy 1-0 England summary: score, goals, highlights, UEFA Nations League": "Italy 1-0 England: match summary\n\nEngland’s sorry Nations League run continued as Giacomo Raspadori’s 68th-minute strike gave Italy a deserved 1-0 win on Friday that relegated the shot-shy visitors to the second tier League B.\n\nThere was precious little to provide optimism for England’s fans with Qatar only two months away but at least they will be going, unlike Italy, still trying to come to terms with their failure to qualify for the second World Cup in a row either side of winning the European Championship.\n\nIn a game of few chances at the San Siro, the hosts looked the more adventurous side and were rewarded when Raspadori neatly brought down a long ball by Leonardo Bonucci on the edge of the box and, given far too much time, cut in before firing past Nick Pope.\n\nEngland barely managed an effort on goal and looked unrecognisable from the team who went 22 games unbeaten until June – not counting the Euro 2020 final shootout defeat by Italy.\n\nThey have scored only one goal, a penalty, in their five Nations League games going into their final match at home to Germany on Monday.

    "How a Looming Oil Ban Could Devastate a Small Italian City": "Like thousands of Sicilians who live near Priolo Gargallo, part of an industrial petrochemical hub on this island’s southeastern coast, Davide Mauro has tied his livelihood to the giant Russian-owned Lukoil refinery — a landscape of towering chimney stacks, steel cranes and flat-topped gas tanks that rise above the Ionian Sea’s brilliant turquoise waters.\n\nEver since the European Union agreed to ban most imports of crude oil from Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine, the future of this refinery — the largest in Italy — has been thrown into doubt. The deadline for the embargo is less than three months away, but workers still have no idea whether they will have jobs once it goes into effect on Dec. 5.\n\n“The company never says anything official,” said Mr. Mauro, a shift operator who has worked for 20 years at a plant that supplies the oil refinery with power. There has been talk of the Italian government’s possibly nationalizing the facility or guaranteeing new lines of credit. Most recently, there has been talk of an interested American buyer. But Mr. Mauro said: “It’s all rumors. Nothing’s clear.”",
    "Mussolini: the master of Italy – archive, 1922": "Fascist activities\n\nFrom our own correspondent\n\nThe Observer, 24 September 1922\n\nRome\n\nThe Fascisti are continuing their activities all over Italy, and if they use despotic methods it must be admitted that their despotism is sometimes attended with good results. How far and how long an extra-state despotism can continue to exist side by side with the legal constitution is the problem that will have to be faced in the near future by both Italy and the Fascisti.\n\nThey are now preparing a campaign in the south of Italy where, so far, fascismo has penetrated very little. The National Congress of Fascisti takes places at Naples in October, and will be the signal for the “black shirts” to start their propaganda. They have already established National Syndicates to take the place of Communist Labour Chambers in the provinces of Bari and Foggia, formerly strongholds of socialism. These syndicates aim at federating workers of all classes, instead of separating the social strata and producing the harmful class strife which has hitherto been the hallmark of Italian socialism.\n\nIn Sicily fascismo has better ground to work on than in the Neapolitan provinces. As an article in the Popolo d’Italia truly observes, there is no real socialism in Sicily; there are only discontented people, who will gladly join any association that promises to ameliorate their lot. In Messina, fascism is already thriving. In Sicily, generally, memories still linger of Garibaldi and his band of heroes, and the tradition of the “red shirts” will pave the way for the new expedition of the “camicie nere.”\n\nIn central Italy the Fascisti are championing ex-soldiers in the country districts by occupying the villas or these landowners who refuse to give them work. A few days ago 300 of them swarmed over the Villa Borghese in the Mugello, near Florence, and continued the pressure of their presence until the owner, the Duca di Bomarzo, consented to employ a reasonable number of ex-servicemen on his estate.\n\nThe village of Bacchereto, also in Tuscany, has just been occupied by Fascisti, who announce their intention of remaining on the spot until the parish priest has been removed. The obnoxious cleric is accused of uttering libels against fascismo from the pulpit, and of being generally guilty of anti-national feeling. His parishioners are, it seems, thoroughly in agreement with the Fascisti, and are grateful to them for their help. The priest declares that he is innocent of the sentiments attributed to him, but it is rumoured that he intends to resign the living of Bacchereto sooner than fight it out with the Fascisti.\n\nThe master of Italy: Mussolini and his programme\n\nFrom our own correspondent\n\nThe Observer, 1 October 1922\n\nFlorence\n\nLast week both the nominal and the virtual leader of Italy made speeches and were honoured in different ways and in very different measure. The banquet given at Pinerolo, in Piedmont, to celebrate the completion of 30 years of the prime minister’s political life, was attended by numerous ministers, innumerable deputies and three Italian ambassadors, besides a crowd of other distinguished guests, who had come, not only because Facta is personally liked and much respected, but because an important speech was expected, given the gravity of the political situation. Delusion wits bitter. “Verba non Facta,” exclaimed one wag, and the phrase will serve as cenotaph for this amiably dignified and ineffectually upright minister who has failed to impress his countrymen, and is only used as a hyphen between one ministry and the other. He has purred about peace and order at home, and respect for Italy abroad, but has not known which card to play.\n\nThe subtle Italian mind adores a man of action, a man of elemental force. Mussolini, “the Thunderer,” whose words became deeds as they drop from his mouth, has swept most of young Italy off their feet, and for the time being holds them in the hollow of his hand. He at any rate has no difficulty in finding cards to play; he shows them with tempestuous promptitude in answer to the stirred curiosity of his anxious countrymen, and no one can complain that his game lacks variety. His whole life, from a revolutionary socialist to a revolutionary fascist, is made of cinema shifts of stirring interest and significance.\n\nAt Udine on 20 September Mussolini made the most important of his speeches, which had for its watchword, “Rome”. “The march on Rome,” however symbolic as a term (and, given the necessity, Mussolini will turn symbols into deeds), means nothing less than that Italy is to be fascista and governed either by Mussolini or by those who will suit their policy to his. In the very near future we may see a Giolitti-Mussolini ministry – age and exuberance grappling with, perhaps, the most subtly difficult situation an Italian cabinet has ever had to deal with.\n\nDiscipline\n\nIn the Udine speech Mussolini made a vigorous call for discipline to be the mainspring of his army and of Italy. “We must subject ourselves,” he said, “to an iron discipline or else we would have no right to impose it upon the nation. Discipline alone will enable Italy to make her voice heard among other nations. Discipline should be accepted; if not accepted, it must be imposed … We are an army, and because we have chosen that special constitution, our life and our actions must be founded upon discipline … “Italy’s voice to be heard among other nations” – there you have another foundation stone of Mussolini’s programme.\n\n“Black Shirts” at Cremona\n\nThe very day that the prime minister’s 3,000 distinguished guests were eating their excellent dinner and exchanging “bei complimenti,” Mussolini was taking peaceful possession of enemy country. The beautiful little city of Cremona, lying in the rich Lombard plain close to the gliding waters of the Po, awoke to find her population suddenly doubled by the advent of 30,000 fascists – youths in black shirts and black fezes, skull and crossbones as their emblem, their motto “Me ne frego” (“Je m’en fiche”); and young girls in short black skirts, white blouses, and jockey caps made of tricolour.\n\nMussolini in Rome, February 1927. Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG/Getty Images\n\nThe “loggie” flanking the cathedral were soon crowded with people, boys sat astride on the grim medieval lions and heads looked out of the small windows above the giant sundial, while thousands of Black Shirts streamed into the piazza for an hour and half in well-ordered formation. With his habitual quiet rapidity, Mussolini suddenly appeared in the stone pulpit affixed high up against a pier of the Communal Palace whence demagogues of old had swayed the people of Cremona. There was a roar of welcome “Il nostro Duce,” and the banners were raised on high and waved above the crowd.\n\nMussolini as orator\n\n“How like he is to a Roman tribune,” exclaimed one officer, as Mussolini stretched out his arm to the crowd, saluting the people in the Roman manner adopted by the fascists. His powerful head was thrown back, his stern eye fixed them all as one person. I was more impressed by the religious silence which fell upon the multitude when Mussolini began to speak than by the indescribable enthusiasm when cheering broke loose. He is a great speaker, not an orator. He dominates his audience more by sheer force of his volcanic personality, which is well under control, than by the force of his words. The young men in Italy, full of intense zest for life, and of truculent patriotism, would follow him anywhere at the lift of a finger. In this absorbing love for Italy and pride in her lies their strength, their virtue, and their danger.\n\nThis is an edited extract. Read the article in full.",
    "Italy fires Meta urgent request for info re: election interference measures": "Days ahead of the Italian general election, the country’s privacy watchdog has sent Facebook’s parent (Meta) an urgent request for information, asking the social media giant to clarify measures it’s taking around Sunday’s election.\n\nThe risk of election interference via social media continues to be a major concern for regulators after years of rising awareness of how disinformation is seeded, spread and amplified on algorithmic platforms like Facebook, and with democratic processes continuing to be considered core targets for malicious influence ops.\n\nPrivacy regulators in the European Union are also watchful of how platforms are processing personal data — with data protection laws in place that regulate the processing of sensitive data such as political opinions.\n\nIn a press release about its request yesterday, the Garante points back to a previous $1.1 million sanction it imposed on Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and for the “Candidates” project Facebook launched for Italy’s 2018 general election, writing [in Italian; translated here using machine translation] that it’s “necessary to pay particular attention to the processing of data suitable for revealing the political opinions of the interested parties and to respect the free expression of thought”.\n\n“Facebook will have to provide timely information on the initiative undertaken; on the nature and methods of data processing on any agreements aimed at sending reminders and the publication of information ‘stickers’ (also published on Instagram — part of the Meta Group); on the measures taken to ensure, as announced, that the initiative is brought to the attention only of persons of legal age,” the watchdog adds.\n\nThe move follows what it describes as “information campaign” by Meta, targeted at Italian users, which is said to be aimed at countering interference and removing content that discourages voting — and involving the use of a virtual Operations Center to identity potential threats in real-time, as well as collaboration with independent fact-checking organizations.\n\nThe Garante said the existence of this campaign was made public by Meta publishing “promemoria” (memos). However a page on Meta’s website which provides an overview of information about its preparations for upcoming elections only currently offers downloadable documents detailing its approach for the US midterms and for Brazil’s elections. There is no information here about Meta’s approach to Italy’s general election — or any information about the information campaign it is (apparently) running locally.\n\nA separate page on Meta’s website — entitled “election integrity” — includes a number of additional articles about its preparations for elections elsewhere, including Kenya’s 2022 general election; the 2022 Philippines’ general election; and for Ethiopia’s — 2021 — general election. Plus earlier articles for State elections in India; and an update on the Georgia runoff elections from the end of 2020, among others.\n\nBut, again, Meta does not appear to have provided any information here about its preparations for Italy’s General Election.\n\nThe reason for this oversight — which is presumably what it is — could be related to the Italian election being a snap election, called following a government crisis and the resignation of prime minister Mario Draghi, i.e. rather than a long-programmed and timetabled general election.\n\nHowever the gap in Meta’s election integrity information hub on measures it’s taking to protect Italy’s general election from disinformation suggests there are limitations to its transparency in this crucial area — suggesting it’s unable to provide consistent transparency in response to what can often be dynamically changing democratic timelines.\n\nThe Italian parliament was dissolved on July 21 — which was when the president called for new elections. Which means that Meta, a company with a market cap of hundreds of billions of dollars, has had two months to make upload details of the election integrity measures it’s taking in the country to relevant hubs on its website — yet it does not appear to have done so.\n\nWe reached out to Meta yesterday with questions about what it’s doing in Italy to protect the election from interference but at the time of writing the company had not responded.\n\nIt will of course have to respond to Italy’s watchdog’s request for information. We’ve reached out to the regulator with questions. Update: A spokesperson said it heard about Meta’s activity on the Italian elections via media coverage of the issue. “We believe that Meta will provide all the required information and documentation as soon as possible. I can not provide you with more information since it is under the Garante investigation,” they added.\n\nThe Garante continues to be an active privacy watchdog in policing tech giants operating on its turf in spite of not being the lead supervisor for such companies under the one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has otherwise led to bottlenecks around GDPR enforcement. But the regulation provides some wiggle room for concerned DPAs to act on pressing matters on their own turf without having to submit to the OSS.\n\nYesterday’s urgent request to Meta for information by Italy’s watchdog follows a number of other proactive interventions in recent years — including a warning to TikTok this summer over a controversial privacy policy switch (which TikTok ‘paused’ soon after); a warning to WhatsApp in January 2021 over another controversial privacy policy and T&Cs update (while stemming from a wider complaint, WhatsApp went on to be fined $267M later that year over GDPR transparency breaches); and a warning to TikTok over underage users, also in January 2021 (TikTok went on remove over half a million accounts that it was unable to confirm did not belong to children and commit to other measures).\n\nSo a comprehensive answer to the question of whether the GDPR is working to regulate Big Tech requires a broader view than totting up fines or even fixing on final GDPR enforcement decisions.",
    "A far-right politician is poised to become Italy’s first female leader": "Listen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nROME — The favorite to be Italy’s next prime minister has rocketed almost from out of nowhere. Her party, until recently, was on the fringes. She was overlooked for years by Italy’s male-dominated political class. She is an unmarried mother with a heavy Roman accent, always casual and blunt, gesturing with hands to the sky, lambasting “woke ideology” and cancel culture.\n\nBy any account, Giorgia Meloni’s rise is astonishing. In a matter of weeks, if all goes as expected, she stands to become Italy’s first female leader. She’s also set a benchmark for a far-right politician in Western Europe, earning a level of power that’s been out of reach for her counterparts in Germany and France, and doing so even after the forces propelling nationalism on the continent — a migration backlash and Euroskepticism — have waned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Meloni’s profile is distinctive, as is the path she’s found for political success.\n\nAmid war in Europe, she has notably avoided the pitfalls of nationalist figures elsewhere. She’s a strong NATO supporter and shows no affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin. She has pledged not to disrupt Italy’s stability and Atlantic alliances. The country, she says, won’t take some authoritarian turn.\n\nWhat will surely change, though, is Italy’s tone. Meloni takes shots at the “LGBT lobby” and the “globalist” left. She highlights anecdotes about immigrant crime. She has said that “everything we stand for is under attack” — Christian values, gender norms. Some of her stances — like opposition to gay adoptions, for instance — don’t get much traction among Italian voters, but she cites them as evidence that she cares more about principles than popularity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In a political world where everyone’s saying one thing and doing another, our [party’s] system of values is pretty clear,” Meloni said in an interview with The Washington Post. “You may like it or not, but we aren’t misleading.”\n\nIf Meloni, 45, prevails, she’ll wind up with a hard job: running a country in a generation-long economic decline that is somewhat wary of her powers.\n\nThose on the left have sounded the alarm, saying that Meloni could push Italy into Europe’s illiberal bloc, alongside Hungary and Poland, fighting against diversity and agitating against Brussels. Her opponents argue that her views can veer into the extreme. They cite past remarks — such as a speech from 2017 — in which Meloni said mass-scale illegal immigration to Italy was “planned and deliberate,” carried out by unnamed powerful forces to import low-wage labor and drive out Italians. “It’s called ethnic substitution,” Meloni said at the time, echoing the far-right “great replacement” conspiracy theory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer allies, on the other hand, say Meloni has the kind of serious plans her predecessors have lacked, and that she chiefly wants to address Italy’s economic woes. Her stump speech is theatrical, but it deals mostly with ideas about boosting investment and curbing welfare. Her party’s recently released platform has 25 proposals — everything from extending high-speed rail lines to jump-starting university research. Voters inclined toward Meloni tended to cite, in interviews with The Post, her perceived honesty and coherence as the reasons for their support.\n\nFor now, Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia party — the Brothers of Italy, a name that echoes lyrics in the national anthem — is the most popular in the country, favored by roughly one-quarter of voters. It has a coalition agreement with other parties on the right, giving it overwhelming odds to prevail against a fractured and reeling left. The right-wing bloc has said that the premier job should go to the leader of the party with the most votes. Still, following the Sept. 25 general election, the president, Sergio Mattarella, has final say on who gets the mandate.\n\nMeloni acknowledged in her Post interview that Italy is facing extraordinary challenges. She mentioned the rising cost of energy and raw materials, uncertainty about whether the pandemic might come roaring back, and Italy’s towering public debt — which perpetually leaves the country several missteps away from crisis. There’s a reason Italy has had 11 governments in the past 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I cannot say that, faced with such a responsibility, my hands aren’t shaking,” she said. “Because we’d find ourselves governing Italy during what’s perhaps one of the most complex situations ever.”\n\nA savvy campaign strategy\n\nMeloni’s ascent owes something to the fading star of another far-right politician, Matteo Salvini.\n\nSalvini, as recently as several years ago, was seen as Italy’s political dynamo — holding raucous rallies, banning the docking of immigrant ships and echoing former president Donald Trump with his pledge to put “Italians first.”\n\nFrom his perch as interior minister in 2018 and 2019, Salvini dominated the national discourse, and his League party had grown so popular that he thought he could vault into the prime minister’s seat. But his plan backfired. When he broke apart his government coalition to force new elections, other parties joined hands to freeze him out. He tumbled into the opposition. He lunged for new ways to stand out and contradicted himself with shifting positions. Eventually, Salvini took his party back into government, supporting former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, the embodiment of the European establishment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Salvini had won the lottery ticket,” said Giovanni Orsina, director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. “Then he lost it and Meloni got it.”\n\nEven those who disagree with Meloni’s politics concede that she strategized wisely.\n\nAs Salvini tumbled, she built ties with like-minded parties in Europe — including Spain’s Vox and Poland’s Law and Justice party — and she made trips to address Republicans in the United States.\n\nTo Italians, she framed her party’s perpetual opposition role as a matter of principle: The Brothers of Italy would only join a government if elected, as opposed to entering a majority through backroom deals. Meantime, she tried to show that her party would still be constructive players if it believed in a cause.\n\nMeloni, while speaking with The Post, mentioned supporting Draghi on handling aspects of fallout from the Ukraine war amid division in the prime minister’s coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When help was needed, we offered it,” Meloni said.\n\nEspecially as it pertains to her positions on Europe, she has moderated more noticeably than the other Western European nationalist who earlier this year made a run for power, France’s Marine Le Pen. While Le Pen’s platform had ideas that would have led to standoffs with Brussels — like prioritizing national law over E.U. law — Meloni’s does not, said Luigi Scazzieri, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform.\n\n“This kind of sanitization and Europeanization has gone a lot further in Meloni’s case than in Le Pen’s,” Scazzieri said.\n\nThe catch now for Meloni is that to enter government, she’ll need Salvini, whose party is part of the right-wing coalition. On the trail, Salvini — who once wore a Putin T-shirt while touring Red Square — has suggested that the West should rethink sanctions against Russia, arguing that the measures are causing pain in Europe and failing to change the Kremlin’s calculus.\n\nAnalysts say there’s already reason to wonder about the durability of any Meloni-led coalition, given the potential for competition and rivalry with Salvini. In theory, Salvini could complicate Meloni’s trajectory even before she gets the top job, by suggesting the party leaders stand back and pick an alternative representative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnrico Letta, the president of Italy’s center-left party and Meloni’s chief sparring partner on social media, made the point in an interview with The Post that Italy isn’t in the midst of a sudden far-right surge. In European elections in 2019, Salvini’s League got 34 percent of the vote. Meloni’s party got 6 percent. As then, roughly two-fifths of Italians still favor the far-right parties; the difference is that Meloni has siphoned off much of Salvini’s support.\n\n“It’s not a wave — it’s her,” Letta said. “Part of the country is betting on her, because she is young and new.”\n\nHe predicted that her honeymoon would “end soon,” and that the inevitable compromises would sully her reputation.\n\nMeloni, and those around her, said she has built her party up with no shortcuts.\n\n“We took the longer route,” she said. “Italians today understand that we’re a very reliable party.”\n\nWell prepared for confrontation\n\nMeloni says she learned at a young age the importance of having enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer childhood in the Roman outskirts was difficult. She was abandoned by her father, who sailed off to the Canary Islands. She was raised by her mother, a right-winger who wrote romance novels. Playing with candles, she accidentally burned down the family home. And she was bullied for being overweight. In her autobiography, she recounts the story of being called a “fatso” when trying to get into a volleyball game. She dieted and slimmed down.\n\n“Years later I’m grateful to those rednecks,” Meloni wrote.\n\nAll these years later, Meloni references her adversaries all time, sometimes with glee. On Facebook, she cites skeptical or critical news headlines. On the trail, she talks about how the left is obsessed with trashing her and is doing “everything to stop us.” Even in a video she released last month, rejecting any party ties with Italy’s fascist past, she noted that suggestions to the contrary had been “inspired by the powerful media circuit of the left.” In her interview with The Post, she explicitly cited the “globalist” left as an enemy, and said the West is “paying for the weakness” of its ideology, which she said seeks to flatten differences in identity.\n\nItaly has had all sorts of leaders — including Silvio Berlusconi, with his politics-as-theater approach to governing (and who six years ago discouraged a pregnant Meloni from running for mayor of Rome, saying a “mother cannot be mayor”).\n\nMeloni is hardly the first to relish political combat. But some Italians worry she’ll further polarize the country and loosen some of the restraints in society. Edith Bruck, a Holocaust survivor and poet who lives in Rome, and who has befriended Pope Francis, noted Meloni’s shorthand way for introducing herself: as a woman, a mother, an Italian and a Christian.\n\n“What is the implication of that?” Bruck said. “That she isn’t Muslim or Jewish? It all goes back to the idea that Europe is Christian and non-Christians are a threat.”\n\nMeloni’s allies see it differently. Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a Brothers of Italy senator who has known Meloni since she was a teenager, said Meloni would represent the whole country, but that there could be “exceedingly hard” clashes with entrenched powers that she judges aren’t working “for the good of the nation.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Meloni has dealt with mostly adoring crowds, plus the occasional protest group chanting “fascists” at her supporters. And she’s used even the off-script moments as evidence that she’s ready for the job.\n\nDuring a speech on the island of Sardinia, a young man with a rainbow flag evaded security and made his way onstage. He was beginning to talk about his desire for legalized same-sex marriage when Meloni interjected.\n\n“You and I don’t agree,” she said. “I want the [political] right to think differently. It’s a democracy.”\n\nShe mentioned that Italy already provides the right to civil unions, “so you can do what you want.”\n\nThe confrontation ended peacefully. She asked the crowd to applaud, and Meloni promoted a video clip of the moment on social media.\n\nAs the man left the stage, she said, “I respect people’s courage to stand up for what they believe in.”\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "What is the legacy of outgoing Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi?": "Italians are fairly satisfied with the way Mario Draghi, the country's outgoing technocratic prime minister, navigated the COVID-19 crisis, the war in Ukraine and the consequences both have had on the economy, but as he prepares to leave the Chigi Palace, his legacy appears quite fragile.\n\nAccording to a poll by the Centro Italiano Studi Elettorali released earlier this month, 62.4% of the country's electorate view Draghi's actions over the past 17 months positively.\n\nYet pollsters also predict that the next government will be made up of a right-wing coalition led by the far-right, neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party that will also include the right-wing populist Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Go Italy after Italians head to the polls on Sunday.\n\nOn many issues, these parties stand on opposite sides of the spectrum from Draghi.\n\nThe 75-year-old former head of the European Central Bank is unashamedly pro-EU, has called for tough sanctions on Russia and for strong financial and military support to Ukraine. He's also known as \"Super Mario\" for his leadership at the central bank during the euro crisis.\n\nSo after just a year and a half in office, what is Draghi's legacy in Italy likely to be?\n\nDraghi's COVID-19 recovery package\n\nDraghi was tasked with forming a government in February 2021 following the collapse of a coalition led by the populist Five Star Movement (MS5) that also included the right-wing Northern League party.\n\nAt the time, his main task was to steer the country through the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the vaccination campaign and the country's economic rebuilding.\n\nItaly, like France and Spain, was plunged into recession in 2020 as economic activities all but ground to a halt due to lockdowns and border closures.\n\nAfter establishing a so-called \"big-tent coalition\" that gathered together leftist, centrist and right-wing parties, he quickly set to work on building a plan the EU Commission would approve on how the country would spend the €190 billion it would receive from the bloc's €809 billion resilience and recovery fund.\n\nThe plan he put forward, which includes tough reforms in a reform-reticent country, is perhaps his best chance at a lasting legacy.\n\nThese reforms include modernising the country's public administration and justice system as well as liberalising competition rules and updating fiscal policies. The first two have been passed but now need to be implemented but the other measures have few fans.\n\n\"In practice, it's always possible for the next government to refuse to make the reforms,\" Leila Talani, Director of the Centre for Italian Politics at Kings' College London told Euronews.\n\nBut there would be a big catch. The disbursement of these EU funds is tied to the roll-out of these reforms with a tight timetable in place.\n\n\"The Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni, has already said that there cannot be big changes (to the resilience and recovery plan) — only cosmetic changes — and that means that if the reforms are not implemented, they will not get the money,\" she explained.\n\nDraghi's foreign policy chops\n\nBut COVID is not the only crisis \"Super Mario\" has had to steer his country through.\n\nTwelve months into his tenure, Russia launched a full-scale military attack on its neighbour, unleashing dramatic consequences for Ukraine but for Europeans too as it sent energy prices soaring, and pushed inflation to record levels.\n\n\"Ukraine is probably the dossier in which he made the single biggest difference,\" Luigi Scazzieri, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER), told Euronews.\n\nItaly has deep economic ties with Russia which had until now usually translated into a more conciliatory stance towards Russia on foreign policy matters than other Western EU member states.\n\nYet, Draghi was instrumental in getting France and Germany, which were much more sceptical on the issue, to back granting EU candidate status for Ukraine. He was also at the forefront of the effort to boost support for the war-torn country and to impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"He was significantly ahead of Italian public opinion in saying so and definitely in terms of his support for Ukraine,\" Scazzieri said, in particular when it comes to arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nHis clout at the European and international level, which allowed him to table ideas including a cap on Russian gas prices, something that the EU appears to be slowly moving towards despite first ruling it out as too difficult, is meanwhile attributed to \"his gravitas and the fact that he had already been well known, and was very respected.\"\n\nThis — Italy punching above its weight in the EU — is however likely to end with him as Draghi \"was very constructive. He was able to play the game.\"\n\nA more eurosceptic government, such as one helmed by Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni could be more confrontational with the EU and would make it \"harder for her to be included in the at the heart of the more important debates before the choices are made,\" he said.\n\nWhat that means for EU sanctions against Russia, which have to be unanimously approved by the 27 member states, is unclear.\n\nItaly, Talani said, has a close relationship with the US and NATO so even a more pro-Russia right-wing coalition is likely \"to vote for the sanctions because we really do not want to be marginalised so much.\"\n\n\"But still, it could be a matter for discussion, a debate, and we will weaken our position in Europe by doing something like debating or discussing whether or not there should be sanctions,\" she added.\n\nDraghi 'did all he could'\n\nDraghi is unlikely to leave much of a mark on domestic politics despite managing to wrangle all the warring political parties in a grand coalition. His departure is therefore expected to spell the end of Italy's short-lived political stability and a return to the status quo.\n\nWhen asked why Italian voters approve of Draghi yet are likely to elect a right-wing coalition, Scazzieri said that \"at some stage, you need to return to a prime minister that's elected and to a more normal political life.\"\n\n\"There's also the perception that this grand coalition is somewhat unnatural because it was so much riven by infighting that there's the feeling it's better to have a clean either left-wing or right-wing coalition,\" he added.\n\nItaly has had 11 prime ministers since the turn of the century as coalitions are made and implode. The country's next government may not be able to fare much better.\n\n\"There is the possibility that internal contradictions in the centre right will explode and even if they don't explode, they have a lot of internal contradictions. Believe me, they are not really as united as they look out from outside,\" Talani said.\n\nStill, Draghi achieved essentially everything he wanted to, according to Scazzieri.\n\n\"There's this idea that somehow an individual can come and fix all of a country's issues. And there was a lot of that rhetoric with him just because of how competent he was. And I think he was perhaps more realistic in what he thought he could achieve and wanted to try to tie future governments to this reform path.\n\n\"He, realistically, did all he could and now it's down to others to try to collect the baton,\" he said.",
    "At least 10 dead in flooding after Italy is hit by unprecedented rains": "Listen 3 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nROME — Several hours of extraordinary rainfall triggered flooding across a stretch of central Italy early Friday and left at least 10 dead, with several others missing, according to authorities. As the rainfall stopped, rescue crews scrambled through mud and around fallen trees to look for survivors. Some people had taken refuge on rooftops or held onto branches amid the flooding. Italian media reported several searing accounts, including a mother and daughter who were believed to have been swept away while getting out of their car.\n\n“All citizens are ordered to not leave their homes and go to higher floors,” one hard-hit town wrote in an all-caps bulletin on Facebook as the high water surged.\n\nWhile Italy has had deadlier floods over the decades, the event marked yet another example of extreme weather, following a record drought that had sapped lakes and rivers and devastated crops. Fabrizio Curcio, the head of Italy’s civil protection department, said the flooded area over a matter of hours saw “about one-third of the rainfall you’d usually get in a year.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There were moments of terror with truly extraordinary levels of water,” Curcio said.\n\nA spokesman for the civil protection department said the area had been hit with 400 millimeters, or about 15.75 inches, of rain.\n\nWhile it is difficult to connect any single event to climate change, experts say moments of extreme weather are becoming more common — including in Italy, which has seen melting Alpine glaciers, summer wildfires and rising seas that are chipping away at coastal cities.\n\nIn a visit to the flooded region, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said flooding risks had become an “emergency with climate change” and would require steps for prevention, including infrastructure investment.\n\n“It also means tackling climate change,” Draghi said.\n\nThe flooding Friday stretched across the Marche region, from the inland hills to the Adriatic coast. Some mayors of the hard-hit towns noted that there had been no indication that such an extreme event might be coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“[There was] only a yellow alert from the civil protection for wind and rain,” Maurizio Greci, the mayor of Sassoferrato, told Italian radio. “Nothing could foretell such a disaster.”\n\nThe Italian region of Marche experienced deadly flooding on Sept. 16.

    "Will a right-wing win push Italy towards Russia?": "Italy’s national election on Sunday will likely bring to power parties with historically friendly ties to the Kremlin.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin won a fourth term in 2018, some right-wing leaders in Italy were quick to convey their congratulations.\n\n“The will of the people in these Russian elections is unequivocal,” Giorgia Meloni, the head of the Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party, said on social media at the time.\n\nThat remark has resurfaced in recent weeks, with Meloni poised to become Italy’s first female prime minister, after the collapse of Mario Draghi’s government triggered a national election scheduled for Sunday.\n\nBrothers of Italy party is likely to emerge as the largest political camp and forge a right-wing coalition government with Matteo Salvini’s League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.\n\nThe prospect of a coalition with parties that have historically friendly ties to Russia is increasing fears that Rome could nudge closer to Moscow, at a time when Europe is doing all it can to end the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“This debate is a legitimate one,” Aldo Ferrari, the head of the Russia programme at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), told Al Jazeera. “But the importance of [their ties with Moscow] is being blown out of proportion and used in the electoral campaign as a topic to brandish against the adversary.”\n\nMeloni’s main opponent did not hesitate to sound the alarm.\n\nEnrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, portrayed himself as a candidate fighting “for an Italy that will be in the heart of Europe”.\n\n“On the international stage, those who would be happiest if Giorgia Meloni won would be Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and, in Europe, Viktor Orban,” Letta said, referring to the former US president, Russian leader and Hungary’s nationalist, Moscow-friendly premier.\n\nMeloni has sought to soothe concerns by condemning Russia’s “unacceptable large-scale act of war” and stressing Rome’s ties with the European Union and NATO.\n\n“We will be guarantors, without ambiguity, of Italy’s positioning and of our uttermost support to the heroic battle of the Ukrainian people,” Meloni said at her party’s headquarters last month.\n\nAccording to ISPI’s Ferrari, Meloni has “kept a clear stance on Ukraine” and concerns about Russia relations are inflated.\n\n“I don’t see a shift on her positions as likely,” he said.\n\nDisinformation campaign\n\nMeanwhile, the election follows suggestions that foreign actors might have attempted to meddle in voting campaigns.\n\nCOPASIR, the parliamentary committee that oversees national intelligence agencies, raised the possibility of disinformation, cyberattacks and political and economic pressure emerging from Russia, saying Italy was at risk of becoming “the lock pick with which to break Europe’s Atlanticism.”\n\nA report drafted by the committee warned of a “low-intensity war” being fought alongside the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“This is a hybrid warfare within the cyberspace that justifies adopting every measure to protect our digital system,” it said.\n\nFabio Giglietto, who heads the Mapping Italian News research programme at the University of Urbino, said while disinformation was not new, it bears fruit in electoral times.\n\n“We are particularly concerned about strategies that are difficult to observe because they take place away from the political realm,” Giglietto told Al Jazeera.\n\nAmong them are Facebook groups that purport to be apolitical – such as religious groups – but that are used to reach malleable voters.\n\n“If I attempt to reach people who are already politically engaged, it will be difficult for me to change their opinion. Whereas if I have a page dedicated to religion, people are more likely to be receptive and I can reach them when they are less prepared to defend themselves from external influence,” Giglietto said.\n\nAccording to him, fake Facebook accounts are less of a problem than the spread of fake or misleading information.\n\nWhile Brothers of Italy adopted a more conciliatory tone in its official campaign, the ideas circulated on social media by its supporters often match those of the “alt-right” nationalist movement such as a deep distrust of politicians, fears of a left-wing cultural hegemony, and the “war” on free speech.\n\n“Regardless of how they present themselves, these calls point to their ideas being those of the extreme right rather than its moderate wing,” said Giglietto.\n\nMurky past\n\nWhile the Brothers of Italy has tried to blend into the cultural and political mainstream, critics point to the party’s origins, which trace back to the Italian Social Movement founded in the aftermath of World War II by supporters of executed leader Benito Mussolini, the founder of the National Fascist Party.\n\nIn a campaign video message, Meloni affirmed that Italy’s political right had “handed fascism over to history”.\n\nYet, the party is represented to this day by a neo-fascist symbol, a tricoloured flame, and counts some of Mussolini’s descendants as direct allies, including Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, a great-grandson of the leader, who was a Brothers of Italy candidate at the European Parliament in 2019.\n\nMeloni’s allies have also come under the spotlight following allegations of illicit financing from the Kremlin.\n\nSalvini has repeatedly denied wrongdoing after a recording was leaked in 2019 of one of his aides discussing a secret oil deal in Moscow.\n\nBerlusconi, who is set to make a reappearance after a ban preventing him from holding public office was lifted, is known to be friends with Putin, the pair having stayed in each other’s holiday homes.\n\nIn the aftermath of Draghi’s demise in July, foreign minister Luigi Di Maio alleged the Russian leadership was at work to “destabilise Italy and Europe.”\n\nItalian newspapers reported that Salvini’s League and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia were in touch with the Russian embassy weeks before they withdrew support for Draghi’s government, a move which ultimately led to its collapse, prompting speculations that the Kremlin may be meddling in Italian politics. Both denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLast week, a US intelligence report claiming Russia gave $300m to political parties in more than 12 countries jolted Italy’s election campaign and prompted right-wing leaders to swiftly deny receiving clandestine cash.\n\nAdolfo Urso, a senior Brothers of Italy politician who also heads COPASIR told state broadcaster RAI that “at the moment” there was no indication Italy was among the recipients.\n\nAccording to ISPI’s Ferrari, Draghi’s fall was “undoubtedly welcomed” by Russia.\n\nBut while right-wing parties in the past found an ally in Russia on positions including national sovereignty, the current political climate is remarkably different.\n\n“The invasion of Ukraine has now rendered a shift towards Moscow untenable,” he said.",

    "At a Famous Florence Old Masters Fair, Italy’s Impending Elections Have Dealers Fretting About the Future of Its Art Market": "On the eve of a snap general election in Italy, which is looking most likely to see victory for a far-right party with fascist ties, the people of Florence were busy raising glasses to the return of the city’s art week for the first time since the pandemic.\n\nAt the country’s most important Old Masters fair, BIAF, the Biennale Internazionale dell’Antiquariato di Firenze, international curators from the Met and LACMA rubbed elbows with Italian colleagues from the Uffizi Galleries at the elegant mid-17th-century Palazzo Corsini, and buzzed about the attendance of major collectors such as American music producer John Landau (a renowned sculpture connoisseur, who also happens to be Bruce Springsteen’s manager). Elsewhere, in the open-air courtyard of the Palazzo Strozzi, which has been making strides in its quest to attract a younger audience to art, a DJ entertained Instagram art-fluencers at an immersive Olafur Eliasson exhibition.\n\nItaly’s general election—which will take place on Sunday, September 25—was triggered by the resignation of prime minister Mario Draghi earlier this summer amid political infighting and the collapse of his fragile coalition government of left, right, and centrist parties. Currently leading in the polls is the so-called “center-right coalition,” which includes four parties, the biggest of which is Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing, nationalist Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d’Italia), which is rooted in a neo-Fascist party created after the death of Benito Mussolini. There is also Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigration, nationalist Northern League (Lega Nord), and ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s more moderate party Go Italy (Forza Italia).\n\nAmong the 800 attendees of BIAF’s gala dinner, the sentiment surrounding Italy’s political state of play was a general sense of hope that a change of government might bring an opportunity to fix the problems that have been beleaguering Italy’s art market. While the global auction market for Old Masters has had its best first half in five years, growing just under 20 percent and generating $405.9 million (according to data from Artnet’s price database), Italy’s auction market had its worst first half since 2017, with total sales down 27 percent from where they were in 2021. And where the private market for the Old Masters category is also seeing positive movements due to pent-up demand spilling over from lockdown, as evinced by reports from TEFAF Maastricht earlier this year, in Florence people were complaining of a state at “war” with its art dealers.\n\nThe cause of the disgruntlement is Italy’s draconian export laws, which mean that the state must grant a special export license for all objects of cultural importance. Works deemed too important to leave Italy—and there are many—become “notified” and can only be sold domestically, where the state closely watches their movements. BIAF’s chairman, Fabrizio Moretti, confirmed that around 10 percent of the objects on view at the fair were so “notified,” with a further 25 percent lacking an export license, meaning that only around 65 percent of objects could safely be marketed to international clients.\n\nA rediscovered Antonio Canova work at the booth of Rome’s Antonacci Lapiccirella gallery caught more than one bypasser’s attention. But dealer Francesca Antonacci told Artnet News that the rare painting (executed by the neoclassical sculptor on a 16th-century panel as part of an elaborate prank on behalf of his patron), had been notified by the state.\n\n“We have this huge problem in Italy. It’s okay if the state thinks that a work of art is very important and should stay in Italy and be exhibited in museums, but why does the government then not buy it? They just stop us and that’s it,” Antonacci said. “As dealers, we do this difficult work: We discover and restore works of art like the Canova and many others, and then we are punished for it. So we really hope that this will change.”\n\nThe fair’s chairman, Moretti, expressed hope that the future minister of culture, whoever they may be, “will be open to the market.” Which is not to say, he clarified, that they should “open the doors to make works of art leave Italy, but to facilitate more elasticity between the market and the state, to see if we can find a dialogue.”\n\nHe added that this includes reducing the red tape around temporary imports (currently bureaucratic hurdles can take as much as three months to surmount.) “Let’s hope that the future minister will be at least sensible and will be a man of culture. In Italy we haven’t had for many years a man of culture in that position. Only politicians. And I think that is extremely wrong.”\n\nOne drama that has preoccupied politicians in recent years surrounds a series of reforms made in 2015 that allowed foreigners to run major institutions across the country. They were briefly rolled back under the short tenure of populist culture minister Alberto Bonisoli, who favored native Italians in the role. Now, foreign museum directors, such as the German leader of the Uffizi Galleries, Eike Schmidt, might be holding their breath to see whether a nationalist win see the country return to more isolationist cultural positioning.\n\nSeveral Italian exhibitors at the fair there expressed resentment about the great Italian curators leading museums abroad (such as Gabriele Finaldi, the director of London’s National Gallery, or the Getty Museum’s senior paintings curator, Davide Gasparotto). Most agreed that everyone, regardless of their nationality, should be eligible to apply for museum roles, but there was a feeling that they would prefer to see Italians in these posts. As Moretti put it, “Do you think the Louvre would have put somebody not French in that position?”\n\nPalazzo Strozzi director Arturo Galansino is hoping that the elected politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, will recognize the importance of culture as an economic driver. His museum alone generates €60 million for the city per year. “I think all the politicians know that culture is a fundamental asset for Italy, and they should invest more and more in culture because it is evident if you browse around Florence today how important it is in bringing tourism, of course to make the lives of the people better, but also to generate economy.”\n\nHis museum, which is currently hosting a VR exhibit and offers services such as a “teenager kit,” has concentrated its efforts to attract Florence’s youth, particularly during the pandemic, which links to another problem facing politics in Italy: a largely disinterested younger generation. A very unscientific canvasing of fresh-faced partygoers about their voting plans was met with more than one shrug, which seems in line with Italy’s high number of undecided voters, and the estimated 41 percent of the electorate not planning to vote at all, according to Euronews.\n\nThe aging of the guard has also been an issue facing the Old Masters market for years. “The Old Master world needs fresh blood,” Moretti said. Efforts to make the field more alluring were visible at the fair, from QR codes for catalogue information to an increased Instagram presence to a video game aimed at teaching Florentine history. “It’s a problem of culture,” the dealer proselytized. “We’re living today in the lowest moment of culture (in the world, not just in italy) the new generation are ignorant and not educated.”\n\nMoretti said his gallery, Moretti Fine Art, exhibited next to Hauser and Wirth at Frieze Masters to try to reach a new audience, and has just gone into business in London with Emma Ward, former managing director of Dickinson Gallery, on a new venture focused on 19th- and 20th-century artworks. “Contemporary and modern art is a stronger market in the world,” Moretti said. “But we need to try and make these people understand that the Old Masters is the beginning. You can’t understand a modern picture if you haven’t studied the old masters. And also in terms of investment, Old Masters today are very cheap with respect to modern pieces.”\n\nThe dialogue between old and new was also a concern identified by Florence’s social-democratic mayor, Dario Nardella. “Florence is not only an unbelievable capital of cultural heritage but it is also an important actor on the contemporary stage,” Nardella told Artnet News. “This is our challenge: to be a big contemporary city, not only a city-museum, but also a living city capital of creativity, and innovation. This is the best way to keep the memory of the renaissance.”\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:",
    "Pope urges Italians to help migrants as far right tipped to win election": "Pope Francis has urged Italians to help migrants as voting proceeded in a general election widely expected to bring an anti-immigration rightwing coalition into power.\n\nSpeaking at the end of an open-air mass in the southern Italian city of Matera, the pope recalled that Sunday coincided with the Catholic church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. “Migrants are to be welcomed, accompanied, promoted and integrated,” he told the assembled faithful.\n\n“Let us renew our commitment to building the future in accordance with God’s plan: a future in which migrants and refugees may live in peace and with dignity.”\n\nFrancis made no direct reference to the election, but his message rang loud and clear throughout the country as millions of Italians queued to elect a new government.\n\nMigration has been a central theme in the electoral campaign of extreme right parties, led by the leader of Brothers of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who could become the country’s first far-right leader since Mussolini and who once said Italians needed to “repatriate the migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them”.\n\nThis summer, Meloni and another of her coalition leaders, Matteo Salvini, a former interior minister who made high-profile moves to block the arrival of asylum seekers at Italian ports, have rallied against what they described as fake refugees and portrayed the arrival of people seeking asylum in Italy as an “invasion”.\n\nMeloni, whose party has roots in neo-fascism, said that if she becomes prime minister, she intends to put in place a naval blockade in the Mediterranean to stop migration to Italy.\n\n“May the Kingdom of God be realised with them, without exclusion,” said the pope. “And we can thank these ‘brothers and sisters’ as they can help our communities grow and flourish economically, culturally and spiritually.”\n\nIt is not the first time the pope has criticised far-right parties and their anti-migration stances. Francis has previously criticised former US president Donald Trump and the “new culture of defending territories by building walls”, which has “brought so many headaches and so much suffering”. He has also urged Hungary to “extend its arms towards everyone” in an apparent veiled criticism of Viktor Orbán’s anti-migrant policies.\n\nLast year, returning from a visit to Lesbos, the Greek island long at the centre of Europe’s refugee crisis, Francis attacked Europe, citing its indifference and cynical disregard while people continue to die during sea crossings.\n\nOn Sunday, Francis also asked Italians to have more children. “I’d like to ask Italy: more births, more children,” he said. Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world and Francis has frequently lamented its “demographic winter”.\n\nThe 85-year-old Francis appeared tired during the visit, which was scheduled before Italy’s snap elections were called and came a day after he made a separate trip to the Umbrian hilltop town of Assisi.

    "'It would be a joy to be Italy's PM,' League leader says": "Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party, gestures in front of a screen, at a rally ahead of the Sept. 25 snap election, in Pontida, Italy, September 18, 2022. REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo\n\nSummary Italy holds national elections on Sept. 25\n\nLeague annual party returns after pandemic hiatus\n\nSalvini is lagging behind Meloni in the polls\n\nPromises to push for autonomy for regions, tax cuts\n\nPONTIDA, Italy, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The rightist League aims to win the Italian premiership when the country holds an election next week, its leader Matteo Salvini told his party's annual rally in northern Italy on Sunday.\n\nA conservative alliance of parties, including the League, is widely expected to win the Sept. 25 election. But it is likely to be a bittersweet moment for Salvini who has seen his position as undisputed leader of the right usurped by Giorgia Meloni.\n\n\"For me, it would be a pride, a joy, a thrill to be chosen by you and President Sergio Mattarella as prime minister of this extraordinary country,\" Salvini said before thousands of flag-waving supporters in Pontida, the spiritual home of his party.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nMeloni's nationalist Brothers of Italy party is forecast to take around 25% of the vote, while the League is seen at around 12%, down from 34% in a European parliament election in 2019.\n\nSome League veterans have suggested that Salvini could be ousted if the vote share falls further, but diehard supporters rejected any talk of failure on Sunday.\n\n\"They might receive less votes but I am confident the centre-right will win... and given it is a coalition they will rule all together,\" said supporter Marco Mollica, a 39-year-old metalworker from Turin.\n\nThe League returned to Pontida - where it held its first annual rally in 1990 - after a three-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nParty officials said a fleet of more than 200 buses and trains brought an estimated 100,000 supporters from across the country this year.\n\nHowever, the crowd seemed smaller than in 2019, when 35,000 to 40,000 people were estimated to have attended, and two policemen told Reuters that there were around 15,000 participants.\n\nThe Northern League was originally rooted in the wealthy north, with the then leader Umberto Bossi demanding secession from the poorer south. Salvini controversially stripped the word \"northern\" from the party name and pushed to create a national force - a decision that upset many of the old faithful.\n\nGUARANTEED SECOND-HAND\n\nSalvini promised that if the League formed part of the next government it would push for autonomy for regions, giving them more say over how locally raised taxes are spent - something the nationalist Meloni has appeared lukewarm about.\n\n\"Autonomy rewards those who govern well and helps citizens because it takes the mask off the chatterers who leave their people in emergency for years and say it is always the fault of others,\" he said.\n\nSalvini, 49, rebuilt the party from near ruin when he took charge nine years ago, replacing the old independence battle cries with the slogan \"Italians first\" and replacing chants against Rome with insults directed at Brussels.\n\nHis strategy appeared to work, with the League forming a coalition government in 2018 and Salvini himself becoming interior minister. But a series of political blunders since then have allowed his ally Meloni to leapfrog him in the polls.\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, ministers and regional governors of the League formally committed to giving greater autonomy to regions and pursuing cuts in taxes and energy bills. They also promised to lower the retirement age, stop immigrant landings and to improve the justice system.\n\nIn his speech, Salvini vowed to scrap the 90-euro tax Italians pay annually to fund the state-owned broadcaster RAI and to revitalise small villages by making them a real estate tax-free zone.\n\nHe also pledged loyalty to Meloni and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.\n\n\"Giorgia, Silvio and I have the same view on everything, almost everything, and for five years we will be ruling well together,\" he said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Federico Maccioni; Editing by Giselda Vagnoni and Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Unpacking Italy's Political Future": "On July 20, Italy’s government collapsed after right-wing lawmakers staged a walkout from a vote of confidence for Prime Minister Mario Draghi. As elections approach in less than ten days, the right-wing Fratelli d’Italia led by Giorgia Meloni is widely expected to seize the premiership, in a coalition including other parties on the Italian right with well known links to Russia. What does a Meloni-led government look like for Italy and for Europe as a whole? What does this mean for human rights in Italy, and for the transatlantic relationship? Will coalition parties' ties with Putin steer Italy away from its support of Ukraine?
