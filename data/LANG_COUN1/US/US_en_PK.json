    "Pakistan’s Biblical Floods and the Case for Climate Reparations": "We have tried, in various ways, to convey to the world the scale of destruction caused by recent floods in Pakistan, because, apparently, a third of the country underwater and thirty-three million lives upended doesn’t cut it. Pakistan’s climate minister has called it Biblical. We have shot and shared videos in which the landmark New Honeymoon Hotel crumbles in the duration of a TikTok. The U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, who is seventy-three and has called the climate crisis a “code red for humanity,” visited Pakistan and said that he hadn’t seen this scale of climate carnage in his life. Some of us have created maps showing that the areas underwater are larger than Britain. We have shown pictures of dead and starving cattle to appeal to animal-lovers. We have posted videos of puppies being heroically rescued from rushing waters.\n\nMaybe when the world seems to be ending, it needs poets. A poet in Khairpur, in southern Pakistan, one of the worst-affected areas, was asked by a journalist if he had received a tent to shelter his family. He found the idea so improbable that he asked, “Why are you making fun of me? Why would anyone give me a tent?” Pakistanis are saying that charity tents and emergency supplies are welcome, but what we need and want is compensation for climate-related loss and damage. Although much of the world seems to agree in principle, there is a we-have-all-heard-this-before weariness in the air. Our innovative communications have little impact. The U.S. has offered fifty million dollars and “long-term” support, the U.N. has appealed for a hundred and sixty million, France has offered to hold a donors’ conference, Angelina Jolie has flown in and said that she’s never seen such devastation. President Biden casually mentioned at the U.N. General Assembly that Pakistan “needs help,” without any specifics. This all sounds like a lot until you remember that Pakistan’s losses are estimated to be around thirty billion dollars.\n\nExperts have pointed out that this is not the kind of flood that causes weeks of havoc and then leaves behind fertile lands. Six months from now, flooded fields still may not be ready for cultivation. Most people affected by the floods live off the land, from crop to crop. Waterborne diseases and food shortages are already rampant. Climate scientists who have studied Pakistani floods have concluded that they can only predict more unpredictability.\n\nScientists are clear, however, that the catastrophe in Pakistan is linked to global warming. Pakistan generates less than one per cent of the world’s carbon emissions. We are quite good at blaming ourselves and our governments for our misfortunes, but global warming is overwhelmingly caused by rich folks living thousands of miles away, mostly in the West, by people who know that their air-conditioned homes and midsize cars and Caribbean holidays have snatched away the home and livelihood of someone in a village in Pakistan.\n\nThe West sees its culpability in this man-made disaster but prefers to blame the victim. I think of a fable that I grew up with, in which a lamb drinks from a river downstream until a lion accuses it of polluting the river upstream. In the version of the fable that I remember, the lion eats the lamb as punishment. Imagine this: the driver of an S.U.V. speeds into a country lane, hits a person on a bicycle, and then, instead of paying damages, asks the cyclist to drive an electric vehicle powered by renewable energy. The driver of the S.U.V. wonders why the cyclist wasn’t more resilient, and asks, “Why didn’t you plan for a future where my car might come and destroy your bicycle and break your leg? You could have prepared for a better future, for apocalyptic floods, but what did you do? You prepared a petition for reparations? And you don’t even have a practical plan for how these reparations would work?”\n\nThose calling for climate reparations received an answer from America’s climate envoy, John Kerry, at the U.N. General Assembly last week. “You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, ’cause that’s what it costs,” he said, perhaps steeling himself for difficult questions at November’s global climate conference, COP27, in Egypt. Western governments do have trillions of dollars, and they have had more than a decade to think through how climate reparations should work. Kerry sounded like he was haggling over the price of life jackets with drowning people.\n\nMaybe Pakistan could have handled the current floods better if we had done our homework. We had a massive flood in 2010, experts were flown in, reports and studies were commissioned and then shelved. But Pakistan, like its Western allies, had other priorities: we were busy in neighboring Afghanistan, helping America defeat the Taliban, or maybe helping the Taliban defeat America—we are still not sure. On the other border, we were busy with India. Even in the week of our Biblical floods, we managed to finalize a deal with the United States worth four hundred and fifty million dollars, to upgrade our F-16 fighter planes. We may not know how we are going to feed our people for the next six months, but we have made sure that we can keep them safe from hostile aircraft.\n\nLike Westerners, Pakistani élites planned for security and progress. We turned agricultural lands into golf courses and gated communities, and built houses on riverbeds, and grew cash crops along waterways. We thought less about the millions who live in mud houses, who till someone else’s land to feed their kids and save a bit in hopes of sending them to school one day. Now the water has turned their houses back into mud, and washed away the grain that they stocked for the entire year, and flooded the land that still belongs to someone else. They dare not dream of justice, let alone climate justice.\n\nExperts tell us that the world suffers from donor fatigue, what with a war in Ukraine, in which people with fair skin and blue eyes are fleeing their homes and fighting for their lives. What goes unsaid is that hearts have been hardened by repeated images of brown mothers cradling skeletal children who are covered in flies, along overflowing rivers or scorched fields. Or maybe rich nations think that they should save their money for when the disasters come for them.\n\nSometimes my own compatriots tell the world, If you don’t listen, it could happen to you. The West seems unfazed by this logic: climate carnage has happened there, is happening there. Perhaps the West fears that if it acknowledges any debt to a country like Pakistan, it will no longer be able to withhold what it owes its own citizens. A childhood friend lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for most of his life, and in the span of a year his house and business were destroyed thrice, first by Hurricane Laura, then snow, then flooding. He reluctantly put his house up for sale, moved to Los Angeles, and slowly started to build a life. The aid that the government promised to Lake Charles hasn’t arrived. After Hurricane Maria, hundreds of thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico were denied federal assistance. They were still vulnerable when Hurricane Fiona brought floods and blackouts again, this week. The lamb does not escape the lion by showing a U.S. passport.\n\nA global climate movement has made people aware of their carbon footprint, of the impact of their eating habits, of the evils of fossil-fuel companies, but it has yet to convince people that they and their governments can and should pay for what they helped to destroy. They must, because the losses and damages will only grow, and because the West became rich from the burning of fossil fuels, and because the village that is drowning may one day be their own.\n\nWhen rich nations refuse to acknowledge that countries such as Pakistan need climate reparations, they not only shirk their responsibility now but set a precedent of inaction and impunity, even within their own borders. They seem to say, We can build walls so high that the polluted air will only poison you. When it melts glaciers, only you will drown, and when your fields are flooded, only you will go hungry. We can give you a few thousand tents to shelter your millions, or rafts to float you over what used to be self-sustaining villages, but we don’t owe you anything. If it happens to us, rich countries seem to say, we won’t starve. We can always eat you. ♦",

    "How the U.S. is helping Pakistan overcome severe floods": "The United States and partner organizations continue to provide support for Pakistan’s recovery from disastrous floods that have affected 33 million people.\n\nThe U.S. government has provided more than $56 million in flood relief and humanitarian assistance for Pakistan this year. More than $50 million of the assistance has come through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The State Department provided an additional $2 million to support the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ response effort in Pakistan, and $1.4 million in Defense Department funding helped airlift supplies.\n\nThe funding helps provide food, drinking water, nutrition, sanitation, shelter assistance and other aid to the country, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding, landslides and glacial lake outbursts. Nearly 1,600 people have been killed and an estimated 12,900 injured, USAID said.\n\n“We’ll continue to provide assistance to our partners in this time of need,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said September 13, noting that U.S. and Pakistani officials have been working together to assess the damage.\n\nA USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team and Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority have worked together to assess damage and identify priority humanitarian needs.\n\nU.S., partners provide assistance\n\nU.S. assistance supports partners’ efforts to reduce hunger and disease risk after floods destroyed 1.8 million hectares of cropland and damaged sanitation systems.\n\nUSAID supports the U.N. World Food Programme’s distribution of food and cash assistance to buy food for approximately 341,500 people across Pakistan. The effort brings wheat, yellow split peas, vegetable oil, iodized salt and supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition.\n\nUSAID partner organization Concern Worldwide, headquartered in Dublin, is providing safe drinking water, hygiene items and water removal services for 283,000 people. “Concern is also providing shelter repair kits, tools, kitchen sets and plastic sheeting to help people whose houses have been damaged or destroyed,” USAID says.\n\nTo deliver assistance quickly, USAID asked that the Defense Department airlift supplies to hard-hit areas. U.S. Air Force cargo planes delivered nearly 630 metric tons of relief supplies from USAID’s warehouse in Dubai to Pakistan, completing the mission September 16.\n\nU.S. government–built schools have served as shelters for displaced people after floods damaged or destroyed more than 2 million homes.\n\n“The United States is deeply saddened for the flood victims and the loss of loved ones, livelihoods, and homes throughout Pakistan,” USAID said in a September 9 statement. “We stand with communities in Pakistan during this difficult time and will continue to help them in this time of need.”",
    "Military Helicopter Crashes in Southwest Pakistan, 6 Soldiers Killed": "Pakistan’s military said Monday that one of its helicopters crashed in a turbulent southwestern district, killing all six soldiers on board.\n\nThe helicopter went down during a “flying mission” in Khost, a remote town in the province of Baluchistan late on Sunday and two major-ranked officers were among the dead, an army statement said. It shared no further details, nor did it give any reason for the crash or type of aircraft.\n\nThe so-called Balochistan Liberation Army insurgent group claimed in a statement it had shot down the helicopter. It said the helicopter had arrived in the area to rescue two army officers BLA militants had kidnapped in an ambush in the district.\n\nThe claims could not be verified immediately from independent sources and insurgents often release exaggerated details about their activities in the region.\n\nOutlawed ethnic Baluch groups routinely plot attacks against military targets in the impoverished Pakistani province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nEarly last month, six senior Pakistani military officers were killed when their helicopter crashed due to bad weather during a flood relief activity in Baluchistan’s Lasbela district. An army lieutenant general, a major-general and a brigadier were among those killed.\n\nHeavy monsoon rains have caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Pakistan, including Baluchistan, killing more than 1,600 people and washing away villages, roads, bridges and hundreds of thousands of homes since mid-June.",
    "‘Heart-breaking’: Irish priest says Pakistan flooding still critical": "Parishioners affected by the flooding sleep in makeshift shelters in Badin, where the Columban missionaries are helping relief efforts. Columban Father Liam O’Callaghan told Catholic News Service there was “an urgent need for relief aid,” and he appealed to Catholics worldwide to respond. (Credit: CNS photo/Courtesy Father Liam O’Callaghan.)\n\nDUBLIN — An Irish missionary priest in Pakistan said the “sheer scale” of the flooding disaster is “hard to comprehend” and “the misery of people, camped on the side of the road with their meager belongings, is heart-breaking to see.”\n\nColumban Father Liam O’Callaghan told CNS there was “an urgent need for relief aid,” and he appealed to Catholics worldwide to respond.\n\n“The reality is shocking. The infrastructure — like roads, bridges, rail lines, schools, health centers — is so damaged. Where do you start? It will take years to repair,” he said via Zoom from the Columban-run parish of St. Thomas the Apostle in Badin, a rural city in the Diocese of Hyderabad in Sindh province.\n\nThe Pakistani government has declared a national emergency. More than 1,100 people died and many more were injured in the flooding caused by this year’s significantly heavier monsoon rains, which deluged the South Asian country over a two-month period. More than 220,000 houses were destroyed and another 500,000 were damaged.\n\nAid agencies are finding it difficult to get into the areas where relief is most needed due to the damage caused to hundreds of bridges and thousands of miles of road. The economic losses are estimated to be over $10 billion.\n\nO’Callaghan, who has been working in Pakistan since 1998, said that while the whole country has been suffering, Sindh and Balochistan provinces, in the south and southwest, have been the worst-affected by the floods.\n\nThe country experienced nearly 190 percent more rain than the 30-year average in this year’s monsoon season, with Sindh province getting 466 percent more rain than the average.\n\n“There has been six months of extreme weather and climate chaos, a cocktail starting with the heat wave in March and April. March was one of the hottest on record, with 60 percent less rainfall. That was followed by heavier monsoon rains, and the glacier melts in the north filled the rivers,” O’Callaghan explained.\n\n“In Sindh province, where the Columbans work, the situation is still critical. The majority of the province is under water at the moment. The sheer scale is hard to comprehend. In places it is like looking out on a lake as far as the eye can see,” he said in late September.\n\nThe area along the flood plain of the Indus River was badly affected. “About 2 million acres of cultivated crops have been wiped out, and many hundreds of thousands of livestock have been lost. This will lead to food shortages and food inflation over the coming months,” the priest said.\n\nHe added that he is worried about the impact of the coming winter and the challenge of waterborne diseases linked to the lack of sanitation and clean drinking water. Cholera, malaria and dengue fever are likely to thrive in stagnant flood waters.\n\nIn Badin and Khipro, where the Columbans work, many parishioners have been affected. The missionaries have been helping to distribute food rations, tents, mosquito nets, and medical aid to the most vulnerable families.\n\nChristians are a small minority in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. O’Callaghan said they tend to be poor tenant farmers.\n\n“Their lives were already fragile, and the flooding has made it even worse,” he said.\n\nThe relief effort could last for months, while house reconstruction will come later.\n\n“There are big questions such as where do you rebuild?” said O’Callaghan. “Those worst affected were already the poorest who were living in areas prone to flooding.”\n\nThe priest, a member of Hyderabad Diocesan Climate Change Group, warns that there is “an urgent need for wealthy countries to reduce greenhouse emissions.”\n\n“Pakistan has contributed very little to emissions, but it is in countries like Pakistan that the effects of the climate crisis are worst. The church needs to take more seriously the ecological teaching of Pope Francis and use its moral authority in the corridors of power.”",
    "Flood-ravaged Pakistan’s leader appeals for urgent global support in UN address": "“No words can describe the shock we are living through or how the face of the country lies transformed,” Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif told the General Assembly’s annual high-level debate.\n\n“For 40 days and 40 nights a biblical flood poured down on us, smashing centuries of weather records, challenging everything we knew about disaster, and how to manage it.”\n\nNo starker evidence of global warming\n\nClose to eight million people have been displaced by the disaster, according to the UN, which along with the authorities and partners have continued to reach affected populations with desperately needed relief items. To date, more than 1,500 people have been killed, including 552 children.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that some 33 million people are now at risk of health hazards; more than 13,000 kilometres of roads have been damaged; one million homes have been destroyed and another million damaged; and four million acres of crops have been washed away.\n\n“Pakistan has never seen a starker and more devastating example of the impact of global warming,” he stressed. “Life in Pakistan has changed forever.”\n\nOn his visit to the country earlier this month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he had never seen “climate carnage on this scale,” and called for urgent financial support to help Pakistan, saying it is not just a question of solidarity but a question of justice.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted: “Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing. Our actions did not contribute to this.”\n\nHe added that the current priority is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of destitution, which requires a stable external environment.\n\nSustainable peace in South Asia\n\n“Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia, however, remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. At the heart of this longstanding dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination,” he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister added that in a “classic settler-colonial project,” India is seeking to turn the Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu-majority territory through “illegal demographic changes.”\n\n“Millions of fake ‘domicile certificates’ have been issued to non-Kashmiris; Kashmiri land and properties are being seized; electoral districts have been gerrymandered; and over 2.5 million non-Kashmiri illegal voters fraudulently registered. All this is in blatant violation of Security Council resolutions and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.”\n\nHe called on the United Nations and the Secretary-General to play their rightful role in urging India to implement existing UN resolutions on this issue.\n\nThe position of the UN on this region is governed by the UN Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions. The Secretary-General maintains that the final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir is to be reached by peaceful means, in accordance with the UN Charter and bilateral agreements.",

    "Pakistan's prime minister talks Kashmir, floods at UN": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nUNITED NATIONS — Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif appealed for a peaceful end to the dispute over Kashmir and deplored regional instability, invoking the perennial themes of Pakistan’s U.N. addresses after dedicating the first half of his speech Friday to the ravages of recent floods. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The flood-induced devastation, which Sharif described in biblical terms, means it’s incumbent on Pakistan to “ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of poverty and hunger,” he said.\n\nBut in order to do so, Sharif said, Pakistan needs a “stable external environment” — that means peace in South Asia, which he said hinges on a resolution of the decadeslong dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n“At the heart of this longstanding dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination,” Sharif said, outlining what he called India’s “relentless campaign of repression” and “serial brutalization” of Kashmiris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and has been claimed by both since they won independence from the British empire 75 years ago.\n\nSharif accused India of its own colonial ambitions by trying to change Kashmir’s demographics from majority Muslim to majority Hindu. While he described Islamophobia as “a global phenomenon,” he specifically accused India’s Hindu nationalist government of engaging in “the worst manifestation of Islamophobia.”\n\nIndia — which has said Kashmir is an internal matter and one of law and order — is scheduled to speak at the General Assembly on Saturday. Rights groups have accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing party of looking the other way and sometimes enabling hate speech against Muslims. Modi’s party denies the accusations, but India’s Muslims say attacks against them and their faith have increased sharply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two South Asian nations lobbed barbs past one another later in the night, each invoking the right of reply. An Indian diplomat shot back at Sharif by accusing the prime minister of seeking to “obfuscate misdeeds in his own country and to justify actions against India that the world considers unacceptable.”\n\nDuring his afternoon speech, Sharif also spoke at length about regional instability and terrorism — of which he called Pakistan “the principal victim.”\n\nHe presented a marked contrast from his flashy yet conservative predecessor, Imran Khan, who dedicated much of last year’s speech to accusing the United States of victimizing Pakistan. Khan was ousted in April after losing a no-confidence vote.\n\nDressed in a sober business suit instead of Khan’s favored waistcoat-and-salwar-kameez combination, Sharif didn’t once mention the United States by name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was impassioned, at times vigorously tapping the rostrum or demonstratively bringing his fists together, but his words struck a less combative tone.\n\n“Pakistan is a partner for peace,” Sharif said before departing from prepared remarks: “But Mr. President, peace can only be ensured and guaranteed when the rights of communities who have been suffering over decades, and subjugated over decades, earn their freedom and are respected.”\n\nSharif’s speech also represented a departure from last year, when Khan expressed optimism about the then-incipient Taliban rule in Afghanistan and exhorted the General Assembly not to isolate the new government. A year later, no U.N. member state has recognized the Taliban government.\n\n“Pakistan would also like to see an Afghanistan which is at peace with itself and the world, and which respects and nurtures all its citizens, without regard to gender, ethnicity and religion,” he said, avoiding direct mention of its current government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbove all, he echoed a fear common to countries who typically do not dominate the global discourse: “My real worry is about the next stage of this challenge, when the cameras would have gone or left this august assembly and the story just shifts away to conflicts like Ukraine,” he said of the flooding recovery. “My question is, will we be left alone, high and dry?”\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of the U.N.

    "The Metaverse opens up a world of possibilities for Pakistan. Can we take advantage?": "Pakistan should consciously pull back and refocus exclusively on technologies shaping the future.\n\nListen to article 1x 1.2x 1.5x\n\nIt feels wrong to mention Pakistan and the Metaverse in the same sentence. The latter is the oncoming pinnacle of human technology, while the former is a developing country, stuck in what seems to be a perpetual cycle of economic and geopolitical turmoil. It seems Pakistan will be the last country to enter the Metaverse in any shape or form.\n\nHowever, Pakistan’s troubles are already a known quantity. This article is an attempt to chart a better future, not wail about the past or the present.\n\nWhat is the Metaverse?\n\nThe Metaverse is the successor to today’s Internet. Think of the Metaverse as a universe of inter-connected virtual words. And just like smartphone users jump between apps on mobile devices, Metaverse users will jump from one world to another without needing to return to real life.\n\nSo who is building this Metaverse?\n\nMany companies. Our state of technology is naturally advancing in such a direction that the Metaverse is emerging ipso facto. It’s like how the Internet emerged in the 1990s, through the interplay of rising consumer expectations, and the confluence of various technological advances in the decades before. Those same demand and supply forces are at work now. And while we’re beginning to sense traces of the Metaverse, our children will see it in full bloom.\n\nDon’t think of the Metaverse as merely a virtual twin of your existing life. Instead, consider it an array of alternative realities with unexpected possibilities and psychological effects. The Metaverse will change how humans interact with technology, with one another, and with the world. Ultimately, it will even upend the concept of what a world is.\n\nWhy does the Metaverse matter?\n\nIt matters because of the economic value up for grabs. I’ll illustrate with a comparison.\n\nThe advent of the Internet made most industries go “digital”. And now, 30 years later, about 15 per cent of the world economy is purely digital, while the remaining 85pc is digitally enhanced. So the Internet’s footprint is everywhere.\n\nExpect the Metaverse to take over the global economy at a comparable rate and in a similar timeframe.\n\nMoreover, if going digital was a big shift, this next one would be even bigger due to the increasing criticality of technology to economic activity. Some expect the Metaverse will generate more than 10 trillion dollars in value and tens of millions of new jobs.\n\nThe economic pie up for grabs is so enormous that the advent of the Metaverse will probably reshuffle the world order — among both the corporate world and governments. Amid this reshuffle will arise an opportunity for a developing country like Pakistan.\n\nPakistan’s entry into the Metaverse\n\nWhenever something has a strong demand, those best positioned to supply it get rewarded handsomely. So it pays to position yourself for a future that is approaching. This fundamental principle turned around the fortunes of many countries during the digital revolution — India and China being two notable examples from Pakistan’s neighbourhood.\n\nMany years ago, I proposed a menu of ambitious tech-related suggestions to Pakistani decision-makers. But my proposal was too expansive, requiring a lot of bandwidth and resources. Pakistan was not ready for it (nor is it ready yet). So taking note of that, I’ve tweaked my doctrine. I now believe Pakistan should consciously pull back and refocus exclusively on technologies shaping the future. Otherwise, it will be spreading itself too thin. In essence, being lightweight and focused is the need of the hour.\n\nSo in light of that, here are some suggestions for the Pakistani state:\n\nCreate a think tank: The state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy.\n\nThe state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy. Formulate a Metaverse policy: Why is this policy needed? Firstly, to take advantage of the upcoming Metaverse economy. Secondly, to regulate virtual experiences that could have harmful psychosomatic effects (for example, porn in virtual reality). And thirdly, to address data collection, usage, rights, and penalties. The Metaverse will capture much more user data than social media. Cameras, microphones, and sensors will record nearly every movement, every word, every expression, and much more in the Metaverse. Pakistan needs a Metaverse policy right away, before tech giants swoop in and goad government officials into signing contracts that enslave Pakistan’s virtual future on the pretext of globalisation.\n\nWhy is this policy needed?

Pakistan needs a Metaverse policy right away, before tech giants swoop in and goad government officials into signing contracts that enslave Pakistan’s virtual future on the pretext of globalisation. Incentivise service providers: Pakistan has a growing community of tech service providers. Their primary bread and butter is building websites and apps for foreign clients. Through sweeteners, the state can incentivise this developer community to start compiling a portfolio of Metaverse projects. This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time.\n\nPakistan has a growing community of tech service providers.

This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time. Align academia: Huge advances in computational resources, blockchains, bandwidth, networking, and AI-based optimisations are needed to make the Metaverse possible. Likewise, expertise in 3D and VR modelling, animations, and using APIs to create immersive 3D experiences is also growing in demand. Pakistani university curriculum and research should nurture these competencies among scholars. Accordingly, technology universities can be mandated to offer relevant courses, or at least one ‘Metaverse 101’ course. In case of a shortage of competent professors, a suitable online course or seminar can be made compulsory (for example, Stanford’s). A small start like this can someday snowball into a more meaningful curriculum upgrade as the Metaverse matures in the future.\n\nI’ve deliberately kept these recommendations simple and low-fidelity. Expecting costly overhauls is unrealistic, given Pakistan’s economic travails. So let’s take baby steps first and delay significant strides for later.\n\nMetaverse use cases for Pakistan\n\nSo which industries in Pakistan can benefit the most from Metaverse-related technology? An obvious answer is game development startups from Pakistan’s tech sector. But what about beyond the obvious? Let’s explore:\n\nEducation: Covid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom. That’s where the Metaverse shines. Immersive virtual reality transcends video calls, making your dominant senses feel you are present in the virtual experience. I’ve seen jaws drop when people experience this for the first time. So making use of this effect, top-tier Pakistani universities can introduce a course or two taught directly in VR. For example, it could be a course with guest lecturers from around the world, giving unforgettably immersive, interactive lectures to scholars. Note that entry-level VR devices cost roughly as much as mid-range smartphones. So it isn’t unthinkable for top-tier Pakistani universities, colleges, or schools to procure a dozen VR devices for learning. In the short run, this move will differentiate these institutions from their competition. But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways.\n\nCovid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom.

But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways. Real estate: The best way to illustrate this is via an example. In July, UAE’s largest real estate company Damac declared a $100 million investment in Metaverse technology. Damac’s GM explained the rationale behind this investment: “we sell AED 100 million monthly over Zoom calls without any immersive technology. With the Metaverse, we can sell AED 700-800 million a month to customers in California, New York, or Miami”. This rationale also partly applies to Pakistan, given how hungry Pakistan’s real estate sector is for overseas investment.\n\nThe best way to illustrate this is via an example.

We’re already seeing virtual fashion brands like ‘dressx’ making a mark and virtual influencers like ‘lilmiquela’ playing muse to fashion houses on Instagram. Pakistan has a burgeoning fashion scene, with designers gaining international traction over the years. Expanding into virtual fashion and influencers will open up new revenue streams for such designers, helping create a reputation for innovation among their international clientele.\n\nAs the Metaverse takes off, so will virtual fashion.

Expanding into virtual fashion and influencers will open up new revenue streams for such designers, helping create a reputation for innovation among their international clientele. Defence and security: Pakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate. Equally, engineers at organisations such as the Institute of Optronics would do well to integrate augmented reality (AR) capabilities in the night and thermal vision gear they’re developing. There’s also massive potential for AR-enriched training systems, ranging from traditional combat training to anti-terrorism exercises. The tech created will eventually have export potential, apart from virtuously spilling over to the local economy. I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts.\n\nPakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate.

I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts. Tourism: Imagine 3D videos and immersive VR that depict flying like a bird over valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan, virtually climbing Himalayan peaks, or experiencing the best camping sites in Pakistan. Such technology will let anyone in the world experience a slice of Pakistan’s natural beauty from the comfort of their home. Marketing like that will naturally pique a lot of interest and vigorously feed Pakistan’s tourism. Remember that tourism promotion is usually tax-funded, so the government must take the lead and engage private sector solution providers for such Metaverse projects.\n\nCrisis relief: Pakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Donations are critical in such cases; however, donor fatigue is increasing by the day. The Metaverse can help with this. It can allow potential donors experience the horrors of the calamity firsthand as if they are there. Grab a VR headset and experience life in a Syrian refugee camp via Clouds over Sidra to see what I mean. There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note.\n\nPakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note. Skills training: Be it professional sportsmen, medical staff, machine operators, or health and safety professionals, high-quality training is a vital ingredient for productivity and excellence. The Metaverse can facilitate such training effectively while offering substantial time and cost savings. For instance, imagine virtual training for handling rare but costly scenarios in factories or facing a thousand virtual bouncers from the world’s fastest bowler to perfect your hook shot. Through such immersive training, PSL franchises, manufacturing plants, hospitals, and retail corporations can all level up. The tech is available now. It’s not science fiction.\n\nThe above isn’t an exhaustive list of suggestions; it’s more intended to stimulate minds and get the ball rolling.\n\nForming a consensus\n\nThis article means nothing if it cannot spur action. Yet, pessimism has so overtaken the zeitgeist that the Metaverse sounds like a distant dream for affluent times.\n\nHowever, we must realise that the world always tends to gravitate toward chaos. It’s a law of nature. There will never be a “perfect time”. Instead, Pakistan will need to consciously, effortfully turn the tide, one step at a time. The tide won’t turn automagically.\n\n“We can’t even make bicycles”. That sounds like a Pakistani quote, but it was in fact muttered by a prominent Israeli parliamentarian in 1951, who used the faltering bicycle industry to criticise a proposal to establish a futuristic Israeli aerospace company. Although it was deemed unrealistic, the proposal somehow went through.\n\nAs a result, the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) was born. Today, IAI is one of Israel’s biggest employers. It has helped the country evolve from a land that could not manufacture bicycles to being one of the largest exporters of technology in the world. Big things have small beginnings.\n\nPakistan itself is no stranger to humble origins. The evolution of its nuclear programme is a testament to Pakistanis innovating when pushed against the wall.\n\nInternally, Pakistan’s nuclear programme mostly had broad support, cutting through egos, party lines, and civil-military friction. Key stakeholders wanted to get it done by hook or crook, no matter what it took. Why? Because the existential threats they faced brought them clarity. This clarity enabled them to act in unison. And that, in turn, created results greater than the sum of the parts. It’s akin to the physics principle of resonance but played out in the arena of human decision-making.\n\nSo far, innovative technology (such as the Metaverse) is a politically neutral subject in Pakistan. Hence, it can potentially enjoy broad support across the spectrum, like the country’s nuclear programme.\n\nHowever, let’s also be pragmatic. Pakistan remains a patronage economy, where it’s about who you know, not what you know. Cronyism is the name of the game. And the problem with cronyism is that even well-intentioned cronies get caught up in turf wars. The result is politics, not progress.\n\nWhile it remains largely unblemished to date, the adoption of innovative technology in Pakistan can still be toxified by factors such as those mentioned above. If that happens, the country’s technology aspirations will suffer a paralysing deadlock for decades, with another generation or two wasted like cannon fodder. Once humans dive into the rabbit hole of factionalism, common sense evaporates and nightmares come true. Case in point: Covid-19 was politicised in the US, leading to Americans taking their vaccine denialism to the next level, despite suffering the world’s largest tally of Covid deaths. It would be comical if it weren’t so tragic.\n\nIn short, Pakistan must adopt guardrails that ensure innovative technologies like the Metaverse remain insulated from unnecessary politicking and cronyism. It must also wilfully drive an internal consensus on the matter to catch the global trend early. As I said, big things have small beginnings. Such a consensus will pay massive, massive dividends in the future. Time to act now.\n\nFurther reading\n\nYou can stop reading now. But for those curious about the technical specifications of the Metaverse, I’ll indulge some more.\n\nMatthew Ball, a prominent Metaverse thinker and venture capitalist, has formulated perhaps the best definition of the Metaverse. His definition is roughly: “the Metaverse is a collection of 3D virtual worlds that are interoperable and massively scaled, have high concurrency, are synchronous and persistent, and render in real-time”.\n\nLet me explain some of those concepts.\n\nInteroperable: Virtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another. Practically that means items, progression, and the rules from each world will be recognisable in all other worlds. Without such interoperability, the Metaverse will reduce to a collection of walled gardens without synergies. Although opinions vary, I believe blockchains will play a pivotal role in enabling interoperability.\n\nVirtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another.

For example, if you disconnected while constructing a building, you won’t start from scratch upon returning. Or if you made a dent in some corner of the world, that dent would stay in perpetuity. Real-time: These worlds and the people in them will react to inputs without perceptible lag.\n\nOur civilisation has advanced to the point where the above specifications don’t seem outlandish science fiction. Indeed we are already seeing glimpses of these capabilities in much of the current technology. That is why the leading technology thinkers of our age can now sense the Metaverse coming.\n\nGiven the exaggerated hype the term ‘Metaverse’ is seeing in the media, it’s easy to ignore it as another marketing ploy for milking attention. Perhaps the word ‘Metaverse’ will get rebranded in the coming years. But its underlying thesis won’t change. Look under the hood; there’s a ton of substance.\n\nBelieve the hype, prepare yourself, and bide your time. It’s now a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’. The world our children see will be very different from what we see and Pakistan would do well to be a major part of it.\n\nIllustrations by Rare Sense Inc.",
    "Following Devastating Flooding In Pakistan, Feinstein, Gillibrand, Colleagues Call on President Biden to Grant Temporary Protected Status to Pakistani Nationals": "Washington-Following unprecedented flooding that has left one-third of Pakistan underwater and affected approximately 33 million people, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and a group of their Senate colleagues to write a letter calling on President Biden to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Pakistani nationals currently residing in the United States. Implementing TPS would allow Pakistani nationals to remain in the United States until Pakistan recovers from this environmental disaster. The ongoing crisis has left many regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe, caused at least an estimated $10 billion in damage and contaminated the water supply, spreading an array of waterborne illnesses, including diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye infections, and typhoid.\n\nIn addition to Feinstein and Gillibrand, the letter was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).\n\n“Granting TPS to Pakistani nationals in need is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections,” wrote the senators. “Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions the country is facing, we urge the Biden administration to prioritize such a request while continuing to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community.”\n\nThis action is supported by the National Immigration Forum, Asian American Federation (AAF), the Climate Justice Collaborative at the National Partnership for New Americans, Communities United for Status and Protection (CUSP) and South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).\n\nFull text of the letter is available here and below:\n\nDear President Biden:\n\nWe write to respectfully urge your Administration to consider designating the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Unprecedented flooding in Pakistan is currently impacting approximately 33 million people and has killed more than 1,500 people, including 536 children. Given the severity of this crisis, the United States must ensure that Pakistani nationals present in the United States are not forced to return to conditions that could imperil their lives.\n\nCurrent conditions in Pakistan represent an ongoing environmental disaster – one of the statutory bases for TPS designation. Extreme flooding has left most regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe. According to data from the European Space Agency, approximately one-third of Pakistan is underwater. The Indus River is exceeding its capacity, which has led officials to evacuate entire villages in hopes of mitigating further disaster. Half of Pakistan’s municipal districts have declared a “state of calamity” and the country’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that one in seven Pakistanis has been affected. According to Pakistan’s finance minister, the damage is likely to exceed $10 billion, which is equivalent to 4 percent of the country’s annual gross domestic product.\n\nEven as Pakistanis are reeling from the physical destruction caused by the flooding, they are also facing the spread of waterborne illness that this environmental crisis has exacerbated. Tens of thousands have been stricken by diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections (ARI), skin and eye infections, typhoid, and other health issues resulting from contamination of the water supply. While we applaud your Administration’s decision to provide a much needed $30 million in humanitarian assistance and dispatch a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, further action is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of this crisis.\n\nForcing Pakistanis to return to a country that is experiencing what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called a relentless impact of “epochal” levels of rain and flooding would be a grievous obstruction to relief efforts. It would also risk fueling further displacement, destabilizing the region, and undermining key U.S. national security interests.8 The use and implementation of TPS as a humanitarian tool would provide necessary relief to individuals that are unable to return to their country due to the extraordinary environmental and public health conditions.\n\nAdditionally, designating Pakistan for TPS would also contribute to your Administration’s multi-pronged disaster response. It would decrease the strain on Pakistani infrastructure and provide a safe haven for those who cannot return to their homes or whose homes have been destroyed. Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions that the country is facing, we urge you to prioritize such a request and take it into serious consideration while you continue to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community. TPS is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections.\n\nThank you for your consideration. We look forward to your timely reply.\n\n###",

    "Pakistan and the U.S. Have Made Up, but Will It Last?": "This marks a departure from a year ago, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Pakistan’s leaders saw the U.S. exit as poorly executed, and senior U.S. officials voiced their frustration at Pakistan for not having brought more weight to bear on the Afghan Taliban to reach a negotiated peace settlement with the former Ashraf Ghani-led government.

Subsequent suggestions by U.S. officials that the relationship with Pakistan could be downgraded were viewed in Islamabad as petty punishment: partly for not having done more to help America in Afghanistan and partly for former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ill-timed visit to Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut when Khan began to accuse the United States of trying to engineer regime change in Pakistan, prompting a full-blown political crisis in Islamabad, Washington’s decision to hold off on further engagement became diplomatically prudent rather than vengeful.\n\nKhan has not shied away from cleaving his country’s relationship with the United States and the West more generally. After a no-confidence vote by Pakistan’s opposition parties, the ousted prime minister started staging megarallies across Pakistan’s cities. Despite the country’s worst monsoon in decades, he has continued to foment popular unrest, demonizing the new coalition government that replaced him and accused the Pakistan Army of politicization.\n\nAlthough Khan’s allegations of U.S. regime change are far-fetched, there remains some truth to the claim that it was the Pakistan Army’s withdrawal of its support for Khan that prompted April’s change in government. The Army initially helped pave the way for Khan’s electoral victory in 2018, but it is said to have been increasingly aggravated by the high costs of Khan’s populist politics, which often used anti-American sentiment to whip up domestic support.\n\nIn contrast to Khan, the Pakistan Army sees ties with the United States as central to Pakistan’s geopolitical relevance and key to stabilizing a worsening economy and acute liquidity crisis. To this end, one of the first measures taken by the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government that replaced Khan’s was to overturn Khan’s unfunded fuel and electricity subsidies. This was so Pakistan could resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following a seven-month hiatus, over a $6.5 billion program.\n\nFor Washington’s part, in addition to the resumption of the IMF program, there are other signs of a willingness to revive ties. Devastating floods have been accompanied by a flurry of high-profile official visits from Washington: first by State Department counselor Derek Chollet, who announced a 10-day humanitarian air bridge to Pakistan and a $30 million relief package, and then a strategically timed visit by U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power, who took the time to field questions at a press conference in Islamabad to Pakistani journalists. Even though the pretext for the two visits was largely humanitarian in nature, both officials spoke about the significance of 75 years of bilateral relations between the two countries as well as the importance of deepening ties.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the State Department announced the approval of the potential sale of F-16 aircraft sustainment and related equipment to Pakistan in a deal valued at up to $450 million, with the objective of servicing joint counterterrorism objectives. This decision overturns an earlier decision by the former Trump administration to end the technological and technical support program for the Pakistani fleet. The summer also saw the appointment of a full-time career ambassador to Pakistan after a gap of four years. (The last career ambassador relinquished his charge in 2018.)\n\nIt is virtually impossible to delink the ostensible sea change in America’s willingness to engage with Pakistan to the change in government that transpired this summer. Possibly in a bid to rebuild ties with the Pakistani establishment, Khan is said to now be contemplating softening his party’s extreme stance on the United States. Interestingly enough, it didn’t help that this hard-line position also didn’t sit comfortably with a sizable Pakistani-American diaspora that forms a key part of Khan’s base and which willingly sends remittances back to support the economy. As part of what may be called an internal reset, former U.S. diplomat and lobbyist Robin Raphel met with Khan at his Bani Gala residence this week, albeit in a private capacity. And in an interview to a top television anchor at around the same time, Khan said he was not opposed to Pakistan enjoying a good relationship with the United States, though he added that Pakistan “should not be used like we were used during the war on terror.”\n\nKhan will have to continue to define the parameters of what he considers acceptable in the relationship. In a 2021 television interview, for instance, Khan said Pakistan would “absolutely not” allow the CIA to use bases on its soil for cross-border counterterrorism missions once U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Although that sentiment is largely shared by parties across the Pakistani political spectrum, high-ranking officials between the two countries have held exploratory discussions about ways to bolster security and counterterrorism mechanisms in the region. It remains to be seen what those mechanisms could look like, but there are a few possibilities. Last month, the United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan that prompted the Afghan Taliban to accuse Pakistan of allowing its airspace to be used for the strike.\n\nPakistan’s foreign office deftly sidestepped the allegation; still, the resumption of the sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan is likely to reinvigorate the conversation around the extent and potential of Pakistani-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation and the Pakistan Army’s willingness to let America back into the country on the ground and in its skies. The Pakistan Army no doubt sees the upside as leveraging counterterrorism cooperation to target Pakistani Taliban militants operating from Afghanistan. The government, meanwhile, would like to maximize international assistance to rebuild Pakistan’s economy and infrastructure devastated by recent and ongoing flooding.\n\nA partnership could potentially have considerable benefits for the United States. By reengaging Pakistan, the United States will diversify its investments in South Asia and in the Indo-Pacific. This may be valuable given India’s insistence that it be allowed to maintain ties with Russia despite the war in Ukraine, which could in time lead some in Washington to privately question India’s long-term reliability as a key American partner in the Indo-Pacific. Although India remains an important partner for the United States for the most part, the United States has been unsuccessful in trying to coax a change in India’s position on Russia. Thus far, U.S. officials have been standing firm on their sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan despite criticism from India—signaling perhaps that they too are not averse to hedging.\n\nBack in Pakistan, Khan is savvy enough to recognize a shift in attitudes. It is likely that as temperatures cool and the floodwaters slowly recede, Khan may, somewhat begrudgingly, modulate his anti-U.S. rhetoric. The catch is that Khan actually remains massively popular in Pakistan, and it is widely expected that he will return to power in the next general election—with or without the establishment’s support. A key question for the Pakistan Army, then, is whether it wants Khan in power as a friend or as a foe. The latter would be bad for civil-military relations in the country, and it would also be singularly unhelpful for the country’s longer-term efforts to resuscitate its complicated relationship with America.",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to the world to help Pakistan after arriving in the country Friday to see climate-induced devastation from months of deadly record floods that have left half a million people living in tents under the open sky.\n\nHis trip comes less than two weeks after Guterres appealed for $160 million in emergency funding to help those affected by the monsoon rains and floods that have caused at least $10 billion in damages and 1,391 deaths. International aid is arriving, including the first planeload of what the U.S. has pledged will be $30 million in assistance.\n\n\"I have arrived in Pakistan to express my deep solidarity with the Pakistani people after the devastating floods here. I appeal for massive support from the international community as Pakistan responds to this climate catastrophe,\" he said on Twitter before dawn.\n\nLast week, the U.N. chief issued a stern warning about the effects of climate change.\n\n\"Let's stop sleepwalking toward the destruction of our planet by climate change,\" he said in a video message to a ceremony in Islamabad at the time. \"Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country.\"\n\nPakistan's Information Minister Maryam Aurangzeb in a statement thanked the U.N. chief for visiting Pakistan at a time when, she said, one-third of Pakistan is underwater. She said she wants the visit to help elevate the crisis for flood victims to the global level.\n\n\"The visit will also help in realizing the consequences of the deadly effects of climate change,\" said, urging the international community to step up efforts to help poor countries affected by floods and natural disasters.\n\nAurangzeb said Guterres will receive a briefing from Pakistani officials about damages caused by floods before addressing a news conference along with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in Islamabad on Friday.\n\nSo far, U.N. agencies and several countries have sent nearly 60 planeloads of aid, and authorities say the United Arab Emirates is one of the most generous contributors, as it has sent so far 26 flights carrying aid or flood victims. The United States said it will provide $30 million in assistance to help flood victims.\n\nThe floods have touched all of Pakistan and affected more than 3.3 million people.

    "Pakistan reels from ‘apocalyptic’ floods, pleads for international aid": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nMultistory hotels crumbling into rising waters. Surging waves crashing into elevated roads and bridges. Millions of people driven from their homes. Showing videos of what they called “apocalyptic” floods currently sweeping their country, Pakistan’s leaders, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, pleaded Tuesday for aid from developed nations, which they said were responsible for bringing extreme weather to one of the world’s most vulnerable regions.\n\n“I can say without any fear of contradiction, this flood situation is probably the worst in the history of Pakistan,” Sharif said.\n\nThe South Asian country of about 220 million people is now facing an unprecedented crisis after eight consecutive weeks of heavy rainfall. The floods have killed 1,100 people, affected more than 33 million residents, wiped out 1 million homes and destroyed about 2,200 miles of roads, Pakistani officials said Tuesday. Nearly 500,000 people are in displacement camps, and many others have nowhere to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe death toll and economic burden are expected to rise, adding stress to an economically fragile and politically divided country.\n\n“We want to showcase this to the developed world in particular,” Ahsan Iqbal, the minister for planning and development, told reporters in Islamabad. “The quality of life that people in the West are enjoying today, someone is paying the price in the developing world.”\n\nIn southern Sindh province’s Khairpur, one of the hardest-hit districts, Zahid Ali Jalalani, a 35-year-old farmer, experienced nonstop rain for the past two months. The water level in his village was rising slowly at first. Then came the flood.\n\nOne night last week, as he rested with his wife and two children in their single room home, a nearby canal burst, crashing into houses. Some parts of his village were instantly submerged under 10 feet of water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“At one time it seemed as if the walls were shaking, as if there was an earthquake,” he said. “I thought this was the day of judgment, our last hours alive.”\n\nAs the water receded, Jalalani ran into the darkness to help villagers save residents, some of whom were trapped with water up to their necks. About 250 villagers were injured when their walls caved in. One man drowned in his home.\n\nNow, hundreds of people from his village are living in a makeshift camp that lacks tents, food and medicine, Jalalani said. “We are living, thank God, but in terrible conditions,” he said. “But people are not willing to go back. Even those whose houses are still standing, they think they could collapse at any time.”\n\nThe growing number of extreme weather events around the world is caused by the planet’s rising temperatures, weather experts say. Higher temperatures mean more water in the air: For every degree of warmer temperature, the air can hold about 4 percent more water, leading to torrential rainfall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistani officials said Tuesday that the country experienced a slew of abnormal weather events this year. Four heat waves came immediately after the winter, leading to a year “without spring.” The heat scorched crops. But in recent weeks, parts of Pakistan experienced about four times more rainfall than the 30-year average. In Sindh, the city of Karachi has seen 48 inches of rainfall in the past two months. The financial hub, which has a desert climate, usually sees less than 10 inches of rainfall per year.\n\nSherry Rehman, Pakistan’s climate minister, said the government has been distributing water pumps to Karachi in recent weeks, but the equipment has been overwhelmed.\n\n“Where do you drain the water?” she said. “It’s an ocean. It’s a merciless sky.”\n\nThe flooding comes at a particularly difficult time for Pakistan.\n\nEven before the floods, Pakistan faced a steep fall in foreign exchange because of soaring global commodity prices and a rise in the U.S. dollar. The cost of electricity and food has soared. Pakistan has sought a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, which approved the request on Monday and released $1.1 billion to the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flood is expected to add $10 billion worth of damage to the teetering economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United States Agency for International Development announced $30 million in humanitarian aid, adding to a United Nations contribution of $3 million last week. The U.N. said it was also launching a new flood relief plan for Pakistan, as its officials echoed calls for greater contributions from around the world.\n\n“This super flood is driven by climate change — the causes are international, and so the response calls for international solidarity,” said Julien Harneis, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Pakistan.\n\nPakistani officials, who have been criticized domestically for not doing enough to respond to the floods, rebuffed the criticism and said no amount of planning would have mitigated the disaster. The country was experiencing a preview of the extreme weather that will eventually hit elsewhere in the world, said Rehman, the climate minister.\n\n“We are literally on the front lines of unfolding climate catastrophe,” she said. “It will happen to others later. It’s time we all took notice.”\n\nShih reported from New Delhi, Hussain from Islamabad and Jeong from Seoul. Susannah George in Kabul contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Pakistan wrestle over weightlifting administration. Two sporting bodies fighting for control amidst allegations of corruption": "Despite two different sporting bodies vying to run weightlifting in Pakistan, the International Weightlifting Federation has decided to let the dispute continue for now and has backed the existing body, which is being challenged by a government-backed organisation. While one body, the current sports authority of the sport in Pakistan, holds a letter from the IWF backing them, the other body has been approved by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB).\n\nThe argument being made by the government-backed sports board is that rampant corruption has taken place in the current weightlifting organisation and this move will allow for a fresh start.\n\nHafiz Zafar Iqbal, a former national champion who was appointed to the interim committee, said to Insidethegames.biz, “The intention of the PWLF is to protect the corrupt, while the PSB has acted to maintain discipline, as a controlling body of sports in Pakistan.”\n\nMeanwhile the Pakistan Weightlifting Federation (PWLF) has said that the sole intention of PSB has been to take over the Pakistan Olympic Association and this is a move towards making that a reality. PWLF chief Hafiz Imran Butt said that there is no law or validity of the PSB taking over weightlifting in the country, in this manner.\n\n“The PWLF is not a banned federation and is working under its own constitution and under the constitutions of the POA and the IWF – and none of them has banned the PWLF. The PSB was created to provide infrastructure to National Federations, which it is not doing. The dispute has been created by the PSB just to put, by force, a few retired army friends at the helm of affairs of a properly constituted weightlifting federation,” said Butt.\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board on the other hand, said that the PWLF were directly responsible for the doping violations that have occurred in the past months. Pakistani weightlifter Talha Talib tested positive twice in November and December along with six other team members who had been provisionally suspended for doping violations. Four of those violations were based on samples not being provided.\n\nIqbal said that three of these six violations were made by the three sons of Amjad Amin Butt, the vice president and former secretary of PWLF. He then added that in the two other violations, the coach of both players was Irfan Butt, the son of PWLF president Hafiz Imran Butt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I fail to understand how the POA and PWLF managed to deceive the IWF and fetch a letter in favour of the suspended President. I would request the IWF to review its decision and withdraw support of Hafiz Imran Butt until finality of the inquiry,” said Iqbal.\n\nIrrespective of where Pakistan weightlifting goes, their current bleak circumstances are compounded by the fact that they most likely face a ban from the sport for multiple doping violations and are most likely not going to be able to participate at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.",

Her husband, who she says is drug addict, saved only himself. \"He ran off,\" she says. \"He didn't even turn his neck around to see what happened to us.\"\n\nNow Mubina, who has only one name, is staying at the Nowshera Technical College, sharing a tent with her neighbors, two other women who also came with their children.\n\nShe's one of the many millions of Pakistanis reeling from the record floods.\n\nA roadside view of the toll\n\nOn the highway from the Pakistani capital to the northern city of Nowshera, you can see the damage caused by weeks of unprecedented rains: Dozens of displaced and destitute people have flung up tents on the roadside. Some even put up lean-tos to shelter the cattle they managed to steer out of flood waters.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hussain Ali/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Hussain Ali/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAnd in Nowshera, just one of the cities affected by floods after the nearby Kabul River burst its banks last Saturday, authorities scrambled to convert 25 institutes – technical colleges and universities — and student hostels into shelters for families rendered homeless.\n\nThe scene in one of those institutes, the Government College of Technology, Nowshera, spotlights the challenges facing Pakistan as over 5 million people scramble for food, water and emergency aid, including half a million who need shelter, according to U.N. figures. They are the human face of a seasonal monsoon rain cycle that began in mid-June and dumped three times the expected amount of water onto Pakistan. Some areas received up to six times the expected amount.\n\ntoggle caption Diaa Hadid\n\nMaking matters worse, the monsoon's once-predictable trajectory has also changed, experts said — likely because of human-induced global warming. (Warmer air holds more moisture.) The monsoon steered into unexpected places, like hilly areas, causing flash floods from mountainsides. The combined toll of those flooding left about a third of Pakistan under water, has washed away nearly 300,000 homes, dozens of bridges and more than 3,000 miles of roads.\n\n\"What we are facing today has been no above average monsoon. It is an entirely new level of climate-led catastrophe,\" said Pakistan's foreign minister, Bilalwal Bhutto Zardari at the launch of a joint appeal with the United Nations to raise $160 million for emergency aid.\n\nTrying to find a temporary haven\n\nIn the Nowshera Technical College, which opened for displaced people last Sunday, around 500 families registered within the first three days, said Zar Aly Khan, the government official in charge.\n\ntoggle caption Diaa Hadid\n\nTents were set up amid the buildings – and trash-strewn lawns — on the sprawling college complex.\n\nMany of the flood victims turned up because the assistant district commissioner of this district, Qurat Al-Ain Wazir, marshalled an effort to alert people to evacuate days ahead of the river bursting its banks. Wazir herself even went door-to-door in some parts, telling people to leave, earning her widespread praise online.\n\n\"We informed people through mosque loudspeakers, through social media, through WhatsApp. We evacuated and rescued a lot of people.\"\n\nSaved, but their homes destroyed.\n\nThis week, about three dozen desperate people smushed around the door to a room in the technical college that Khan had commandeered into a HQ, once a college administration room. They pressed in so tightly that the headscarves of women were ripped off – in a part of Pakistan so conservative that most veil their faces, not just their hair.\n\ntoggle caption Diaa Hadid\n\nKhan and volunteers helping him register families were ensconced inside the office, using a chair to jam the door shut. Its large window was smashed by an earlier wave of desperate people trying to register.\n\n\"We have to deal with such kinds of people!\" exclaimed one adult volunteer, who said he'd been working for three days without rest.\n\nA man furiously jotted down the details of new families, copying details from ID cards into a large registration book. He could not work fast enough. A relentless tide of people streamed through the front gate, including one family who clip-clopped in on a cart hitched to a donkey.\n\nKhan says registered people have access to clean water, bathrooms and two meals a day at his shelter. But on the ground, it's a fight to get the essentials to survive.\n\nFighting to make sure women and girls get food\n\nCrowds swarmed around an open-backed jeep where a man handed out plastic bags filled with cooked rice. People banged on the side of the vehicle to try getting the attention of the man handing out food. Some jogged to keep up. Elderly people fell behind. One woman managed to get a bag of rice, but a man grabbed it from her hand. It tore open and much of the rice scattered on the grass.\n\nOne woman, Zubaida Begum, scolded the jeep driver for causing chaos — and for leaving women behind, declaring: \"I want to ensure that women and girls are getting food.\" Begum sees this as her mission: She runs a small women's aid group and visits displaced camps to check on how vulnerable women and children are faring. \"It's hard for women here, for widows, for orphans,\" she says.\n\nIn this conservative area it's frowned upon for women to be in public, let alone press for their needs. Many can't even read or write.\n\nLocked toilets, a lack of period pads\n\nMubina is one of the new tent dwellers. She guesses she's around 35 and works as a cleaner. She says that one of her five children, a son who's 10, works in a furniture carpentry workshop.\n\nThe tent where she now lives with two other women and their children on the college campus is just a tarp hoisted up by a pole. And there's even a shortage of these temporary havens across Pakistan because the floods have been so devastating. Her life right now is a grab bag of uncertainties. She doesn't know when she and her kids will eat next. She doesn't know when they can use the toilet.\n\nThe women in Mubina's tent say there's only one toilet for females and it's sometimes locked for reasons that aren't clear to them. Open urination is common for men but the area is too conservative for women to do that. So the mothers and their daughters are always holding it in. Her friend Laila, a 31-year-old mother of three, leans in and says, \"We don't have period pads either.\"\n\nLeila, who only has one name, says the last time she and her family were displaced by floods in 2010 – which drenched about a quarter of Pakistan's landmass – aid groups gave them packs with underwear and period pads.\n\nUsually these women use clean washed rags to absorb their period blood. They can't afford pads and find them culturally weird to use, but Leila said they were handy in crisis situations like this. \"Right now, we are using our dupattas,\" she said, referring to the long scarves that women here use to cover their face and hair.\n\nThe women aren't sure when they will be able to leave the camp. They were given cash to rebuild their huts after the devastating floods of 2010 and said they were hoping for money this time too. \"Without money, we can't rebuild. We aren't people with means,\" said Leila, who said her husband, like Mubina's, is a drug addict.\n\nFlooded-out mothers reflect on climate change\n\nIt's unclear when rebuilding will occur. The U.N. and Pakistani appeal is earmarked for emergency aid to cover immediate needs such as shelter, food, sanitation and education for kids. It is just a fraction of the $10 billion that the planning minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters that the country would need to rebuild flood-damaged areas.\n\nBut as climate change makes these drenching rains – and floods – more intense, it's not clear if Pakistan's layers of government have plans to rebuild in a way that adapts to a changing, more extreme climate.\n\nThe women in the camp, who were all neighbors in riverside huts, said they would rebuild by the Kabul River when they can. \"We can't afford to build anywhere else,\" said another woman living in the tent, 35-year-old Nazia Bibi. The river side is cheap, she said, precisely because it's prone to flooding.\n\nAre they worried that there'll be another flood? The women shrug. They had not heard about climate change. They've also done very little to contribute to it.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fayaz Aziz/ Reuters Fayaz Aziz/ Reuters\n\nThe women don't have cars, or even motorbikes. The last time they ate meat, they recalled, was when they were given charity on the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha in early July.\n\nWhen I ask if they've ever been on an airplane, Nazia burst out laughing. \"I've never been on a plane. I've never even seen an airport!\"\n\nShe says she can't connect a line between driving a car, eating meat or flying a plane and the changes in climate that contributed to the flood that washed her home away. \"Our destiny is written,\" she says. \"God has rewarded some people in this life with so many blessings, but maybe in the afterlife, God will reward us too.\"",

However, a government official highlighted that the conversation in the audio does not reveal any wrongdoings. \"Nowhere in those audio clips was anyone talking about diamonds and gifts. There was nothing controversial in the audio from the ruling party's perspective,\" the official said.

    "IMF Resumes its Extended Fund Facility for Pakistan": "The State Bank of Pakistan has finally received proceeds of $1.16 billion (the equivalent of SDR 894 million) after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board completed the combined 7th and 8th review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.\n\nWhile this tranche was much awaited ever since the Shehbaz Sharif government took power through a controversial in-house change on April 10, the results of this release so far are not clear. Since immediately after the IMF release, the Pakistani Rupee, which had earlier started to stabilize against the US $, has suddenly shown a downward trend – indicating perhaps that even the IMF tranche has not met market needs or other parallel developments are increasing pressures upon the country’s troubled economy.\n\nRead more: Pakistan Economic Survey 2021-22 unveiled\n\nThere is a longstanding background to current challenges. High international prices and delayed policy action worsened Pakistan’s fiscal and external positions in FY-22, leading to significant exchange rate depreciation and eroding foreign reserves. The loan approval comes as Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves (including those held by private commercial banks) stand at a mere $13.5 billion, as of August 19, according to the central bank. Weekly inflation touched 45 percent in August, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, with food and fuel prices skyrocketing. In addition, Pakistan is confronting massive devastation caused by monsoon flooding that has left over 33 million people in desperation and taken the lives of over 1,300 people.\n\nPolitics around IMF\n\nPakistan has been in the IMF program since June 2019; it was never really suspended despite political debates on tv that create that misperception. It kept stalling because IMF would like to see the completion of commitments before the release of the new cache. Imran Khan’s government, before its removal, was confident that the next cache would have released around April. However, politics around IMF has continuously affected Pakistan’s relations with the monetary body. Public opinion has been shaped to see IMF as a threat to Pakistan or a conspiracy.\n\nShehbaz Sharif’s government, after much bickering and infighting, on July 13, 2022, finally reached a staff-level agreement on policies to complete the combined 7th and 8th reviews of Pakistan’s EFF. The agreement was subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board. However, despite a principled agreement, the situation kept dragging – and politics continued as usual.\n\nAlhamdolillah the IMF Board has approved the revival of our EFF program. We should now be getting the 7th & 8th tranche of $1.17 billion. I want to thank the Prime Minister @CMShehbaz for taking so many tough decisions and saving Pakistan from default. I congratulate the nation. — Miftah Ismail (@MiftahIsmail) August 29, 2022\n\nThe public has been unhappy because of strict decisions regarding fuel, power and commodity prices undertaken by the Shehbaz government to meet IMF conditions. The coalition partners have responded by accusing Imran Khan’s government of signing the agreement with the IMF on tough conditions and leaving the economy on the “verge of default.”\n\nRead more: Flour prices breaking the backs of citizens\n\nThe finance minister believes that the IMF agreement would help unleash $3.5 billion in further loans from Asian Development Bank, $2.5 billion in World Bank loans, and $500 million in Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank loans (AIIB). Moreover, the government is expecting to unlock further foreign economic assistance from various international creditors, in addition to flood relief aid from friendly countries and other financial institutions. However, given the country’s current overall socioeconomic situation, investors will remain cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, aftershocks of the revival of the IMF loan program are still to be surfaced. These are evident from the country report released by the Fund, including the Memorandum for Economic and Financial Policies—a document that is full of assurances given by Miftah Ismail on behalf of the government of Pakistan. The document was required to revive the program and extend it until June 2023 in order to get a total $3.5 billion loan from the IMF from August 2022 to June 2023. According to the report, Pakistan has assured the IMF that if revenue collection slows or current expenditures begin to exceed targets, the government will implement a contingency plan that involves both the imposition of new taxes and the reduction of federal and provincial development expenditures of Rs. 534 billion.\n\nNote: A slightly different version of this article appears in the 2022 September Magazine.",

    "Could Balochistan secede from Pakistan?": "The rain and the cold in Quetta, the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, did not deter them. Neither did the floods that ravaged their homes. The families of Balochistan’s missing had been protesting for days outside the provincial government’s headquarters. On August 25, one of the protestors, Seema Baloch, the sister of Shabbir Baloch, a student leader who had been missing for weeks, fell unconscious and had to be taken to a nearby hospital. The others simply kept protesting.\n\nGovernment officials gently asked them to leave, but when the protesters asked about the missing—all allegedly abducted by Pakistani security forces—the officials professed ignorance or, worse, helplessness.\n\nBaloch activists claim that nearly a thousand people disappear every year, abducted by the Pakistani security forces. The security forces link nearly all of the missing to Balochistan’s independence movement. The call for independence is rapidly gathering momentum there.\n\nIt’s not a new call. On August 12, 1947, the eve of Pakistan’s birth, the Khan of Kalat and ruler of most of Balochistan, Mir Ahmad Yar Khan, announced that Balochistan would be independent, part of neither Pakistan nor India.\n\nBut Pakistan’s founding prime minister, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had other plans.\n\nJinnah threatened the Khan of Kalat and other Baloch tribal leaders with the newly formed Pakistani army. Yar Khan reluctantly agreed to Balochistan’s accession to Pakistan in April 1948. But 18 days later, Jinnah’s government asked the Pakistani army to invade Balochistan anyway. The army arrested Yar Khan and, in the months that followed, jailed Baloch leaders and imposed martial law.\n\nThe Baloch people have never forgotten. Today, they are once again demanding independence from Pakistan. Some have become violent. They accuse the Pakistani army, a looming presence in the region since 1948, of violence against them. Bombings and kidnappings are now a daily occurrence. Balochistan has become dangerously unstable, and the West does not care.\n\nBalochistan occupies nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan’s land mass and borders Iran’s Sistan Province, home to many who also call themselves Baloch. The province has some of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, and rich stores of coal, oil, and natural gas. Last year, the state-owned Pakistan Petroleum Corporation announced the discovery of huge gas reserves there: one trillion cubic feet.\n\nLeaders of the three major political groups that seek independence—the Free Baloch Movement, the Baloch Republican Party, and the Baloch National Movement—are in exile. Another group that seeks independence, the Baloch Liberation Army, operates from within the province. It is not above using bombs and violence to achieve its ends.\n\nThe leader of the Baloch National League, based in Europe, which seeks to unite Balochistan’s independence movements under a single banner, told me, ‘We are being hunted by the Pakistani establishment. We fear for our lives, even in exile.’ My sources would speak only on condition of anonymity, fearing for their lives.\n\nThe uproar threatens the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor; the port of Gwadar; gold, copper, and uranium mines; and even Pakistan’s nuclear complex in the Chagai Mountains of Balochistan.\n\nNearly a third of the China-Pakistan Economic corridor passes through Balochistan. Through the port of Gwadar, the corridor connects Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang province to the Arabian Sea, providing Beijing with a link to the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina has committed to investing more than $60 billion in this route. It is strategically imperative for Beijing not only because it’s part of the Belt and Road Initiative, but because it gives China a land route to the Strait of Malacca, the world’s most critical maritime chokepoint.\n\nSources in Balochistan told me that a joint venture company, Jiwan China, is secretly building a naval base in Jiwani, a small town with a port very near Gwadar. They also said China and Pakistan were privately forging a plan for China to station more forces in Balochistan to secure its investments.\n\nApart from the recent devastation caused by floods, political unrest in Balochistan has grown rapidly. Sources tell me the freedom movement now has deep roots. According to one, the Baloch independence movement may be led by political and guerrilla groups, but it has the full support of the Baloch nation: ‘Islamabad is an occupier and coloniser who has colonised and occupied Balochistan. A coloniser and occupier will never develop a region but will loot and subjugate it,’ says one Baloch National Movement leader.\n\nIslamabad disagrees, claiming that the separatists are a fringe group. Nevertheless, my sources say that Islamabad has deployed the Pakistan Army, along with the Frontier Corps, throughout Balochistan, with some four to six small army camps in each district and one or two major camps in each; all total, there are nearly a quarter of a million army personnel there. They say the army’s operations are devastating: The military raids homes, they say, and disappears people in large numbers; it dumps the dead bodies in the streets and the hills, and conducts air strikes that kill, injure, and damage property.\n\nThe Balochistan Human Rights Commission, in a report released in May this year, claimed there were 442 disappearances in the province in 2021, involving fake encounters, abductions, extrajudicial killings, targeted killings, and torture by Pakistani forces. The primary targets were Baloch students and activists demanding greater autonomy or independence for Balochistan.\n\nIn August, Pakistani security forces reportedly raided a college dormitory in the city of Quetta in Balochistan, beat up four students, then arrested them without charge. In the city of Turbat, security forces arrested freshman student Yousuf Nisar as he returned home from a soccer match. The families of the detainees say they were given no reason for their arrest.\n\nLeading Baloch separatist figures say the students were arrested because of their sympathy with the independence cause. A leader of the Baloch Liberation Front, a group that has long fought the Pakistani army and sought independence, told me that the police and the army suspected them of being activists. In some cases, the boys had actively espoused the cause, but ‘in most cases the mere hint that they support Baloch nationalism is enough,’ he said. Often, the visibly tortured bodies of the abductees are thrown into the mountains. The Baloch Voice Association, a Paris-based nongovernmental organisation, is planning a three-day banner and poster exhibition on these disappearances at the 51st session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.\n\nThe Canadian mining company Barrick Gold has been openly warned to stay out of the province by the Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar, a conglomerate of armed separatists, I was told by a Baloch source. Two weeks ago, the company signed an agreement with the provincial government. The conglomerate has not yet responded publicly, but my sources indicate that if work on the project begins, retaliation will occur.\n\nThe provincial government, led by chief minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, has signed an agreement with Barrick Gold that calls for a $10 billion investment and promises to create 8,000 jobs in the province. Bizenjo has seemingly delivered: job creation for locals, investment in the province, and more. But for the Baloch, that’s no longer enough, said an exiled Baloch National League leader: ‘We want the jobs. We want the investments. But we don’t want the fruits of our labour to go to Pakistan and Islamabad.’\n\nBaloch separatists often cite Baloch natural gas reserves, among the largest in Asia, as an example of their grievances. They say the gas has been pumped out of Balochistan, benefiting Pakistan’s Punjab region, while industry in Balochistan has barely grown.\n\nThe Gwadar port is already besieged. Work on the port has been significantly delayed because Baloch activist groups have been targeting Chinese workers on the site and throughout the region. Chinese trawlers, fishing off the coast of Gwadar, have been attacked. Gwadar fishermen say that Chinese large-scale mechanised fishing is destroying the local fishing industry. ‘The people of Gwader are no longer allowed to fish in the sea as they used to. Those who are allowed can only fish in a limited area. The rest of the sea is controlled by Chinese engineers, the navy and fishing companies, and the Pakistani army,’ said a source in Gwadar.\n\nThe Baloch people oppose the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a Baloch separatist leader told me. ‘We have not agreed to the project. It is a project that exploits the Balochs’ mineral resources, especially gold and copper.’ He told me that Baloch militants had repeatedly attacked the project’s infrastructure and the officials associated with it.\n\nChinese personnel and the corridor’s rail and road infrastructure have been attacked, frequently, with crudely made bombs. The violence is now so acute that in June, Beijing wanted to move in with its forces. The Pakistani government hasn’t yet made a decision. But my sources indicate that China has now quietly stationed between 1,500 and 3,000 naval personnel in Gwadar and Jiwani.\n\nOther parts of Balochistan are similarly destabilised. Quetta, the capital, was once home to the notorious Quetta Shura, the Taliban’s inner leadership, which crossed over to Afghanistan last August. Nearly a million Pashtun refugees from Afghanistan live there now, and it remains a haven for outlawed groups that seek to impose the Sharia upon Pakistan, such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan—both of which regularly harass the Pakistani army and Islamabad.\n\nBaloch leaders say that while groups like these are officially banned, they enjoy the patronage of Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, the country’s most powerful entity. A Baloch separatist leader told me that the army and ISI had given the TTP and its like sanctuary in Quetta: ‘They have no presence in the rest of Balochistan. The Baloch and Pashtuns reject these organisations. They are the mercenaries of Pakistan army,’ he said.\n\nWhatever their provenance, Quetta has emerged as a hotbed of terrorism, with the TTP blamed for terrorist attacks throughout the country.\n\nChina and Islamabad have played a few cards shrewdly. Around Gwadar, China has begun offering Chinese language courses to locals. Beijing is actively courting political parties that have sought to join Pakistan’s broader political establishment, such as the Baloch Nationalist Party (Mengal) and the Balochistan Awami party.\n\nThe BNP (Mengal), led by Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal, a former chief minister of Balochistan and current member of Pakistan’s parliament, rejects calls for complete independence. He wants more rights and autonomy for the province. The BAP is a newcomer to the game, formed in 2018 by dissidents from factions of the mainstream Pakistan Muslim League.\n\nBaloch separatists reject these parties, whom they believe to be in bed with the Pakistani federation and the army. China has been courting these parties assiduously for several years. ‘These parties have been mandated by China to win the heart of the people of Balochistan and increase the moral support of the people of Balochistan for China,’ one separatist told me. ‘Moreover, China has hired locals in Balochistan to create moral support for China and its investment in Balochistan,’ he claimed.\n\nBut the problems in Balochistan won’t be eradicated by teaching locals Chinese, nor by wooing local politicians. Nor were supporters of independence silenced by Islamabad. Instability in Balochistan could spill into Iran. This would destabilise the region.\n\nBut above all, it’s dragging Pakistan into the abyss.\n\nThis article first appeared on the Cosmopolitan Globalist substack.",

    "Alt News, Newslaundry come to defend Islamists, claim that Pakistan Zindabad slogans were not raised by PFI supporters": "On September 25, the self-proclaimed fact-checking website Alt News again came to rescue Islamists. This time, they attempted to give clean chit to the Popular Front of India members that were protesting in Pune. As per reports, videos of the protests organized by PFI members in Pune surfaced on social media platforms where they could be heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ As the videos got traction on social media, the obvious saviours of Islamists, including Alt News and Newslaundry, came rushing to their rescue.\n\nAlt News shielded PFI workers raising “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans. Source: Twitter\n\nAlt News propaganda to twist the facts\n\nIn its report, Alt News talked about the protests that took place to oppose the raids by National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) on several locations linked to PFI in 15 states. During these raids, 106 PFI officials and workers were arrested by the investigating agency.\n\nThe protests were organized against the raids and arrests by PFI workers in multiple cities across the country in Pune. In the videos of the Pune protests, the members of PFI were heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ Several netizens and prominent personalities on social media shared the videos and condemned the slogans. OpIndia had also covered the matter.\n\nAlt News, owing to its reputation, could not digest the fact that such slogans were raised. In their “explanation,” the portal said the slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They even targeted those who condemned PFI workers for raising the slogans.\n\nThe portal shared a 26-second video and claimed that upon gathering videos from different sources, including journalists on the ground, they “found” that slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They also shared a long video version of the protest recorded by Policenama.\n\nThe reality of the slogans\n\nOpIndia re-examined the videos, including the video shared by Policenama. There were multiple slogans that were being raised by the protesters. Among those slogans, ‘Nara-e-Takbeer Allah hu Akbar,’ ‘Popular Front Zindabad,’ and others were included. Now, the question is, was the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ raised? The answer is yes, the slogan was, in fact, raised.\n\nAt the 7:34 timestamp in the video, the slogan ‘Popular Front Zindabad’ can be easily heard. However, following the said slogan, ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ was also raised by the protesters.\n\nTwitter user Hawk Eye also published the analysis of the video and debunked Alt News claims. In his reply to Alt News, The Hawk Eye published the video compilation at three different speeds. He said, “Sharing the same video in a loop, with 3 different speed variations. The last part is with zoom to read the lip sync. Let ppl decide – “Pakistan” or “Popular front.”\n\nHawk Eye also slowed down the video and zoomed in on the PFI member who was detained by the Police and raised the controversial slogan. It was clearly evident that the slogan was, in fact, ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’\n\nSame vid with audio noise reduction. Observe the audio amplitude variation if its matching with “Pakistan” or “Polular Front”?\n\n2/ pic.twitter.com/YZzcYNWtCv — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) September 25, 2022\n\nAs there was a lot of background noise in the video, there was still a chance that the likes of Alt News may raise questions over the slogans raised. The Hawk Eye went ahead and cleared the background noise to make it clearer. In the three-speed variants of the audio with reduced background noise, the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ became more prominent.\n\nNewslaundry’s attempt to shield PFI\n\nA similar “fact-check” was done by the Leftist propaganda website Newslaundry. They quoted Pune Police, suggesting that no such slogans were raised, and shared the same video by Policenama as well. They talked to the protesters as well, who “denied” the allegations of raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans.\n\nRJD leader shielded PFI\n\nWhile Alt News and Newslaundry were insisting that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were not raised, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari bluntly supported PFI workers and said such slogans are part of routine protests. He said that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans raised during a protest in favour of PFI were only a “sign of protest.” Tiwari’s comments came after over a hundred PFI activists were arrested in several states in a nationwide operation on Thursday, after which PFI workers had chanted Pakistan Zindabad slogans in Pune during a protest against the arrests.",

    "Pakistan win fourth T20 to level series despite Dawson’s England heroics": "A bewitching, twisting game, full of unpredictable turns and hitches, ended in a three-run victory for Pakistan. It was a match England lost, won and lost again in the space of 10 crazy minutes. At their start, they needed 33 runs from 18 balls to beat Pakistan’s 166, and were relying on Liam Dawson and Adil Rashid to do it against Mohammad Hasnain, who had already taken two for 16 with some wickedly quick bowling. They say heroes can be found in the most unlikely places, but outside of Dawson’s home village of Goatacre, there cannot have been many people watching who expected what happened next.\n\nDawson walloped a six down the ground, then glanced a four to third man off a no-ball, he stuck the free hit through mid-wicket, uppercut the next over the slips, and glanced the fifth through square leg. By the time he had taken a single off the final delivery, he’d hit 24 runs off the over, which was one more than he had scored in his 10 previous T20 innings for England. “I think that took everyone by surprise,” said the head coach, Matthew Mott. “I don’t think in our wildest dreams we ever imagined we would end up in that position.”\n\nThe National Stadium was awfully quiet now. A lot of the 30,000 people who had spent the evening screaming and cheering were already leaving because England needed only nine from the final 12 balls. Dawson scored four of them off the second ball of Haris Rauf’s over. Then the game turned again.\n\nRauf bounced Dawson, who was so amped up that he tried to pull the ball and was caught at short mid-wicket, a shot he replayed endlessly when he was back off the pitch. In came Olly Stone, with five needed, and then out he went again, bowled by his first delivery. Rauf’s hat-trick ball was a 96mph yorker which almost had Reece Topley lbw.\n\nPakistan celebrate winning the fourth T20 to level the series. Photograph: Anjum Naveed/AP\n\nThe people making to leave turned right back round into the ground, where they pressed up close against the mesh fence. Topley, all elbows and knees, took a leg bye which left him facing at the start of Mohammad Wasim’s final over with four runs needed. Rashid, desperate to get on strike, was almost run out off the first delivery, and then Topley, beaten home by Shan Masood’s underarm throw, actually was off the second. Karachi erupted in celebration while, among the English players slumped by the boundary-side, Dawson was utterly distraught.\n\nMott was not. “It was a knife-edge game and we’ll draw plenty from it,” he said. “It was a fantastic opportunity to see how we handled ourselves under pressure and I thought we did a good job of it.” It did not look as if they would get so close. Pakistan’s total was built around another large opening stand from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, who put on 97 together.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the two of them were together, England, who had brought in Stone for Mark Wood and David Willey for Sam Curran, looked pretty powerless to do anything about it.\n\nThen Azam was caught at mid-wicket trying to sweep Rashid, and the game slowed right down again, as if, having built the platform, Pakistan’s batsmen wanted to stop a tea break before they put it to use. Rizwan and Masood, who was badly dropped by Alex Hales, scored only three boundaries between them in the next six overs. It took a couple of hefty late blows from Asif Ali in the last over to satisfy the crowd’s incessant cries of: “We want sixers! We want sixers!”\n\nThe modest total receded into the distance when England’s top order collapsed in a heap. They were 14 for three after 12 deliveries and Harry Brook and Ben Duckett were back together again. Duckett, who continues to bat like a man who has spent three years waiting for his opportunity, began to claw England forwards with a flurry of fours off Wasim. Then Brook pressed on with Moeen Ali. They both hit glorious sixes off Mohammad Nawaz, but he got his revenge by bowling Ali as he charged down the wicket. Brook was caught at fine leg and in came Dawson, for the start of that extraordinary final few overs.\n\nThe series moves to Lahore with the scores tied two-all. England should get stronger as the week goes on, with Jos Buttler, Wood, and Chris Woakes all set to come back into the team. If Pakistan play like this again, they will need to be.",
    "Pakistan’s Scramble for a Peaceful and Stable Afghanistan": "The country’s initial euphoria at the Taliban victory has given way to concern as several troubling developments threaten its regional interests.\n\nPakistan and Taliban flags flutter on their respective sides while people walk through a security barrier to cross border at a key border crossing point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Chaman, Pakistan, Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough stability is gaining ground in Afghanistan, challenges remain as the economy and people’s livelihoods are facing serious difficulties. These developments hold ramifications for the world, yet regional countries will be most heavily impacted by any development in Afghanistan – and none more than Pakistan, because of its geographical proximity and historical and cultural links.\n\nCircumstances have changed since the initial euphoria that Pakistan enjoyed after the Taliban won power in August 2021, because of Islamabad’s expectation that the regime change spelled an uncertain future for India in Afghanistan. Several challenges still exist in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.\n\nThe first major concern is Pakistan’s security fence along the border, which has caused quarrels. Historically, Afghanistan has called the Durand Line an artificial border imposed by the British. Such views are present irrespective of the faction that is in power in Afghanistan. Against such loud reiterations, Pakistan has vowed to resolve the issue diplomatically. Still, the Taliban’s interim government has remained reluctant to accept the Durand Line as the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The dispute persists even though the Taliban’s major interests are inevitably linked to Pakistan, be it efforts for recognition of the government, trade, or humanitarian assistance.\n\nThere have been recurring reports of Afghan security forces damaging Pakistan’s border fencing, calling it illegal. For instance, most recently, Enayatullah Khwarazmi, the spokesman of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense, said Pakistan has “no right” to separate Pashtuns living on either side of the Durand Line.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe development has raised alarm bells for Pakistan. The ISPR’s director general, Maj. Gen. Babar Iftikhar, expressed a commitment that the fencing would be completed as planned, because “blood of martyred soldiers has been spilled while erecting the fence.”\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe border issue has remained a point of contention for decades, but there are even more pressing challenges.\n\nThe second major concern is that ever since the Taliban’s takeover, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has resurfaced with renewed political strength coupled with improved internal cohesion, thus raising eyebrows in Islamabad as the insurgents bring splintered factions back into the fold. Coupled with this development is the possibility of TTP cooperation with the Afghan Taliban. With the Taliban emboldened by the fall of Kabul, it is not an exaggeration to say that the TTP’s strong yet low-profile presence in Pakistan could act as a Trojan horse for Afghanistan in Pakistan. After all, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud has pledged allegiance to Maulvi Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan Taliban leader. So, the Taliban know that they can use the leverage of the TTP, a self-declared branch of the Taliban in Pakistan, to receive benefits from Pakistan. The TTP remains one of the most dangerous interregional terrorist threats to Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the Taliban government has released scores of TTP commanders in recent times, including former deputy chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammed. Such a gamble from the Taliban government would fray Pakistan’s support for a stable Afghanistan, especially if the security circles see a constructive resurfacing of militancy in Swat that undermines the decade-long counterinsurgency efforts by the Pakistan Army to oust the TTP. This could be one of the reasons why Pakistan reportedly (though it was never confirmed) carried out airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, thereby sending a message to the Afghan government not to shelter militants on their soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan has tried to open negotiations with TTP, yet Islamabad has failed to subdue the terrorist group’s rise in northwestern Pakistan. One reason for the failure is because Pakistan has tried to use the same strategy – for instance, the release of 90 TTP militants in 2021 – so that the negotiations continue, yet after a temporary ceasefire, the TTP resumes attacks. Such tactics are employed to gain momentum and remain an important tactic for “regrouping” and for securing the release of imprisoned senior leaders, thus improving the TTP’s position.\n\nThe third major concern is linked to Pakistan’s ambitions to link South Asia with Central Asia to promote regional connectivity, development, and the flow of energy from Central Asia toward Pakistan. Such ambitions can only be materialized if Afghanistan remains stable, as several projects between the two regions pass through Afghanistan’s north. Therefore, the future of several of Pakistan’s Vision Central Asia-inspired projects with the Central Asian States, including the TAPI and CASA 1000, depends on peace and stability in Afghanistan – a conflict-prone country.\n\nAfghanistan’s north is still subject to challenges from the Islamic State of Khorasan as well as Tajik and Uzbek militants. Several factions in Afghanistan are not willing to accept the Taliban’s rule. There are reports of challenges to the interim government, for instance, from the Islamic State, Uzbek resistance in Faryab province, Hazaras in Balkhab district led by Mawlawi Mehdi Mujahid, Tajiks in Parwan province led by Afghan Army chief Mohammad Yasin Zia, and Ahmad Masood’s forces, who are challenging the Taliban-led status quo in Afghanistan.\n\nThe fourth concern for Pakistan is the recognition of the Taliban’s interim government in Afghanistan, which for the global audience remains a pariah regime. Seemingly, the world is reluctant to pursue constructive engagement with the Taliban, based on global powers’ common calls for inclusivity in governance, women’s rights, and counterterrorism. Islamabad, however, remains committed to showing the world that the way forward is to move beyond such rhetorical arguments. If the great powers want to pressure Afghanistan, then they should constructively engage by incentivizing the Afghan government and then asking for compliance with international standards of governance.\n\nThat said, unless the world softens its stance on the interim government, Pakistan will remain hesitant to recognize the Taliban. Doing so unilaterally that could harm Pakistan’s already strained relations with the West and could lead to the threat of sanctions. For now, policy pundits in Pakistan are clear that the new Afghan government is a reality that must be recognized by the world. Pakistan’s foreign policy line remains close to what Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said regarding recognition of the Taliban government: “We see no other option. We share a border, deep history and culture.”\n\nOnly time will tell how many other regional stakeholders will resonate with Mirziyoyev’s views. Until then, Pakistan, together with Afghanistan’s neighboring partners, is urging international actors to engage with the Taliban, because it does not want Afghanistan to become a cordon sanitaire for Pakistan’s relations with the West.\n\nPakistan’s position seems clear: Any true help for the Afghan people can hardly materialize if one bypasses the interim government of Afghanistan. But even as Pakistan scrambles to boost the prospects of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan by convincing the world to interact with the Afghan government, Islamabad finds itself facing several challenges from ongoing developments in Afghanistan. These challenges have led to mutual disdain, but cooperation between the two nations must take precedence.",
    "Pakistan in limbo amid power struggle of former PM and deep state": "On Dec. 18, 2010, during a live interview at the Islamabad Press Club, the late Director-General of Pakistan's intelligence services Hamid Gul casually affirmed that “no one becomes the Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan without the U.S.' approval.”\n\nEver since, every now and then, those words come back to haunt the political and military dispensation in Pakistan. Granted, this accusation is not new. It was always understood by uninhibited political analysts that Pakistan's formidable military rules the roost and to varying levels is in a tug-of-war with the United States hegemony. Of course, the level of influence, or give and take, vis-à-vis the U.S. has always been open for debate. It depends on who is leading the military establishment and how willing the powers are to antagonize their own people to oblige their purported benefactors in pursuit of their interests.\n\nAfter the removal of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan from power by a dubious vote of no-confidence, this old debate has resurfaced. As such, many are asking “who controls Pakistan?” After all, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu allegedly demanded the removal of Khan.\n\nSince then, the country has been in a dizzying decline – skyrocketing energy prices, economic collapse, an unprecedented level of popular revolt and the worst flooding the country has seen in the last 50 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the circus plays to its own choir while the country plunges into crisis.\n\nPakistan's current government has charged Khan as a terrorist. What makes this particularly outrageous is that the allegation of terrorism against Pakistan's most popular political leader is led by an illegitimate government, many of whom face serious allegations of financial impropriety and are out on bail. But Khan is not backing down.\n\nEndless tussle of the core, periphery\n\nAmerican sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, in his World-System Theory, describes global order as the unequal distribution of power between the core – mainly the \"West,\" the semi-periphery countries and the periphery countries of the global south.\n\nThe reach of the “core” is able to influence the internal political structures of the periphery through locally kept leaders – be they in the political, economic, military, or judicial spheres. This leads to the untiring tussle in every post-colonial society between those who wish to facilitate the emergence of representative governance and those against it. On the one side, there are those who are the facilitators of the empire or the proprietors of the core. They excuse their betrayal with such gobbledygook as “enlightened moderation.” Then, they enrich themselves while lamenting punitive austerity measures on their populace since “beggars cannot be choosers.”\n\nOn the other side, there are those who aim to seize the instruments of state power away from those beholden to market fundamentalism or global hegemony. They seek genuine freedom. This unforgiving rivalry is real and goes to the crux of the conflict over state power. It is brutal and further compounded by people of varying interests/motivations vying for their own space. Many do not want to get involved or have lost hope for change. That is, until now.\n\nAfter being unceremoniously and arguably unlawfully removed from office, Khan has politicized his entire country. Yet, his will, commitment and perseverance have energized people like never before; he has made clear who stands on what side of the political spectrum and his pushback has overwhelmed the deep state.\n\nThis privileged class loathes their compatriots and rules only to institutionalize cronyism, inequality and corruption. This rationalization is required in order to purposively obstruct social development, stifle creativity and mock the ethical values and moral moorings of their own people.\n\nA further psychological aspect of these unrepresentative elites and their political cronies is that they embody some of the worst Islamophobic tendencies. It is more insidious since it occurs inside Muslim majority polities and is done by those who ostensibly claim to be Muslims. Despite that, Khan is deftly maneuvering and has swept by-elections in Pakistan's Punjab province by taking 15 out of 20 constituencies and won another by-election in Karachi. This is a remarkable feat and underlines that one can own all the institutions they want, but it is people that matter. If anything, Imran Khan's victory against the deep state, foreign interference and corrupt political parties is stunning.\n\nKashmir issue\n\nConcerning Kashmir, there will be no meaningful commitment until a semblance of political stability returns to Pakistan and legitimate representatives wrest power away from those with questionable integrity. Even worse, there are open discussions from the government of Pakistan opening trade links and working on the infamous \"Musharraf\" (country's former military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf) formula which is essentially maintaining the status quo and accepting the current cease-fire line as a porous border.\n\nAn Indian paramilitary soldier stands guard as a Kashmiri girl watches from a doorway during a strike in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir, April 23, 2010. (AP Photo)\n\nIt must be recalled that the deep state in India refused this bargain, as well as Kashmiris. Hence, most Kashmiris inside Indian-occupied Kashmir and those working in the diaspora communities recognize that only a free, independent Pakistan will genuinely support its liberation movement. At the same time, the Kashmiri diaspora must develop a sophisticated approach to its global resistance while recognizing Pakistan's internal challenges and redlines without ceding control of the resistance to those who may bargain away their future, as those puppet Rajas (kings) in Pakistan have forsaken their own.\n\nThroughout the broader post-Arab Spring, the Middle East, of which Pakistan is part and parcel, the counter-revolutionary forces operate in conjunction with the deep state and global hegemony. That internal deep state, whether in the form of political parties, judiciary, police or military, undermines the emergence of representative democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Institutions are compromised, parliamentarians are bought, and courts are open at midnight to hear cases and enforce their will over parliamentary supremacy to protect the deep state elites' ill-gotten wealth and dubious fiefdoms.\n\nOne could reasonably argue that the deep state looks upon emerging democratic forces that challenge the status quo with both amusement and disdain. It will never willfully forgo the reins of power. However, it will do one better: Make space for emerging political forces to enter the political arena, then slowly undermine them.\n\nIn fact, the carrot of giving power is slowly weaponized to strip away at their aura, heighten instability, and spread fake news of \"nothing being done.\" This character assassination is subtle and meant to slowly undermine the emerging recalcitrant political order to make it a spent force. That is happening in emerging grassroots movements in the Middle East and is attempting to be done to Khan. So far, though, it has not worked.\n\nThere are many among the Pakistani people who support Khan and his team, and this is a promising development for both Pakistanis and Kashmiris.",
    "US, Pakistan re-engage to cope with floods, rebuild ties": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan and the United States will hold ministerial-level talks in Washington on Monday (today), indicating willingness on part of both sides to resume institutionalised engagement after a long absence.\n\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari reached Washington on Sunday on a three-day visit during which he will hold in person talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nHe will also have a separate meeting with State Department’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Commercial and Business Affairs Dilawar Syed, reflecting a mutual desire to deepen trade ties between the two old allies. He is also meeting key Cong­ressional leaders on the Hill.\n\nOfficially, both sides have only forwarded a generic description of the talks, saying meetings would “highlight flood relief efforts in Pakistan and commemorate 75 years of bilateral relations”.\n\nAt an earlier briefing to Dawn, State Department’s counselor Derek Chollet acknowledged that the United States wanted to maintain friendly ties with Pakistan and was even ready to compete with China to do so.\n\nBut he also said that in doing so, the Biden administration does not want Islamabad to choose between Beijing and Washington, rather it wants countries “to be able to have a choice”. The United States, he said, was not “afraid of competing with China, but we would like to have a fair competition”.\n\nThis clearly illustrates a sketch of the relationship Washington wants with Islamabad, a close ally, which can maintain its special relationship with China without allowing it to affect its ties with the United States.\n\nBut the issue that’s going to dominate the talks is the one that was not even there when these talks were planned: this year’s unprecedented floods that have brought Pakistan close to an economic meltdown.\n\nPakistan is seeking, but not getting, international assistance that matches the scale of the disaster that befell the country this summer.\n\nEditorial: Funding gaps\n\nMichael Kugelman, Director of South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Centre, said in a tweet on Sunday that during a recent trip to Pakistan, “the main message I heard on the floods is that the only hope is international aid, which has been slow to come”.\n\nBut the “biggest obstacle to addressing the crisis may not be the lack of international aid, but political polarisation at home,” he wrote.\n\nMadiha Afzal, a Pakistan scholar at Brookings, another Washington think tank, also highlighted this issue in her tweet. “Pakistan’s political polarisation is so hardened now that nothing seems to be able to reduce it — not its flooding catastrophe, nor anything else,” she wrote. “Doesn’t bode well.”\n\nSome experts warn that this could also impact efforts to rebuild US-Pakistan ties as scholars and policy makers in Washington also worry about the stability of the current political setup in Islamabad.\n\nAnd as the two scholars indicated, this was already affecting Islamabad’s efforts to raise funds for the relief and rehabilitation of flood victims.\n\nIn his speeches and statements at the UN General Assembly this week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif not only appealed to the international community to help Pakistan but also assured them that the funds they send would be used for the victims only. Apparently, he did so to assure the donors that the aid would not be misappropriated, as some of them fear.\n\nExperts say that in their talks in Washington, Pakistan would not only seek, and probably get, more assistance but would also ask for US support to its efforts to reschedule its debt. In his engagements at the UN, the prime minister minced no words in reminding the donors that “all hell may break lose” if Pakistan does not get debt relief.\n\nMr Chollet, when asked if the United States would help Pakistan in getting its debt rescheduled, said Washington was aware of the situation but he did “not want to get ahead of an official US decision” on this issue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2022",
    "Catastrophic floods: Understanding the gravity of Pakistan’s health and food crises": "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently warned that his country needs “an infinite amount of funding” to support flood relief efforts. Torrential rains and heavy flooding have killed more than 1,550 people and displaced millions. Compounding the challenge are Pakistan’s intensifying food and health crises, as flood-borne diseases surge and nearly two-thirds of the country’s food basket has been destroyed.\n\nComing to grips with Pakistan’s health crisis\n\nA dearth of healthcare access in hard-hit southern provinces threatens to expose millions of malnourished children and women to infectious diseases, with fears of a wider spread. An estimated 16 million children have already been impacted by the floods and millions remain in need of lifesaving support, according to figures from the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Delivering that support is an enormous task. Cases of malaria, dengue, and skin diseases continue to climb, and water borne diseases have pushed daily patient numbers to as high as 90,000 in Sindh. The situation in neighboring provinces offers little comfort: Make-shift health facilities are increasingly common, as dwindling finances and limited expertise hamper relief efforts in flood-ravaged areas.\n\nAs Pakistan braces for more floods, it is unlikely that a fragile healthcare system can keep apace for long. On the financial side, just over 1% of Pakistan’s total GDP goes toward public health expenditure, and even support for major relief camps is reliant on international assistance. Depleting currency reserves and record-setting inflation have put enormous pressure on long-term spending, which suggests there may be delays in efforts to rebuild lost infrastructure.\n\nCataclysmic floods have already damaged over 1,460 health facilities in sensitive areas, compounding logistical challenges and throwing up new barriers to healthcare access. With vast areas of Pakistan still underwater, life-saving supplies risk delays and future displacement complicates outreach.\n\nPakistan’s growing dependence on make-shift facilities presents another problem: It creates an urgent demand for climate-safe infrastructure that could take years to build. In Sindh, Pakistan’s hardest-hit province, authorities fear that the damage to healthcare facilities has reached a point where many are unable to “offer any services” to flood victims. These constraints arrive at a time when malaria cases are fast rising, and a deadly surge in dengue fever raises alarms in other provinces. Over half a million pregnant women also require maternal health services in flood-ravaged areas, putting more pressure on Islamabad to scale emergency response efforts, and prevent vulnerable populations from sliding into acute hunger.\n\nAn intensifying food crisis\n\nExtreme floods have wiped out over 800,000 hectares of farmland, and damaged about 80-90% of crops. These include crops that are critical to Pakistan’s food supply chain. Key export items, including rice, wheat, and cotton, also risk future shortages as the scale of damage spreads to key agricultural belts. That includes Pakistan’s southernmost Sindh Province, where an estimated 90% of crops have been ruined. Sindh is responsible for producing half of the country’s food.\n\nThe resulting constraints on Pakistan’s agricultural sector are enough to lift double-digit inflation to new highs if supply shortages stretch long term and future floods exacerbate damage. There is also growing likelihood that the government will increase its dependence on agriculture-related imports to plug near-term shortfalls.\n\nEarly signs include Pakistan’s engagement with the Asian Development Bank, hoping to leverage flexible financing of food imports to address domestic demand. But Islamabad’s shaky foreign reserves make it difficult to scale imports and continue food sourcing long term. That puts the government in a tight spot when the threat of acute hunger is fast intensifying.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has already warned of a substantial rise in acute hunger going forward, since at least 43% of Pakistan was already food insecure before the floods hit. Heavy rain damage to key areas of agricultural production has further weakened the prospect of a productive rice and wheat harvest this fall, an essential factor in bolstering nationwide supplies. Much of Sindh and Balochistan’s flood water refuses to recede quickly, putting pressure on resource-rich Punjab to step up production, and soften the blow of any long-term price shocks.\n\nAs Pakistan stares at the specter of increased starvation, a change in course remains elusive. Extreme floods have pushed legions of children to the verge of hunger, and increased their exposure to contaminated drinking water. The possibility of more floods amplifies fears of future displacement and relocation. Millions of flood-affected people are still confined to open skies, with limited means to compensate for lost agricultural and farming income. That income has played a critical role in sustaining community livelihoods for years, and helped others navigate absolute poverty. As millions become reliant on humanitarian aid for survival, regaining livelihoods will be a monumental challenge.\n\nEconomic recovery hopes are also bleak, thanks to weakened growth and potential borrowing in the future. Some 21 million acres of crops are still underwater, compounding food supply logistics at a time when extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent in Pakistan.\n\nGovernance woes\n\nIslamabad’s ruling coalition has limited options at its disposal. Billions in flood damages could prompt a cut in projected GDP growth, making it critical to leverage international climate financing to support relief operations in hunger hotspots. On the domestic front, the government is under intense pressure to deliver long-due economic relief. Promised service delivery reforms are yet to materialize in full, while drastic upticks in food and energy prices add to public discontent. Rapid food imports from neighboring countries also face headwinds: The rupee’s sharp devaluation has complicated trade arrangements with Afghanistan and Iran, and risks intensifying an acute shortage of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes.\n\nTo be clear, despite long-running frictions between the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the ruling coalition, top leaders continue to campaign for urgent flood donations and back international appeals.\n\nBut restoring nearly two-thirds of the country’s food basket will prove much harder.\n\nDamage control: Options for Pakistan\n\nPakistan should prioritize early evacuation efforts in high-risk districts where the threat of rising water levels is most pronounced. Lack of early evacuation contributed to the post-flood shelter crisis that has left millions homeless. In an encouraging sign, local authorities have begun work on early rehabilitation in densely populated areas, and continue to facilitate the return of flood-hit populations once water levels drop. It is imperative for Islamabad to work with the United Nations on a post-disaster reconstruction plan, with a specific focus on ending illegal construction on Pakistan’s riverbeds.\n\nThe survival of key crops in Punjab should form the core of the government’s food sourcing in the near term. Priority supplies can be dispatched to make-shift camps where hunger risks are most pronounced, with enough from fall harvest to limit possibilities of a major price spike.\n\nProvincial governments should also ensure that each rebuilt health installation is registered as a “panel facility” in rural districts. Panel facilities constitute a predefined list of hospitals and serve as the first point of treatment for one or several districts. This gives flood victims more than one access point for treatment, and prevents make-shift camps from taking on an excess treatment burden in the future. Early evidence from Pakistan’s “Sehat Sahulat” health insurance reforms in the north confirms a similar logic at play: Empaneled facilities played a vital role in extending healthcare access to scores of underdeveloped districts.\n\nBut given the sheer gravity of Pakistan’s health and food crises, one thing is clear: Damage control alone will not suffice.\n\nHannan Hussain is an international affairs commentator, author, and recipient of the Fulbright Award in Public Policy at the University of Maryland.

The flooding, caused by a combination of heavy monsoon rains and unusually high glacial melt, is the worst to hit the country in recorded history, Pakistani officials say. More than 33 million people have been affected, and almost 1,400 people have died. Nearly a third of the dead are children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery day, dozens of boats pass Raza Mohammad’s shelter of tree branches and reeds erected on a narrow retaining wall offering him a ride to higher ground, but each time he waves them away.\n\nEven in the midst of this immense disaster, he refuses to leave. Fleeing now would mean leaving his livestock behind — all he has left of value after his village was inundated — and he doesn’t trust the government to care for him and his family on dry land.\n\n“To be honest, I don’t want to stay here, but I cannot go without my livestock. I would be left with nothing,” he said.\n\nLike many in rural areas of Sindh province, Mohammad and his family had been living on the equivalent of about four dollars a day. After the flood hit, he’s been unable to work. Without his animals, he wouldn’t be able to provide for his wife and three children, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We never thought the waters would reach this high, otherwise we would have left earlier and taken our animals with us,” he said. A retaining wall had been built by the Pakistani government to protect his area after the last massive flooding in 2010.\n\nMohammad and his neighbors thought the wall would hold. But it burst suddenly in the middle of the night. In a matters of hours, what was about a foot of rain became a torrent of water. By morning, nearly the entire village vanished, he said.\n\n“The people in these areas have become accustomed to flooding,” said Pakistani Army Lt. Col. Ejaz Karin, who is overseeing rescue and relief efforts in Dadu district. But Karin said he doesn’t believe the families who are refusing to be rescued understand it could take weeks or months for the waters to drain.\n\nIf thousands continue to stay in flooded villages, Karin said it will create “a food emergency” and health crisis, further stretching relief efforts and causing a sudden spike in mortality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood distribution to these flooded villages is intermittent and largely organized by private individuals. Sometimes, boats arrive daily. Other times, three days can pass without any deliveries, residents say. The rations families receive consist of flour, rice, tea and sugar.\n\nAnother farmer sheltering on the muddy embankment, Miril Solengi, said he is thankful for the food deliveries, but he is running low on animal feed and cannot afford to buy more.\n\n“If we cannot feed our buffaloes,” he paused. “I don’t know what we will do. Our lives depend on these animals. All we can do is wait for the waters to recede.”\n\nIn Solengi’s village, floodwaters are 15 feet high. And at the current rate, they are receding at about two to three inches a day.\n\n“We have already warned them, please leave your homes and go to safety, but they refuse,” Sona Khan Chandio, the deputy commissioner for Khaipur Nathanshah, said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the government has sent health teams to visit the families remaining in the flood zone, but the teams have not been able to reach everyone. “We are doing our best,” he said, adding that those who refuse to be rescued have a responsibility to “take care of themselves.”\n\nBudhari Solangi, 24, who was sitting with a group of other women under a tent made of reeds and tattered cloth, said all the children who have stayed are falling ill. “They have fevers and skin diseases we never saw before,” she said.\n\nShe called her 7-year-old son back from the crumbling edge of the mud bank. She lifted his foot to reveal a raw bumpy rash running up his ankle. “I don’t know what it is,” she said.\n\nWhile some boats deliver food, she said no one has brought medicine to her area. The Pakistani navy has tried to encourage her to leave, but she said she doesn’t want to break up her family and has heard horror stories about the conditions on higher ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamilies rescued by boat are dropped along a highway miles away from the nearest government camp, she said. And making the trip by foot with small children would be impossible.\n\n“Our only option is to stay,” she said.\n\nAt the water’s edge, Pakistani navy officers have set up a staging area to expand rescue operations and survey the damage. Behind them, hundreds of families who had chosen to flee their villages were packed along the highway. Many were still wet from the journey. Others had been there for more than a week, living in shelters they assembled themselves.\n\nUnder a tent made of branches, scarves and woven reeds, a group of women held up small bags of cooked rice and begged passersby for assistance.\n\n“This is all they gave us!” Naveeda Naich yelled across the road, gesturing to the security forces just a few yards away. “Nothing else, not even milk for our small children.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a food ration truck pulled up, the women told their children to run to it.\n\n“We send our sons and daughters to collect the food because the authorities are less harsh with them,” Gulam Zohra said. Her husband once tried to bring food back for the family, but he was badly beaten by security forces when he tried to push through the crowd, she said.\n\nThe aid truck was quickly surrounded by people desperate for food, and police with batons tried to disperse the crowd.\n\n“Look at how they treat us,” Zohra said, watching the scene and beginning to cry.\n\nNaich hurled insults at a Pakistani police truck driving by. “You’re dogs! All of you, dogs! I spit at you!” she screamed.\n\nZohra said she had thought she was keeping her family safe by leaving her possessions behind and fleeing the floods, but now she’s horrified by the conditions they are living in.\n\n“They don’t respect us,” she said of the authorities. “They just treat us with brutality.”\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "A Political Crisis Is the Last Thing Pakistan Needs": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWith Pakistan reeling from devastating floods and spiraling inflation, it’s an exceptionally bad time for a political crisis. Unfortunately, that’s what seems to be shaping up in the standoff between the government and ex-prime minister Imran Khan. All sides should recognize that compromise is in their best interests — and, more to the point, in Pakistan’s.\n\nKhan bears the lion’s share of blame for the crisis. Accused of economic mismanagement and toppled in a no-confidence vote in April, he has since kept up a steady stream of attacks on the coalition government that replaced him, calling tens of thousands of supporters into the streets to demand early elections. Matters escalated in August when one of Khan’s top aides went on TV to warn lower-ranking military officers against following unlawful orders from their superiors, which was taken as incitement to mutiny. The aide was charged with sedition and claims to have been tortured in custody, which the government denies. The TV station that aired his comments was forced off the air.\n\nKhan then threatened to retaliate against police officers and a judge involved in the case, prompting a complaint against him under draconian anti-terrorism statutes. He faces a hearing on those charges today, even as he seeks to fend off a possible contempt of court case. If convicted, he could be barred from politics and possibly jailed, like several former Pakistani leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhan can’t pretend to be a model democrat. Army backing is widely thought to have helped smooth his ascent in 2018. His government is accused of targeting critics in the media and civil society, and he employed dubious parliamentary maneuvers to try to derail the no-confidence vote. Since losing power, he has stoked populist fury with unfounded conspiracy theories accusing the US of orchestrating his removal. He welcomed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and embraced Vladimir Putin the day of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nEven so, the government’s hardline response could well turn Khan into a martyr. Many legal analysts think the terrorism charges against him are excessive. Repressing media outlets further weakens free speech in the country. Banning Khan from politics outright would only prompt greater turmoil, cynicism and instability.\n\nInstead, both sides should work to turn down the temperature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Khan needs to better respect the law and the constitutional process. If he wants to battle the government on policy, he should re-enter parliament along with his fellow party members rather than continuing to boycott the institution. His party should test its popularity by continuing to contest by-elections, which have yielded several notable victories recently, and should demonstrate its skill at governing in the provinces it controls instead of using them to harass the central government.\n\nIn return, the government should be willing to play fair. It should enforce the law but not pursue trumped-up cases in the misguided hope of expelling Khan from the political system. Instead, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his ministers should focus first on emergency efforts to deal with the floods and food shortages, then on stabilizing the economy and cushioning the blow of austerity measures. The best way to counter Khan’s appeal isn’t to attack him — which only feeds his narrative of persecution — but to outperform him.\n\nMost important, the army needs to let civilian leaders get on with the task of governing. Its political meddling — a perpetual problem — only encourages politicians to focus on the brass rather than citizens; part of the reason Khan is fighting so hard for early elections is because the prime minister will appoint the next army chief in November. Meanwhile, repeated cycles of political instability undermine the economy and impede effective governance. Pakistan’s leaders should know this game by now — well enough to understand no one wins.\n\nMore From Other Writers at Bloomberg Opinion:\n\n• Why Pakistan Can’t Afford Another Political Crisis: Mihir Sharma\n\n• Modi’s India Risks Making the Case for Partition: Nisid Hajari\n\n• What If India and Pakistan Actually Got Along?: Tyler Cowen\n\nThe Editors are members of the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Climate change: Pakistan emits less than 1% of the world's planet-warming gases. It's now drowning": "CNN —\n\nPakistan was already struggling when the devastating monsoon rains hit.\n\nThis year, economic and political crises have converged in the South Asian nation of more than 230 million, as food and fuel prices soared and former leader Imran Khan was forced from office.\n\nNow its reeling with the worst floods in living memory.\n\nSwaths of Pakistan are now underwater after experiencing the heaviest rains on record with little reprieve since mid-June. Some areas have seen five times their normal levels of monsoonal rain.\n\nMore than 1,100 people have died and 33 million people are impacted – that’s more than the population of Texas.\n\nTorrents of water have smashed through entire villages and farmland, razing buildings and wiping out crops. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies shared with CNN show how communities have been wiped out, leaving behind little more than bare Earth and dust.\n\nGudpur, Pakistan Satellite image ©2022MaxarTechnologies\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, European Union data shows, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. It’s paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges.\n\nOfficials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion. The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster.\n\n“We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Tuesday.\n\n“And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.”\n\nThe stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with.\n\nGudpur, Pakistan Satellite image ©2022MaxarTechnologies\n\nThe United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed. Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving.\n\nThese devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization.\n\nBut the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show, and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis.\n\nPlanet Labs Planet Labs Hala, Pakistan Planet Labs\n\nFahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust.\n\n“What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan,” he said. “They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form.”\n\nHe added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad.\n\nSaeed said Pakistan was in “a position to present a strong case” at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces. Developed and developing nations have remained generally divided over the issue for years.\n\nPlanet Labs Planet Labs Mianwali, Pakistan Planet Labs\n\nThe developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing nations to help their transitions away from fossil fuels, but also to help them adapt to climate change. That amount has never been delivered in full.\n\nMore controversial is the issue of who should pay for the destruction. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US was one of several advanced nations that showed opposition to obligatory payments for “loss and damages” – essentially climate compensation – particularly for schemes based on historic responsibility.\n\nHistorically, the US accounts for the most greenhouse gas emissions in the world.",
    "Devastating floods in Pakistan": "21 September 2022\n\nTorrential monsoon rains triggered the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history, washing away villages and leaving around 3.4 million children in need of assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition.\n\nAs floodwaters slowly recede, the sheer scale of damage is being revealed. Hundreds of thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed, while many public health facilities, water systems and schools have been destroyed or damaged. Young children are living out in the open with their families, with no drinking water, no food, and no livelihood, exposed to a wide range of new flood-related risks and hazards, including from damaged buildings and drowning in floodwaters.\n\nUNICEF is responding with the Government and partners, helping to deliver safe drinking water; lifesaving medical supplies; therapeutic food supplies; and hygiene kits to children and families. We are also establishing temporary learning centres and supporting the protection and psychosocial wellbeing of children affected by these devastating floods.\n\nBut much more is needed to ensure we can reach all families displaced by floods and help them overcome this climate disaster.\n\nWe need your urgent support to help save lives."
