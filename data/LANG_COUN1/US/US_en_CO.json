    "After 7 years, the Colombia-Venezuela border is reopening to trade": "LEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThe main border crossing between Venezuela and Colombia officially opens to trade today after years of being closed. The border opening fulfills a campaign pledge by Colombia's new president, Gustavo Petro, to reestablish formal relations with Venezuela. But what does it mean for Venezuelans who are trying to leave their own country in record numbers on a daily basis? Reporter Manuel Rueda is in Cucuta on the Colombian side of the border. Hi.\n\nMANUEL RUEDA, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning.\n\nFADEL: Good morning. So how significant is today's border opening?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this is quite important because for years, the governments of Colombia and Venezuela were ideological rivals on the opposite ends of the political spectrum. So what this border opening shows is that they're taking a different approach. Now they want to cooperate on security issues, on trade, on immigration issues.\n\nFADEL: Now, Venezuela right now is considered the second-largest external displacement crisis in the world. So what does this border opening mean for Venezuelans who are trying to leave their country?\n\nRUEDA: Well, the hope is that with more trade, the economy improves somewhat. When the border last functioned normally back in 2014, trade between both countries was worth about $2 billion each year. So perhaps, you know, this helps businesses on both sides of the border to exchange with each other the raw materials that they need to get manufacturing up and running again. So maybe that generates some jobs. And maybe that means that some people might want to stay in the country now. But the situation is still quite difficult. I mean, the minimum wage in Venezuela right now is about $16 a month. So when you actually go on a road that leads into the center of Colombia, you can still find many people from Venezuela just walking, walking towards the center of Colombia because they don't have money to pay for the bus. And one of the people I met was a 21-year-old man called Elio Sanabria (ph). And this is what he said.\n\nELIO SANABRIA: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nRUEDA: So what he's saying there is that he was working at a chicken plant in Venezuela. And his wage was $20 a month. And he says, you know, this is just no way to live. You just have to live day to day. There's barely enough money for food. And so he was trying to head to Chile, where he has some friends who told him they might be able to help him find work there.\n\nFADEL: So some possible hope for some alleviation of those economic struggles in Venezuela. But beyond Venezuela, what does the border opening mean for this region of South America?\n\nRUEDA: So Gustavo Petro, the new president of Colombia, is trying to improve relations with Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. And the border opening is just part of a broader plan he has. His main interest - Petro's main interest is to generate peace talks with different rebel groups that still exist in Colombia. But he needs Maduro's help because many of those groups also operate in Venezuela. So will the relationship go to that level where Maduro will help him to make peace with the rebel groups? We'll have to see.\n\nFADEL: Reporter Manuel Rueda is in Cucuta, Colombia. Thank you so much for your reporting.\n\nRUEDA: Sure. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",

    "Colombia and Venezuela: Country Program Overview - Colombia": "Work in Colombia\n\nMedGlobal has been operating in Colombia since 2019. Our immediate goal was to provide primary health care services to Venezuelan migrants. We attempted to play a part in the response to the extra burden imposed by this diaspora.\n\nTo provide primary and specialty care, MedGlobal has hired local health staff and has hosted 73 international medical volunteers from a variety of medical specialties such as internal medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, etc., who deployed to help.\n\nIn Cúcuta, Norte de Santander Department, MedGlobal ran a primary care clinic for 2.5 years in the Comuneros neighborhood. This was chosen because the “barrio” (neighborhood) was home to a large number of Venezuelan migrants. Primary care services to children and adults and prenatal care services were among the services provided in this site.\n\nTo serve Venezuelan migrants as well as Colombian IDPs with little to no access to health care, MedGlobal conducted five medical brigades in the El Talento neighborhood, located on the outskirts of Cúcuta. These medical brigades included local staff as well as international medical volunteers, who provided care of acute intermittent illnesses as well as care of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, asthma, and diabetes, plus COVID-19 testing and a COVID-19 immunization clinic.\n\nMedGlobal was invited to participate in an ambitious government program to serve a large group of Venezuelan migrants called Los Caminantes (the walkers). They are Venezuelan migrants and refugees who leave Venezuela, traveling to other countries in the region by foot. Los Patios Migration Center is the first of six way stations along Los Caminantes’ route from Cúcuta to Bogota. MedGlobal was asked to serve as the medical presence at Los Patios.\n\nThe clinic provides Los Caminantes with free, first-contact medical services including acute care, obstetrics and gynecology, psychosocial support services, laboratory services, and medications. The clinic also offers COVID-19 rapid testing and COVID-19 vaccination. Through April 2022, MedGlobal has provided more than 7,600 health services in Los Patios.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, MedGlobal provided a variety of services in Cúcuta and in Bogota. Thousands of Venezuelan migrant and refugee families attempted to return to Venezuela amidst economic instability, creating a public health crisis in the border regions. Migrants were stuck at the border creating an overcrowded area. Tents were established to help mitigate the situation. MedGlobal and its partners began providing health services at a shelter established at the Tienditas Bridge in Cúcuta, providing health screenings and first aid to migrants and refugees. MedGlobal also distributed a range of critically needed supplies and equipment in Cúcuta, including 3 portable ventilators, to the new COVID-19 treatment center at Erasmo Meoz Hospital and hygiene kits for the local community. MedGlobal provided three medical staff to collaborate with the local health system in COVID-19 case surveillance.\n\nTo help build capacity at the border, MedGlobal began a training program for Point of Care Ultrasound. We donated the hardware, and we also provide on-going consultation to Venezuelan physician-trainees facing any difficult diagnostic case. We do this via telemedicine consultations as well as intermittent webinars.",
    "Can Petro Pull Off ‘Total Peace’ in Colombia?": "Gustavo Petro might be only six weeks into his presidency, but he hasn’t lost any time defining his top priority. “I will work to achieve true and definitive peace. Like no one else, like never before,” he pledged at his August 8 inauguration.\n\nPetro’s agenda, which he has dubbed “total peace,” is nothing if not ambitious. He proposes simultaneous talks with the National Liberal Army (ELN), FARC splinter groups and over two dozen other mafias—all with the goal of ending Colombia’s epidemic of violence once and for all. If the promises sound big, that’s exactly why many Colombians voted for Petro. After his predecessor, Iván Duque, failed to remedy the situation with a more conventional security policy, there was and is appetite for change.\n\nBut success is far from guaranteed. For now, Petro can count on a pro-government majority in Congress, seasoned peace negotiators in his cabinet, and an open line to Washington, Havana, and Caracas, each of which may figure in eventual talks. Moreover, while opposition to the 2016 Accord was fierce, Total Peace has received little political pushback. Still, much will depend on whether Petro’s government can get three critical groups on board—all without undercutting the state’s bargaining power in the process.\n\nSupport from Strange Bedfellows\n\nFirst, Petro needs buy-in from Colombia’s myriad armed groups and criminal organizations. For now, 22 criminal and armed groups have expressed willingness to enter talks—but they have different incentives to accept or reject peace, which could become a hurdle. Moreover, Petro inherited a crumbling security situation from his predecessor: In 2021, Colombia’s homicide rate stood at 26.8 per 100,000, topping even Mexico’s and reversing years of improving security in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the 2016 Peace Accord.\n\nThe ELN, which, at 2,500 fighters, remains Latin America’s largest insurgency, has consistently signaled its interest in engaging in talks with the Petro government. In August, Petro signed a decree lifting the arrest and extradition orders for ELN leaders holed up in Cuba. This week, FARC dissidents, who rebuked the 2016 Peace Accord, also met with the Petro government to explore the possibility of dialogue. And the Clan del Golfo, the fragmented successor to Colombia’s right-wing paramilitaries, declared a unilateral ceasefire on the day of Petro’s inauguration to signal its leaders’ willingness to take part.\n\nBut all three groups—plus dozens of other, smaller mafias—also control lucrative drug trafficking routes and illegal mines and have much to lose from dismantling their criminal fiefdoms. Last year, Colombia’s cocaine exports reached near-record-setting amounts. It’s unclear how criminal groups expect to improve their situation, or safeguard their profits, by participating in talks, but they might be vying to turn their fortunes legal. The Petro government recently announced it has plans to pursue cocaine decriminalization.\n\nIf buy-in comes in phases, as it almost certainly will, that could pose its own risks. Still-active mafias could swoop in to take control of territory and illicit trade routes abandoned by groups participating in the talks. That was the story of the swathes of territory vacated by the FARC after 2016. With Mexican cartels growing regionally, a lurking danger is that Colombia’s illicit economies could end up in the hands of new foreign owners with bigger guns.\n\nThat’s what makes buy-in from a second group—Colombia’s armed forces and police—even more critical. Few were surprised when the Petro’s relationship with top brass got off to a rocky start. After all, Petro built his career as a critic of state security force’s checkered history of human rights abuses, and appointed Iván Velásquez, famous for investigating links between right-wing paramilitaries and the state, as his defense minister.\n\nBut the Petro government has moved quickly and aggressively to change military leadership, purging more than half of Colombia’s generals and police commanders in just six weeks. Observers say those left behind are eager to preserve institutional privilege and reputation and likely to fall in line with Petro’s security policy—provided dissenters among their ranks don’t get the upper hand. Retired generals and officers have already publicly criticized Petro’s plans to negotiate with mafias. Keeping security forces on board will be a must for filling vacuums left behind by criminal groups—but it’s sure to be a balancing act.\n\nThird, although less critical than its domestic pillars, Total Peace also needs international support. After all, Colombia’s criminal and armed groups already rely on trade routes and territorial enclaves that run deep into Venezuelan territory. That gives the Maduro regime unfortunate yet undeniable leverage over Colombia’s security situation. In early September, Petro asked Venezuela to act as guarantor to upcoming talks—a request which Maduro eagerly accepted, drawing sharp criticism from U.S. Senate Republicans and Democrats.\n\nBut if Petro aspires to international legitimacy, Total Peace will also require the support of democracies. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have both offered support. But it remains uncertain whether democratic governments can ensure any kind of transparent process alongside autocratic Venezuela. While Maduro’s participation could push the ELN, which depends heavily on access to Venezuelan territory, to stay at the negotiating table, it also risks legitimizing a brutal dictatorship likely to have ulterior motives.\n\nBellwether or Red Flag?\n\nFor Petro, Colombia and the region, the stakes couldn’t be higher. After a brief reprieve in violence at the height of the pandemic, organized crime is now resurging with a vengeance, eroding the state and threatening investments in Mexico, turning Brazil’s porous borders into lawless no man’s lands, and roiling once-peaceful countries like Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. A decade ago, governments across the region opted for head-on confrontation to fight organized crime, but mano dura crackdowns largely failed to deliver the desired results, and now leaders are struggling to find a new way forward.\n\nIf Total Peace succeeds, it could provide a blueprint for dozens of other governments across the region and dismantle Colombian criminal groups that have for years spread violence to Colombia’s neighbors, including Peru and Ecuador. But if Petro’s gamble fails, it could spell disaster. Silvana Amaya of Control Risks compared the policy with Colombia’s failed 1999-2002 negotiations with the FARC, which saw the state give the FARC control of the Caguán, a region the size of Switzerland, in a bid to make peace. Instead, the FARC took full advantage of the situation, using the brief reprieve to prepare a siege that would go on to nearly topple the state.\n\n“Today, we’re seeing the formation of mini-Caguáns all over Colombia,” Amaya told AQ. If Colombia’s criminal groups take advantage of upcoming talks to regroup and rearm, the consequences could ripple across Colombia’s borders and give organized crime groups an renewed safe haven. For the Petro government, the current moment presents an unparalleled opportunity and an unparallel challenge. The clock is ticking.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Will Freeman is a Ph.D. candidate in politics at Princeton University and a 2022 Fulbright-Hays grantee to Colombia, Guatemala and Peru.",
    "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years": "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years\n\nWhat might the official re-opening of the border to trade between Colombia and Venezuela mean for the two countries - and for the record number of Venezuelans trying to leave their own country?\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST:\n\nThe border between Colombia and Venezuela has been officially closed to trade for nearly seven years. The countries recently reestablished diplomatic ties. And on Monday, the border reopens to all traffic. Commercial flights between the countries will also resume soon. Manuel Rueda is on the Colombian side of the border for NPR. Good morning.\n\nMANUEL RUEDA, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning, Ayesha.\n\nRASCOE: Why did the border between the two countries close to trade in the first place?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this began in 2015, when the smuggling of cheap, subsidized goods from Venezuela was increasing into Colombia. And then there was an incident where three Venezuelan soldiers were killed, apparently by smugglers. So that kind of launched everything. And after that, the Venezuelan president shut down the border. Then in 2019, tensions flared up again when the Colombian government, with the help of the U.S., was trying to deliver truckloads of aid, of food to the opposition in Venezuela as part of a greater effort to help the opposition groups in Venezuela. After that, the shutdown intensified for a year. Then it's been open for some time just to foot traffic. But on Monday, things will begin to normalize again because we'll see, you know, more commerce - trucks going along the border with different types of goods.\n\nRASCOE: So you've been talking to people on both sides of the border. What will this mean for them and the region as a whole?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this will be very important for businesses on both sides of the border because they can get exchange - for example, raw materials - with each other, without having to resort to smugglers who take goods along dirt paths, you know, along the border, which is what they've been doing for now. So, for example, I was talking to a baker in the town of - on the Venezuelan side, who said, I can import flour from - I could import flour from Colombia now without having to resort to the smugglers, and maybe that'll make my products cheaper. So that's expected to activate the local economy.\n\nRASCOE: And so record numbers of Venezuelans are leaving their country. Will this change encourage more to stay?\n\nRUEDA: Well, not for now, I think. The economic situation in Venezuela is still quite difficult, and it's going to take some time to get that sorted out. So for example, yesterday, I was driving along a road that goes from the Colombian border into the center of Venezuela, and you can still see many people there walking along the road. These are immigrants from Venezuela trying to get into the center of Colombia and to other countries. And they're just walking - right? - because they can't afford the bus fare, you know?\n\nAnd I met a young man there in one of the shelters. He's 21 years old. And he's telling me, look. In Venezuela, I was working at a chicken plant, and my salary was $20 a month, which is more or less the minimum wage in Venezuela at the moment. So he says, you know, this is no way to live. So that's why, you know, people are still leaving. I mean, in August, there were about - Venezuelans were encountered in the border between Mexico and the United States about 25,000 times, which was four times higher than the number of encounters of Venezuelans in August of last year. So you can still see that people are moving...\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: ...And people will continue to leave Venezuela while the economic situation does not get sorted out.\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: This reopening of the border...\n\nRASCOE: Oh, I...\n\nRUEDA: ...Is a first step.\n\nRASCOE: Thank you.\n\nRUEDA: But there's still...\n\nRASCOE: Thank you. That's Manuel Rueda at the Colombia-Venezuela border. Thank you so much.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "What Health Care in Colombia Could Look Like Under the Petro Government": "BOGOTÁ, Colombia—The center of this South American capital city filled out on August 6 with Indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians and peasants dressed in traditional attire to carry out the spiritual inauguration of recently elected President Gustavo Petro. The event took place a day before the official inauguration and was accompanied by rituals, songs and speeches.\n\nFor the first time in decades, fear does not reign among the vulnerable and historically abandoned sections of society. Representatives of these groups saluted the president during the inauguration.\n\n“Certainly, the only possible path to real transformation in the country will be achieved with articulated and respectful work between governmental bodies and our own forms of government,” said human-rights defender Marcela Londoño, while reading the popular mandate the collective handed to Petro.\n\nThe Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities that campaigned in favor of center-left former militant Petro and the first Afro-Colombian woman vice-president, Francia Márquez, helped the pair win up to 99 percent of votes in some regions. Now, these oppressed communities see Petro’s proposal to reform healthcare—among other aspects of Colombian society—as aligning with their culture as well as their spiritual understanding.\n\n“[Under the current system], health is seen as a business that does not value life,” said Mama Luz Dary Aranda, governor of the Guambia reservation in the Cauca department, in an interview with this reporter. “The proposal presented by Petro is the opposite.”\n\n‘Health for Life and Not for Business’\n\nPetro’s campaign promoted the slogan, “health for life and not for business,” advocating a reformed healthcare system based on the principles of prevention, participation, decentralization and an intercultural approach. Part of the proposed solution would involve creating a National Health Council, with the participation of civil society including, academics, healthcare workers, patients, peasants, and Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples. Other proposals include ending EPSs (Empresas Prestadoras de Servicios or intermediary health providers); improving scientific investigation and technological development; investing in education; and fighting climate change, among others.\n\nDuring the first healthcare meeting between Indigenous peoples and the Ministry of Health that took place on September 7, Minister Carolina Corcho ratified the compromise of working with the communities to develop the healthcare reform and announced future visits to continue the dialogue.\n\n“The political will by the government of Gustavo Petro—and today more specifically by the Ministry—is very important for this [Indigenous health] system to become a reality,” said Polivio Rosales, senator of the Indigenous Authorities Movement political party.\n\nIncorporating Indigenous Practices\n\nPetro’s program could contribute to complying with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommendation that health policies and programs should recognize and include traditional practices, such as medicine, to ensure the participation of the populations involved, as well as take into account respect for human rights, an intercultural approach, and gender equality.\n\nAfter modernizing medicinal production and engaging government officials—among other actions—the Indigenous and Intercultural Health System (IIHS) was founded in 2014. Yet, such advances have been unequally implemented.\n\n“Within the state’s policies, the Indigenous wisdom of health automatically becomes only an ancestral practice or a belief,” said Mama Ximena Hurtado, director of the Mama Dominga Hospital and health program coordinator on the Indigenous reservation of Guambia in the Cauca department. The title, “Mama,” is given to a woman who holds or has held a position within the Misak government. “Those words minimize our own science, and create a disadvantage and a barrier.”\n\nIn the days before and after Petro’s inauguration, he and a delegation of ministers held regional summits. The administration has prioritized historically abandoned regions, such as the Pacific, the Amazon and the island of San Andrés in the Caribbean Sea, where inequality as well as poor access to healthcare and education reign. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have participated in these summits.\n\nMisak People Develop a Healthcare Model\n\nMost Misak—around 21,000 people or 1.5 percent of the Colombian population—live on the Guambia reservation. It is located in the steep southwestern mountains of the Cauca region, a rich ecosystem characterized by moors, or high-altitude grasslands. This community has been leading nationally in developing a healthcare model, as well as in the recovery of traditional practices.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Misak community began taking back ancestral territories through occupation and, later, by negotiating with the government. Within this land, they have set up the House of Medicine Sierra Morena and the Mama Dominga Hospital. The Payan House of Memory, a three-story building constructed according to Misak traditional architectural practices, preserves their history and knowledge.\n\n“This generation has had the opportunity to receive both types of knowledge: The Western and the one taught here by the ‘shures’ and the ‘shuras’ (traditional doctors), which are transmitted from generation to generation and based on the knowledge about plants,” explained Floresmiro Calambas, in charge of the laboratory in the House of Medicine Sierra Morena.\n\nWithin the House of Medicine, the community has set up a medicinal garden with more than 200 species of plants that are processed in the laboratory to be distributed in the community. Misak people affiliated with the healthcare system can acquire natural medicines free of charge. Other services include midwifery, physiotherapy and care from a traditional doctor.\n\nThe Misak community also manages Mama Dominga Hospital, where locals can access basic health services.\n\n“Many of our Indigenous people do not like to leave the territory for fear of how they will be treated or because they do not speak the language,” Mama Ximena said.\n\nThe availability of a healthcare model within the Misak territory guarantees wider coverage in the community, closing the healthcare gap other rural Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have experienced.\n\nAranda argues respecting traditional knowledge while deploying Western practices, when necessary, is essential.\n\n“Sometimes the national healthcare system wants to impose their institutional practices on us,” she said.\n\n‘The Transition Will Be Difficult and We Understand It’\n\n“As Indigenous Peoples, we see health as a whole,” said Alberto Mendoza, delegate of the Wayuu people, after the September 7 meeting. “For that reason, the lack of water or the consumption of low-quality water, as well as the absence of sustainability, impact the health of individuals, families and communities.”\n\nDuring the Pacific region summit, Petro announced Márquez will facilitate regional equality. He committed to designating the first social expenditure to this region as it is the most unequal. Multidimensional poverty in the Pacific region—which takes into account access to health, education and employment—increased from 26 percent to 31 percent between 2019 and 2020.\n\nPetro recognized during his inauguration speech that the government needs to secure resources to implement social reforms.\n\nCongress members like Gustavo Bolivar recently have denounced the poor state of finances left by the previous president, Iván Duque. According to a report presented by the government transition team, the healthcare system has a budget deficit of 6.4 billion pesos (about $1.4 million) for 2022 and 4.6 billion (about $1 million) for 2023.\n\nA tax reform has already been presented in congress that is expected to raise about 25 billion pesos ($5.76 million) over the next year to help execute social programs. The reform includes increasing personal income taxes for the top 2 percent, who earn more than 10 million pesos monthly (around $2,300). Fossil-fuel exports and sugar-based products also will be taxed. The latter tax is designed to reduce health problems associated with sugar consumption.\n\nAranda recognizes Petro’s proposal will take time.\n\n“The transition will be difficult and we understand it,” she said. “But this is when new proposals will be needed and we believe we will be heard to present our proposals on Indigenous healthcare.”\n\n‘Food As Healthcare’\n\nIndigenous communities understand health goes beyond the absence of an illness. To them, health is linked to the environment, their territory, agricultural practice and nature in general. A relationship that, according to Mama Ximena, previous governments have not understood.\n\n“For us, for instance, food and food production are part of healthcare and, therefore, should be financed,” she said. “But [the Health Ministry] sees it as a responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.”\n\nPetro’s health reform proposal, as well as a wide range of policies that address education, drinking water, the environment and climate change, align with the cosmovision (understanding of life) of Indigenous communities.\n\n“It looks at how health can become a right,” Aranda said, “so that we all can live with dignity.”",
    "Colombia’s ‘dinosaur of peace’": "Researchers now know that, around 175 million years ago, a 12-metre long sauropod, roamed around an area of northern Colombia. The scientific world is attributing the discovery of this new species of herbivorous dinosaur to the improved security situation that exists in Colombia since the signing of a 2016 peace deal, which put an end to half a century of civil war.\n\nJust two years after the signing of the agreement, it was deemed safe for a group of researchers from the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, and the University of Michigan, United States, to visit the Serranía del Perijá, and gather fresh data.\n\n© Marcos Guevara Professor Aldo Rincón and his guide, Pedro Pablo Contreras, conducting fieldwork in the Serranía del Perijá mountain range.\n\nSearching for clues, 80 years on\n\nThe scientists returned to the place where a fossil of a dinosaur dorsal spine vertebra was found by a geologist working for an oil company in 1943. At the time no-one knew that it was part of a brand-new species and, after the find, the fossil was taken, along with some sediment samples, to the United States and given to the University of California scientific collection at Berkeley.\n\nAldo Rincón Burbano, professor at the Department of Physics and Geosciences at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla and one of the research leaders in Colombia, acknowledged that \"without the security conditions provided in the area today, it would have been difficult to return to the field. This is due to the Peace Agreement.\"\n\nThose security conditions are monitored by the UN Verification Mission in Colombia, which was established by the Security Council in 2017 to support the progress of the Peace Agreement, and verify the reintegration of former combatants of the FARC-EP rebel group and their families into Colombian society.\n\n© UNVMC/Jorge Quintero Félix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC combatant, was one of Professor Aldo Rincón's guides at the ETCR in Tierra Grata.\n\nFrom fighter to guide\n\nFormer FARC-EP fighters provided logistical services, lodging, and guides for the researchers, as they tried to locate the site where the fossil had been unearthed some 80 years earlier.\n\nFélix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC-EP combatant who now works on an ecotourism project in Tierra Grata, accompanied them on long walks, searching for the exact spot. \"I didn't know they were looking for a dinosaur because they were studying rocks; luckily I was familiar with the area because the former 41st front of the FARC operated there\".\n\n\"We spent almost a year in the process, writing and searching, and although we didn't find any new fossils, we managed to get to the site and find the same sediment collected alongside the vertebra in 1943”, says Mr. Rincón. “By studying the sediment, we were able to conclude that the vertebra was from a new genus, and a new species.”\n\nThey named the species Perijasaurus lapaz: the first part after the place where it was found, and the second as a tribute to the historic Peace Agreement. The dinosaur is similar to other sauropods of this period found in Asia, North Africa, and southern Patagonia, which were smaller than the later dinosaurs belonging to this group.\n\n“We still must look for more fossils in rocks of the same age in other areas of the country. Including the Tatacoa desert in Huila; the Girón area in Santander; and Nobsa in Boyacá,\", says Mr. Rincón.\n\nMr. Arango, the former combatant who accompanied Mr. Rincón and his team, says that, hopefully, these other investigations can also tell the story of the experience of former combatants, who now, thanks to peace, play a different role in society.",
    "Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry are Colombia's new promising fruits": "The new trades seek to consolidate international markets, such as Mexico and the USA. Both Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry have registered increases in exports during 2022.\n\nThe Colombian fruit export market continues to reactivate and grow. One of the strategies of several entities is to do so with the promising fruits produced there.\n\nThis comes along with a drive to consolidate in international markets. According to reports from ProColombia and the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), the ten most exported fruits are the following:\n\nThe main destinations for this exports are the following countries :\n\nAccording to Catalina Hernández, vice-president of Exports of ProColombia, both Cape gooseberry and passion fruit have great potential.\n\nAs for the first one, between January and July there was an increase of 5.6% in exports, reaching US$ 21.5 million. Recently explored markets include Mexico, Singapore, Brazil and Panama. Admissibility was obtained in Mexico. Although exports to that market have not yet been registered, studies have been shared with companies to support Colombian exporters in their internationalization processes.\n\nPassion fruit, on the other hand, grew by 25.8% during the first seven months of the year, registering US$30.7 million.\n\nFor this fruit, admissibility in the U.S. is a priority. Additionally, Italy was the market that showed the most growth during the first half of 2022.\n\nHernández also advises that, in order to reach international markets more efficiently, exotic fruit producers must adapt their supply to the requirements of these markets. Sustainability, detailed information on the products and a constant relationship with commercial partners are key. The latter is crucial in order to be aware of new forms of consumption and channels.\n\nHernández also explains that, because they are Colombian exotic fruits, other countries do not know how to consume them. For this reason, it is essential that the exporter and promotion entities support the process of educating and raising awareness in international markets.\n\nHow to achieve export success?\n\nThe Colombian Fruit and Vegetable Association (ASOHOFRUCOL) says that to ensure success in the export sector and encourage exports, they provide comprehensive technical assistance from planting to marketing.\n\nThey provide technical and financial resources in their certification processes regarding the quality seals required by the markets.\n\nThe ASOHOFRUCOL also helps strengthen the entrepreneurship of producers, they promote commercial approaches to link producers with formal allies that aim to export and provide training in relevant technical aspects for proper harvesting and post-harvesting.\n\nAlejandro Ángel, general manager of Caribbean Exotics, points out that these fruits are so sought after for their flavor, color, aroma, texture and high nutritional content.\n\nCaribbean Exotics is a leading company in the sector with more than 30 years of experience exporting exotic fruits to 16 countries.\n\nFor example, Cape gooseberries are a source of vitamin A (3,000 I.U. of carotene per 100 grams), vitamin C, vitamin B complex, protein (0.3%) and phosphorus (55%). Research has shown that it may help prevent diabetes when consumed.\n\nAdditionally, passion fruit is a source of antioxidants, healthy fats, calcium, phosphorus, iron and is rich in fiber and vitamins A, B and C.\n\n\"Thanks to the marketing strategy, Caribbean Exotics can ensure the supply of such fruits 365 days a year. Our suppliers are located in the best regions where soil conditions are optimal, so we can guarantee their quality standard,” Angel said.\n\n“In recent years we have reached Saudi Arabia for the first time, although according to information from the sector, these Colombian fruits also reach Lebanon and the Czech Republic.\n\n“Other countries such as Holland, Germany, Canada, France, Spain and the United Arab Emirates have had significant growth in recent years.\" Angel concluded.",

We played together. She is one of us.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these remote parts, where destiny is shaped by water and gold, the reference was clear: Francia Elena Márquez, the most eminent, and provocative, citizen of La Toma, a string of villages and farmsteads spread over verdant hills and valleys that is home to some 8,000 people, overwhelmingly of African ancestry. Most are descendants of slaves brought to South America centuries ago by the Spanish to work in mines and on plantations.\n\nThe view from a hilltop in La Toma, Colombia, hometown of Vice President Francia Elena Márquez.

She took office last month alongside President Gustavo Petro, 62, an ex-urban guerrilla and the first leftist chief executive of this nation of 50 million, long a key U.S. strategic ally.\n\nThe meteoric rise and ballot-box draw of Márquez — her charismatic appeal with minority, female and young voters helped boost Petro over the top in his third presidential bid — is a singular development, even at a moment when the left is again on the upswing in Latin America.\n\nPresident Gustavo Petro greets Vice President Francia Elena Márquez as Senate President Roy Barreras, left, and Chamber of Representatives President David Racero look on during the Aug. 7 inauguration in Bogota.

That is often the case in Latin America, where racism has persisted, typically in a less institutional, albeit no less insidious, manner than in the United States.\n\nHer high-profile advocacy has placed Márquez at the vanguard of an awakening of identity — and push for equality — among the country’s long-marginalized Afro-Colombian masses, who officially tally less than 10% of Colombia’s population. Advocates call that a vast undercount, reflecting centuries of neglect.\n\nColombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez takes part in a ritual during a traditional ceremony in her home municipality of Suarez on Aug. 13, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\n“People of African descent are at the bottom of the pyramid in terms of inequality,” said Helmer Quiñones, an activist who wears a Black Lives Matter pin on his lapel. “Francia Márquez is not the first great political leader in Colombia of African descent. But she also has a global profile, not just domestic.”\n\nMárquez’s big jewelry and multi-patterned outfits have emerged as a style point for admirers from backgrounds rural and urban, poor and wealthy. Her face stares from flamboyant wall murals, many proclaiming her campaign slogan: “Vivir sabroso” — roughly, live life to the fullest.\n\nAfro-Colombians were major participants in nationwide protests last year against what was then a conservative government. The massive street mobilizations, and police violence against protesters, set the stage for a “change” agenda in this year’s national voting.\n\nStill, many didn’t take Márquez’s chances seriously last year when she announced her bid for the presidency. But, in a March primary of the leftist Historic Pact coalition, she garnered almost 800,000 votes.\n\nPeople in Suarez, Colombia, watch the inauguration of President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez\n\non Aug. 7, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPetro, a sitting senator and former mayor of Bogota, the capital, won the primary and named Márquez his running mate; in a June runoff, the pair narrowly beat a conservative businessman. Their platform vowed social and political reformation of a nation battered by decades of civil war, narco-violence and deepening inequality.\n\nMárquez calls herself a champion of the “nobodies” — the county’s Black and Indigenous minorities, the poor, working-class women and others at the fringes of a nation historically dominated by a white-mestizo male elite based in the cool Andean climes of Bogota. Most of Colombia’s Afro-descendant peoples hail from the torrid zones along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.\n\nBeyond race, Márquez has unabashedly challenged sexism, classism, inequality and gender prejudice, among other incendiary topics. She has weathered threats against her life, racist taunts and denied allegations of links to armed guerrillas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternationally, Márquez has developed a kind of rock-star following as a fearless crusader for environmental, racial and gender justice, climate change and other timely issues.\n\n“I am part of the struggle against structural racism,” she declared in her 2018 Goldman Prize speech in San Francisco. “Among those women who raise their voices to stop the destruction of rivers, forests and wetlands. Among those who dream that, one day, all human beings are going to change the economic model of death to an economic model of life.”\n\nHer critics label her a divisive figure who deploys multicultural rhetoric to mask a lack of government experience in her ambitious march to the Casa de Narino, the presidential palace.\n\nA man holds a cardboard cutout of Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Bogota on Aug. 7, 2022. (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n“It’s very convenient for her and her followers to construct a defensive wall that characterizes as racist or classist any type of criticism,” Luis Guillermo Vélez, an opposition politician, wrote during the presidential campaign. “Francia Márquez’s personal story may be admirable.... But that doesn’t exempt her from responding to questions about her political ideas.”\n\nAfter less than two months in office, Márquez’s exact role in the new administration remains largely undefined, a fact that has unsettled some of her supporters. Márquez has pushed for the creation of a Ministry of Equality, with her at the helm. But that has yet to happen as Petro faces various daunting challenges, notably pacifying a deeply polarized nation.\n\n“The time has come to build peace, a peace that implies social justice,” Márquez said after the election.\n\nMárquez’s activist roots lie here in La Toma, one of a number of predominantly Afro-Colombian townships in Colombia’s southwestern Cauca department.\n\nThe region’s breathtaking beauty belies a harsh reality: It is a largely lawless, conflict-ridden zone where narco-traffickers harvest swaths of coca and marijuana, wildcat miners poison waterways and fell forests, and sundry armed groups — guerrillas, killers for hire, paramilitaries, criminal bands — hold sinister sway and grab land.\n\nColombia perennially ranks among the world’s most perilous places for activists protecting land and water resources. Scores are killed each year. And Cauca is ground zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the people of La Toma and environs, gold mining has historically been a key source of income, supplementing subsistence farming. But gold, and gold fever, have inevitably spurred conflict.\n\nResidents of La Toma have long practiced both alluvial mining — panning in the Ovejas for gold washed down from the hills — and digging for ore in tunnels cut deep into dirt and rock.\n\nIn an autobiographical article for Colombia’s El Espectador newspaper, Márquez recalled that Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were always dedicated to family gold mining. When she finished primary school, Márquez wrote, her mother — a midwife who had 11 children — said there was no money for further studies. But an aunt invited the young Márquez to work in a mine, a job that provided cash to buy a school uniform, books and cover other educational costs.\n\n“She was very studious, very extroverted and very involved with her process of education,” said Azael Balanta, 54, who was Márquez’s primary school teacher in her home village, Yolombo, one of five villages that make up La Toma, part of the municipality of Suárez. “But I never thought that the Francia Elena who was my student would so quickly become vice president of the Republic of Colombia.”\n\nLa Toma, Márquez wrote in El Espectador, has a history of land battles. Her grandfather and other elders were thrown into jail in a dispute with a landlord. Relatives gathered gold to pay a lawyer to help free them.\n\n“The struggle in my territory, in my community ... has passed from generation to generation,” Márquez wrote.\n\nIn her youth, she wrote, outsiders would casually fling racist insults — “You are descendants of slaves.” Or: “You come from Africa, a miserable place.”\n\nEarly on, Márquez also heard about environmental injustice. The 1980s construction of the Salvajina Dam, on the Cauca River, near La Toma, was widely condemned. The project flooded the lands of thousands of Afro-Colombian and other farmers and devastated traditional fishing, mining and agricultural activities, residents say.\n\nAs a teenager, Márquez joined her La Toma neighbors in protesting a multinational company’s plan to divert the Ovejas river — La Toma’s essential water source — to boost power for the Salvajina Dam.\n\nThe rising price of gold eventually drew the interest of multinational companies and others keen to cash in on the area’s treasures. Márquez became a plaintiff in a 2010 lawsuit alleging that Colombian authorities had awarded mining rights in La Toma without soliciting community input, as required by law. Colombia’s highest court agreed and suspended the concessions, a major victory — and a signal to Márquez that the legal system could be an ally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople work at a street market in Suarez, Colombia. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nStill, the situation in La Toma and surrounding areas was becoming more fraught. In April 2010, gunmen killed eight miners along the Ovejas. Residents blamed right-wing paramilitary forces in the employ of mining interests. Authorities pointed to leftist guerrillas who impose extortion fees on anyone mining on their turf.\n\nSoon, a rash of bulldozers and backhoes moved into La Toma, tearing up the riverbank and hillsides in search of gold. Gunmen threatened anyone who stood in the miners’ way, residents said. The influx worsened deforestation and increased dumping into the Ovejas of mercury and cyanide, two highly toxic chemicals widely used to separate gold from rock.\n\nThe mass intrusion into La Toma provided the impetus for Márquez’s signature act: In November 2014, she burst onto the national stage leading a march of 80 Black women — known as the March of the Turbans, after their African-inspired head attire — from La Toma to Bogota, more than 300 miles away, protesting the presence of the illegal miners.\n\nThe demonstrators remained outside the Interior Ministry for three weeks, demanding a solution. Finally, the government relented and agreed to evict the illegal miners.\n\nBy then, Márquez was a single mother of two, and had received threats. Joining the ranks of millions of Colombians displaced by violence, she had left vulnerable La Toma for the city of Cali, home to a large Afro-Colombian population, and began studying law.\n\nIn 2015, Márquez received a national human rights award. Three years later, she won the Goldman Prize, which thrust her into international prominence.\n\n“She overcame sexism, racism and corruption to lead La Toma’s struggle,” the Goldman citation said. Not long afterward, while working at cleaning houses, Márquez told a newspaper editor: “I’m going to be president one day.”\n\nIn La Toma, reached on a bumpy two-hour drive from the nearest major city, Márquez is a figure of adulation. She has also raised some modest expectations — that running water will finally be widely available, that more roads will be paved, that educational opportunities will improve, that the pervasive sense of insecurity will diminish.\n\nA mural portrays Colombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Suarez. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We want to be able to keep on studying to become better people, just like Francia did,” said Doris Adriana Ocoró, 22, a nursing student who was panning for gold on a recent morning with her husband, as her daughter, 3, watched. “We have learned a lot from Francia, and from our ancestors.”\n\nOver at the Santa Rosa de Lima school, students said Márquez’s ascension had also inspired them. At an outdoor musical performance, Jinller Leany, 12, and Andrea Torres, 15, sang a song about dignity and pride:\n\nI was born Black and my companion is the sun\n\nTo the rhythm of the marimba and first the drum\n\nMy name is African mixed with Spanish ...\n\nI am proud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nProud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nBlack I was born, and Black I am.\n\nSpecial correspondents Liliana Nieto del Río in La Toma and Cecilia Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.",

The organization also runs many smaller missions that support conflict-resolution and justice efforts in specific countries, including several in Latin America. Though they don’t always make headlines, these U.N. projects often serve as important arbiters.\n\nColombia offers one example. U.N. monitors were critical to the rapid demobilization of guerrilla fighters after the country’s 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was signed. Today, the U.N. mission in Colombia is assisting new President Gustavo Petro’s efforts to explore a demobilization deal with other guerrilla fighters who sat out of the negotiations six years ago.\n\nThe mission’s “fundamental legitimacy and strength comes from the fact that both sides [of the 2016 peace deal] called for it to be there,” the International Crisis Group’s Ivan Briscoe told Foreign Policy. Even when Iván Duque—who had been opposed to the deal and was resistant to putting his full support behind it—took Colombia’s presidential office in 2018, the mission found a way to continue its work and preserve its legitimacy, Briscoe said.\n\nIn Honduras, U.N. envoys are currently in talks with President Xiomara Castro’s government about opening a special anti-corruption commission in partnership with local prosecutors and judges. A similar U.N.-backed commission was founded in Guatemala in 2007, and Castro had pledged to establish one in Honduras when she campaigned for the presidency late last year.\n\nA previous Organization of American States (OAS)-backed effort to install an anti-corruption commission in Honduras in 2016 was short lived, and its mandate was allowed to expire under Castro’s predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was extradited to the United States and charged for drug trafficking this year.\n\nFor such a commission to be effective, analysts have argued, it must be free from political inference. Though Guatemala’s commission revolutionized anti-corruption work in the country over the course of about a decade, then-Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales shut it down in 2018—when it began to investigate him. Castro and the U.N. are negotiating just how much independence the commission will have; for example, U.N. envoys have hesitated at her proposal to allow her administration to choose its investigators, El Faro reported.\n\n“Castro’s challenge lies in keeping [her party’s] nose out of the judiciary,” El Faro’s Roman Gressier wrote. If the commission moves forward with independence, it will amount to “[swimming] against the current … in a region whose courts and top prosecutors … have become subservient to the sitting governments.”\n\nMeanwhile, a U.N. fact-finding mission on Venezuela this week released a new report documenting government forces’ torture and rape of detainees from 2014 to the present and tracing the human rights abuses to plans orchestrated “at the highest levels of the government.” Last month, 125 Venezuelan and international civil society and human rights groups praised the U.N. mission and called for its renewal, writing that it has “advanced a search for truth, justice, and reparation.”\n\nThe groups called the U.N. mission’s work complementary to stalled negotiations on Venezuela’s political crisis, writing that its recommendations identify problems that must be addressed in the talks—whenever they resume.\n\nCurrent U.N. missions in Latin America do not always garner this kind of praise from local human rights groups. In Haiti in particular, some civil society advocates have fiercely criticized the U.N. mission there—which has a mandate to enforce political stability, peace, and human rights—for continuing to back unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry as the country has experienced violent unrest in the wake of former President Jovenel Moïse’s 2021 assassination.\n\nStill, the aforementioned U.N. efforts in Colombia, Venezuela, and Honduras are providing support for peace and justice work in ways their polarized host societies would not be able to do alone.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24: The foreign ministers of the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are slated to meet on the sidelines of the U.N.

Mexico and the Caribbean were pummeled by natural disasters on the anniversaries of previous tragedies this week. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit Mexico on Sept. 19, the same day as disastrous 2017 and 1985 quakes, while Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Turks and Caicos Islands on the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria.\n\nFiona’s damage was vast, with Puerto Rican authorities registering up to eight deaths by Thursday. The island also experienced a blackout, and 1 million people were reportedly still without power by Thursday morning. In Mexico, Monday’s quake, which left two people dead, came just hours after residents of Mexico City had participated in an earthquake readiness drill. A subsequent quake on Thursday, which President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called an aftershock, also reportedly killed at least two people.\n\nBukele on the ballot. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said last Thursday that he plans to seek reelection in 2024, an announcement that surprised few. El Salvador’s constitution prohibits presidential reelection, but last year, a panel on the country’s Supreme Court—then recently stacked with pro-Bukele justices—ruled it should be allowed. At the time, the U.S. State Department was among those publicly criticizing the ruling.\n\nReactions from human rights and democracy advocates were harsh. “Today, a new [Hugo] Chávez emerges,” tweeted José Miguel Vivanco, a former Human Rights Watch Americas chief.\n\nThe announcement also prompted a letter from a forum of former Latin American and Spanish leaders that urged the OAS to take measures to “promote the normalization of democratic institutionality” in El Salvador, invoking the OAS’s charter on democracy.\n\nA Guatemalan Indigenous man plays a Mayan ball game at San Juan La Laguna in Sololá, Guatemala, on Sept. 18, 2021.\n\nPause the soccer talk. Mexico’s national Indigenous and Traditional Games took place this month in the state of Sonora, pitting 500 Indigenous athletes against one another in 125 games and sporting activities. It was the 23rd such annual meeting.\n\nWhile some games played at the event involved physical tools—such as balls, gloves, and hockey-like sticks—it also featured mountain running and “mental skill games,” such as contests in how to plan for the harvest. Researchers attended the events to better understand how some of them were connected to Indigenous spirituality, organizer Ana Claudia Collado García told EFE news agency.\n\nOne of the sports played at the event was ulama, where players hit a heavy rubber ball back and forth using their hips. The pre-Colombian game was played across ancient Mexico and Central America and has enjoyed a revival in Mexico over the past decade, during which Mexico City even opened an ulama court. This month’s competition featured Mexico’s second national ulama tournament.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nWhich of the following guerrilla groups had already gone defunct by the time of Colombia’s 2016 peace agreement?

Lasso has sought such a restructuring since early in his presidency, which began last year, and traveled to Beijing in February to pursue it.\n\nUnder the 2007 to 2017 presidency of Rafael Correa, Ecuador took out billions of dollars in loans from China under terms that were opaque to the public, drawing criticism. By this February, Lasso said Ecuador’s outstanding debt to China was $4.6 billion.\n\nUnder the new deal, Ecuador will have three more years to pay back its debts to two Chinese state banks, now due in 2027 and 2032, and will also owe lower interest rates on those payments. Lasso said the deal would free up $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on debt repayments by 2025. Ecuador also owes China barrels of oil as part of a separate debt, and last week, Ecuador announced China would allow a delay in scheduled deliveries. This will grant Ecuador some additional $709 million in oil revenue through 2027, the country’s state oil company said.\n\n“This looks like a fairly standard rescheduling,” the Council on Foreign Relations’ Brad Setser tweeted about the news. “Necessary, but not earthshattering.”\n\nLasso celebrated the deal, and economic analyst Alberto Acosta-Burneo told Bloomberg that it was significant not only for providing short-term relief but also because it represented a “relaunch of the relationship with China” and could even pave the way for a new credit line from China in the future. Ecuador is on a tight repayment schedule to the International Monetary Fund and may have trouble borrowing on international capital markets because of its poor rankings from credit agencies, Bloomberg noted.\n\nChina has now carried out post-pandemic debt extensions in several countries, but it has rarely done so in cooperation with other creditors. The sheer scale of Chinese lending to developing countries has prompted scholars, such as Ulrich Volz at SOAS University of London, to call for a more multilateral approach to Chinese debt restructurings.",

    "Colombia May Shoot Itself In The Foot With Ban On Fracking": "The controversial hydrocarbon technique hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, which sparked the U.S. oil boom catapulting that country to become the largest petroleum producer globally, is drawing considerable attention in Latin America. A major fracking boom is underway in the region’s third largest economy, Argentina, which is driving oil and natural gas production to record highs. Mexico is also embracing the controversial hydrocarbon extraction technique to boost economically crucial petroleum output. Fracking is also under consideration in Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay as Latin American economies, hit hard by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, struggle to boost growth and government income while reducing soaring poverty. In stark contrast the strife-torn Colombia is seeking to ban fracking with newly appointed leftwing President Gustavo Petro having campaigned on an anti-extractivist platform.\n\nDuring his electoral campaign Colombia’s first ever leftwing president stated he intended to end contracting for oil exploration and ban fracking in the Andean country. This will sharply impact Colombia’s hydrocarbon dependent economy and potentially cut funding for Petro’s planned programs aimed at alleviating poverty. For over a decade Colombia has punched well-above its weight when it comes to hydrocarbon production. Despite a lack of proven oil reserves, which at the end of 2021 amounted to just over 2 billion barrels sufficient for 7.6 years of production, Colombia is Latin America’s third largest oil producer. The expansion of the oil industry over the last two decades, with annual average petroleum output exceeding one million barrels per day for the first time during 2013, saw petroleum become a key economic driver.\n\nCrude oil is Colombia’s largest export responsible for around a third of the Andean country’s total exports by value. Data from Colombian government statistics agency, DANE, shows the Andean country exported $12.1 billion of crude oil and derivative products for the first seven months of 2022. That represents 35% of all exports, which totaled $34.6 billion, for the period, making petroleum Colombia’s single largest export. The peak oil industry body, the Colombian Petroleum Association, estimated the hydrocarbon sector (Spanish) directly contributed $20 trillion Colombian pesos to government coffers during 2021 which was a considerable increase over the $11.5 trillion generated in 2020 but less than the $26.2 trillion paid during 2019. The industry body believes that amount will rise to over $24 trillion pesos for 2022. Those numbers indicate Colombia’s oil industry is responsible for generating around a fifth of government revenue. That underscores the industry’s importance as a source of fiscal income, especially with the Petro administration planning to hike government spending on social programs in an uncertain economic environment weighed down by runaway inflation and fears of a global recession.\n\nRelated: Oil Falls Below $80 As Powell Warns A Recession May Be Looming\n\n\n\nColombia’s endemic lack of proven oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with an absence of large-scale discoveries for two-decades, points to fracking being the only viable means of sustaining the Andean country’s vital hydrocarbon sector. This is especially the case with Colombia’s proven oil reserves set to expire by around 2030 and sooner if production returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 880,000 barrels per day. Since 2017 Colombia has been facing a natural gas crisis, which forced the country to start importing liquified natural gas in December 2017. That further stresses the need for Bogota to focus on bolstering energy security and expanding hydrocarbon reserves, particularly with proven natural gas reserves of nearly 3.164 trillion cubic feet only capable of sustaining production for eight years.\n\nFracking has long been seen as a solution to Colombia’s limited proven hydrocarbon reserves. The U.S. EIA estimates Colombia has at least 5.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and 20.1 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the Middle Magdalena and Llanos Basins alone. Colombia’s highest administrative tribunal the Council of State in a July 2022 ruling overturned its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, established in 2018, and rejected a lawsuit seeking to ban fracking in Colombia. The court found that the rules implemented by the Duque administration, which left office on 7 August 2022 when Petro was inaugurated, for fracking are legal. The decision opened the door for the commencement of commercial fracking operations in Colombia.\n\nNonetheless, moves are afoot by Petro’s administration to ban fracking in Colombia despite the Council of State of Ruling. The Andean country’s Congress recently held a hearing for Bill 114 of 2022 (Spanish) which seeks to prohibit hydraulic fracturing of the exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits. The bill is supported by Colombia’s President whose Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development Susana Muhammad was quoted as stating in local media (Spanish):\n\n“We believe that fracking and unconventional ones are not a path that accelerates the energy transition because it would delay it, has high environmental costs especially in land use, in the use of water and irrigation not known and difficult to know only, as is the impact on the very complex Colombian geology,\"\n\nFor the bill to proceed it must be debated by a congressional commission and discussed in both chambers before approval and authorization by Colombia’s president.\n\nRising uncertainty surrounding fracking saw Colombia’s state-controlled energy company Ecopetrol request permission (Spanish) from the industry regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH – Spanish initials), to suspend its two fracking pilots for 90-days. Ecopetrol, which is the operator, partnered with ExxonMobil to develop two fracking projects in the Middle Magdalena Valley, near the municipality of Puerto Wilches, known as Kale and Platero. The pilots are attracting substantial opposition from the local community, primarily over concerns regarding water contamination. A Barrancabermeja court ruled in the favor of a community organization which sought to end the projects on the basis that Ecopetrol had not consulted with the local community as required by Colombian law. The Administrative Court of Santander later overruled that decision finding the request for prior consultation by the local Afrowilches community was inadmissible. Those events indicate that even if Bill 114 of 2022 is not passed into law considerable opposition to fracking will continue in Colombia, making its introduction fraught with uncertainty, thereby deterring the required investment from energy companies.\n\nBy Matthew Smith for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Five Ways Sustainable Travel is Accelerating Across Colombia": "The secret has long been out: Colombia is booming as a travel destination, and a visit now will reveal far more gringos visiting than what could be seen only a few short weeks before the global pandemic shut everything down. But now, travelers are back, and popular hotels, guesthouses and hostels are booking up fast. With an influx of visitors comes social and environmental risks, but there are ways to visit this incredible country while mitigating your impact, starting with a few examples below.\n\nNo, you don't need to kill anything now if you want a taco craving (Leon Kaye)\n\nVegan restaurants are easy to find and widely available\n\nColombian food is often brilliant in its simplicity: a protein with sides of starches such as rice, plantains, yucca and potatoes (usually fried) as well as a salad or vegetables. But for those visitors who prefer to avoid any animal products, vegan eateries are increasingly are becoming an option — and while Happy Cow is always a reliable source for locating these places, walking around any neighborhood to find a vegan place should be a matter of minutes, not hours.\n\nTake Medellín, for example. As in many Colombian cities, Mexican food has long become a thing. Walking around El Poblado, a neighborhood long popular with visitors for its forested landscape, range of accommodation and nightlife, it’s easy to find vegetarian and vegan options: and requesting a dish to be vegano is often accommodated. El Pablado itself has at least a couple places offering vegan tacos: Other popular eateries, such as Criminal Taquería, will tweak their menu items if requested.\n\nEven smaller towns, such as the lakeside resort of Guatapé, has vibrant vegan options – and the chances are high that you’ll see locals dining in restaurants as well.\n\nA vegan cazuela (stew), in Guatapé (Leon Kaye)\n\nMore responsible options for transport\n\nPublic transport is always the best option to get around, especially in Colombia, were traipsing within the city centers of Medellín, Bogotá and Cali will nudge you to wear a mask, even if COVID isn’t a concern of yours. Diesel emissions from old vehicles, paired with the fact many of Colombia’s larger cities are wedged between mountains, means dubious levels of emissions.\n\nUber says it is doing its part to take on this challenge. You won’t be able to book an electric car in Colombia yet, but the company is offering riders in big cities an “Uber Planet” option: a 2 percent increase in fees that Uber says will fund Anaconda Carbon, a non-profit partner that issues carbon bonds. These bonds will fund programs that will take on local climate action projects, boost biodiversity protection and reduce the environmental impact of illegal activities such as informal gold mining.\n\nIf you use Uber, keep in mind the fraught relationship the company as with the Colombian government. For a while, Uber was outright banned, but now the service is currently available. But depending on who you talk to, however, Uber is “illegal.” Drivers often keep their phones on their leg or close to the stick shift to avoid any attention from the police — they’ll also often ask you to sit in the front, so they don’t score any attention from police officers or any taxi drivers who resent the service.\n\nOther options to Uber include DiDi and Cabify, which allow you to book through a smartphone app but give you the option to pay the driver in cash.\n\nMedellín’s metro is a gem — fast, efficient and clean and about 3,000 pesos ($0.75) a ride, and they include transfers to most cable cars (gondola lines), which allow you to snap breathtaking views of the city.\n\nAttractions such as Jardín Botánico Joaquín Antonio Uribe in Medellín are accessible by the city's metro (Leon Kaye)\n\nCycling offers a great path toward learning more about Colombia\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of transportation, no trip to Colombia is complete without experiencing its cities and land from two wheels.\n\nPart of cycling’s popularity stems from that fact that Colombians were besides themselves when one of their own, Egan Bernal, won 2019’s Tour de France. In a race dominated for decades by the Belgians, Spanish, Italians and yes, the French, Bernal was the first Latin American to win the 2,200-mile (3,500 kilometers) race.\n\nThe surge in the popularity of cycling is seen in cities such as Bogotá, which has opened up new lanes in order to help citizens move more freely across the city. Bogotá, which years ago launched its ciclovía program on Sundays to encourage residents to walk or cycle on roads that ordinarily would be choking with cars and trucks, has expanded the program so that it’s now occurring daily. Depending on the day of the week, the length of streets closed to cars and opened to cyclists have expanded as much as five-fold. This is on top of the 300-plus miles (500 km) of permanent bicycle lanes that crisscross Colombia’s capital.\n\nMedellín and Cali are among other Colombian cities that have closed major roads on Sundays for years, in part to combat those urban areas’ stubborn air pollution. The success of those car-free days, or ciclovía, have led cities worldwide like Los Angeles to launch their own version of open street days.\n\nCycling tours in Colombia's cities are easy to book (Leon Kaye)\n\nPublic libraries for all\n\nColombia still has deep social divisions, evidenced in the recent elections that launched the country’s politically left president ever. The country of 52 million-plus people has one of the widest income gaps between the rich and poor worldwide. Nevertheless, some local governments deserve credit for addressing the problem. Medellín’s municipal government is one of them.\n\nAmong its various programs, Medellín’s parques bibliotecas (library parks) rank as among the most innovative tactics to expand social welfare. Over the past ten to fifteen years, many of these libraries were built in the poorest neighborhoods where social services were often non-existent or difficult to access. Most of them are architectural gems, deserving of a visit. Residents apparently agree, and the fact that these libraries have a full calendar of events geared to education and children certainly help boost their popularity.\n\nParque Biblioteca León De Greiff La Ladera, Medellín (via Facebook)\n\nVisiting national parks, with limits\n\nColombia’s lush biodiversity is one reason why travelers are increasingly finding their way to the country, whether they seek to trek up one of the few glaciers in a tropical zone, visit the lush Pacific coast or explore the country’s mountainous Zona Cafetera.\n\nBut that tidal wave of interest is paired with the risk of more ecological damage. To that end, local authorities have established limits on how many people can visit these natural wonders, including Los Nevados and Tayrona.\n\nImage credits: Leon Kaye",
    "Part 1: Colombia's advertisers recognise their agencies great work": "Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 in Colombia reconfirms the great potential of this market, which has historically surprised with its high satisfaction levels in advertiser-agency relations.\n\nSource © Flavia Carpio Unsplash Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 reconfirms the great potential of the Colombian market\n\nThe following positive results are revealed in Scopen’s Agency Scope 2022 study in Colombia.\n\nSatisfaction of advertisers with their creative and media agencies\n\nAll indicators related to advertisers´ evaluation of their agencies are highly positive, and even better than those obtained in past editions, which were already good.\n\nAdvertisers declare themselves much more satisfied than in 2020 (43.6% declare themselves \"very satisfied\" with their creative agencies. 13.3% more than in 2020 and 39.6% with their media agencies - 10% points more than in the last edition).\n\nDue to this great satisfaction, the predisposition to change has decreased: 75.5% of advertisers will most definitely not change their creative agency and 76.9% their media agency (20 points more in 2020 in both cases).\n\nAll this reflects the great work that agencies are doing for advertisers. Of 47 service attributes analysed, in 32 of them, creative agencies are better valued than in the last edition; and of 35 attributes, media agencies evolve positively in 27 of them (especially in the digital area).\n\nAnd, not only that, but advertisers consider that their agencies are contributing more and more to the growth of their businesses (in both cases with a percentage close to 30%). That almost a third of business growth is due to the agency´s work reflects the importance that the advertising industry has when it comes to its clients ' businesses, and the great work they do together.\n\nConsequently, advertisers recommend their agencies to a greater extent (NPS grows by 15 points for both creative and media agencies) and advertiser-agency relationships are consolidated, both in duration (average duration grows by half a year) and, in the relationship model, becoming more and more ongoing and less for specific projects.\n\nThe great positioning that agencies have achieved in the minds of advertisers\n\nWhen we ask advertisers about their current internal challenges, they remain the same as in the past: strengthening their prestige and perception in the market and adapting to the new times.\n\nHowever, they are increasingly concerned about understanding their consumers and how to reach them, and betting internally on creativity, innovation and digital.\n\nOnce they´ve declared their challenges, we ask them which companies (agencies, media, platforms, consultants, etc.) they consider could help them face these challenges, and this is where the great change lies compared to the past.\n\nIt is no longer the large digital platforms that dominate the top positions (as was the case in 2020 and is still the case in most of the markets where we carry out the Agency Scope), but rather the most mentioned creative and media agencies.\n\nAdvertisers consider that they are the ones who can and have to help them overcome their challenges. They trust them and see them as responsible for this help.\n\nAnother point we ask advertisers is if, of all the agencies they work with, regardless of their profile, they consider any of them as their \"lead agency\" (an agency that leads the communication of their company and is the one that coordinates the rest of partners). In just six years, the percentage of customers who confirm this has almost doubled, increasing from 24% to 46%.\n\nThe agencies have positioned themselves internally with their clients, not just as providers of communication and marketing services, but as partners capable of leading, coordinating and implementing. The internal reinforcement that the agencies have made in key areas such as data, strategy and digital, has resulted in the current better positioning.\n\nAdvertisers´ in-house movement loses strength\n\nHistorically, Colombia has been a market in which important advertisers worked internally on their communication. When people began to talk about this trend in the UK we had already seen it in Colombia. It was a big concern for the agencies. Their competitors were no longer so much other agencies or consultancies or digital platforms, but rather their own clients.\n\nHowever, in this edition, we observe how advertisers work less in marketing areas and disciplines internally. And not only that but, compared to the rest of the markets, Colombia is behind when it comes to in-house services.\n\nThe great work of agencies with advertisers, their constant evolution in areas such as data, and business strategy among others, and the \"bad experiences\" of some advertisers that have tried out this trend, have been the main reasons behind this change. Work carried out by the agencies, their knowledge, their contribution are very complex to internalise.",
    "Colombia relaunches plan to buy fighter jets": "SANTIAGO, Chile — Colombian President Gustavo Petro has reactivated the process to acquire new fighter jets to replace the country’s aging Kfir fleet.\n\nPetro’s decision may come as a surprise given his stance earlier this year on the campaign trail, when he said the purchase of combat aircraft or other military hardware would not be a priority during his time in office, if elected.\n\nMilitary sources in the capital Bogota, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their careers, told Defense News that the credit for Petro’s U-turn belongs to Gen. Luis Carlos Córdoba, the chief of the Colombian Air Force. They explained that Córdoba convinced Defense Minister Iván Velásquez about the urgent need to replace at least part of the Kfir fleet, which will begin retirements later this year, and Velásquez in turn persuaded the president.\n\nSince 1989, Colombia has acquired 24 Kfir jets, made by Israel Aerospace Industries. To counterbalance the acquisition of Sukhoi Su-32 fighters by Venezuela, Colombia’s Kfir fleet underwent upgrades between 2009 and 2017 performed by IAI’s Lahav Division.\n\nThe last upgrade, to the C-60 standard, involved fitting Elta Systems’ ELM-2032 active electronically scanned array radar and a data link as well as integrating Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ Derby weapon — an air-to-air, beyond-visual-range missile. IAI says that standard is equivalent to the F-16 Block 52.\n\nColombia’s modernized Kfirs are possibly the most advanced fighter jets with the most capable systems in service in South America. But the age of the airframes is taking its toll; between 2012 and 2014, multiple aircraft were lost in accidents, at one point grounding the entire fleet. Extensive maintenance support from IAI brought the aircraft back to service.\n\nThe Colombian government is now considering how it can afford to buy new fighters. The president is already pressing for investments in social issues, and about 25% of the country’s annual budget is earmarked to pay off debts.\n\nBogota-based independent defense and security analyst Erich Saumeth is skeptical.\n\n“President Preto came into power making many promises about social development spending, and has a core group of supporters that are not friendly about buying military equipment. On the other hand, the Army and Navy also have need of modernization,” Saumeth told Defense News. “So either nothing will happen, or [there will be] a not-so-good, sort-of-mediocre stopgap solution.”\n\nColombia previously received offers of secondhand Eurofigher Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighters, but the Air Force, which prefers single-engine aircraft, appears focused on Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and Saab’s Gripen. The government has already received offers of both new aircraft of the latest variants as well as secondhand, upgraded options.\n\nOne of the military sources told Defense News that “most likely a first batch of 12 aircraft will be procured” and that “secondhand offers of modern airframes with a large service life remaining and significant upgrade potential are surely to attract more interest than before.”\n\nJosé Higuera is the South America correspondent for Defense News, covering South American and Latin American affairs.",

    "Hope for Colombia?": "Francia Márquez serves alongside Colombia’s first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, whose manifesto promises to bring much-needed reform to Colombia.\n\nYet Márquez has stepped into government - the very institution that has for so long excluded the communities she represents.\n\nI’m curious to see how she will be received by congress and whether her activist spirit will shine through in her new position of power and influence.\n\nJustice\n\nMárquez is the daughter of miners. Her lineage is deeply rooted within Afro-Colombian artisanal gold mining in her ancestral town of La Tomba – which has long been threatened by multinational mining companies and land grabs.\n\nHaving become a single parent at 16 years old, Márquez became a miner herself to support her family.

    "Colombia Expects Record Passenger Numbers In 2022": "Colombia has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas in 2022.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities (Aerocivil) expect the country to receive up to 46 million passengers in 2022, which would be an all-time record, surpassing pre-pandemic traffic levels by nearly 12%. Colombia, fueled by the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers such as Viva and Ultra Air, and a strong recovery from domestic powerhouses Avianca and LATAM, has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas this year.\n\nFlying high\n\nAerocivil released the latest traffic numbers this week, stating that the airlines in this country carried 31.6 million passengers between January and August. This number represents an 85.6% increase compared to 2021 levels and a 17% increase compared to 2019 levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDomestically, Avianca has carried around eight million passengers, followed by LATAM Colombia, with approximately six million passengers, and Viva Colombia, with about 4.5 million travelers.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities estimate that, by the end of 2022, close to 46 million passengers will travel to and from the country. If this number is achieved, the traffic levels will grow by nearly 12% compared to 2019, when Colombia received 41.13 million travelers.\n\nGuillermo Fransico Reyes González, Colombia’s new Minister of Transportation, said that the record numbers posted by the South American country are not only an achievement of the airline industry and local authorities “but also a commitment to Colombians, to whom we have to provide increasingly accessible and quality services.”\n\nFrancisco Ospina Ramírez, director of Aerocivil, added that growth presents the country “with enormous challenges to continue strengthening airport infrastructure and operations in general. We are committed to the country and the air connectivity of its people.”\n\nColombia expects to receive up to 44 million passengers this year. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe strongest recovery\n\nColombia became the country with the most robust recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), Colombia had a 9% increase in international passengers up until July 2022, and a 22% growth in the domestic segment, compared to 2019. Only the Dominican Republic surpassed Colombia in the international segment, with a 16% growth over pre-pandemic levels. Domestically, Colombia was first.\n\nOverall, the Latin American region has had the strongest passenger recovery worldwide (although this does not mean regional airlines are financially recovered from the pandemic). On the contrary, most airlines across the region have experienced financial losses; rising fuel costs, ramping inflation, and the devaluation of local currencies could put some of these airlines in danger of disappearing. Among the airlines that are currently under threat are Viva Colombia, Viva Peru, and Aeromar.\n\nColombia has had the strongest traffic recovery in the region. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe voice of the expert\n\nJosé Ricardo Botelho, executive director and CEO of ALTA, recently said that the continued removal of restrictions on international traffic in the Latin American region has been critical to the remarkable recovery of countries such as Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Brazil.\n\n“Looking to the future, we know that the population will continue to require air transportation; however, in order to make it truly possible for more people to use this means of transportation, we need to continue reducing costs associated with fees and taxes, as well as continue optimizing regulations that generate inefficiencies,” he added.\n\nHave you traveled recently to Colombia?

She sacrificed her upper-class life in Bogotá, Colombia, venturing into the unknown as a single parent of four and immigrating to Miami for us to achieve educations in English and dreams in dollars.\n\nJust over two decades later, I've come back for the reason she left: the pursuit of happiness. For my mom, that meant safety and opportunity during a time when our country was considered one of the most dangerous in the world. In certain parts, it still is. I built on her foundation to seek opulence.\n\n\"The ones that live there are the ones that can, not the ones that want,\" my private driver commented while arriving at Poblado, my new neighborhood. I blushed, thinking I was finally included in the elite.\n\n\"You can't just give up,\" my mom said on the phone when I arrived.\n\nBut entering my two-bedroom, two-bathroom doorman apartment with a balcony overlooking a city surrounded by mountains did not feel like defeat. I treated myself to dinner at a renowned restaurant and walked out thinking, \"How cheap!\" The next day, I paid $13 for a manicure and pedicure, then $37 for a facial.\n\nYou can't buy happiness, but I suddenly felt the high of power and access that doesn't exist in the US for a freelance writer.\n\nI couldn't afford my lifestyle in New York\n\nI began researching digital nomads after ending a four-year relationship that ran long past its expiration date. I never imagined finances would be a reason to stay, until I couldn't afford to leave.

Yet, I couldn't afford to live alone in a city I swore I couldn't live without. Becoming roommates with strangers sounded like another step back, and other metropolitan cities seemed to compete to win the title of \"most overpriced.\" I decided if I could let go of my toxic relationship with a man, I could do the same with geography.\n\nI chose to live where I'm better off\n\nDigital-office culture has empowered many like me with the privilege of lifestyle migration — working remotely abroad, typically somewhere much cheaper than where they lived previously.\n\nI'm not ignorant of the fact that Poblado, where I live now, is a bubble like most affluent neighborhoods. There's an incomprehensible amount of poverty in Colombia — but not unlike America. So why not decide to reside where I'm better off? I still use Apple Pay, order Ubers, and find all the avocado toasts and green juices a New Yorker needs, except I won't be stressed about payment. Buenos Aires is next on my list.\n\nA career that once limited my income now enables me to find happiness — and purpose — worldwide.\n\nThere's a privileged irony in an immigrant returning to their native country and being received as a gringo by locals.

For a few seconds, Banquez’s voice, bold and unrestrained, fills the expanse of the auditorium until pulsating African drums and shakers jumpstart the beat, jolting the audience members out of their chairs and into the aisles to dance.\n\nAfter a lifetime dedicated to the Afro-Colombian music of bullerengue, the stage is where the prolific singer-songwriter appears most at home, whether at a prestigious concert hall, miles away from home in the U.S. American capital, or in the small-town sweaty venues of the Colombian Caribbean Coast.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nDubbed once as the Queen of Bullerengue, Banquez is one of the genre’s top ambassadors. After existing in near-obscurity in Afro-Colombian towns and villages along the Coast, bullerengue today has transcended cultural and national borders, been adapted by young indie superstars, such as Lido Pimienta and Combo Chimbita, and become embedded in Colombia’s national identity. Women like Banquez have been crucial in bridging audiences in cities across Colombia, as well as Europe and the United States, to the centuries-old Black tradition.\n\nWith the support of Juan David Banquez, her musician nephew and bandmate, Banquez, the singer, meets me online, on a pixelated video call, from her daughter’s home in the town of Turbaco. As the day nears noon, the sweltering sun of the tropics peeks out from behind the clouds. Banquez, dressed in a pale pink turban and a white immaculate dress, with a few delicate gold chains dangling from her neck, is seated under the shade of a cool porch.\n\nThroughout the video call, the humble, yet stoic matriarch often lets her verses speak for her, interspersing her words with bursts of song. Even with her success, she explains she’s led a simple life close to her family, residing now in Guamanga, the same farming community along the coast where she was raised.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\n“I like to plant my rice, my plantain, my yucca,” stated Banquez.\n\nThere, she lives on a farm without running water, relying on the rains and a river to drink and wash. Electricity is drawn from a government-installed solar panel. Other basic services, such as the internet, considered luxuries in these remote swathes of the countryside, are absent. However forgotten these lands may be, they remain the subject of praise in various of Banquez’s songs. The Caribbean Coast is, after all, the birthplace of bullerengue, a genre born of enslaved people brought over from Africa who sang through their suffering in melodies and rhythms, passed down through generations. Cantadoras, the female singers like Banquez that front the bullerengue groups, have kept the tradition alive for centuries.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of these cantadoras has slimmed, making Banquez one of the last remaining great singers and composers of the genre. While many her age have quietly retired, Banquez is instead busy reaching new heights in her career, recording new material and touring new cities.\n\n“We’re going to keep recording in the studio as long as Banquez has the spirit, the voice, the desire, and the strength,” said Javier Mutis, co-founder of Om Producciones and Banquez’s manager. “We want to preserve this memory, this legacy.”\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nBanquez’s story is rare in Colombia, where few poor, Black women are recognized for their musical talents. Singing bullerengue, a genre started by Black Colombians, only created additional barriers. It wasn’t until 2010, when Banquez was 68, that the opportunity first arose for the cantadora to record.\n\nBefore this, violence uprooted her family from their home in 2001 and forced them to find refuge in the nearby town of Maria La Baja, where they struggled for 18 years. Throughout her marriage, her husband prohibited her from taking the stage because he believed it would distract her from her children. After her husband died and her children came of age, Banquez was a free woman to sing as she liked.\n\nNow, at the ripe age of 80, Banquez is back home in Guamanga, where in 2007 she returned after the worst violence subsided. While much of her earlier work focuses on the pain of the armed conflict, her latest album, Que Le Baile Yo, released earlier this year, is a testament to the humor and joy with which Banquez has chosen to lead such a tumultuous life.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nBanquez was born in the farming town of Guamanga, today a two-hour drive from the seaside tourist city of Cartagena, on February 3, 1942.\n\nLong days working the fields were punctuated with afternoons enjoying the crooning sounds of vallenato, accordion-led folk music, as well as rancheras. These were the sounds that filled Banquez’s early life. A talented vocalist since youth, Banquez could have grown up to be a vallenato or ranchera singer. She liked both genres, which were both more commercial, but it was bullerengue, the music of her ancestors, that won her heart. “Later on, I realized that bullerengue was my thing,” explains Banquez. “Bullerengue comes from the Black African race and I’m Black and African.”\n\nAt the time, processions of cantadoras would travel from town to town, singing, dancing, and recruiting women to join them along the way. In Guamanga, it was Banquez’s maternal aunts, who were the pueblo’s musical celebrities. When she was a girl, her aunts encouraged her to compose a song out of a fall that had left her nose oozing with blood. At the age of nine, she had her first song.\n\n“Bullerengue comes from things that happen to you. It’s not about romantic lyrics. It’s based on the pain you may feel because bullerengue comes from the Africans that were brought over to Colombia,” said Banquez.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nSince then, Banquez has never stopped composing, even if her songs stayed in the confines of her head. Not knowing how to read or write, Banquez could never write her verses. Instead, she repeated songs until they locked in her memory.\n\nHer first compositions related to the growing pains of a girl: a nose injury after a fall or a heartbreak following the end of a relationship. In adulthood, after her family was displaced, she dedicated her compositions to the trials she experienced, living in exile from her home. Music had a balming effect on Banquez, allowing her a creative outlet for emotions few people understood.\n\n“I suffered a lot because of the violence. It hurt a lot to leave my land,” she said.\n\nIn perhaps Banquez’s most well-known song, “Adios mamá,” she recalls the moment she was forced to flee: “I left the mountain/Of Montes de María/At six in the morning/I heard gunshots/Since I was scared/I paced from livingroom to kitchen/And now I’m with my godmother/I cried without solace.”\n\nThe song is a call for peace. At the time of the song’s composition, Colombia was the closest it had ever been at ending decades of conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government. The country would soon vote on a peace deal. In the song, she explained her support of the treaty: “We have to forgive in order to obtain peace.”\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nIn the next coming weeks, Banquez is expected to return to the studio. She’s recorded 20 original songs so far, but many more are still stowed away in her memory, which Mutis, her manager, likes to call a “box of surprises.”\n\nRecently, she unburied six songs she will soon record: one about a dog she lost years ago and another about the island of San Andrés and its native people. The subjects may seem to stray from Banquez’s usual subject matter, but throughout her life, the cantadora has proven she’s not easily predictable and that if an idea comes to mind, she can, and will, transform it into song.",

    "Never forget my roots: Alfredo Rodriguez, civil engineer": "At the age of 24, Alfredo Rodriguez moved from Bogotá, Colombia, to the U.S. to start a whirlwind adventure that would take him around the country and lead him full circle to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, as a civil engineer working in water management.\n\nRodriguez moved to Overland Park, Kansas, from Colombia in 1985 to live with his parents. He arrived with three things – knowledge of roughly four English words, a civil engineering degree from the Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito and the desire to make a life for himself in the U.S.\n\nRodriguez lived in Kansas for around five months before moving to Texas. During those five months, he had to learn English. His first step was to attend language classes at a local college.\n\n“Then, I took a job at a grocery store packing bags. My only purpose for doing that, even though I already had a civil engineering degree, was to learn English,” Rodriguez said. “When they teach it in school, you learn the proper English, and then you go to the street, and talk to people and all that goes out the window and then you [actually] learn.”\n\nWhen he got to Texas, he discovered his love for water after his brother, who has a master’s degree and Ph.D. in water resources, introduced him to reservoirs. He liked it so much that he got his master’s in water resources from the University of Texas and started his professional journey.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2015, he held engineering positions in Texas and Colorado, working for state, city and private consultants. He also learned about USACE.\n\n“I didn’t know the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers existed, until I started working for the water development board in Texas,” Rodriguez said.\n\nHe partnered with USACE during his time with the board and learned how they operated and maintained reservoirs in the region. This piqued his interest.\n\n“There are things you love to do and things you like to do. I like to do [engineer] modeling, but I love to do flood operations, flood risk management and reservoir management,” he said.\n\nSo, he looked for a job where he could do those things and got his first job in USACE with the Walla Walla District in March 2015.\n\nRodriguez stayed with the Walla Walla District for six years before he traveled back to Kansas to work for the Kansas City District in March 2021.\n\nIn his seven years with USACE, he’s met people and had experiences that stuck with him.\n\n“USACE is one of the best organizations. It gives you opportunities to move within the organization itself and it gives you the chance to volunteer when disasters happen, which is unfortunate but also so rewarding because you get to know other people and places. You get to learn [just] how different cultures are,” Rodriguez said.\n\nAccording to Rodriguez, he doesn’t think he would have the same experiences if he stayed in Colombia.\n\n“What is neat about the U.S. is it’s given me the opportunity to move to Texas, Colorado, [Washington State], and then back to Kansas, all for jobs,” Rodriguez said. “That opportunity does not exist in Colombia. It is very rare… because of the economy, the politics and security of the country. Here [in the U.S.], opportunities are abundant, and I love this country.”\n\nThough he loves his life in the U.S., he never forgets where he is from and celebrates his heritage by sharing it with others.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to take the best of both of my worlds and make it the best for me – I will never forget my roots,\" he said.",

    "Peace and Pesos: How Colombia’s Peace Treaty is Impacted by its Developing Economy": "In 2016, then-president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for successfully signing and implementing a peace treaty that would bring an end to over 50 years of organized violence from a guerrilla terrorist group, the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia—People’s Army (FARC-EP). The agreement brought a light of hope to the families that have been in a three-way crossfire between the FARC, the Colombian military, and paramilitary groups.\n\nHowever, the peace was short-lived. Slow implementation of the treaty has left power vacuums in rural areas of the country. These gaps have slowly been filled by over 30 new rebel groups that have emerged since 2016. Although some groups are formed by former FARC members who decided to not civilize, there are also new members who believe the rebels offer better pay and benefits than if they were to work in the urban and rural areas of the developing country. These organizations are known as Residual Organized Armed Groups (GAOR).\n\nOrigins and Violence\n\nFARC was created in 1964 out of Colombia’s Communist Party to represent the rights of the rural population following the Colombian Civil War. By the 1970s, the group funded its operations from ransoms of kidnapped elites, illegal mining, and the production of cocaine. Although the business provided them with a great amount of wealth, it made them a public enemy of the United States as well as drug-traffickers in the eyes of the national population. At its height in 2002, FARC was estimated to have close to 20,000 active members. By 2014, they generated between US$150 million and US$600 million per year in gross revenue.\n\nThe peace treaty in 2016 was not the first attempt in which the government tried to reach an accord with FARC. In 1984, they agreed to a ceasefire for the first time under the Uribe Accord. In it, FARC and the Colombian Communist Party cofounded the Patriotic Union (UP). Although the party achieved initial success, the group weaponized itself again when 200 to 500 UP leaders were assassinated between 1984 and 1988. During this time, several paramilitary groups formed as an attempt by the elite to defend itself against FARC kidnappings, which occurred in spite of the accord. The main paramilitary group, United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), worked closely with the military to exterminate the rebel group once the deal failed. Although partially funded by wealthy landowners, the group found great wealth through the coca business. At the end of the 1980s, the second largest rebel group in the nation, M19, decided to disarm and form its own political party. This group had previously invaded the Palace of Justice, killing eleven of the country’s twenty-five justices.\n\nBy the end of the century, Colombia’s campesinos (poor farmers) experienced violence by FARC, AUC, and the Colombian military. FARC would claim that some farmers were AUC supporters, while AUC would claim that they were FARC supporters. The military used an incentive system of FARC death counts for holidays and bonuses—in practice, this meant that any corpse would be claimed as a rebel. The homicide rate during this time was close to 60 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2021, it was 26.8 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nAfter social protests against national violence, FARC agreed to enter again in peace talks with the government. These talks did not last due to a change in presidential administration in 2002. By 2006, AUC was officially disbanded through a peace deal instigated by the US, who saw them as an international terrorist organization. In 2012, the government reached out once again to talk with FARC about peace negotiations. Existing rebel groups like Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) and Ejército Popular de Liberación (EPL) still exist and continue to combat each other.\n\nFARC-Colombia Peace Accord\n\nNot everyone in Colombia wanted the current peace treaty to be signed. The first referendum failed with 50.2 percent of votes against. The main opposition came from the Democratic Center party, which argued that the treaty gave too many benefits to those who caused over 260,000 deaths since 1964 through their historic violence. These benefits included a special court and law for former rebels, temporary monthly stipends, and 10 seats in the national congress until 2022 for their new political party. The peace court (Special Jurisdiction for Peace) would mean that offenses of rebels will not be tried as criminal, giving way for the possibility of former FARC members avoiding formal prison time. The stipend was seen as an incentive by the government for killers. After some slight alterations, the current deal was signed with no referendums. The amended treaty limits the Colombian peace court to 10 years of operations and President Santos ensures that the former rebels will be appropriately punished. The temporary stipend was seen as unemployment support as rebels were trained to reintegrate into society.\n\nThe guerilla group was officially disbanded with the signature of the peace accord. Around 7,000 rebels turned in their weapons to the UN and are now represented in national politics as Comunes (common people party).\n\nHowever, the implementation of the treaty has been slow since the new administration gained power. The current president Ivan Duque is leader of the Democratic Center party. Although he blames the pandemic or an economic crisis for the sluggish implementation of the treaty, it seems highly unlikely that there is a political will to keep expanding the promises. Reports claim that Duque has put in action an additional 8 percent of the accord implementation, leaving it at 30 percent of its full potential. Corruption also does not help, with an estimated US$119 million lost to government officials since the treaty was signed.\n\nPesos over Peace: the Conundrum for Campesinos\n\nThe agreement—officially called Final Agreement to End the Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace—focused on different aspects of the complex social problem, such as rural reforms, political participation, group deweaponization, drug trafficking solutions, and means of justice and reparations. By 2018, there had been little improvement in the reintegration of the former FARC members through educational and mental health treatments. This was worrisome given that the unemployment benefits that the members got were about to expire in 2019. Although some wanted to become farmers, the government did not provide a program to ease transition and access to the industry. As a result, close to 1,500 ex-members have become dissidents.\n\nThe promised rural development goals have also stagnated. Duque’s neoliberal approach to growth has focused on empowering large agro-industrial farms to employ the farmers. The results, however, have been disappointing—there has been a historic trend of only minimal job creations from these large companies. Duque has also disbanded different agencies set up to promote rural development, merging them all with the Department of Agriculture. This is problematic since the department has a history of supporting larger industrial farms over the needs of the campesinos. Underdevelopment of rural regions has led to problems such as illicit crop cultivation and violence from militants.\n\nThe outcome of this political disarray is the formation and invasions of GAORs in the country. The lack of access to opportunities along with the little political will allowed the country to lose control of dissident groups. These new groups have different ideals yet they all have one common goal: pesos. Unlike the FARC, there is no claim of a greater social agenda to support rural communities—only supply and demand.\n\nFor the rural towns neglected by the government, these groups represent sources of support. A town on the mountainous border with Venezuela exemplifies the conflict. Coca leaves are the main crop of Catatumbo, a town with little transportation infrastructure and remote location that makes it difficult to trade and grow regular crops. The residents claim they have tried to grow other agricultural goods such as coffee or cocoa, yet coca leaves are the only crop with enough demand for people to go to the village and collect them. They do not want to grow these leaves but it is the only profitable option. The result is constant conflict between different rebel groups that try to take control of the town, as well as the military, which adds to local fears. In the local school, there are posters and banners explaining to children what to do in case they stumble upon a landmine or an unactivated grenade. For these people, their only hope is for the government to provide better infrastructure and opportunities for growth.\n\nYet the government does not support them. The townspeople have had to take it upon themselves to toll those entering town so that they can perform maintenance over what little road they have. Additionally, Duque attempted to reinstate aerial fumigation practices to damage illicit crops. These not only damage legal commodities but could also have adverse health implications for the campesinos. Most importantly, it damages the only meaningful source of income that they have: coca. The country’s Constitutional Court prohibited the administration from advancing these plans until more consultations are done with experts and affected communities.\n\nFor these forgotten towns in rural Colombia, the offer to grow coca leaves and sell it to the guerilla group in their area for profit is sometimes their only option. If the farmers refuse to grow the crop, they are killed. If farmers are accused by any of the rebel groups of supporting other groups, they are killed. If the military suspects the townspeople of actively aiding a group, chances are that they will be killed or detained. This creates a devastating reality in which rebel groups become the center of economic stability for rural towns; if the government removes them from these localities without alternative development measures, it is the economy and livelihoods of the residents that suffer.\n\nHowever, this stability is only temporary. These groups come into constant conflict due to invasions of each other’s territory. This is the case in Colombia’s southern region of Putamayo, in which GAOR Comandos de la Frontera have been in conflict with another GAOR, Carolina Ramirez. In these cases, the towns become battlefields where many civilian lives are lost. Around 10 percent of the country is in territory claimed by one of the rebel groups.\n\nDilemmas of a Fragile Economy\n\nAnother aspect of the larger social issues is the weak national economy. With total employment at 22 million and a labor force of 24 million, there is an oversupply of labor for available opportunities. The effects are lower wages and high unemployment, the latter of which stood close to 10 percent in 2019.\n\nColombia experienced a recent drop in its gross domestic product, with its growth in 2020 being -6.8 percent. The causes can be associated with the disruptions that COVID-19 pandemic created in the global trade and supply chain. These shocks make it difficult for the government to focus on the former rebels in addition to the general population. As a result, Colombia’s economy is not able to sufficiently reward its workers. The combination of the two factors have led to a lack of opportunities for farmers and urban citizens, which makes joining one of the GOARs an attractive opportunity. These groups pay well and even offer vacation time to its militants.\n\n“One [of the members of the new rebel groups] was a single mother who couldn’t raise her children on the $90 a month she made as a housekeeper; another was a former FARC fighter who had discovered he could make twice as much as the unit’s doctor than he could at a public hospital.” - New York Times\n\nColombia has had some overall growth in its economy, with poverty rates falling by 15 percentage points between 2008 and 2017 (27 percent in 2017). It has also had a decent GDP growth of 3.8 percent before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Colombia’s high inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 54.2 in 2020, has diverted that growth from the lower classes. In return, many have looked for alternatives in the informal sector, which employs 62.1 percent of the labor market. However, others have looked for more lucrative—and hostile—ways of creating an income.\n\nFuture Outlooks\n\nThe peace treaty brought hope to many of the people who have greatly suffered from the conflicts of cocaine in the country. Although it came with excitement, there are some factors that have not allowed it to succeed at its full potential. The lack of political will by government officials to fulfill the terms of the agreement can be explained by the disapproval within the current party’s leadership, as well as internal corruption which has impeded intended allocations to integration efforts. However, the increase in productivity of rural areas, which is a bipartisan policy,has also not been implemented effectively. This raises questions as to why the government has not taken the initiative to empower its campesinos. The developing economy of the country also hinders the prospect of peace due to the large returns that narcotraffic has and the scarcity of job opportunities available for the population in urban and rural areas. The delay in the implementation of the accord has led to a rise in the number of rebel groups that compete for rural land and labor to buy coca leaves. Although many farmers disagree with the practices, it is the only effective means that they have to sustain themselves.\n\nGreater urban development and programs that increase productivity and ease transportation of goods in the rural areas will directly support farmers. Campesinos must be given viable options through which they can develop and outgrow the shadow of narcotrafficking. The government has spent too many resources treating the effects of its social troubles rather than focusing on its root causes: underdevelopment. This idea expands further than mere GDP growth. Addressing inequality without greatly disrupting domestic investments would greatly help strengthen the domestic market, which could raise wages and salaries. Having a military that is more regulated will allow citizens to trust them once again, creating greater collaboration to remove rebel groups from towns. Having a government that is more transparent through harsher consequences for corruption will also lead to greater trust from the public. Attracting more foreign direct investment as well as implementing effective policies to grow human capital will create better jobs for the population. As more effective pathways for financial stability are present for everyone, it will make it much harder for rebel groups to recruit soldiers and fund its operations. Effectively, Colombia’s path for peace is through pesos.",

However, the five authors go beyond categorisation and seek to ensure that journalism transcends digital barriers to reach every reader.\n\nIn this way, those who access the material may have another point of view on some assertions such as the inherent violence in human beings as a form of defence or survival; although this type of violence only deepens social rifts, generating greater violence and victimisation in society.\n\nFinally, Pía Figueroa reported that, in addition to the different editions of the book, “the first virtual course on nonviolent journalism in English is underway with students from several countries.” Thus, Pressenza hopes to be able to replicate this experience in other languages.\n\nFigueroa announced that this year the English version of the book will be released and there are plans to translate the text into German, Portuguese, Greek, Italian and, soon, French, and possibly also in Mandarin.",

    "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity": "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity\n\nEvening view over Bogota, Colombia (source: flickr/ Tijs Zwinkels, creative commons)\n\nAlexander Richter 4 Sep 2022\n\nGeothermal energy could play a huge role in the provision of energy to the megacities of this world, e.g. covering all electricity (and more) to Bogota, capital of Colombia.\n\nThe city of Bogotá, the Capital of Colombia in South America, is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, representing a great opportunity to tap geothermal energy. It represents the opportunity to decarbonize the energy matrix of megacities, that is, those inhabited by more than 10 million people, so a recent article shared by the the University of the National University of Colombia (UNAL). The article builds on a study carried out in three megacities: Los Angeles (U.S.), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Bogotá (Colombia), which showed that between Zipaquirá (Cundinamarca) and Paipa (Boyacá) [in Bototá] there is an area with high potential to extract energy from the earth, which would potentially cover the total residential energy demand for Colombia’s capital.\n\nDecarbonization is the focus of the research in which Professor Carlos Vargas, from the Faculty of Sciences of UNAL, participated. The research focused on data that the National Hydrocarbons Agency and the Colombian Geological Service have compiled and used for many years to have a measurement of the magnetic, thermal and geochemical information of the Colombian territory.\n\nThis data made it possible to map the zones, estimating the “Curie depth”, a measure inferred from the magnetic anomalies present in the subsoil, which means that the higher the temperature when the earth falls, the more the magnetic force of the earth decreases. the minerals present there, and when this occurs it can be said that in these areas there is a greater possibility of extracting energy from the earth.\n\n“It was found that the region near the north of Bogotá, between Zipaquirá and Paipa, is an important area that contains this heat resource, which is evidenced by the presence of thermal waters and pools, in addition to other geochemical parameters evaluated there by the oil industry”, so the expert.\n\nIn Bogotá today 14,509,200 GWh (14,509 TWh) are consumed and the supply can grow more and more. The investigation determined that up to 16,603 TWh could be provided by the exploitation and extraction of geothermal energy.\n\nTogether with professors Luca Caracciolo, from the GeoZentrum Nordbayern (Geocentre of North Bavaria) of the Friedrich-Alexander University (Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany), and Philip J. Ball, from the Faculty of Geography, Geology and Environment of the Keele University (United Kingdom), estimated that 73,502,200 GWh per year are used in Los Angeles, and it is calculated that geothermal could supply up to 4.25 times more energy to the city; For its part, Jakarta consumes 10,927,163 GWh, and geothermal could provide capacity by 1.84 times more. The report was published in December 2020.\n\nGeothermal energy as a sustainable alternative\n\nAccording to the geologist, “this amount of energy can guarantee sufficient resources for long-term geothermal plants that take advantage of their location to supply electricity and hot water for industrial and recreational processes.”\n\n“Geothermal energy has greater stability –having sufficient resources– than other energies such as hydroelectric or hydraulic –because in times of drought there are problems of storage and reserve of this resource–, solar energy –since its recharge depends on the moment of the day in which the sun’s rays provide it– and wind power, whose operation is subject to specific currents at certain times of the year”, highlights the teacher.\n\nAlthough at the beginning the costs are higher –machinery, studies, experts, transportation, precaution to treat the subsoil–, in the long term these are reduced, which is evident in Los Angeles and Jakarta: while in LA geothermal energy costs 0.004 cents dollar ($18) and fossil 0.138 ($606), in Jakarta the ratio is 0.006 ($26) geothermal and 0.112 ($492) fossil.\n\nThe academic explains that “geothermal energy has various industrial uses, including producing the electricity that supplies cities; improve plant cultivation processes in greenhouses, as well as heating for homes during the winter, especially in some regions of the planet (high latitudes and altitudes)”.\n\nFor the researcher, the implementation of these energy strategies allows expanding the range of possibilities, since the processes and changes of radiation or heat generation inside the Earth change in millions of years, and not in seasons of days, months or years. .\n\nIt is important to emphasize that geothermal extraction can also have disadvantages, the most important of which is the possible contamination of nearby waters by substances such as arsenic or ammonia -extremely toxic to living beings-, components found in the soil and that can be released when doing the extraction, if the procedures are not carried out properly.\n\nSource: UNAL",

    "Colombia and Venezuela to reopen shared border to cargo transport": "Easing of restrictions comes as neighbouring countries seek to normalise relations after years of tension.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Venezuela have announced that commercial flights will resume between the two nations and cargo transport will be allowed across their shared border on September 26 after a years-long closure.\n\nThe announcement on Friday marks the latest example of increased cooperation between the neighbouring countries since left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro took office in August on a promise to re-establish formal relations with Venezuela.\n\nThe 2,200km (1,370-mile) shared border between Colombia and Venezuela is currently open to pedestrian traffic, but only limited cargo transport.\n\n“We confirm the government’s commitment to restore brotherly relations,” Petro said on Twitter on Friday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro also tweeted that “the exchange and cooperation between our peoples are starting off on the right foot”.\n\n“In addition, we will resume flights between Caracas-Bogota and Valencia-Bogota,” Maduro added.\n\nLast month, the two countries restored full diplomatic relations after a three-year break. Both countries have now accepted each other’s ambassadors, but the two heads of state have yet to announce a state visit.\n\nUnder Petro’s right-wing predecessor Ivan Duque, Colombia refused to recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s leader after his 2018 re-election, which Duque said was fraudulent.\n\nColombia’s ambassador arrived in Venezuela last month and was welcomed by Venezuela’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Rander Pena Ramirez, who tweeted that “our historical ties summon us to work together for the happiness of our peoples”.\n\nCaracas broke off ties with Bogota in 2019 after members of the Venezuelan opposition tried to cross from Colombian territory with trucks loaded with food and medicine.\n\nIt also closed the border, saying the aid masked an attempted coup by the opposition with support from the United States. Embassies and consulates in both countries were shut down, and flights between the neighbours were grounded.\n\nMaduro had ordered the closure of legal crossing points in 2015 after an incident during an anti-smuggling operation along the border. Foot traffic eventually resumed, and some cargo continued to move through a bridge in the north.\n\nThe closures have not ended the transportation of various goods, some of them over dirt roads by armed groups, into Venezuela. Criminal groups have also used the roads for trafficking operations.\n\nColombia has previously accused Venezuela of offering assistance and shelter to armed groups in the border region, a claim bolstered by a report by Human Rights Watch in March.\n\nThe Chamber of Venezuelan-Colombian Economic Integration has estimated that reopening crossings to vehicular traffic could result in a substantial increase in commerce, from $406m last year to an estimated $1.2bn this year.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has said the economic activity within a year of a fully reopened border could be more than $4bn.",

    "Colombia’s largest airport is closing its Catholic chapel. Is that a sign of things to come?": "El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, is one of the largest air travel hubs in Latin America. And in a country where almost 80% of the population identifies as Catholic, it might seem only natural that the airport has a Catholic chapel.\n\nBut a political fight over Bogotá’s airport chapel points to emerging questions about the future of the Catholic Church in a secularizing Colombia — a country where Catholicism was the nation’s official religion until 1991.\n\n'A neutral space of reflection'\n\nThe El Dorado Airport's Catholic chapel has for decades offered daily Mass, weekly expositions of the Eucharist, confessions, and daily rosaries to the millions of commuters passing through the airport each year.\n\nUntil recently, the chapel was open 24 hours a day for travelers and airport staff wanting to spend a few minutes in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nBut on Aug. 26, while a handful of people prayed inside the chapel on a Friday afternoon, airport personnel entered to remove the chapel's Catholic imagery from the walls.\n\n1. La capilla católica del Areorpuerto Internacional de Bogotá [@BOG_ELDORADO] fue desmontada el pasado 26 de agosto con truculencia, cuando había fieles rezando en su interior. Es una agresión objetiva a la fe católica, en general, y a los cristianos, en particular. pic.twitter.com/ylj7qcSgZw — Political Network for Values (@PNfValues) August 30, 2022\n\nAfter the confusion, the airport’s management company, OPAIN, announced on social media that the chapel would be closed on Aug. 27, converted from a Catholic sacred space into a “neutral space of reflection.”\n\n“Thinking about all of our passengers and their different beliefs, we are adapting the oratory to turn it into a space of neutral reflection, as it works in most airports in the world,” the company said in a statement published on Twitter. The statement also mentioned that the daily 11 a.m. Mass would continue.\n\n“In the next few days, [the chapel] will be renovated into a space where all religions are welcome,” the statement added.\n\n“This is a process that has been ongoing for months, with the knowledge of the Archdiocese of Bogotá,” the management company claimed.\n\nEl Dorado International Airport. Credit: Felipe Restrepo Acosta/wikimedia. CC BY SA 3.0\n\n'Accountable to God'\n\nDespite OPAIN’s statement, El Dorado International Airport is not actually located in the territory of the Archdiocese of Bogotá.\n\nIt’s in the neighboring Diocese of Fontibón, led by Bishop Juan Vicente Córdoba.\n\nWithin days of the chapel’s closure, Fontibón’s Bishop Córdoba said the airport’s management company had spoken with his diocese in April about its plans, but the diocese pushed back, noting that it had a contract to operate the chapel until 2037. The diocese declined to end the agreement early, the bishop said.\n\nThe bishop also claimed that it was a Bogotá city administrator who wanted the Catholic chapel closed — he said the local government had asked OPAIN to close it, and the management company complied.\n\n“There was no dialogue. OPAIN is an independent company, but the government asked that we be kicked out of the airport. We denounce this because it does not allow us to evangelize and take care of the people who wish to get close to God’s peace,” Córdoba argued.\n\nThe new “reflection space” does have an hour each day allotted to Catholic worship.\n\n“From 11 to 12 we will celebrate the Mass, but we are not able to continue our 24-hour presence,” Córdoba added in an interview, nor to reserve the Eucharist.\n\nBut the bishop's statement was not the end of the story.\n\n“OPAIN could have let us stay,” the bishop insisted.\n\n“Those who said no will be accountable to God.”\n\n'Why we marched'\n\nFelipe Jiménez is Bogota’s “secretario de gobierno” - a position that functions like a city manager. The politician said in late August it was OPAIN’s decision to close the Catholic chapel, which he claimed the company did after requests from airport visitors – with no mention of government intervention.\n\nBut the mayor of Bogotá, Claudia López, suggested otherwise.\n\nThe mayor threw her support behind the closure, saying Aug. 27 she celebrated the decision “in the name of freedom of worship.”\n\nLópez is a controversial figure in Colombian politics. She ran for office as a progressive, but has been under fire for allegedly xenophobic comments against Venezuelans, and for controversial policies — one, which would create a police force to “identify” migrants in the city, was ultimately scrapped due to lack of support by the national government.\n\nLocal media reported that while the mayor’s office didn’t formally request the airport chapel be closed, López did recommend the idea to OPAIN.\n\nFor its part, the Fontibón diocese told The Pillar this week it will fight against the closure.\n\nThe diocese has already written to the city, a diocesan attorney told The Pillar, where officials claim they have no authority over the airport.\n\nBut the diocese has more moves to make, explained Andrés Forero, attorney for the Diocese of Fontibón.\n\n“We believe that we can place a complaint to the Superintendent of Transportation and Ports, on behalf of the users of the airport, due to the deterioration of the services available,” Forero said.\n\n“They claim to offer a service they do not offer anymore. According to the consumers’ law, they cannot willingly diminish the services they offer,” the lawyer added.\n\n“However, the bishop will have a meeting with the company this week. We are looking for a direct settlement before insisting on legal actions.”\n\nIn early September, a group of Catholic lay people gathered to pray the rosary at the airport, in protest of the closure. Their protest ended when organizers placed an image of Our Lady of Fatima in the chapel, which was removed the next day.\n\n#Colombia | Así fue como hoy en el aeropuerto El Dorado de Bogotá, las personas que piden la devolución del oratorio rezaron un rosario, mientras en las afueras se realizaba una movilización 🎥 @WRadioColombia #4Sep pic.twitter.com/ZL8ShUsSjK — Frontera 7 Días (@Frontera7dias) September 4, 2022\n\n“We were moved by the fact that OPAIN arbitrarily decided to vacate a contract with the Diocese of Fontibón to dismantle the Catholic chapel, and to sell us on the idea of a 'neutral' or 'multi-religious' spaces,” Samuel Ángel, a protest organizer, told The Pillar.\n\n“We believe that the Catholic chapel should be respected and that if they wanted to create a different space for other religions, they should have done it somewhere else. That is why we marched. At least 2,000 people went from the old Isabel La Católica monument to the airport.”\n\nOur Lady, Help of Christians\n\nAmid the protests and petitions, the airport chapel has become an icon in a larger political conflict.\n\nColombia elected this year its first left-wing president. Gustavo Petro, once a member of a Marxist guerrilla group, ended decades of politically conservative rule in the country.\n\nMoreover, Colombia has not been an exception to the rapid secularization which all of South America has undergone. The country is one of several in Latin America to have legalized gay marriage, abortion, and euthanasia—mostly through court rulings.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, some Colombian Catholics and conservative activists believe the closure of the airport chapel is part of an unfolding prospect of discrimination against the Church.\n\nAnd the potential closure of another iconic chapel in the country has lent credence to their theory.\n\nThree Colombian lawmakers — Congressmen Juan Carlos Losada, Luis Alberto Albán, and Alirio Uribe — have a proposal to close the country’s Congressional chapel, dubbed Our Lady, Help of Christians, and replace it with a neutral reflection space.\n\nEsta mañana compartimos la Consagración a Jesús por María en la Capilla del Congreso. La misma que desde ayer proponen acabar#LaCapillaSeQueda pic.twitter.com/31PDyNO3YK — Luis Miguel López Aristizábal (@LuismLopezA) September 14, 2022\n\nAll three lawmakers are part of the majority government coalition. Albán is a member of the Comunes party, the political successor to the country’s FARC guerrilla group.\n\nLosada, the idea’s main proponent, has claimed that a Catholic chapel in the country's legislative chambers violates the constitutional principles of state secularity and freedom of worship.\n\n“Those who want to pray can use the neutral space or can go to the cathedral a couple of blocks away, or to the Saint Augustine Church a block away from Congress,” the legislator said recently.\n\nIn addition to its Catholic chapel, Colombia’s congressional building houses an interdenominational Christian chapel — but there have been no proposals made to eliminate it.\n\nThe closure proposal has been controversial, even among members of the government coalition. Luis Miguel López, a member of the Conservative Party –part of the majority coalition—criticized the decision.\n\n“Congress is a place of serious work. The chapel is a place to pray and let our work and worries go. Workers and congress members use it. We cannot calculate the benefits for the soul and mental health of such a space. Only those who do not know the miracles that happen there can ask to close the chapel,” he said last week.\n\nSenator María Fernanda Cabal, a likely presidential candidate in the next elections, is a member of the Democratic Center party –the main opposition party in Colombia.\n\nCabal has also criticized the proposal, saying with a hint of irony that “the next move would be to dismantle the cathedral and the churches in downtown Bogotá, to include the ‘excluded.’ Persecution disguised as good intentions.”\n\n“The new attack against the Church in Colombia comes disguised as inclusion but it is another strategy of persecution and annulment. I invite Catholics to join in prayer and raise their voices against discrimination until the oratory is back to [the airport of] El Dorado,” she said recently.\n\nAnalysts in Colombia say it is unlikely the congressional chapel itself will be closed.\n\nAnd nearly a month after it was closed, there is some chance the airport’s Catholic chapel could soon be reopened.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSince their initial statements, Neither OPAIN nor the Diocese of Fontibón have published any official updates regarding the chapel.\n\nBut Samuel Ángel uploaded a video on YouTube Sept. 9, in which he claimed that the chapel will be “reinstated.”\n\n“It still lacks the images, but this will be our Catholic chapel,” he says in the video.\n\nFor his part, Forero, the diocesan attorney, provided The Pillar with a picture showing that an “interfaith hall” is being prepared a few meters away from the chapel. The hall can also be seen in Ángel’s video.\n\nIt is possible that airport authorities have decided to leave the chapel in its place, while designating a separate space for the “neutral” chapel — a proposal offered last month by Church officials and Catholic activists.\n\n“OPAIN got in touch with me and I told them that we demanded they leave the chapel in its place and create a multi-religious space somewhere else in the airport. What you see in the video is that they are doing work along that line. They have not put the Catholic imagery back in the chapel but they did start a multi-religious space in a different place,” Ángel told The Pillar.\n\n“Nothing has been reinstated yet, all we know is that they are creating a multireligious hall in a different area,” Forero explained.\n\nThe airport and Congressional chapels might stay in their place, but Catholics in Colombia remain concerned with what they believe is the start of institutional anti-Catholic persecution in their traditionally Catholic country.\n\nPetro’s coalition enjoys a significant majority in Congress, which may allow him to, for example, tax churches, an idea that has been proposed by members of the government.\n\nJosé Antonio Ocampo, Colombia's finance minister, said in August he would not discount such an idea. The proposal would also include more financial oversight of churches by the government.\n\nSome Catholics in the country say they’re also concerned because Petro has shown reticence to condemn attacks against the Catholic Church.\n\nObservers note that the Colombian representative to the Organization of American States was not present at an early August session, which passed a resolution to condemn the persecution of the Church in Nicaragua.\n\nTo date, the Colombian government is one of the handful of countries in Latin America which has not criticized the ongoing persecution.\n\nThe Church in Colombia faces most of the same challenges as the Church in Latin America: fewer people in the pews, fewer vocations, a growing protestant minority, and an increasing number of people disagreeing with the Church’s moral teachings.\n\nBut if some Catholics are to be believed, the Church in Colombia may soon face a challenge strange to most Latin American democracies: direct anti-Catholic attacks from government officials. If you’re skeptical, they suggest you try to find the rosary group at Bogotá’s airport.\n\n\n\n",
    "Laying the Groundwork for Inclusive Growth Through Digital Trade with Colombia": "Building on 200 years of strategic partnership\n\nThis year, Colombia and the United States are celebrating both the 10-year anniversary of the signing of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) and a 200-year-long strategic relationship that has been sustained by strong bipartisan support and successful initiatives, such as Plan Colombia.

Among its priorities, the USCBC has worked tirelessly to promote the growth of the digital economy as a way to facilitate trade and investment and promote the creation of jobs.\n\nFor instance, the USCBC advocates for a digital trade framework that will allow the U.S. and Colombian governments to negotiate binding commitments that create durable digital trade rules, as well as encourage economic security and competitiveness, enhance growth and transparency, and further strengthen the close bond shared between the countries. Digital trade rules benefit businesses of all sizes and workers by fostering a free and open internet, creating access to new markets, and addressing discriminatory and protectionist digital trade restrictions. As per the U.S. Chamber’s recent publication , a digital trade framework between our two countries may also provide the impetus for a broader digital agreement of the Americas that would unite the region endorsing common standards, norms, and approaches, including the principles of openness, inclusiveness, fairness, and transparency.\n\nThe USCBC has advocated in favor of smart and forward-looking policy solutions that support digitalization and expanded access to broadband through the promotion of financial inclusion, increased transparency through digital government services, and the incorporation of SMEs and rural areas. We believe that a new digital framework could become a significant driver for the investment, technology, skills, and resources needed to foster an environment that would accelerate Colombia’s economic roadmap and readiness for future technologies. As per a recent study by Dr. Raul Katz of Columbia Business School, a 10% increase in fixed broadband penetration in Colombia is associated with a growth in GDP per capita of 0.8%, while a 10% increase in the penetration of unique mobile broadband users results in a growth in GDP per capita of 0.4%.\n\nModernizing the U.S.-Colombia relationship through digitalization\n\nI am very optimistic about the future of the U.S.-Colombia relationship. It has been, and will continue to be, a major success story. As we look towards the next 200 years, we need a modern regulatory framework that guides our commercial relations. A modern-day approach to trade and an enhanced digital regulatory framework will incentivize the digital economy and unleash private sector investment from all our companies in the USCBC and beyond. Latin American exports of services continue to lag behind the rest of the world, but a new approach to digital trade could become a driver for economic growth and job creation.\n\nA new digital trade framework can create mutually beneficial streams of labor supply, support service exports and imports on both sides, and drive inclusive and sustainable growth for all. We are living in uncertain times globally, so let’s come together as the strong allies we are in order to lay the groundwork for economic and social opportunities for the people of Colombia and the United States.",
    "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information": "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information\n\nCity view, Medellín, Colombia (source: flickr/ *Iván Erre Jota*, creative commons)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 13 Sep 2022\n\nThe Colombian Geological Service has published the Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information, a guide for the documentation of geothermal data from exploration areas.\n\nThe Colombian Government has worked to advance the energy transition for Colombia and, through its Congress, published Law 2099 of July 10, 2021, which defines provisions for the use, development and promotion of non-conventional sources of energy, including geothermal energy.\n\nIn “Chapter III of the Geothermal Resource,” is the geothermal registry where all those projects for exploration and exploitation to generate electricity will be registered. On the other hand, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Minenergia),\n\npublished Decree 1318 of July 27, 2022 which regulates the development of activities aimed at generating electricity through geothermal energy, and Resolution 40302 of August 5, 2022, which establishes the technical requirements that will govern the Geothermal Registry and geothermal resource exploration and exploitation permits.\n\nFor its part, the Colombian Geological Service (CGS), a Science and Technology entity linked to Minenergia, represented by the Geothermal Research Group, actively participated from the beginning of the geothermal working tables developed from 2016 to 2020, carried out with Colombian government entities, with the support of the IDB and led by Minenergia, and with the participation of state and regional entities such as the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, autonomous corporations, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), among others.\n\nAs a contribution to this inter-institutional effort, the CGS published in November 2021 the Approach to the geothermal potential of Colombia (Alfaro et al., 2021), estimated at 1170 MWe; and supported the definition of annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of August 5th 2022 issued by Minenergia.\n\nThe Annex 1 “Geothermal exploration information delivery guide” was defined for the information generated by public and private entities in terms of geology, geophysics, fluid geochemistry, conceptual modeling of geothermal fields; and the Annex 2 “Guide for delivery of well drilling information and its evaluation” was defined for the information generated by the drilling of geothermal wells and their evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, the Geothermal Research Group of the CGS recently published the Cartographic Standard for Geothermal Information (ECIG) as a milestone for the entity. This document is the first Colombian CGS geographic information standard, prepared in accordance with the guidelines and policies of the Colombian Spatial Data Infrastructure (ICDE), which guarantees the interoperability of the data, not only for the CGS, but also at an intersectoral level and national, because it complies with ISO and NTC standards.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the ECIG is to define the basic guidelines for the storage and cartographic representation of the geothermal data\n\nacquired in the geothermal exploration areas, which guarantee the quality, organization and uniformity, thus being the technical support to comply with the delivery of information required in Annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of 2022. The information will be integrated from geology, geophysics, geochemistry, geomorphology and elements of geothermal energy, in accordance with the SGC standards, for its availability to the scientific and academic community and the general public.\n\nTherefore, the inter-institutional efforts of the Colombian State are focused on the significant progress in the recognition and investigation of geothermal resources, in the definition and establishment of the regulatory framework for the use of the resource; and the granting of tax benefits, such as incentives, for the generation of electricity with non-conventional energy sources (FNCE), including geothermal energy, and efficient energy management, in accordance with\n\nLaw 1715 of 2014, modified by Law 2099 of 2021.\n\nSource: Email correspondence via our Spanish language platform PiensaGeotermia",
    "Colombian oil sector urges government to drop planned export tax": "BOGOTA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Colombia's new government must drop taxes on oil exports from a proposed tax reform and scrap plans to stop energy companies from offsetting taxes with royalty payments, in favor of surcharges based on production, the private oil producers association said on Thursday.\n\nColombia's new leftist President Gustavo Petro has proposed a tax reform bill to lawmakers which would raise some 25 trillion pesos ($5.7 billion) in 2023, before eventually adding some $11.5 billion annually to government coffers, in an effort to increase revenue for social programs. read more\n\nThe reform would levy a 10% tax on oil exports once the price exceeds $48 per barrel.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nOil prices are expected to average $104 per barrel this year, according to the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP), which represents private producers, providing the state with an extra 24 trillion pesos in 2022.\n\nBut the proposed reform will generate extra costs of between 3.7 trillion and 6 trillion pesos ($842.9 million and $1.4 billion) for the sector, the ACP said, threatening the economic viability of some projects and hastening the end of the country's energy self-sufficiency.\n\n\"This puts production exploration and production projects at risk, since the tax burden will rise,\" ACP President Francisco Lloreda told journalists.\n\nUnder the ACP's proposal, companies would see an additional percentage point placed on their regular tax rate once oil hits $75 per barrel, rising to two and three percentage points, respectively, if average prices exceed $85 or $95 per barrel.\n\nThe measures will ensure that Colombia \"continues to be competitive and that we do not endanger planned exploration and production, nor send a message to foreign and national investment that this industry is not competitive,\" Lloreda said.\n\n($1 = 4,389.8 Colombian pesos)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Oliver Griffin; Editing by Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
