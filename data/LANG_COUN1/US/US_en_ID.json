    "Indonesia at UN: ASEAN refuses to be a pawn in ‘a new Cold War’": "Jakarta’s top diplomat also says “principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.”\n\nIndonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi addresses the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. Headquarters in New York, Sept. 26, 2022.\n\nRegional bloc ASEAN will “refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War,” Indonesia’s top diplomat said at the U.N. on Monday, as she vowed that Jakarta would not let geopolitics block global economic recovery under its G20 presidency.\n\nDuring her speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi spoke twice about how “the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable” but did not mention Russia’s war in Ukraine or territorial tensions in the South China Sea.\n\nAs she stood in for Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who was conspicuously absent from the most visible podium on the international diplomatic stage, Retno also criticized many post-war “mini-lateral groupings,” saying they had “become part of a proxy war between major powers.”\n\n“This is not what regional architecture should be. It must serve as the building block for peace and stability rather than undermining them,” she said.\n\nOne such regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), was formed to advance peace in the region, she said.\n\n“ASEAN was built exactly for this purpose. We refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War,” Retno said.\n\n“Instead, we actively promote the paradigm of collaboration with all countries. This paradigm will also guide Indonesia’s Chairmanship in ASEAN next year.”\n\nIndonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest and most populous country, is a founding member of the regional bloc and Jakarta serves as the headquarters of the ASEAN Secretariat. It will take over as ASEAN chair from Cambodia next year, during a tumultuous time for the grouping, when it is dealing with a post-coup crisis in member-state Myanmar.\n\nASEAN has been roundly criticized for its inaction in Myanmar and for the failure of a five-point consensus that the Burmese military agreed to at an emergency meeting last year. Washington, too, has been pushing ASEAN to take stronger steps against the Burmese junta led by Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nThe 10-member regional bloc famously operates by consensus. And critics have said that some of the member-states’ close ties with China have prevented stronger action by ASEAN against the Myanmar military.\n\nHowever, Retno said, Indonesia was very concerned about the Myanmar military’s inaction on the five-point roadmap to return the country to democracy, a roadmap that fellow member-state Malaysia has said should be scrapped in favor of a new approach.\n\nSimilarly, ASEAN has not condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, analysts say, because several countries, including Indonesia, rely on Moscow for their weapons needs.\n\nIndonesia, too, did not directly condemn Russia for the invasion, although it did vote for a U.N. General Assembly resolution in March that “deplored” Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.\n\n‘World is pinning their hope on G20’\n\nStill, Jakarta is caught betwixt and between, because as G20 president this year it has to balance the ire of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, on the one hand, and Russia’s defense of its actions and Beijing’s support of Moscow, on the other.\n\nIn March, U.S. President Joe Biden, who is expected to attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, urged President Jokowi to invite Ukraine as a guest if Russia was not expelled from the group. Jokowi did invite Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but it is not yet certain if Russian President Putin will attend the summit.\n\nIn her speech on Monday, Retno said there was no option but for the G20 summit to produce some solutions for the struggling post-pandemic world.\n\n“The whole world is pinning their hope on G20 to be a catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for developing countries,” Retno said.\n\n“G20 must not fail. We cannot let global recovery fall at the mercy of geopolitics,” she told the General Assembly.\n\nUkraine and Russia provide 30 percent of the world’s wheat and barley, a fifth of its maize and more than half of its sunflower oil. The two countries are also major producers and suppliers of fertilizers. In addition, Russia is the world’s largest natural gas exporter and second largest oil exporter.\n\nFor almost six months after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, it blocked all of the latter’s Black Sea ports and cut off access to almost all of that country’s exports, especially of grain, several news services have reported. Those moves sparked fears of a global food crisis.\n\nRussia has since lifted the blockade under a U.N.-backed deal in July, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, but the spillover effect of the months-long halt of grain exports has led to food inflation in many parts of the world. The rise in food prices comes on top of sky-high fuel prices, amid Western sanctions on Russian oil.\n\n“We must act urgently to address food and energy crises and prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening. Otherwise, billions more people would be at risk, particularly in developing countries,” Retno said.\n\nIn such a situation, Retno said, “peaceful solution is the only option to settle any conflicts.”\n\n“My president conveyed these messages of peace in his visits to Kyiv and Moscow last June,” the Indonesian foreign minister said, referring to Jokowi’s so-called peace mission to Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“A habit of dialogue and cooperation would nurture strategic trust,” Retno said.\n\n“These are the rules of the game that we must maintain if we truly want peace.”\n\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated news service.",

    "Indonesia’s Controversial Fuel Price Hike Was Actually Necessary": "While the rest of the world has dealt with staggering inflation, Indonesians have enjoyed relatively benign price pressure thanks to government subsidies that absorb the shocks of rising costs. For instance, Indonesians paid at the pump only half of the actual price of gasoline in first half 2022, due to the government footing the difference in production costs. Indonesian leaders have been fretful of weaning the democratic country’s 270 million people off of energy subsidies: the habitual subsidies have led to higher consumption of gasoline than the global average by a staggering 13 percent, and fuel prices weigh heavily on average household consumption.\n\nBut the strategy to keep the lid on prices has become excessively costly as the energy crisis persists, prompting the government to hike its price of gasoline for the first time in eight years.\n\nThe Indonesian government was right to make this controversial move, despite protests and potentially higher inflation, and it should go further to wean the country from costly subsidies. So far this year, the government has nearly tripled the subsidy budget—from 207 trillion Indonesian rupiahs ($14 billion) to 502.4 trillion rupiahs ($34 billion)—as production costs rose above subsidized sales prices. In fact, even with the increased subsidy budget, the government estimates that the subsidy cost would rise to 653 trillion rupiahs ($44 billion) even if the price of crude oil were to drop.\n\nTrinh Nguyen Trinh Nguyen is a nonresident scholar in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More > @trinhnomics\n\nThis pressure on the budget crowds out much-needed government investment in projects that enhance productivity, such as those that beef up Indonesia’s woeful infrastructure. An analysis of Indonesia’s infrastructure supply shows that it is inadequate relative not just to developed markets but also to its regional peers, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, on roads, air travel, electricity, railroads, and broadband infrastructure. To make matters worse, with rising urbanization levels and a growing population, Indonesia will need to invest even more to keep up with these demographic shifts. To do so, it needs to reduce the size of spending on subsidies to expand allocation to capital spending, which is currently skewed toward subsidies of gasoline spending rather than investment.\n\nNow is a good time for Indonesia to tackle this issue. President Joko Widodo’s ratings are high, and presidential elections are not due until 2024, meaning that even though the hike has caused unrest, it is unlikely to lead to the toppling of his government. Indonesia also is currently benefiting from the energy crisis, thanks to the increased demand for its exports of coal and other fossil fuels. The trade balance is in surplus, boosting income flows. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are also at an all-time high in part because Indonesia is rich in mineral resources necessary for the energy transition—especially hydrogen and nickel, which are key for electric vehicle batteries. Income flows from these favorable trade terms should offset some of the purchasing power deterioration expected from the fuel price hike.\n\nFinally, the fuel price hike highlights the need for Indonesia to move away from populist policy that is merely a Band-Aid for the cost-of-living crisis. Instead, the government needs to pivot to the real solution: increasing formal employment opportunities and wage growth for ordinary Indonesians. The labor force of 131 million people is underutilized, with more than 60 percent of employment occurring in the informal sector and 32 percent in farming. Such underutilization means that Indonesia is leaving most of its citizens behind, as formal employment opportunities are still limited. My calculation of quantity, quality, and regulations suggests that Indonesia is still not attractive in basic or advanced labor-intensive manufacturing. New measures like loosening restrictive FDI policies, enforcing rigid labor laws (which is in the works via the stalled Omnibus Law), upgrading workers’ skills, and improving weak infrastructure are necessary to attract more labor-intensive manufacturing sectors.\n\nTo fix these issues, Indonesia needs to make space in its budget to deploy more spending toward investment rather than tripling its subsidy budget, which is already too high. Beyond hiking prices, Indonesia needs to entirely wean the populace from costly subsidies and focus on expanding employment opportunities by investing in infrastructure to tap into its favorable demographic transition.",
    "The ultimate guide to Raja Ampat, Indonesia": "The 1500 islands, cays and shoals that make up Raja Ampat lie on prime real estate at the heart of the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hot spot where the Pacific and Indian Oceans collide.\n\nLikened to the “Amazon of the seas,” this tropical labyrinth holds one of the world’s highest densities of marine life with over 1000 species of fish and three-fourths of all known corals. Divers and snorkelers alike dip into the aquamarine waters here in search of wildly-patterned carpet sharks, massive manta rays and pygmy seahorses. Up above, they find bungalows perched over the ocean and palms curving toward pearly beaches devoid of any footprints.\n\nEach of the main islands – or “Four Kings” as they’re known – hides its own wonders, including mesmerizing mushroom-shaped outcrops, placid turquoise lagoons and misty hills where flamboyantly-feathered fowl parade across the canopy in search of a mate. To visit now is to experience a virgin paradise on the verge of discovery.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know to plan the perfect trip to Indonesia's Raja Ampat.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nWaigeo is home to the region's small capital\n\nIf sleepy Raja Ampat has any whiff of a buzz, you’ll find it on Waigeo or its satellite islands Gam, Kri and Arborek. Home to the region’s diminutive capital, Waisai, this is the most logical base from which to plan journeys further afield. Waigeo is the place where British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace based himself in 1860 while studying the birds-of-paradise, a group of 44 lavishly attired birds only found around New Guinea and north-eastern Australia. Research in the jungles here played a pivotal role in his landmark theory of evolution through natural selection, which was published jointly with the more famous Charles Darwin. You can find Wallace’s subjects fluttering about in the hills on the island’s southern edge, as well as on neighboring Gam.\n\nExplore the secluded lagoons around Misool Island © iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nMisool is the most isolated of the \"Four Kings\"\n\nMisool is the most visually arresting of the four main islands. It’s also the most isolated at the southern end of the archipelago. Its southeastern edge is a veritable fortress of towering karst formations that rise out of the sea like shards of green glass. Many of these formations hide secluded lagoons that are perfect for snorkeling or kayaking. Yet, the main draw here is scuba diving in the crystalline waters of the 300,000-acre (1220 sq km) Misool Marine Reserve, established in 2005. The island also features pearl farms, caves, prehistoric rock art and two lakes where you can swim with thousands of (harmless) golden jellyfish.\n\nSalawati and Batanta are the least visited of the \"Four Kings\"\n\nDespite being closest to mainland New Guinea, Salawati and Batanta are the least visited of the “Four Kings.” Salawati is an untouched island that lies directly across the Sele Strait from the Bird's Head Peninsula. It has little in the way of tourist attractions or infrastructure. Batanta is a long, thin island just north of it that’s home to a few tiny fishing villages. You’ll also find a handful of homestays and dive resorts along Batanta’s northern edge, as well as on the smaller satellite islands just off the coast.\n\nDiving is one of the main activities in Raja Ampat © TONY MYSHLYAEV / Stocksy United\n\nWhat to do in Raja Ampat\n\nDive (or snorkel) in Misool’s protected waters\n\nDivers from around the world flock to Raja Ampat’s clear waters to spot soaring manta rays, giant clams, iridescent parrotfish, rare dugongs and swarming schools of yellowback fusiliers. Its unspoiled reefs are home to more than ten times the number of hard coral species found in the Caribbean. In the protected waters of the Misool Marine Reserve, you can find blue staghorns, orange sea whips and chunky brain corals, among countless others. The reserve’s disparate dive sites are best visited from a liveaboard boat or a Misool-area dive resort.\n\nHike to the birds-of-paradise\n\nWalk in Wallace’s footsteps in search of the aptly named birds-of-paradise, whose elaborate courtship dances were a highlight of the BBC's original Planet Earth series. The southern coasts of Waigeo and Gam offer the best chance for sightings, with forests that harbor two species. The larger red bird-of-paradise has crimson wings, emerald cheeks, yellow shoulder tufts and wispy purple tail feathers, while the smaller Wilson's bird-of-paradise has a startling cyan cap, a red-and-black body, blue feet and tail feathers shaped like a scissor handle. Local guides run tours to see the birds along private-access trails that often begin behind their homes. Accommodation providers can arrange trips, which typically involve a pre-dawn hike up to a crude viewing blind near a popular mating area.\n\nAnd there are plenty of snorkeling opportunities for non-divers © Rudhie68 / Shutterstock\n\nVisit Arborek Village\n\nTiny Arborek Village (population around 200) offers a glimpse of more traditional Papuan culture, with elders who still make a living weaving and children who have revived Papuan dancing. The people who live in Arborek (an island just off the coast of Waigeo) migrated here from the hills of the mainland in the 1930s, and their dances tell the story of the transition from being hunters to fishers. Meanwhile their woven crafts – made from the dried leaves of the pandanus tree and local dyes – often take the shape of manta rays and other sea creatures found in the nearby waters. You can frequently spot kids rehearsing dances in front of the town church, while crafts are sold directly from the homes of weavers.\n\nClimb Pianemo Hill\n\nWant that classic Raja Ampat shot with pincushions of bush-clad rock floating in the turquoise sea? You’ll need to climb to the top of Pianemo Hill, a hunk of honeycombed karst in the Fam Islands group (between Batanta and Waigeo) that’s covered in spindly pandanus and gum trees. Some 250 wooden steps lead through the dense vegetation up to a platform at the top, where the five points of a star-shaped lagoon come into view. Two overlooks nearby jut out over the edge for picture-perfect panoramas. You can find similar views 30km (19 miles) beyond Waigeo at Wayag, a remote collection of atolls often featured in promotional materials.\n\nChoose between budget homestays to luxurious waterside bungalows © iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nWhere to stay in Raja Ampat\n\nThe quality of homestays varies\n\nThe cheapest and most authentic way to sleep in Raja Ampat is to book a village \"homestay.\" The name is a bit deceiving; you won’t actually sleep in anyone’s home, but rather in a bungalow nearby. Stay Raja Ampat is like the Airbnb of family-owned budget options, giving an online presence to rural accommodation providers. Most homestays come with full board, though hospitality standards and quality vary widely. Recommended options include Kordiris Homestay and Corepen Homestay on Gam Island, as well as the more remote Mandemor Homestay on Batanta.\n\nDive resorts range from comfortable to luxurious\n\nDive resorts were the first to put Raja Ampat on the map, and they remain the most comfortable – often downright luxurious – options around. Some have overwater bungalows and beach bars; others spas and farm-to-table restaurants. The best properties, such as Misool Eco Resort and MahaRaja Eco Dive Lodge, have been instrumental in safeguarding some of the most biodiverse reefs on earth through conservation initiatives and community empowerment.\n\nLiveaboard boats are ideal if you want to explore the archipelago\n\nResorts and homestays typically tie you to one island, but if you want to tour the entire archipelago, there’s really no substitute for a liveaboard boat. Several Indonesian cruises include quick stops in Raja Ampat, but to spend more time here, you’ll want to book an option departing from Sorong. Most ships run five- to 11-day itineraries with a focus either on diving or land excursions. Others, such as SeaTrek, invite experts onboard for themed trips in search of whale sharks or the elusive birds-of-paradise. In general, rates for liveaboards start at around $140 per day, all-inclusive.\n\nGetting to Raja Ampat and around\n\nRaja Ampat lies off the west coast of the world’s second-largest island, New Guinea, which is shared between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Most visitors arrive by plane at Domine Eduard Osok Airport in Sorong, which lies in Indonesia’s West Papua province and receives regular flights from Jakarta. Daily ferries depart from Sorong’s harbor to Waigeo, while twice-weekly ferries head to Misool. Chartered speedboats are available at the harbor for more direct trips to your accommodation.\n\nLocal carrier Susi Air flies light planes (with a 10kg/22lb baggage allowance) from Sorong out to Marinda Airport in Waisai (Waigeo), the only airport in the archipelago.\n\nAll visitors will transit Raja Ampat Marine Park and must pay the Environmental Services Fee (700,000 rupiah). Visitors to select tourist sites will have to pay an additional 300,000 rupiah for the Raja Ampat Visitor Entry Ticket, introduced in 2019.\n\nWhen to go to Raja Ampat\n\nThere’s no bad time to go to Raja Ampat, which lies on the equator and enjoys relatively consistent temperatures of between 31ºC (89ºF) and 25ºC (78ºF). June, July and August are historically the wettest months, but the monsoon seasons here are not as dramatic as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Rainfall is often short-lived and localized. Higher winds between mid-June and mid-September can make the typically calm seas turn choppy. During this time, diving outfits may close and inter-island travel can become temporarily suspended.",

    "Enabling the Digital Literacy Generation for a Stronger Indonesian Economy": "JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- September 8th, is commemorated as World Literacy Day. As proclaimed by UNESCO in 1966, World Literacy Day aims to remember the importance of literacy for individuals, communities, and societies and the need for intensive efforts for society to be literate. Now, along with the rapid development of technology accompanied by changes in people's lifestyles, literacy is viewed not just as it was originally proclaimed, but increasingly as literacy in using and utilizing digital technology.\n\nAs the leading digital telecommunications company in Indonesia, PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (Telkom) has a responsibility to support the development of Indonesia's digitalization by providing the digital infrastructure and digital services platform.\n\nThe Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) of the Republic of Indonesia, Erick Thohir, said, \"Developing Indonesia's digital economy will be an integral element of our growth ambitions, with a potential to reach Rp4,500 trillion, which is eight times faster than the country's GDP growth. However, at the moment, Indonesia is utilizing just 1% digital talent, while the minimum total required is 20%. Therefore, Telkom and Telkomsel, as digital telecommunications companies owned by state, must become the backbone to Indonesia's digital economy. \"\n\nSince the beginning of the transformation journey led by Erick Thohir, PT Telkom Indonesia has continued to focus on digital business and become the largest digital telecommunications company in Southeast Asia. This transformation to digital business is in line with the mission of the Government of Indonesia to equalize digital access throughout the nation. Until June 2022, Telkom has delivered various infrastructure such as 171,654 kilometres of fiber optic cable across the archipelago and 255,107 Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), which serve 8.9 million IndiHome customers, serving 169.7 million Telkomsel customers connected to the world via the internet.\n\nIn order to achieve digital sovereignty, at least three factors need to be considered, specifically: the environment, society, and digital economy. A successful digital environment can be created through infrastructure development. Based on Ministry of Finance data, from 2019 to 2022 the investment budget for digital infrastructure development has reached Rp75 trillion.\n\nIn the development of digital sovereignty, people's digital literacy and inclusion must be improved to increase the quality of digitalization and to support Indonesia's digital transformation. Digital Transformation has become one of the key topics of the Indonesian G20 Presidency agenda. To support these efforts, PT Telkom Indonesia has been actively participating in the G20 agenda, specifically in the digitization-related topics. The President Director of Telkom, Ririek Adriansyah, has also been entrusted with the mandate as Chairman of the B20 Digitization Task Force.\n\nAccording to Ministry of Communication and Information data, Indonesia's digital literacy index is 3.49 out of a range of 0-5. The data indicates a mature digital literacy level in Indonesia, ready to compete in the era of society 5.0. Telkom has formed a strong digital society through various products and services. Through collaboration with various parties and SOEs, Telkom seeks digital literacy improvement through PeduliLindungi application development, implementation of assistance through BUMN Houses, provision of Amoeba and Indigo incubation facilities, and various other efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the digital environment and society can drive a strong digital economic ecosystem. Through digitalization, people's living standards increase and positively impact Indonesia's economic growth. According to a Google report in 2021 by Temasek and Bain & Company, the value of digital transactions in the Indonesian e-commerce sector reached Rp1,000 trillion, or US$70 billion. This value is predicted to increase to US$146 billion by 2025. To support the growth of the digital economy, various products and services are needed by the community and business actors. Therefore, Telkom has presented a number of solutions such as PaDi UMKM (MSMEs), Agree (agriculture and fisheries), Logee (Logistics), BigBox (One Indonesia Data), MySooltan, and many other digital services.\n\nMoving forward, Telkom has three missions to help companies reach their vision. First, accelerating the sustainable development of smart digital infrastructure and platforms. Second, developing digital talent to escalate Indonesian capabilities and levels in digitalization. Third, lead the digital ecosystem formation that provides the best experience for users.\n\nCommenting on Indonesia's digital literacy ambitions, President Director of Telkom, Ririek Adriansyah said: \"Indonesia's future will depend on how well the country is able to optimize its wealth and potential in the digital realm. With the best talent, qualified technology, and a strong business ecosystem, Indonesia can become a major economic player in the region and even the world in the next few years. Telkom will stand with the people and the Indonesian government to realize these ideals.\"\n\n#DigitalBisa\n\n#UntukIndonesiaLebihBaik\n\nSOURCE PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk",

    "Emissions and deforestation set to spike under Indonesia’s biomass transition": "Indonesia’s cofiring program — reducing the amount of coal used in power generation by cutting it with wood pellets — will result in massive deforestation and a net emissions surge, an energy policy think tank warns.\n\nUnder the government’s 10% biomass cofiring plan, up to 1.05 million hectares (2.59 million acres) of forest could be cleared for acacia and eucalyptus plantations to provide wood pellets.\n\nThis would result in up to 489 million metric tons of emissions — a vastly greater amount than the 1 million tons in reduced emissions that cofiring is expected to achieve.\n\nThe analysis, by Trend Asia, also shows that, if anything, Indonesia’s coal consumption has only increased with higher biomass cofiring, and that this trend is expected to continue through 2030 as more new coal plants are built.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia’s program to wean itself off coal by burning it alongside progressively higher amounts of woody biomass will threaten more than a million hectares of rainforest and result in massive net carbon emissions, a new analysis shows.\n\nThis process of cutting coal with materials such as wood pellets, oil palm kernels and sawdust is known as cofiring, and has been touted by the government as a key method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, which generate most of Indonesia’s electricity.\n\nThe plan is to increase the portion of biomass burned in coal plants to 10%, which the government says will require 9 million metric tons of biomass annually.\n\nBut the more realistic figure is 10.2 million metric tons, according to Trend Asia, an Indonesian think tank that focuses on the clean energy transition. And there’s no way that amount of biomass will come from agricultural or urban waste, meaning the bulk of it will have to come from large-scale forest plantations, Trend Asia said in a recent analysis.\n\nThese would require 2.33 million hectares (5.7 million acres) of land — an area roughly 35 times the size of Jakarta — according to Trend Asia. And nearly half of it would have to be newly established — which in many cases means clearing standing forest for acacia and eucalyptus — given that Indonesia’s current annual production of wood pellets is less than 1 million metric tons.\n\nMeike Inda Erlina, renewable energy campaigner at Trend Asia, said the resulting deforestation — between 1 million and 1.05 million hectares (2.47 million to 2.59 million acres), depending on the mix of acacia and eucalyptus — would amount to a tremendous loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\n“There’s biodiversity [in our forests] that supports our lives as human, and there’s also lots of people whose livelihoods depend on forests, especially those who live in forest areas, such as Indigenous peoples,” she said at the recent launch of Trend Asia’s analysis. “All these have immeasurable values which the state can’t pay [back].”\n\nDarmawan Prasodjo, president of state-owned utility PLN, said the cofiring program would provide a source of livelihood to local communities growing acacia and eucalyptus trees for wood pellets. He also said there was plenty of non-forest “deserted” land on which they could be grown, including 800,000 hectares (2 million acres) just on the island of Java.\n\nMore emissions than reductions\n\nThe carbon dioxide emissions associated with clearing forests for new energy plantations, as they’re known, would far exceed any reductions achieved from cofiring, Trend Asia’s analysis shows.\n\nUnder the 10% cofiring scenario, Indonesia’s 52 biggest coal-fired power plants could expect a combined reduction in emissions of 1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). But the cost of achieving this — the deforestation to make way for the acacia and eucalyptus plantations — would result in emissions of 469 million to 489 million metric tons CO2e, according to Trend Asia.\n\n“The problem is, based on the [large] amount of biomass needed, the figure [of reduced power plant emissions] is too low,” said Trend Asia researcher Mumu Muhajir.\n\nHe added the amount of coal that Indonesia burns is expected to keep increasing through 2030, even if the cofiring program is fully implemented. This goes against the government’s own touting of the cofiring program as a way to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, he said.\n\nThe increase in coal use is already evident: When the amount of biomass used in cofiring increased significantly from 9,731 metric tons in 2020 to 282,628 metric tons in 2021 — a 28-fold jump — the amount of coal burned also increased, from 66.68 million to 68.47 million metric tons.\n\n“So why don’t we see a decrease in coal consumption?” Mumu said.\n\nThat’s because while the government pledged last year to retire 9.2 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants by 2030, it also plans to build 13.8 GW of new coal plants during the same period. That means a net increase in coal capacity this decade. And if anything, Mumu said, the cofiring program will only prolong the life of coal power plants.\n\n“This will become a double catastrophe,” he said. “Carbon emissions from coal will keep rising because of the increase in consumption, but then we also use cofiring from biomass whose emissions from deforestation we will have to pay for over the next 20 years.”\n\nThe increase in coal burning to generate electricity will also add to the state’s financial strain, Mieke said. She noted that each 1 GW of additional electricity generation costs the government 1.36 trillion rupiah ($91 million). But the country’s power grid is already oversupplied by 5 GW, translating into nearly half a billion dollars of electricity that the government is paying for but can’t sell.\n\nRegulatory support\n\nYet despite all the concerns over the sustainability of burning biomass in coal-fired power plants, the government has issued several regulations in support of the policy.\n\nAmalya Reza Oktaviani, campaign manager at watchdog group Forest Watch Indonesia, said regulations issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry make it easier for companies to acquire forest concessions for “energy security” purposes. In these cases, companies don’t have to wait until a land demarcation process is completed finished in order to start developing the concessions — which in many cases means clearing the forest.\n\nCompanies would also be eligible for larger concessions than usual, up to 60,000 hectares (148,000 acres) per province, or 300,000 hectares (741,000 acres) nationally, and wouldn’t require approval from provincial governors, Amalya said at the launch of the Trend Asia report.\n\nThese companies would also be exempt from paying non-tax revenue and from the obligation to rehabilitate watershed areas, she said.\n\nAs of 2020, there were 14 companies developing more than 156,000 hectares (nearly 386,000 acres) of energy plantations, according to data from the forestry ministry, with another 18 companies plan to join the rush.\n\nAlso for “energy security” purposes, the government has designated 5.4 million hectares (13.3 million acres) of forest area that may be cleared for plantations, according to FWI. Not all of it will necessarily be cleared, Amalya said, but the point is that this potential deforestation “is in the law.”\n\n“So we can see that [deforestation for energy plantations] is legalized,” she said.\n\nBanner image: A truck carrying acacia logs in Indonesia in 2014.

    "Indonesia’s electric vehicle batteries dream has a dirty nickel problem": "Indonesia—the world’s largest nickel miner—is making moves to become a key player in the electric vehicle supply chain. Most of Indonesia’s nickel output is currently Class 2 nickel, a low-purity type used for stainless steel. The country’s government and the mining sector are determined to transform its nickel industry to meet the rising demand for Class 1 nickel, a crucial component for electric vehicle (EV) batteries.[1] EVs are widely viewed as a pillar of the transition toward renewable energy sources since they typically have a smaller carbon footprint over their lifespan than gasoline-powered vehicles. These efforts have seen some success to date, with the EV and battery manufacturing sector making investments in the country’s downstream industry (in other words, investment in end-uses of nickel, such as EV batteries), including an EV battery cell plant near Jakarta.\n\nNickel is a key part of Indonesia’s commodity-led development strategy, in which the country has banned exports of raw commodities to attract downstream investment and catalyze socioeconomic development. The government is planning to tax exports of nickel pig iron (NPI) and ferronickel, which would likely boost production of battery-grade nickel. And for EV manufacturers struggling to source nickel in a tight market, Indonesia has become a key supplier in the past year.\n\nBut there is a catch: Indonesia’s nickel sector is particularly carbon-intensive and environmentally damaging. This creates an awkward challenge for EV manufacturers, who are under pressure to manage environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in their supply chains, including carbon emissions. Some EV manufacturers have expressed a preference for “low-carbon” nickel. However, the supply of “low-carbon” is insufficient to meet forecasted demand, and it comes with a higher price tag. In this piece, we unpack the environmental risks and recent developments in Indonesia’s nickel industry that illustrate several of the difficult trade-offs required for decarbonization.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nIndonesia’s nickel sector poses many environmental challenges. Its nickel processing industry is especially carbon-intensive due to its reliance on coal. Civil society groups have also voiced concerns about the environmental risks of nickel mining and processing. Most recently, environmental groups urged Tesla to terminate its investment plans in the country’s nickel industry, citing concerns over deforestation, pollution of water bodies, and disruption to the livelihoods of indigenous people as a result of nickel mining.\n\nThe way nickel is processed, and particularly how Indonesian nickel resources are transformed into material suited for EV batteries, is energy-intensive and environmentally damaging. On average, producing Class 1 nickel from Indonesia’s laterite ore resources, releases two to six times more the amount of carbon dioxide emissions than producing Class 1 nickel from sulfide deposits. The latter tend to have higher grades than laterite deposits and are easier to process, but more laterite projects in Indonesia and elsewhere are being developed to meet rising demand for nickel. Moreover, Indonesia’s energy grid remains highly reliant on coal—which accounts for approximately 60 percent of its total electricity capacity. Its industrial parks, which have become major hubs for nickel and aluminum processing, currently account for 15 percent of the country’s coal power output.\n\nIf plans to expand the captive power of these industrial parks are fulfilled, their share of Indonesia’s total coal power output is expected to rise to 24 percent. While Indonesia’s government technically has plans to phase out coal for electricity by 2056, it may not prove willing to make any economic tradeoffs, including reducing industrial park capacity.\n\nInitiatives by Tsingshan, the world’s largest nickel producer, highlight some of these environmental challenges. For example, Tsingshan is spearheading one of Indonesia’s five hydrometallurgy projects through PT Huayue, a joint venture that is using high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) to produce Class 1 nickel from laterite resources, which are generally used for Class 2 nickel production. Even if in the long-term HPAL in Indonesia can be decarbonized, the process produces “toxic waste that is difficult to manage” and poses environmental risks, like many traditional metal smelters in Indonesia.\n\nSimilarly, Tsingshan has also converted Class 2 nickel pig iron (NPI), which is mainly used to produce stainless steel, into nickel matte, a higher-grade form of the material. This process has raised even greater concerns given that matte production from NPI results in nearly three times as many greenhouse gas emissions per unit of nickel as HPAL processing.\n\nInvestments and market dynamics\n\nThe government of Indonesia and investors jumping into the country’s nickel sector seem willing to overlook these environmental concerns. President Joko Widodo has expressed aspirations to develop an onshore nickel-based EV industry, including processing and refining, as well as producing battery components. In 2020, Indonesia banned raw nickel exports to develop a domestic downstream industry, which halted the large outflow of raw nickel to China.\n\nSince the export ban, Indonesia has seen an uptick in downstream investments focused on nickel refining and processing, especially from China. Chinese refineries, including GEM Co, have committed approximately $30 billion to offshore their activities to Indonesia. In mid-April 2022, Chinese battery giant CATL entered a joint investment in Indonesia for nickel mining and EV battery production.\n\nDownstream EV players, including Volkswagen and Tesla, have also aimed to secure minerals from the Southeast Asian nation. In April 2022, a Korean consortium led by LG Energy Solution, the world’s second-largest EV battery manufacturer, signed a $9 billion investment agreement with local mining company PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) and Indonesia Battery Corporation. LG Energy Solution is also building a $1.1 billion battery cell plant in Karawang Regency, 65 km southeast of Jakarta, as part of a joint venture with Hyundai Motor Group. China has played a key role in the financing of coal-fired power plants required for nickel processing. Indeed, China’s large-scale investment in Indonesia’s nickel industry raises serious questions about China’s own climate agenda. President Xi has announced broad plans to stop building coal plants overseas and halt new coal-related projects. Indonesian coal-powered nickel processing plants seem to be an exception. A report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air explains that China may be using a loophole to develop two nickel and steel processing plants powered by coal plants in Indonesia. The projects fall under a gray area, as they are not “new.” Rather, they are linked to existing steel and nickel complexes approved before the ban. As a result, the coal-fired power plants have secured construction and purchasing agreements from Chinese firms.\n\nMoreover, it would be difficult for EV manufacturers to cut Indonesian nickel out of their supply chains even if they wanted to. Russia supplies roughly 20 percent of Class 1 nickel, but the repercussions of its invasion of Ukraine and the potential for sanctions may reduce this and constrain European and U.S. actors’ willingness or ability to source nickel from Russia. Given the investments into Indonesia’s refining and processing capacity and the sheer amount of its nickel reserves, Indonesia will likely become an even more important source of refined nickel for EV batteries over the next decade.\n\nMoving forward\n\nGovernment action will be vital to cutting carbon emissions in the nickel supply chain. There are some encouraging moves in Europe. For example, the new EU Batteries Regulation will require EV battery manufacturers to disclose the carbon footprint of all batteries sold in Europe. While manufacturers may be motivated to reduce the carbon footprint of their batteries, including by opting for lower-carbon nickel, they will also likely face practical constraints due to a supply squeeze. Moreover, there is little sign of action when it comes to cutting carbon emissions in the nickel supply chain from other major players like China and the U.S.\n\nIf the industry and policymakers ignore the climate threats of coal-powered industrial parks used to produce substances like nickel, Indonesia could solidify its standing as one of the world’s largest but dirtiest nickel players in the EV supply chain.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] According to the IEA, “There are two types of primary nickel products: high-purity Class 1 products (containing 99.8% nickel or above) and lower-purity Class 2 products (containing less than 99.8% nickel). Battery cathodes need nickel sulfate, which is synthesized from Class 1 products.”",

The Philippines is offering \"workation\" packages in the resort of Boracay, while Malaysia announced regulations this week to allow digital nomads who qualify to stay for 12 months.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nAdditional Reporting by Rozanna Latiff in Kuala Lumpur and Neil Jerome Morales in Manila; Writing by Kate Lamb; Editing by Ed Davies\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Indonesia Launches Information Aggregator Website": "The information from numerous ministries and institutions, even local governments, will now be combined into one website. The aggregator website Indonesiakini.go.id has been launched by the Ministry of Communication and Information.\n\nThis action will make it simpler for the public to obtain reliable information on the numerous policies and initiatives that the government has implemented and will continue to implement.\n\n“We hope that with this website, the public can find out the current situation, and condition of Indonesia by just clicking on one website. The existence of this website makes public communication more integrative, more orchestrated in the eyes of the citizens,” says Usman Kansong, Director General of Information and Public Communication of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.\n\nThe Director General outlined how Indonesia’s presence will undoubtedly address the difficulties of rapid, widespread, and integrated public communication. He continued by saying that the dynamics of information and communication technologies that cause the disruption make it difficult for government institutions to handle public information and communication in a way that allows for adaptive public consumption.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, nonetheless, that not all local governments, organisations, or ministries have combined their material into a single repository. Communication activities must be adjusted to the changing public communication landscape in government institutions to facilitate the public’s access to information.\n\nThe Ministry of Communication and Information has the responsibility to coordinate the planning, preparation, and implementation of public communications related to policies and programmes of the government, in accordance with Presidential Instruction Number 9 of 2015 concerning the Management of Public Communication.\n\nThe Ministry is also responsible for organising information into a single narrative for the Presidential Instruction. The presence of Indonesia will undoubtedly be the ideal setting for bringing together the various government channels.\n\nThe public will now have easier access to information about the government’s development initiatives. The four information channels held by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics will soon be integrated into the Indonesian aggregator website.\n\nThis includes 115 universities, 34 provincial governments, 98 city governments, and 416 district governments. There are also 37 additional ministry sites, 7 institutions, 2 sites run by the presidential palace, and 37 other sites.\n\nIndonesia has collected 588 websites belonging to various institutions, local governments, and ministries. 746 locations total, or 79 per cent of the target, have been reached.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of South Sulawesi, particularly Makassar City, are prepared for the end of analogue television broadcasts and the subsequent transition to digital television broadcasts. In July 2022, periodic opinion polls performed by the Ministry of Communication and Information confirmed this readiness.\n\nRosarita Niken Widiastuti, a member of the Minister of Communication and Information’s Special Staff, reported that 82.94 per cent of Makassar and its surrounding residents were interested in viewing Digital TV broadcasts.\n\nThe willingness of the citizens of Makassar City cannot be separated from the contribution of the performance of the Broadcasting Institution. All 18 analogue broadcasting institutions in Makassar City and its surroundings have transitioned to digital broadcasting.\n\nFurthermore, the Director of Broadcasting of the Directorate General of Post and Information Technology at the Ministry of Communication and Information, Geryantika Kurnia, noted that there are three determinants of readiness prior to the implementation of the Analogue Switch Off (ASO) programme.\n\nAccording to the Director, 112 Service Areas are affected by ASO in Indonesia due to the prevalence of analogue television broadcasts. LPP TVRI, the Indonesian public television network, is actively constructing infrastructure for the remaining rural sites, of which 90 are already receiving digital transmissions.",

Of the 2,078 permits that were revoked, 700 companies had objected.\n\n\"Seven-hundred companies stated their objection.

    "SerMorpheus wants to make NFTs an everyday sight in Indonesia": "More than half of the population in Southeast Asia is under 30, making it a coveted market for novel technologies. Unsurprisingly, several countries in the region, like Singapore and Vietnam, have some of the world’s highest crypto adoption rates.\n\nWhile Indonesia isn’t the most crypto active in the region — total crypto value received was less than half of Thailand’s from July 2021 to June 2022, according to Chainalysis — the country is thought to hold huge potential for web3 adoption, thanks to a young and sizable (270 million) population as well as a vibrant Web 2.0 industry.\n\nIndonesia is “catching up” on web3 because its huge talent pool still rests in the Web 2.0 industry, one crypto investor pointed out previously.\n\nBut entrepreneurs are working to bring blockchain applications to the multicultural archipelago. Pintu racked up $113 million in financing in June to offer crypto trading services to Indonesians. Now a startup called SerMorpheus is hoping to connect brands and consumers through digital assets.\n\nA digital asset in the form of non-fungible tokens can be used to authenticate ownership. For instance, NFTs can prove one’s access to exclusive content, membership in an organization or discounts on a deal.\n\n“Indonesians are big consumers of social media content. A lot of intellectual property is getting created, but creativity is underexposed when it comes to web3,” noted co-founder of SerMorpheus Kenneth Tali. “With so much money coming into crypto, why isn’t much [web3] creativity coming out of Indonesia?”\n\nPart of the problem, he reckoned, is the technical loops creators need to jump to create smart contracts; they’d have to contact multiple platforms and manage relationships with each of them. On the consumer side, users are already stuck at the stage of setting up a wallet and are worried about losing their private keys.\n\nAs such, SerMorpheus recently closed a $2.5 million seed round to create a user-friendly platform for businesses to create NFTs; end users, on the other hand, can buy and trade digital assets on the platform with the local currency rupiah. To date, the service has been used by some 27,000 people to claim tickets to music events, exclusive fan perks from celebrities, membership to football clubs and so on, the founder said.\n\nThe platform is still manually onboarding businesses and brands — so far 25 of them, including Indonesia Comic-Con — but the next step is to make SerMorpheus as automated as creating a Facebook page. To do so, smart contracts, or lines of codes that execute on predetermined rules, will be standardized, as well as the types of benefits creators devise for their end users.\n\nThe startup takes a 5-10% cut from NFTs minted on its platform and charges a 2% fee in secondary sales.\n\nIts seed round was led by Intudo Ventures, with participation from 500 Global, Febe Ventures, AlphaLab Capital, BRI Ventures and Caballeros Capital. With a team of 30 people, SerMorpheus plans to spend the fresh capital on building out its infrastructure and hiring across all functions.",

    "VP listens to aspirations of Indonesians living in Japan": "Tokyo, Japan (ANTARA) - Vice President Ma'ruf Amin on Monday listened to the aspirations of Indonesian nationals who are currently attending school or working in Japan\"I need to add that for the improvement of human resources, Japan does provide many scholarships to us as well as technical skills training, and we hope that in the future, it will also expand Japanese language teaching, vocational education, and disaster response (skills training),\" he said at the(Indonesian embassy) in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday.He made the remarks while meeting Indonesian nationals at a luncheon that was also attended by Mrs. Wury Ma'ruf Amin and Indonesian Ambassador to Japan, Heri Akhmadi, and Mrs. Nuning Wahyuniati.\"Next year, Indonesia and Japan will celebrate 65 years of Indonesia-Japan relations, and I hope that the friendly relations that have been ongoing for six decades will be even more intimate and provide welfare benefits for the people of both countries,\" he added.During the meeting, a representative from the Indonesia Community in Japan (ICJ), an association of Indonesian workers in Japan, Andi Laver, called for work safety support.\"The proposal to the Indonesian and Japanese governments is more support for friends who work in the field; many are needed such as protection of occupational safety and health and what is the next ‘next,’\" said Laver, who joined the meeting via the Zoom videoconferencing platform.Meanwhile, chair of the Japanese Nahdlatul Ulama Board, Gazali Achmadi, who is currently pursuing doctoral studies, asked for support for interns from Indonesia.\"On average, those participating in the NU branch here are dominated by apprentices with a three-year stay. It is how to ensure that they do not return to Indonesia unemployed, but (make sure there is a) vocational school,” Achmadi said.Vice President Amin said that he will take up the proposals with the technical ministry.\"The presence of the Indonesian diaspora in Japan can contribute positively, (by acting as) ambassadors for Indonesia, providing the best work, complying with local laws, and keeping in touch and helping each other,\" he remarked.He also urged the people to not hesitate in contacting the Indonesian embassy in Tokyo and the Indonesian Consulate General in Osaka if they face any difficulty.\"Before I end this, I (would like to remind) for ladies and gentlemen who are far from the country to always maintain Indonesia's greatest wealth, (those) beingand diversity,\" he said.According to Ambassador Akhmadi, as of December 2021, the total number of Indonesian citizens in Japan reached 59,820, consisting of permanent residents, temporary residents, apprentices, students, wives/husbands of Japanese citizens, people holding visas for certain activities and others.The Indonesian nationals were dominated by apprentices (25,007), followed by permanent resident residence permit owners (7,077), and special skilled workers (5,855).",
    "Smoke and mirrors in Indonesia as giant gas projects struggle": "Register here for the Energy Voice daily newsletter, bringing you key news and insight from across the global energy landscape.\n\nIndonesia has an ambitious target to almost double natural gas production from 6.5 billion cubic feet per day (cf/d) to 12 billion cf/d by 2030. Hitting that goal means giant undeveloped gas projects, such as Inpex’s Masela and Chevron’s IDD, must proceed rapidly.\n\nThe trouble is these projects have stalled in recent years, largely because of political meddling, as well as the rising trend towards resource nationalism under President Joko Widodo’s watch since he took power in October 2014.\n\nDwi Soetijpto, the head of Indonesia’s upstream regulator SKK Migas, is under pressure from Widodo, known locally as Jokowi, to get Masela and the Indonesian Deepwater Development (IDD) moving. This explains the pronouncements, suggesting progress on these mega projects, by Dwi and other senior officials, to delegates and the media at the Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA) conference last week in Jakarta.\n\nJapan’s Inpex (TYO:1605), which leads Masela, will submit yet another revised plan of development by the end of the year. At the same time, an Indonesian consortium led by Pertamina is being steered by Jokowi to buy Shell’s (LON:SHEL) 35% share of Masela. Shell’s desire to divest – triggered by Jokowi’s previous decision in 2016 to cancel a government-approved plan of development for FLNG at the block – has been an impediment for the project.\n\nDwi reckons Inpex will take a final investment decision (FID) by end of 2023, while Inpex has said FID is expected in the second half of the 2020s. Inpex’s forecast is more realistic, as a new plan of development needs to be hammered out with the government. And, crucially, a tricky divestment – that involves Japanese-backed loans and various Indonesian stakeholders – needs to be negotiated with Shell.\n\nChevron Divestment\n\nMeanwhile, if Dwi is to be believed, Italy’s Eni (MIL:ENI) is close to buying out Chevron (NYSE:CVX) from the IDD project. The US giant put its 62% share of IDD up for sale three years ago after failing to agree attractive terms and conditions with the Indonesian government that would allow the development to compete for investment capital within Chevron’s global portfolio.\n\nBut market sources suggest the government is again jumping the gun with its pronouncements. It is true that Eni would be the logical buyer. The Italian company, which already operates fields nearby in the Kutei basin, is currently a minority shareholder in the IDD with a 20% interest, along with China’s Sinopec, which holds the remaining 18% share.\n\nPresumably, if Dwi is correct, Eni will increase its stake, but the Italian company is unlikely to operate the IDD with an 82% interest. No doubt Pertamina will be offered a stake in the project and Sinopec might need to be persuaded to boost its shareholding. UK-based Neptune Energy, a partner of Eni, could also be in the mix too.\n\nStill, sources suggest there is no urgency to finalise the sale of IDD. There are interested buyers and discussions are making progress. However, all parties share the mantra that a “bad deal is worse than no deal” and a final agreement seems someway off just now.\n\nA successful divestment deal would see Chevron, previously one of Indonesia’s largest oil and gas investors, left with no operated-upstream assets in the country after it handed the giant Rokan Block to Pertamina last year. Chevron’s request to extend their Rokan PSC was refused in July 2018 in favour of Pertamina as part of Jokowi’s resource nationalism drive to hand legacy production to the national oil company.\n\n© Supplied by IPA\n\nDownsizing\n\nAs Chevron downsized its operations the supermajor vacated four of its five office floors in a Jakarta building. Inpex, which shared the same building, took over all the space vacated by Chevron, presumably to beef up its Masela project resources. Ironically, the Japanese company has now returned it all and keeps only one floor in the office tower. This would fit with the waning enthusiasm from Tokyo for the proposed Abadi liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Masela Block in recent times.\n\nStill, there is a glimmer of hope for Masela. The war in Ukraine has put energy security top of the agenda within the Japanese government and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida appears to be putting his weight behind Jokowi’s drive to revive the project.\n\nJokowi, whose final presidential term ends in 2024, will “move mountains to make Masela happen” as part of his closing legacy before leaving office, noted a senior industry executive. Pertamina will be pushed to buy Shell out of the project and Inpex could find itself in a good position to negotiate favourable commercial terms and conditions with the Indonesian government.\n\nElsewhere, the BP-led Tangguh LNG project reported record gas production from trains one and two in September. Its long-delayed expansion project that will add a third train is also due to come online in 2023, which will provide a welcome boost for Indonesia’s upstream. But hitting the 2030 gas production target still looks like a stretch just now without urgent radical action.",
    "GoTo president credits Indonesia economy for aiding stock in tech rout": "GoTo Group, the Indonesian e-commerce juggernaut that braved a choppy IPO market to debut on Indonesia’s stock exchange earlier this year, says it plans to wait and see before launching a second listing overseas.\n\n“Given where markets are, and the volatility, I think we’re waiting for more stable and supportive markets before we consider doing that secondary listing outside of the [Indonesia Stock Exchange],” said Patrick Cao, GoTo’s group president, during the Spark Founders Summit organized by Huawei Technologies, in Bangkok, Thailand on Tuesday.\n\nGoTo debuted on Jakarta’s stock market on April 11, in a listing that raised $1.1 billion. Shares climbed more than 13% on opening day, giving the company a market capitalization equivalent to about $30 billion. The company gave away thousands shares to its 600,000 drivers in advance of its trading debut. In its prospectus, the Indonesian startup said it would also launch a secondary listing in a foreign stock market by the end of 2023, mentioning options like the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, among others.\n\nGoTo’s shares have struggled since its debut, falling about 30.3% since April. Yet the company is handling the tech rout better than its two main Southeast Asian rivals.\n\nShares in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab, which raised $4.5 billion in its December debut on the NASDAQ, valuing the company $37 billion, have slumped 62.6% since the start of 2022. Shares in SEA, a Singapore-based digital entertainment company that has expanded into e-commerce and digital payments and trades on the New York Stock Exchange, have plunged 75.4% over the same period. SEA remains Southeast Asia’s most valuable company with a current market capitalization of about $25 billion, compared to about $20 billion for GoTo, and $10 billion for Grab.\n\nGoTo is the product of the May 2021 merger of ride-hailing firm GoJek and e-commerce platform Tokopedia. Cao, who was president of Tokopedia before the merger, became president of the newly-formed GoTo, while Andre Soelistyo, GoJek’s founder, became CEO.\n\n‘The economy is humming’\n\nCao pointed to Indonesia’s strengths as a market for GoTo’s resilience amid global economic uncertainty. “Not only are commodity prices doing well, but the government’s move to go more downstream to support more high-tech areas like batteries has really created a lot of value,” Cao said.\n\nIndonesia has the world’s largest reserves of nickel, a critical metal for electric vehicle batteries. Indonesian president Joko Widodo banned exports of unprocessed nickel to encourage investment in domestic nickel processing and electric vehicle manufacturing. Widodo even took a detour during an official visit to the U.S. to lobby Elon Musk in-person to get Tesla to invest more in Indonesia.\n\nCao said the government’s efforts have “created a nice virtuous circle within Indonesia itself, in terms of GDP growth and consumption growth.” In September, the Asian Development Bank increased its 2022 GDP growth forecast for Indonesia, from 5.0% to 5.4%. The bank forecasts 4.3% GDP growth for the year across Asia.\n\nGoTo’s president also pointed to the strength of Indonesia’s stock market: the Jakarta Composite Index is up 7.8% for the year, making it one of the few Asian—if not global—stock markets in positive territory in 2022.\n\nIndonesia, with 274 million people, accounts for nearly half the population of Southeast Asia, and generates nearly 60% of the region’s GDP. GoTo counts on Indonesia for more than 95% of its revenues.\n\nAnd Cao argued the Indonesian economy has plenty of room for further growth. He noted that while the Indonesian economy used to be centered around the main island of Java, which houses the country’s capital of Jakarta, growth is now spreading across Indonesia’s many islands. “The economy is humming” across the country, Cao said. “That means the entire nation is growing in a very healthy way.”\n\nCao said that there are still gaps in the country’s economy that GoTo could fill, particularly in financial services. He estimated that “about 48%” of Indonesia’s population is unbanked, while only about 6% of Indonesian consumers have credit cards. “There’s so much work to be done,” Cao said.\n\nMore broadly, Cao argued that Southeast Asia featured high smartphone use, but low penetration of e-commerce and digital finance, making it a good market for anyone seeking to launch a startup.\n\n“There’s just so much opportunity,” he said.",

The fish has been harvested from the wild and heavily traded among aquarium enthusiasts around the world since the mid-1990s, with most exports going to the United States and Europe.\n\n“The population [of the Banggai cardinalfish] is relatively small, that’s why, to protect the sustainability of the species, the ministry has designated the fish as limited protected, its habitat as a regional conservation area, and made it the national mascot for ornamental fish,” M. Firdaus Agung, the fisheries ministry’s acting director of marine biodiversity conservation, said in a press release published Sept. 20.\n\nThe updated strategy will evaluate the Indonesian government’s conservation efforts for the cardinalfish and its habitat from 2017-2021, and lay out the nationwide strategy for the next five years, the ministry said. Overfishing, destructive fishing, habitat loss, and climate-induced warming ocean have contributed to the population decline. The unsustainable trade over the past few decades in particular prompted the U.S. and the EU to push, unsuccessfully, in 2007 and 2016 to restrict the species’ trade under CITES, the global wildlife trade convention. The last effort resulted in decisions that tasked Indonesia with ensuring the sustainability of international trade of the cardinalfish by implementing conservation and management measures.\n\nThe Banggai cardinalfish is captured in large quantities — an estimated 500,000 to 900,000 individuals annually. It was among the top 10 most imported aquarium fish into the U.S. in 2008 and 2011, with wild-caught imports into the country between 2005 and 2011 ranging from approximately 118,000 to 160,000 individuals annually, according to a NOAA report. The report also showed that Indonesia was the only source of wild-caught Banggai cardinalfish.\n\nIndonesian law already imposes stringent licensing requirements for the harvest, transport and trade of cardinalfish. The fisheries ministry in 2021 also banned wild harvests of the fish in the Banggai Archipelago during two brief windows — February to March and October to November — which are the peaks of the fish’s spawning period. Captive breeding of the fish also occurs in several sites, including Ambon and Bali, coupled with restocking efforts in the wild, but the wild population remains threatened.\n\nThe species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. NOAA classifies it as threatened, and it’s the first marine aquarium fish to have become an international CITES issue due to mounting concerns of overharvest leading to its potential extinction. The ornamental fish trade contributes significantly to Indonesia’s economy, with exports valued at around $34 million annually. The volume in domestic trade for the Banggai cardinalfish is reported at between 1.1 million and 1.4 million individuals, with each selling for around 20,000 to 25,000 rupiah ($1.30-$1.70).\n\nAt the latest CITES Animal Committee in June 2021, it was agreed that Indonesia would continue to monitor the trade without the need for any international restrictions.\n\n“This is good news and demonstrates that CITES recognises that species listing is not the only solution available to ensure the sustainability of trade,” Dominic Whitmee, chief executive of the Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association, said in a statement in June 2021.\n\nThe cardinalfish’s habitat, the Banggai Archipelago, is considered to be in the heart of the Pacific Coral Triangle, which is home to the highest diversity of corals and reef fishes anywhere on the planet. The Indonesian government in 2019 established the Banggai Dalaka Marine Protected Area in an effort to conserve the cardinalfish and its habitat.\n\nBasten Gokkon is a senior staff writer for Indonesia at Mongabay.

    "First in: The Sanubari hotel, Sumba, Indonesia hotel review": "The backstory\n\nFor the longest time, visiting Sumba either meant ponying up an eye-watering amount of rupiah for a stay at high-flyer hideaway Nihi, or roughing it at one of the basic homestays dotting the coast. Rowan and Micha Burn, the Bali-based British-Australian couple behind The Sanubari, saw an opportunity for a place pitched between these extremes. With the support of a duo of Bali-based British hoteliers, the family moved to Sumba five years ago to oversee the construction of the property, which opened in its first phase in July 2022. The couple has grand plans – and plenty of space – for future extensions, which include a residential villa project, horse stables, a locally minded creative village, and a farm to grow hard-to-source produce.\n\nThe Sanubari, Sumba, Indonesia Tommaso Riva\n\nThe rooms\n\nThe six roomy beachfront villas are all-white Sumbanese fantasies with sliding glass doors framing those stunning ocean views. They have gabled roofs from bamboo and local alang grass, and floors from creamy marble. Inside, they’re minimally furnished with the Sumba hallmarks: ikat tapestries on the walls, a handful of local wood – and stone carvings, and furniture from wicker and teak. Bathrooms take up a third of the floor plan and come with open rain showers and soaking tubs overlooking the sea out front. Each villa (except for the Studio) also opens to its own beachfront infinity swimming pool, built from pebble-washed terrazzo that seemingly fades into the sand. At the time of my visit during the hotel’s soft-opening in September 2022, eight more beach villas were in the works, while another seven will be built in the hills and rice fields further inland.",

    "Indonesia and Norway give REDD+ deal another go after earlier breakup": "Indonesia and Norway have embarked on another REDD+ scheme that will see the latter pay the former to keep its forests standing, after a previous attempt failed because of lack of payment.\n\nIndonesia is home to the third-largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, and the bulk of its greenhouse gas emissions comes from land-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation.\n\nOfficials from both countries say it’s of mutual benefit to both countries, and to the world, to preserve Indonesia’s forests boost their capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nUnder the new deal, payments still outstanding from the previous agreement, which was terminated in 2021, will be honored.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia has signed a new climate deal with Norway that will see the Nordic country pay the Southeast Asian one to keep its forests standing. The deal comes a year after Indonesia terminated a nearly identical scheme between the two countries over the lack of payments.\n\nLand-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation account for the bulk of Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the new deal (and the previous one) is that by slowing or outright preventing forest loss, Indonesia will be able to preserve what’s currently the third-biggest expanse of tropical rainforest on Earth (behind the Amazon and the Congo Basin). Measurable progress on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, a mechanism known as REDD+, will then be eligible for payment under the deal with Norway.\n\nThe new partnership is enshrined in a memorandum of understanding signed by Indonesia’s minister of environment and forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Norway’s minister of climate and environment, Espen Barth Eide, on Sept. 12.\n\nSiti said the intention to form a new partnership was conveyed by Norway in a letter dated Aug. 5.\n\n“Indonesia under the leadership of [President] Jokowi [Joko Widodo] has made great strides and I have to happily announce that we see Indonesia as a world leader on global issues that we’re discussing today,” Eide said. “It’s good for Indonesia, it’s good for Norway, it’s good for the planet because all of our efforts to reduce our emissions from energy, from the industry, from transport, would all be in vain if we don’t look after the carbon sink we already have.”\n\nRewarded for reducing emissions\n\nThe centerpiece of Indonesia’s forest policy is its “FOLU Net Sink 2030 Operational Plan,” an ambitious bid to transform its forests into a major carbon sink by 2030, absorbing 140 million metric tons more CO2 than they emit into the atmosphere.\n\nIndonesia has long been among the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases from deforestation, forest fires and peatland destruction, but its deforestation rate has declined in recent years. According to official data, Indonesia’s deforestation rate in 2019/2020 was 115,500 hectares (285,400 acres), an almost 90% drop from 1.09 million hectares (2.69 million acres) in 2014/2015.\n\nThis progress came during the period when the previous agreement between Indonesia and Norway, signed in 2010, was still in place.\n\nIn 2019, Norway agreed to pay 530 million krone ($56 million) for Indonesia preventing the emission of 11.23 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) through REDD+ in 2017. But by 2021, Norway still hadn’t paid, prompting Indonesia to terminate the REDD+ agreement.\n\n“Indonesia and Norway had cooperation on environment, with REDD+ agreement in 2010, and it was very unfortunate [that] we cannot continue this cooperation,” Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said during a joint press conference with Norwegian officials in Jakarta on Sept. 12. “But we learned a lot from the REDD+ cooperation and continue to be constructive in our engagement.”\n\nBuilding on their long-standing partnership on environmental issues and past experiences, Norway and Indonesia have entered a new agreement, Eide said.\n\n“[We are] learning from our shared experience in the past and moving towards something that I think is really and genuinely promising,” he said at the press conference.\n\nBustar Maitar, CEO of Indonesian environmental NGO EcoNusa Foundation, said he’s optimistic the new climate partnership will further strengthen efforts to achieve the FOLU Net Sink target by 2030 and other climate actions.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe details of the new deal will be ironed out in a new contribution agreement, set to be signed in the next three to four weeks, Eide said.\n\n“And I would like to underline that this is just around the corner and that this is very promising work based on the MOU that we needed to sign in order to complete the contribution agreement,” he said.\n\nWhat’s clear, though, is that Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) will channel the payments directly to Indonesia’s Environment Fund. And the $56 million outstanding that Norway had agreed to pay Indonesia back in 2019 will be paid under the new partnership.\n\nEide said Norwegian payments for Indonesia’s REDD+ achievements made from 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 will be based on the existing measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) protocol, a system set up by Indonesia to account for its progress in reducing emissions.\n\nPayments for results generated from 2020/2021 onward will be based on a mutually agreed updated MRV protocol.\n\n“The first results-based contribution will amount to USD 56 million for verified emission reductions in the forest year” 2016/2017, or August 2016 through July 2017, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and Environment said in a press statement. “Additional results-based contributions will be [made] annually as emission reductions are verified for subsequent years.”\n\nThe new partnership differs in scope from the previous Indonesia-Norway REDD+ agreement, according to Indonesia’s environment minister Siti.\n\n“It is not just about the result-based contribution agreement, it encompasses a broader engagement on climate and forest issues in Indonesia,” she said at the press conference. “The MOU is also to emphasize the importance of deliverable, tangible and direct benefits for the community, and for the progress of Indonesia.”\n\nTo prevent this new deal from being abruptly terminated like the last one, it will be based on mutual respect and mutual understanding, complete with an MRV protocol that’s mutually agreed on by the two countries, said Dida Migfar Ridha, the head of foreign partnerships at Indonesia’s environment ministry.\n\n“This [partnership] is built together in accordance to Indonesia’s characteristics. For instance, we’re based on local community and Indigenous peoples, [and] we have internal regulations [on those issues],” he said on the sidelines of the press conference. “What’s most important is mutual trust and respect by paying attention to existing regulations, especially since [the new partnership] is carried out in Indonesia.”\n\nBanner image: Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).

Coconut trees and chili plants, flooded with salt water, are all dead. The farmers’ fish ponds fail, the water getting so high that the fish swim over the nets. And trash carried by the tides float in and out of homes with doors that no longer can be shut.\n\nOn the northern coast of Central Java, Indonesia, villages are hit hard as sea levels rise, one of many effects of climate change. Many homes have been “raised” with cement or dirt several times over in an effort by occupants to keep dry. Others can only be accessed when the tide is low, trapping people inside for hours at a time.\n\nMany villagers have fled the area, becoming climate migrants seeking new lives in places that are drier and higher above sea level.

When The AP first visited the village in November of last year, 11 homes were still occupied. By July 2022 that number dwindled to five, including Zuriah.\n\nZuriah says she’s on a list to receive aid from the government, but nothing has happened so far. She’s been told to be patient.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLiving in the home has meant learning to adapt. Inside, she points to the electrical socket that’s been moved up several times on the wall to decrease the risk of electrocution when there’s high tides. The wall bears water marks that show how high the water gets, sometimes less than a foot below the latest electric socket position.\n\nZuriah’s daughter now lives with relatives outside the village so it’s easier for her to attend school. She says her daughter worries about her, but that she tells her that she must get an education so she can chase her dreams.\n\n___\n\nDwi Ulfani, 18 - Timbulsloko\n\nWhen talking about whether she wants to move away from her flooded village, Dwi Ulfani begins to cry.\n\nUlfani and her family have been living in the flooded family home as long as she can remember.

She says that when they moved here the water wasn’t like this; You could still ride motorcycles along the main road through the village, and the water level always went back down to normal.\n\nBut as time went by, Wahyuni noticed that the water often did not recede, resulting in more flooded days for their home. They decided to do what they could to elevate their home above the water — adding layers of concrete at first, eventually building a permanent wooden level above the water. Despite this, the water still comes into the house occasionally. Still, if they hadn’t raised the house, they’d be neck-deep in water, says Wayuni.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTheir 3-year-old son Bima sits in Sadewa’s lap. While Wahyuni, who grew up in the village, remembers playing in rice fields, watching adults harvest corn and seeing snakes glide through the grass, her son Bima won’t have the same experiences in the village. She says he will have to adjust, but she also hopes he has the opportunity to live elsewhere by the time he he grows up.\n\n“I’m worried that every year the water will get higher. But we don’t have any resources,” she says. “If we had resources, we would move out.”\n\n___\n\nKumaison, 60 - Timbulsloko\n\nKumaison remembers the time she cried when a bad flood washed away the 400,000 Indonesian rupiah (US$27) she had been saving. Other items, like clothes and furniture, could be cleaned and repaired. But the money was gone forever.\n\nGrowing up in the village as a young girl, Kumaison says she remembers her neighbors’ rice fields and shrimp ponds as a thriving business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut now, “Everything is gone, can’t harvest shrimp or fish. It’s changed everyone’s livelihoods,” she says.\n\nKumaison says her home has been raised with concrete and dirt three times now, each time being followed by even higher flooding. In the flooded front yard, villagers have helped her build nets that help catch trash, preventing it from floating into her home. She has trouble sleeping at night, worried that the floods will get even higher in the middle of the night.\n\nKumaison’s son lives in a village close by and has offered that she move in with him. But despite her worries, Kumaison says she doesn’t want to leave, as she enjoys the company of friends and the community that she’s known for decades.\n\n___\n\nMunadiroh, 46 - Mondoliko\n\nWater-damaged books lay drying on the elevated wooden terrace of Munadiroh’s home, while a floating white tub used to transport items in the water is tethered nearby. With no land left in the village, two chickens rustle in a tree nearby, causing the only audible noise in the entire village.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe village has gotten quiet since nearly every family left due to constant flooding. Even the local mosque, where Munadroh’s husband served as a cleric, has stopped the trademark calls to prayer that would usually play five times a day.\n\nWith no other home or financial resources to move, Munadiroh and her family stay in the village. Her child, grade-school age, makes the long journey to school by wading through the water and riding in a boat several times a week. Sometimes the home still floods, and Munadiroh says she keeps working to dry as many things as she can in the sunlight each day.\n\n___\n\nSudarto, 63 and Turiah, 34 - Timbulsloko\n\nSudarto lays on the bed in his flooded home, stepping into water to walk out on to the terrace. On the wall are water lines, some up to 30 centimeters (1 foot) that show how high the floods have gotten in his already-elevated home.\n\nTuriah, his adult daughter, lives in the home with him. Born with a physical disability that prevents her from walking, she spends her days sitting in the home’s front window on an elevated wooden platform.\n\nLike many homes in the village, the windows are partially immersed in the sea water that is a permanent fixture inside. In some areas, barnacles and mold rings cling to the walls. Personal items, such as a refrigerator, clothes and an old clock, are kept on wooden platforms elevated above the water from the rising sea level.\n\n___\n\nMar’iah, 70 - Timbulsloko\n\nMar’iah sits in a chair at the end of the village’s elevated walkway, her flooded wooden home not far behind her. A widower, Mar’iah lives alone with no one to help care for her daily needs.\n\nWith most trees dead from the sea’s saltwater, there’s no shady place she can sit outside her home unless she’s willing to wade through flooded water.\n\nIn a soft voice, Mar’iah explains that she sits in the chair every day waiting until her house is dry enough to enter again. Unlike neighboring villages, there’s no dirt left in the village that could be used to help elevate the home’s floor. Wooden platforms used to previously elevate the house have already flooded and remain underwater.\n\nMar’iah’s remaining neighbors say they have heard that a nearby village has received government aid, but help has not come to Timbulsloko.\n\n___\n\nSuratmi and Ngatiroh, - Timbulsloko\n\nNgatiroh says that after her mother Suratmi’s home collapsed due to flooding, she moved her into the windowless, dirt-floor home that they now share. Damp, moldy air hangs in the room as Ngatiroh walks through it while her mother lays on a bed in the living room.\n\nNgatiroh’s home has not been spared from the floods either though, she says. They’ve used layers of dirt to try and raise the floor high enough to keep dry the mattress that Suratmi lays on throughout the day. The home’s kitchen has permanent standing water, while chickens use the back room as their grazing ground since the backyard disappeared to floods long ago.\n\nNgatiroh says that she wants to move to a new, drier home, but the family lacks the financial resources. Instead, she says, she will just keep adding layers of dirt to rise their home above the rising water, trying to keep her aging mother safe.\n\n___\n\nWahidah, 55 - Timbulsloko\n\nSitting on the porch of house she was born in, Wahidah and her friends chat as they avoid the heat of the sun.\n\nShe recalls how when she was little she would see buffalo roam through the village’s fields where rice, corn and chilis would grow. Some neighbors kept fish ponds filled with catfish they could sell at the market or eat themselves.\n\n“Everything we needed was here,” she says.\n\nShe remembers how the water began to rise. The fields and trees all died from the salt water. All the buffalo were sold as there began to be no land to safely keep them. Even the fish ponds failed, the water getting so high the fish could jump over the netted walls. Eventually the graveyard became flooded, with the dead being buried further away.\n\n“It’s just like the ocean here now,” she says.\n\nThese days, a man comes on a boat during the week to sell them the things they used to be able to grow or raise for themselves. Houses have collapsed around them.\n\nWahidah says she knows about 40 people who have left, moving to other parts of Java that haven’t permanently flooded yet.\n\n“I think the younger generation should move. If they have money they should buy land. But I don’t have money right now, so I stay,” she says.\n\n___\n\nSukarman, 73 - Timbulsloko\n\nCrabs scuttle through the water where Sukarman’s yard used to be.\n\nSukarman has lived in the village for most of his life, working as a handyman and staying close to his family. He’s raised his house and the land around it two times, but the floods still come into the house. He says he gave up trying to raise the land again.\n\n“We’ve already done it twice and it hasn’t worked, so what else can we do?” he says.\n\nHe says the government has helped with donations of food and advice on where villagers might be able to move. But the government hasn’t been able to stop the flooding.\n\nSukarman thinks younger people, such as his granddaughter Dwi Ulfani, should move away if they can. But he knows that with no money or other family homes, he’s likely to spend the rest of his life living in an increasingly flooded home.\n\n“What am I supposed to do?” he asks. “I’m old. There’s nothing I can do.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP’s climate initiative here.

    "More to Life Than Inflation? Indonesia Is Just Asking": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThese are inauspicious times to be challenging the primacy of fighting inflation. Yet that is precisely what Indonesia, an emerging market icon that constantly frets about the strength and durability of capital flows, is contemplating. It doesn’t have to end in tears — if managed well. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight With consumer prices escalating around the world, it’s a brave nation that asks its central bank to do much more than contain the cost of living. Policy makers have been chastised for not acting sooner, and more forcefully, to rein in inflation. Ominous noises are rumbling in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada about altering mandates to sharpen the focus on prices. Would it be a tragedy if a big developing country struck out in the opposite direction?\n\nIt would certainly be ironic, given that Bank Indonesia was remade along western lines after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. BI’s official job is defined by the quest for price and currency stability. Lawmakers in Jakarta have chafed that the framework is too narrow and are making another run at broadening the central bank’s remit to support jobs and growth as well. Also under consideration is enshrining a form of debt monetization — the direct purchase of bonds from the government — in the bank’s charter. Jakarta took such a step during the pandemic, billing it as a temporary measure aimed at buttressing state coffers in a time of crisis. It was initially contentious, but Southeast Asia’s largest economy suffered no real run on its currency or investor flight. In other words, they got away with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the possibility of adjustments to BI’s directives first surfaced in 2020, they met with some outcry. They would compromise independence, tut-tutted critics, overlooking that some banks considered the global benchmarks such as the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, had labor or growth mandates. Though let’s not forget that then, inflation was low and thought likely to stay that way. Central banks with dual mandates were praised for their Midas touch. It seemed unfair to turn on Indonesia for wanting to go down the same route.\n\nNow, with inflation resurgent and public health crises still lingering, the role and shape of central banks is up for grabs. Did officials spend too much time chasing historic lows in unemployment only to store up problems for later? Are ambitions to reduce racial and gender disparities in the labor market really something that monetary institutions should worry about? The idea that attentiveness to climate change be part of their portfolios and included in stress tests of lenders remains controversial.\n\nLiz Truss, the UK’s likely next prime minister, has talked vaguely about changing the law so that the Bank of England is more devoted to inflation-busting. The performances of the Reserve Bank of Australia and its New Zealand counterpart are under review by outside panels. You can interpret the maneuvering in Indonesia as part of a broader tussle about the scope of central bank power and where it ought to applied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Joko Widodo has endorsed the thrust of the mooted reforms, so some change is likely. The next question is how to translate these mandates. BI has an inflation target of between 2% and 4%; price gains are exceeding that and interest rates are climbing. Further tightening is anticipated. Most inflation targets have a “2” in them somewhere. Few — if any — have a number attached to the jobless rate or gross domestic product. They tend to be vague, which can be good. It gives monetary chiefs some leeway.\n\nJokowi promised during his first five-year term to boost GDP growth toward 7% from the average rate of about 5%, where it remains stuck as he enters the home stretch of his second term. Maybe BI just needs to be seen to acknowledge that it has some role in keeping that prospect alive, even if it isn’t achieved. Or at least, not be seen to stand in the way. As a last resort, there is always the piggy-bank of bond purchases.\n\nWith its natural wealth highly unequally shared among a population of 270 million scattered across some 17,000 islands, Indonesia may not exactly be a template for the rest of the world. But the arguments will be heard elsewhere as the social and business costs of returning inflation to comfortable levels bite. Autonomy for central banks, a rallying cry for decades, is still the base case. But look for that orthodoxy to come under duress. Over to you, Jakarta.

    "Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman’s Travel to Jakarta, Indonesia": "The below is attributable to Acting Spokesperson Shejal Pulivarti:‎\n\nOn September 9-10, Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman visited Jakarta, Indonesia to underscore the United States’ enduring partnership with the government and people of Indonesia. She met with the USAID Mission staff to celebrate USAID’s long track record of shared successes with Indonesia in promoting education; health; governance; gender equality and equity; economic growth; and environmental protection. The Deputy Administrator also met with USAID Indonesia’s locally-employed staff and thanked them for their dedicated support for the Indonesian people.

    "Indonesia’s push to reach net zero emissions can help power a new phase in its economic development": "Indonesia has a viable path to reaching its target of net zero emissions by 2060, bringing major benefits to its citizens in the process such as more secure and affordable energy supplies, according to a new IEA report released today. But key policy reforms and international support will be crucial to the success of the clean energy transition in the world’s fourth most populous country as it enters a new phase of its economic development.\n\nThe IEA’s Energy Sector Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions in Indonesia – a collaborative project undertaken with the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) at the request of the Government of Indonesia – was launched today at the G20 Energy Transitions Ministerial Meeting in Bali under Indonesia’s first G20 Presidency. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol and Indonesia’s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif also signed a Joint High-Level Statement that sets out a shared vision of Indonesia’s path to net zero, drawing on the Roadmap’s findings.\n\nIndonesia’s economic development over the past half century has been a remarkable success story, lifting millions of people out of poverty and bringing electricity to almost all citizens across the country’s 17 000 islands. Access to affordable supplies of energy from the country’s abundant resources as well as revenues from fossil fuel exports have been important drivers of this success.\n\nToday, the clean energy transition offers huge opportunities for the next chapter of Indonesia’s development as it seeks to become an advanced economy by 2045. According to the IEA Roadmap, many of the ingredients for reaching net zero emissions and advanced economy status are the same: innovation, knowledge, technology, and economic diversification.\n\nFor instance, Indonesia’s export revenues from critical minerals, which are needed for many clean energy technologies, are set to be greater in 2030 than its largest ever export revenues from coal. And even bigger opportunities exist if Indonesia can capture more of the clean energy value chain. At the same time, the clean energy transition and economic diversification will have significant impacts on Indonesia’s coal-producing regions, demanding attention from policy makers to ensure a fair and people-centred transition.\n\nThe IEA Roadmap shows that by reaching net zero by 2060, Indonesia would reduce total household energy bills as a share of income from today’s level. For the country’s economy as a whole, the pathway to net zero by 2060 would lower oil import bills by one-third in 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario. This saving on oil imports would by itself cover the extra cost the transition would require in terms of new investments – meaning that the transition would effectively pay for itself. An even more ambitious transition by Indonesia and other countries around the world, as envisaged in the IEA’s global Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, would yield even greater savings, the analysis shows.\n\n\"Indonesia has the opportunity to show the world that even for a country that relies heavily on fossil fuel exports, a pathway to net zero emissions is not only feasible but also beneficial,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “We must be clear-eyed about the challenges, especially in areas that depend on the coal industry, but the economic opportunities more than compensate for the costs.”\n\n“This Roadmap – which reflects the IEA’s status as the global authority and was conducted hand-in-hand with my Ministry – sets out a clear and achievable path forward, based on energy efficiency, renewables and electrification,” said Indonesia’s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif. “This demonstrates that a transition to net zero in Indonesia can be just, affordable and rich with opportunities.”\n\nThe IEA report stresses that the technologies Indonesia needs for the initial steps in its journey to net zero – such as energy efficiency solutions, solar, wind and electric vehicles – are already commercially available today and cost-effective, provided that the right policies are put in place.\n\nEnforcing energy performance standards, especially for air conditioners, and supporting electrification of transport and cooking are essential to lower energy costs and emissions at the same time. Indonesian homes are set to add another 20 million air conditioners by 2030, shifting to the best available technologies could avoid annual electricity demand equivalent to the output of around 10 coal power plants.\n\nDriving rapid expansion of renewables, especially solar, demands an immediate and sustained policy push. Solar projects in Indonesia are currently more than twice as costly as those in similar emerging market countries. But costs can be brought down by introducing transparent and competitive tariffs and a predictable project pipeline. At the same time, by allowing coal plants to operate more flexibly and remunerating them for it, Indonesia can reduce power system costs by more than 5% and help free up the space in the power system that needs to go to renewables.\n\nTo achieve net zero by 2060, Indonesia will need to almost triple energy investment by 2030 from today’s level. That means an extra USD 8 billion in investment a year by the end of this decade compared with the level in a business-as-usual pathway. Mobilising that additional financing will hinge on policy reforms and international financial support for which Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JET-P), as endorsed by G7 Leaders at their Summit in June, can provide a framework. International cooperation will also be critical to bring technologies such as nuclear power, hydrogen and carbon capture to market in Indonesia and to reduce costs.\n\n“As a long-term and steadfast partner to Indonesia, the IEA is committed to continuing to provide leading analysis and practical solutions to help Indonesia achieve its energy and climate goals,” said Dr Birol. “I call on Indonesia’s international partners to do their part by mobilising clean energy finance through a Just Energy Transition Partnership and ensuring much needed technology transfers. The results will bring major benefits for both Indonesia and the world.”"
