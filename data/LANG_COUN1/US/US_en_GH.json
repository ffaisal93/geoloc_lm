It’s wonderful to see Ghanaian and American artists share this global stage. Our commitments tonight for Ghana affirm African agency, strengthen partnerships, and catalyze economic growth and opportunities. The United States Government will work with Congress to provide $138 million in new funding to support human capital development in health, education, climate, and peacebuilding — and all of our investments will adhere to principles of gender equality, women’s empowerment, and inclusive development.\n\nAdditionally, through implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, the U.S. Government will work across Coastal West Africa to promote inclusive economic growth and accountable governance, and prevent conflict. We’re providing more than $30 million in initial funding to launch this regional initiative and will work with Congress to substantially increase funding over the next decade.\n\nWe commit to creating new professional exchanges with a special focus on shared U.S. and Global Citizen priorities; and will further advance women’s economic empowerment by expanding Ghana’s Academy for Women Entrepreneurs.\n\nFinally, Peace Corps Ghana will increase the number of volunteers in agriculture, education, and health – continuing decades of collaboration that began in 1961 when the very first Peace Corps Volunteers in the world launched the global program in Ghana.",

REUTERS/Francis Kokoroko\n\nACCRA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Ghana's economy expanded 4.8% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022, driven by growth in the fishing, manufacturing and education services sectors, data from the country's statistics service said on Tuesday.\n\nThe gold- and cocoa-producing nation, which said in July it would seek IMF support as its balance-of-payments position deteriorated, recorded 4.2% growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nEconomic growth came in at 3.3% in the first quarter of this year, less than half the 7% growth seen in the last quarter of 2021 as the West African nation battled runaway inflation, a depreciating local currency and high public debt.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"The sharp decline we recorded in the last quarter has been marginally reversed,\" government statistician Samuel Kobina Annim said during a press conference.\n\nThe government has blamed its woes on a combination of forces, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, as well as U.S. and Chinese economic slumps.\n\nAnnim cautioned against seeing recent growth as a reversal of fortunes, however.

    "Q&A: Ghana captain Ayew on team’s chances at Qatar World Cup": "Ghana’s captain tells Al Jazeera about the team’s preparation and chances at the World Cup as well as the determination he wants from his players.\n\nDoha, Qatar – Ghana’s national football team captain Andre Ayew is confident that the Black Stars will be a tough team to beat at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on November 20.\n\nThe Ghana squad has to be fit in order to put on the performance he’s hoping for, Ayew, who plays for Al Sadd football club in Qatar’s capital Doha, emphasised.\n\nAfter missing the 2018 tournament, the Black Stars qualified for this year’s event, where they are in the same group as South Korea, Portugal and Uruguay, the team that knocked them out of the 2010 edition in South Africa.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Ayew about the national side’s preparation, chances and expectations, as well as the benefit of his experience playing in Qatar.\n\nAl Jazeera: The World Cup is less than two months away. How is the Black Stars’ preparation?\n\nAyew: Everything is in place for us to have a successful World Cup. We must have the best preparation possible but, most importantly, all of your players must be fit at that time. We played Brazil, we’ll play Nicaragua and Switzerland before the World Cup. They are all big games that will be tough even though they are friendlies.\n\nThese matches are beneficial because we put ourselves to the test and come back as a team to maintain bonding and unity. Normally, we have two to three weeks before the World Cup, but this time we only have about nine days. It’s not ideal but we have to adapt.\n\nAl Jazeera: What are Ghana’s chances of reaching the knockout stage from the so-called “Group of Death”?\n\nAyew: We have a chance. Nobody sees us as favourites, which is expected. So we know we’re not going into any of the matches as favourites but we’re there to fight and make an impact. No doubt it will be a very difficult group for every team and all we have to do is be ready, focused, determined, full squad and have a bit of luck.\n\nIf we have our full squad, we can seriously disrupt a lot of teams. I am not concerned because I know what Ghana is capable of.\n\nAl Jazeera: Will the game between Ghana and Uruguay be a revenge mission after the heartbreak of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa?\n\nAyew: As team leader, I don’t believe we should view this game as revenge. Instead, we must be smart enough to recognise that it is a match we need points from. We can’t ignore history, but what Luis Suarez [Uruguay footballer] did is something I could have done in the same situation [used his hand to stop a goal-bound shot in 2010]. It hurt us all. But that’s part of football and it happened years ago.\n\nWe just want to win against Uruguay after everything that has been said in the media. As a player, if you go into a game with the intent of retaliation, you can make a lot of mistakes and be hyper. We just need to stay calm, follow the plan and try to win the game, or do whatever we can to advance to the next stage.\n\nAl Jazeera: What are Ghanaians’ expectations of the Black Stars in the World Cup? Can they be met?\n\nAyew: Ghanaians expect tenacity, determination and a willingness to die for the jersey. When you come to the World Cup, you face super-strong sides and we’ve shown over time that we can compete with them and, in some cases, beat them.\n\nBut compete and show that you are willing to die for your country. If it results in a satisfactory outcome, thank God. If it does not, as long as the entire nation feels they have represented the country and Africa in the right way, that is the most important thing for me.\n\nWe are in the World Cup not only to showcase Ghanaian football, but Africa as well. Because there are only five African representatives, all teams will receive African support whenever they play and this is how we should always be behind our own fellow brothers in order to make history in this tournament.\n\nDuring the African Cup of Nations, we are all fighting for our countries, but during the World Cup, we are all fighting for the continent. Also, if we can present a good image of Africa on the field and compete against the top teams, everyone will be pleased.\n\nAl Jazeera: Should Africa have more slots at a World Cup starting from 2026?\n\nAyew: If we have more teams, that will be fantastic. It’s about time. We have the most countries, but we are underrepresented, and the African qualifiers are always difficult and stressful. We have a lot of big teams, and the expectations are high, so it will be difficult for all of the big teams to qualify with only five slots.\n\nIf we can secure more berths, we will have a better chance of seeing an African team reach the semi-finals or even win the World Cup.\n\nAl Jazeera: What are your thoughts on the new players who have switched allegiance to play for the Black Stars? Will they strengthen the team?\n\nAyew: The players are good, and qualifying for the World Cup makes you very attractive. Why not let the boys come? The door is open for any Ghanaian who wants to play for and help the country, but you must come with the same determination you put into your club, the same desire, and you cannot expect everything in your European club to be the same in the national team because there is a time for the team to adapt.\n\nI fully support them and wish them the best of luck, especially when you come with a strong desire to succeed. When you have the right attitude and desire to sweat for the Ghana jersey, I am more than willing to welcome you, even though I am not the coach but a longtime member of the team.\n\nThe newcomers are talented, but we already have a strong team that qualified for the World Cup, so every position is competitive. Apart from senior players who may have an advantage, I believe no one is guaranteed a place in the squad just yet. Everyone must prove their quality on the field and everyone has a chance, giving the coach more options and solutions, formations, and I believe it is beneficial to have new players with the right mentality.",
    "Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has hiked rates by 850 bps in the past year but that has not helped stop a slide in its currency which has been one of the worst performing emerging market currency, having lost over half its value this year.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.",
    "As global economic crises ‘pile up’, Ghanaian leader says it's time for urgent attention": "President Akufo-Addo’s address to the Assembly’s 77th annual high-level debate centered largely on the issue of global economic challenges and the need of performative solutions for the African economies.\n\nThe global economic crisis\n\nRecalling that COVID-19 had pushed Africa into the worst recession for half a century, he said: “The World Bank observed, last Thursday, that the global economy was enduring its steepest slowdown since 1970. Two years ago, our world came to a thundering halt, as we cowered from a health pandemic from an unknown, malicious virus, coupled with a devastating global economic pandemic. High budget deficits were no longer a concern of only developing nations.”\n\nReferring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that aggravated an already difficult situation, he added, “Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa.”\n\nSeveral African countries had inflation rates surging three to four times higher than what they were just two years ago. Ghana was experiencing the highest inflation for 21 years, he stated.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo highlighted that the international financial architecture was skewed significantly against developing and emerging economies like Ghana. He noted that “the tag of Africa as an investment risk is little more than, in substance, a self-fulfilling prophecy created by the prejudice of the international money market, which denies us access to cheaper borrowing, pushing us deeper into debts”, thus underscoring the necessity for reform of the system.\n\nA watershed moment, indeed\n\nThe Ghanaian President stated: “We do not have the luxury of being able to pick and choose which big problem to solve. None of them can wait; the economic turbulence requires urgent and immediate solution; the turmoil and insecurity in many parts of the world require urgent attention; and so does the need to tackle the problems posed by climate change.”\n\nHe also referred to the security situation in the area of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and expressed disappointment over the fact that all of Ghana’s neighbors had suffered terrorist attacks, and some have lost territorial space to the invading forces. At the same time, he determined to reverse these unfortunate developments.\n\n‘United States of Africa’\n\nRemembering Ghana’s first President, Kwame Nkrumah, who would have been 113 years old today, he recalled driving force of De Nkrumah’s political career, which was to contribute to the birth of a united Africa, or a ‘United States of Africa’.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo told the world leaders that “Africa is ready for business. Africa needs you and you need Africa. You need Africa because Africa is busily building the world’s largest single market of 1.3 billion people.” He went on to add that Africa is the new frontier for manufacturing, for technology, for food production.\n\nHe concluded by calling on the investor community to support the roll-out of Africa’s lucrative agro-industry, and for the community to see agrobusiness in Africa, more of an opportunity, rather than the perceived, exaggerated risk which according to him has been false but the dominant narrative.",

    "Hydro potential in Ghana said to be limited": "Ghana has moved from 100 percent hydro capacity to a mix that is currently dominated by thermal sources of 63 percent, Mr. Abdul Noor Wahab, Manager Generations and Systems Planning, Volta River Authority has stated.\n\nHe said Ghana’s generation at the end of 2021 was dominated by natural gas followed by hydro, liquid fuel, and others adding that the country’s major cost driver remained natural gas.\n\nSpeaking on the topic: “Ghana’s Energy Generation Mix and the Future Outlook,” at Gas Accountants Business Summit organized by Energy Sector Recovery Programme (ESRP), Mr Wahab said the potential of hydro was limited.\n\nHe explained that after Pwalugu’s 60 megawatts, Juale-90MW, and Western River’s about 340MW, available hydro potential in the country was limited.\n\nHe said there was potential for solar in almost every part of the country adding that its potential on average was at 15 to 18 percent capacity factor without battery storage.\n\nMr Wahab however noted that, the cost of generation would increase significantly when four to six hours of battery storage was added.\n\nHe said wind potential was limited as the best wind speeds was along the cost, noting that cost of generation from wind could be 10 US cents/kWh if funding at five percent or lower were available.\n\nMr Wahab said thermal had the highest prospect, easy to deploy, had combined cycles that required water for cooling and could now be cooled by air, in addition to having competitive cost.\n\nHe said nuclear also had a potential to play an important role but has high capital cost which was likely to affect its quantity in future generation mix and thermal generation would dominate by 2040 with a component of about 88 percent of the mix.\n\nThe Gas Accountants’ Business Summit was organised to discuss the natural gas business in Ghana and its related issues to achieve a financially sustainable energy sector.\n\nThe summit was on the theme; “The Role of Natural Gas on Ghana’s Sustainable Future,” brought together accountants, lawyers, commercial experts, and other professionals within the energy sector.\n\nOther presentations during the summit covered the Cash Waterfall Mechanism’s concept, accounting and implementation, Public Utility Regulatory Commission (PURC), natural gas prospects for economic transformation, the future of Africa Gas in the global economy, and the outlook of ECG’s billing processes, and many others.\n\nSource: GNA",

    "Ghana: Crackdown on black market may not halt cedi’s fall": "More than 70 people were rounded up and a stash of currencies seized during the special operation across obscure areas around Makola and Tudu in the Ghanian capital. It is the central bank’s biggest bust in more than five years.\n\nThe head of Forex Exchange Bureau at the Bank of Ghana, Adjoa Konadu Torto, told journalists that the suspects were operating unlicensed forex businesses that have significantly contributed to weakening the local currency.\n\n“This special operation is part of the bank’s strategies to sanitise the foreign exchange market and we’re targeting people buying and selling foreign exchange without a licence from the Bank of Ghana,” she said.\n\nThe cedi has fallen 39% against the US dollar since January 2022. The central bank hiked rates three times in March, May and August, with the Monetary Policy Rate currently standing at 22%.\n\nHowever, the tightening cycle has hardly reversed the trend. According to Ghana’s statistical service, inflation hit a 21-year high of 33.9% in August, up from 31.7% in July partly due to the cedi’s steep slide.\n\nUnrealistic rates\n\nCentral bank officials say black market trading, which is very popular in Accra, leads to speculation over the exchange rate, and thus destabilises the cedi’s value.\n\nArresting the illegal operators is not sustainable\n\nJames Dzansi, an economist at the International Growth Centre, tells The Africa Report that raiding the black market will not stabilise the local currency for long.\n\nAfrica Insight Wake up to the essential with the Editor's picks.

If the exchange rate was reflecting the true value of the cedi, the illegal market [would] not be vibrant.”\n\nThe dollar is traded at GH¢9.5 ($0.92) in most commercial banks and at lower rates in forex bureaus. On the black market, the greenback is traded at GH¢10.5.\n\n“Arresting the illegal operators is not sustainable. In the short term, there can be some impact, but going forward, let’s reduce the gap between the official and the parallel market rates,” says Dzansi.\n\nRegulatory constraints\n\nAt the Rawlings Park in the central business district, Kojo Nsiah, a small business owner, says he prefers the black market to the interbank not only for the higher rates, but also to avoid regulatory constraints.\n\n“The black market offers better rates. These people are well connected so they can easily help you get as much money as you want to change,” Nsiah tells The Africa Report. “The challenge is the possibility of fake notes, but I have a trusted person I deal with here so that isn’t a problem.”\n\nThe Bank of Ghana will carry out raids in different parts of the country as it continues to “educate the general public on forex rules and regulations, including the need to avoid the black market”, says Konadu Torto.\n\nThe central bank’s monetary policy committee is assessing the impact of its previous efforts to keep the cedi stable, and may announce amended measures in October.",

    "Local community rejects Ghana cedi": "The people of Wuru, a deprived community in the Sissala East Municipality of the Upper West Region are not using the Ghana cedi, the official currency of Ghana as its medium of exchange due to depreciation of the Ghana cedi and other compelling factors.\n\nThe only way they accept the cedi as medium of exchange or legal tender is to receive the money in CFA equivalent when selling their products.\n\nThe community, with a population of more than 3,000, transacts business with neighbouring Burkina-Faso and accepts the CFA as the legal tender for convenience.\n\nThey trade in livestock, cereals and sheanut as well as fowls.\n\nMaize, millet, and sesame are the major crops produced in the area.\n\nWurupio Mahama Bataachia Dawuri IV, the chief of the area speaking to the GNA, said there was nothing wrong with spending a foreign currency in the area since they do not recognize themselves as Ghanaians because they have been neglected, and do not benefit from government projects.\n\nHe attributed the problem to among other things, poor road infrastructure, depreciation of the Ghana cedi and increases in prices of petroleum products as well as Burkinabes being their only business partners.\n\nThe community, about 70 kilometres from Tumu borders Burkina-Faso and speaks only Kassem, the language of Navrongo and other Kassena Nankana communities of the Upper East Region.\n\nIt took the GNA more than three hours on a motorbike from Tumu to the community due to the deplorable nature of the road, which a vehicle cannot access.\n\nThe GNA visited the Sissala East Municipality to see problems facing the people and to report on them for assistance by state actors.\n\nWurupio Dawuri explained that the Ghana Cedi and the CFA were spent concurrently, but that the people stopped accepting the Ghanaian currency due to depreciation and high fuel prices.\n\nThe chief said the Wuru community is only remembered during elections, where politicians come to “deceive” them for their votes.\n\nHe said: “We consider ourselves as being in a neutral zone. We do not know whether we belong to Ghana or Burkina-Faso because nobody cares about us,” and that they appealed for support over the years that were ignored.\n\nHe explained that they have been compelled by circumstances to ignore the Ghana Cedi since they could not convey their produce to any of the Ghanaian communities for sale because of lack of roads and transportation.\n\n“People come here to tell us that it is illegal for us to spend the CFA other than the cedis. We also tell them it is not our fault because the only way for us to survive is to accept the CFA since all the goods come from Burkina-Faso,” he said.\n\nHe expressed concern about the inability of the National Identification Authority (NIA) to register and get the Ghana Card for them due to lack of network service in the area for registration.\n\nWurupio Dawuri said it was important for the government to ensure that the Wuru community gets good roads to be linked to the rest of Ghana to ensure the people belong to Ghana and to enjoy the national cake.\n\nHe also appealed for water, communication network and security in the area since they cannot defend themselves from terrorists’ attacks.\n\nMr. Yakubu Fuseini Batong, the Sissala East Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) said the Tumu-Kunchokor-Wuru road had been awarded and that construction would soon start.\n\nHe said efforts were being made to construct and repair broken bridges on the Wuru road.\n\nSource: GNA",

    "Digital Financial Inclusion and Security: The Regulation of Mobile Money in Ghana": "The Cybersecurity, Capacity Development, and Financial Inclusion project, or CyberFI, brings together a robust, transparent community of practitioners and researchers working on digital financial inclusion. This series focuses on understanding financial inclusion ecosystems on their own terms—what countries are doing, what is working, and what isn’t. Six country case studies help capture the diversity of financial markets on the African continent: South Africa, Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGhana’s economy, like many others, is still recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.1 Despite this, the mobile money industry in Ghana enjoyed a big boost during the pandemic. In 2018, Ghana launched one of the first interoperable systems in Africa, which allows transactions between different telecom service providers in Ghana; reports reveal that the interoperability-supported payments reached 308 million Ghanaian cedis (GH₵) ($57 million) by 2019.2 Since then, mobile money has risen to become the most popular digital financial service (DFS) in Ghana, and in recent years, Ghana has been identified as one of the biggest mobile money markets and the fastest-growing one in Africa.3 The Bank of Ghana reported in 2021 that mobile money accounts, which numbered 32.7 million in February 2020, grew to number 40.9 million by February 2021.4 Mobile money service provides users with electronic accounts linked to their phone numbers from which they can store, send, and receive money.5 The simplicity of this service coupled with the convenience it offers has made it an ideal DFS solution for many Ghanaians, but there are also many challenges—including cyber crime, the need for infrastructure and digital capacity, and government policies such as the new Electronic Transactions Levy (or “e-levy”) and digital ID systems—that have inhibited digital financial inclusion (DFI).6 This paper discusses the state of DFI in Ghana and the regulatory framework for DFS, with particular attention paid to mobile money services as the major DFS player in the country and to the government’s digital security strategies in relation to DFS.\n\nThe Digital Financial Landscape in Ghana\n\nThe emergence of digital financial services and inclusion in Ghana arguably began when the Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) was established in 2007.7 As a foundation for financial inclusion, GhIPSS, which is an interbank payment and settlement company, was tasked with creating and managing interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and other financial institutions.8 Essentially, it was created to provide the technology to help Ghana become a cashless society.\n\nNnenna Ifeanyi-Ajufo Dr. Nnenna Ifeanyi-Ajufo is an associate professor of law and the head of law at Buckinghamshire New University (United Kingdom). She was previously a law lecturer at Lancaster University (Ghana), where she taught cyber crime.\n\nIn April 2008, GhIPSS rolled out a novel national switch and smart card payment system dubbed e-Zwich.9 E-Zwich is a biometric smart card connected to all financial institutions in Ghana that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money.10 The card was targeted at the unbanked in Ghana, who amounted to a staggering 80 percent of the country’s population at the time.11 Unlike opening a bank account, which required documentation like letters of employment, recommendation and guarantor letters, or proof of address in the form of water or electricity bills, e-Zwich simply requires a user’s fingerprints. E-Zwich cardholders benefit from high security standards through the biometric (fingerprint) client authentication system. Card users were not restricted to banking halls but could transact at any location that had an e-Zwich point of sale (POS) device. The POS devices were available in all banks, some shops, and e-Zwich merchant stalls. The introduction of the e-Zwich system promoted DFI and Ghana’s digital economy, but because of various challenges the e-Zwich began to suffer decline after it commenced operations.12 Some users and merchants began to experience failed transactions and other technological issues at the POS locations, leaving them unable to withdraw money or continue other transactions due to poor and unstable cellular networks on which transactions relied.13 Despite the difficulties with e-Zwich, GhIPSS has continued to play a crucial role for payment systems. All DFS providers in Ghana, from banks and telecom companies to fintech companies, are partnered with GhIPSS. The interoperability that GhIPSS introduced in 2018 made mobile money more seamless, convenient, and cost-effective across all networks.14\n\nA notable catalyst to mobile money’s debut in Ghana was the Branchless Banking Guidelines issued by the Bank of Ghana in 2008 to encourage deposit-taking financial institutions (banks and non-banks) to pursue branchless banking.15 The guidelines were issued with the primary aim of promoting financial inclusion by extending core banking and financial services outside of banking halls to provide these services to the unbanked.16 The Branchless Banking Guidelines also acknowledged that to accomplish branchless banking, financial institutions would need the help of agents to distribute or retail the services offered. Telecommunication companies (telcos) were seen as potential agents, especially for mobile banking.17 The guidelines, however, made the point that the use of agents or third-party service providers did not remove the responsibility of banks to ensure that operating branchless banking does not compromise banking standards.18 Focused on the financial inclusion objective, the guidelines also established that the only permissible model to operate branchless banking was a “many to many model,” which prevents exclusive partnerships between financial institutions and agents.19\n\nAlthough the potential role of telcos was considered in the guidelines, it was limited to that of agents for the financial institutions. It is evident that the Bank of Ghana hoped that financial institutions would pioneer the cause of DFI through branchless banking; instead, the telcos have championed the change and made significant contributions to DFI in Ghana, especially through the introduction and advancement of mobile money services. The good reception mobile money received in the Ghanaian market unarguably influenced the commencement of other digital financial services in the country.\n\nFinancial technology (fintech) is also a growing industry that is offering innovative financial services to Ghanaians. Zeepay Ghana Limited is currently Ghana’s most successful fintech company. Founded in 2014 and wholly Ghanaian-owned, Zeepay received its dedicated electronic money issuer license in 2020.20 Zeepay essentially provides a single wallet in which customers can receive payments via different digital channels like money remittance, bank transfer, and mobile money. Customers can also withdraw from Zeepay agents if they choose. Zeepay, operating in over twenty countries globally, has partnered with all three mobile money operators and some banks for flexible payments, remittances, and transfers, and it is a major DFS player in Ghana. Zeepay is also licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom.21 ExpressPay is another growing fintech player in Ghana that allows users to conveniently pay various types of bills online and to send monies instantly to any bank account, making the tedious process of bank-to-bank transfers much simpler.22 Launched in 2018, Bitsika is also creating a platform that uses digital currencies to move money across borders at low or zero cost. Users can deposit and remit money across multiple currencies using the Bitsika app. By using digital currencies and distributed ledger technology, Bitsika is making cross-border payments instant and auditable at negligible costs.23\n\nThe Growth of Mobile Money as the Leading DFS in Ghana\n\nIn compliance with the Branchless Banking Guidelines, MTN—Ghana’s largest telecommunications service provider—partnered with nine banks and launched mobile money services in July 2009.24 Under the guidelines, it only had the capacity to be an agent of the banks. All mobile money accounts opened with MTN were linked to one of these nine banks. MTN invested heavily in creating awareness of the service by sending merchants to the unbanked and underserved areas of the country to educate about and market mobile money.25 All the merchants who penetrated the unbanked geography of Ghana were from partner banks who had shown interest in those areas. Each mobile money account registered by a merchant represented an account of the bank the merchant worked for. Registering customers and opening accounts, however, presented another hurdle. Customers had to present a valid national ID to be registered, which was a hindrance to the registration process for many.26 Registrations had to be a scheduled event rather than a service that could be undertaken immediately once a customer expressed interest in the service.27 Despite this, some factors made mobile money accounts preferable to traditional bank accounts for the unbanked. They had lesser know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and were less expensive to use.28 Merchants were also more accessible to the unbanked, reaching some rural areas. By October 2009, MTN had about 20,000 registered mobile money subscribers.29 However, MTN could not operate mobile money at the scale and in the manner it wanted because a majority of the operational decisions were made by the partner banks.30\n\nUpon reviewing the Branchless Banking Guidelines, the Bank of Ghana issued the Guidelines for E-Money Issuers and Agent Guidelines in 2015. These guidelines replaced the Branchless Banking Guidelines and set out new protocols for mobile money operations.31 According to the Bank of Ghana, the guidelines were issued as part of its broader strategy to create an enabling regulatory environment for efficient and safe digital payment and funds transfer mechanisms and to “promote the availability and acceptance of electronic money as a retail payment medium with the potential to increase financial inclusion.”32 The E-Money Issuer Guidelines introduced the status of Dedicated Electronic Money Issuer (DEMI), which an institution could obtain by getting a license to issue e-money alongside licensed financial institutions.33 This gave telcos an opportunity to gain the capacity to issue money to customers for transactions without linking each mobile money account to a bank account. The E-Money Issuer Guidelines set out standards of systems and controls as well as technology and security requirements DEMIs should use. It also set out general operational provisions for DEMIs, including types of mobile money accounts, transaction limits, permissible transactions, KYC requirements, capital and liquid fund requirements, and consumer protection principles, among others.34 Many of these requirements and operational rules have been incorporated into the Payment Systems Act 2019 (Act 987), which currently regulates digital financial service providers.\n\nThe Agent Guidelines essentially changed the meaning of “agent” from the meaning outlined in the Branchless Banking Guidelines and provided new operational guidelines to complement the new e-money guidelines and payment systems structure the Bank of Ghana was putting into place. The practical effect of the 2015 guidelines released the telcos from the position of agents and gave them the option to be principals in the relationship. Although telcos are no longer required to be agents of banks, beneficial partnerships still exist between telcos and some banks to facilitate transactions between mobile money accounts and bank accounts and payments for services.\n\nMTN’s success in venturing into mobile money services and the enabling regulatory environment inspired the other mobile networks operators in Ghana to follow suit. Tigo Cash was launched in October 2010, Airtel Money in 2011, and Vodafone Cash in 2015.35 In 2017, Airtel and Tigo merged to create AirtelTigo, which also resulted in .36 By 2019, mobile phones officially became the most-used medium of payment in Ghana due to mobile money and mobile banking.37 Mobile money dominated the landscape with 32.5 million registered accounts (from 23.9 million in 2018) and 13 million active users at the end of 2018 (see figure 1).38\n\nMTN Ghana has made the largest contribution to DFI in Ghana, not only by introducing mobile money but also by providing the largest amount of coverage. MTN Ghana also set up MobileMoney Limited, a subsidiary responsible for mobile financial services. With a market share of over 80 percent since 2017, MTN continues to dominate the mobile money market to date.39 The Ministry of Communications and Digitalisation (MOCD) revealed in 2020 that MTN controlled 75 percent of the telecom market, labeling it a significant market power (SMP).40 The MOCD also revealed that MTN controlled about 94 percent of the mobile money market share, because the other telcos pay interconnect fees to MTN.41 MTN’s SMP designation enables the National Communications Authority (NCA) to enforce the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act 2008, such as setting a price floor or ceiling for associated mobile money costs so as to maintain a competitive market and level the playing field for all telcos.\n\nAirtelTigo, on the other hand, was the result of a merger to create a stronger telecommunications network. However, in 2020, the parent companies of the entity opted to sell their shares to the government.42 Since the sale was completed in November 2021, it remains to be seen whether operating under the government’s management will be to AirtelTigo’s detriment or success. The government’s previous failure to successfully manage the first government-owned telco, Ghana Telecom, resulted in the privatization of Ghana Telecom, which is now Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone Ghana has also made efforts to increase financial inclusion by allowing Vodafone Cash users to send and deposit money without any charges since 2020.43 This initiative was made possible due to mobile money interoperability.44 Vodafone became the first player in the industry to introduce a free peer-to-peer service to enhance commercial advantage and allow for more financial inclusion.\n\nThe Regulatory Environment\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has supervisory and regulatory authority over banks and all other financial institutions, and it oversees their licensing and operation through the various acts of parliament that relate to financial services. The Banking Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana oversees banks while the Other Financial Institutions Supervision Department oversees financial institutions that are not banks. The Payments Systems Department oversees the financial activities and in particular the mobile money operations of telcos. That department also undertakes licensing, monitoring, and onboarding for telcos involved in payment systems.45 The Fintech and Innovations Office oversees payment and financial technology service providers. On the other hand, rather than being overseen by the Bank of Ghana, the telecommunication services provided by telcos are supervised and regulated by the NCA. The NCA regulates telcos by granting licenses for operation, ensuring fair competition among licensees, monitoring the quality of service, setting equipment standards, and mandating safeguard mechanisms.\n\nTo maintain control over the fast-developing financial sector, new and improved legislation has been passed to replace legislation that was determined unsuitable to the current financial services industry. For instance, the Payment Systems Act 2003 (Act 662) was replaced with the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 (Act 987). These acts, along with the Non-Bank Financial Institution Act 2008 (Act 774), have vested the Bank of Ghana with powers to license, regulate, and supervise financial sector developments. Telcos that operate mobile money services are regarded as payment system providers under the Payment Systems Act (Act 987), meaning that their licensing and regulation fall to the Bank of Ghana.46 The Payment Systems Act is the legislation applicable to DFS or payment system services in Ghana. It consolidates the laws relating to payment systems and payment services and regulates institutions which operate payment services and electronic money business. Under the Payment Systems Act, it is a criminal offense to operate a payment service business without a payment service license from the Bank of Ghana.47\n\nIn 2016, Ghana also introduced the Banks and Specialised Deposit-Taking Institutions Act 2016 (Act 930), which regulates institutions that engage in deposit-taking business and consolidates laws relating to deposits. While banks and nonbank institutions engaged in deposit-taking business licensed under Act 930 are not required to obtain a license to operate a payment system, they must apply for and receive authorization from the Bank of Ghana to offer services.48\n\nBesides Act 987, payment service providers (PSPs) are regulated by other legislation, such as the Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 843). Registering with the Data Protection Commission and obtaining a data protection certificate are prerequisites to applying for a PSP license (which in turn is a requirement for businesses to acquire licenses or registration to operate in Ghana). Applicants for a PSP license are additionally required to submit an anti–money laundering policy as part of their application, in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020 (Act 1044). The policy should outline their KYC processes, internal reporting procedures, and measures to ensure compliance with the act.\n\nPSPs also submit a cybersecurity policy as part of their license application to the Bank of Ghana that must comply with the Cybersecurity Act 2020 (Act 1038). The submitted cybersecurity policy must detail key performance indicators or strategies that highlight cybersecurity consciousness. The Cybersecurity Act 2020 also established the Cyber Security Authority to regulate cybersecurity activities in Ghana. The board of the authority is constituted by the ministers of communication, defense, national security, and the interior. For good coordination in cybersecurity incidents, the authority is required to establish sectoral computer emergency response teams (CERTs), including for the banking and finance sector. Based on conversations with sector practitioners, one salient issue is a question of coordination among the sectoral CERTs and the main Cybersecurity Authority; however, the Ghana National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GH), which was formed by the MOCD in August 2014 principally to respond to cyber infractions on government networks, also serves the private sector.49\n\nMost of the legislation highlighted above were passed recently. The DFS sector in Ghana—despite being quite young—has immense potential and is developing quickly; hence, the Bank of Ghana and the government are updating legislation to match developments and ensure secure DFI. Importantly, the acts of parliament that regulate the various financial institutions provide consumer and individual-user protections; the enforcement of these protections is one of the many powers of the Bank of Ghana. Ultimately, the onus falls on the Bank of Ghana and other regulators and enforcement bodies like the Data Commission and the Cybersecurity Authority to ensure that PSPs are compliant with all relevant legislation and regulation.\n\nSecurity in DFS in Ghana and Regulation of Mobile Money Operators\n\nIn 2017, the financial sector in Ghana underwent massive overhaul as banks and other financial institutions that were unlicensed or noncompliant were shut down by the Bank of Ghana.50 Many depositors of the collapsed institutions were heavily affected and were unable to recover their deposits and investments because of the institutions’ mismanagement.51 However, mobile money operations continued. As mobile money grew, fraud began to emerge in the sector. The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications reported 278 mobile money–related fraud cases in 2015 and 388 cases in 2016.52 In April 2021, the chamber mentioned that over 4,000 cases of mobile money fraud were under investigation.53\n\nTable 1 shows some types of mobile money fraud identified in Ghana.54\n\nTypes of Mobile Money Fraud in Ghana TYPE OF FRAUD MEANING 1. Mobile network operator fraud This type of fraud involves employees of telcos and occurs in different forms. Employees can steal from customers' mobile money wallets, transfer customers' money unauthorized, collude with other fraudsters to swap SIM cards , etc. It generally involves a telco employee manipulating a customer's account without authorization. 2. False promotion fraud Prompts are sent under the guise of a telco promotion and the recipient is asked to input their PIN as a verification measure to claim their \"prize.\" The fraudster gains access to the recipient's mobile money account with the PIN that was inputted. 3. Scam messages/reversal of erroneous transactions A fake SMS is sent that indicates a deposit into a customer's account. The fraudster then calls the customer to tell them the deposit was a mistake and to send that amount back. 4. Fortuitous scam Fraudsters pose as delivery companies and call customers under the pretext of delivering goods to them from relatives abroad. Customers will then be instructed to make a deposit to a mobile money account in exchange for delivering the goods.\n\nBy 2017, fraud was not an uncommon occurrence among MTN subscribers.55 It was reported that some MTN agents and staff were themselves accomplices to the fraud.56 Some of the few fraud cases police successfully solved involved the arrest of telco employees.57 Telcos in Ghana have been meticulous in ensuring employees or ex-employees who were caught defrauding or stealing from customers are not associated with them. Names of telecommunication companies are not typically disclosed in articles reporting mobile money fraud because financial institutions fear that they will lose customers when they expose their vulnerabilities.58 This also means that there is a culture of limited information-sharing; lack of reporting in turn causes lack of evidence to aid law enforcement in ensuring mitigation of further attacks. However, fraud cases are acknowledged publicly by the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunication, which is the umbrella association to which all mobile network operators belong.59\n\nWhile many financial institutions are investing in their cyber defenses, unsecure, low-cost mobile and internet devices are still a major source of cyber threats to financial institutions.60 DFS providers are still undertaking diverse individualistic digital security efforts. For example, to curb fraud, MTN has made it mandatory for customers to display a national ID before transacting with any of its agents or merchants. This policy took effect in 2021 amid arguments that it could derail DFI because access to national IDs remains a challenge and that use of IDs for transactions would not help to curb fraud.61\n\nDFS in Ghana Today: Complications Ahead for Inclusion and Security\n\nThe success of mobile money and other financial products offered by Zeepay, Express Pay, and Bitsika represents welcome progress in Ghana’s concerted effort toward DFI. In May 2020, the Ministry of Finance launched the world’s first Digital Financial Services Policy. The policy outlines a vision of DFI.62 Below are features the government aims to see in the Ghanaian digital finance space by 2023:\n\nA holistic digital payment ecosystem for goods and services\n\nDigitized pension payments for all\n\nDigital payment channels maximized by financial services providers\n\nDigitized records for citizens (including record creation, retrieval, and archiving)\n\nSeamless connectivity between government and private institutions\n\nTo accomplish this, the government will work in six areas that it refers to as policy pillars. They are governance, enabling legislation, capacity building, market infrastructure, digital payment use cases, and supporting fintech. Notably, the cybersecurity of DFI is not mentioned either as an aim or a pillar. While it can be argued that cybersecurity in relation to DFI services is implied in the above pillars, the obvious noninclusion can also be interpreted as an omission or a nonprioritization.\n\nGhana’s Electronic Transactions Levy\n\nA new development that raises the question of digital financial exclusion is the recent move by the government of Ghana in November 2021 to include in the reading of its 2022 budget a new tax: the e-levy.63 This tax applies a 1.75 percent levy on electronic transactions, which include inward remittances, bank transfers, merchant payments, and mobile money payments above GH₵100 (approximately $13) commencing February 1, 2022.64 This levy is separate from the fees that telcos already charge customers for transactions. Despite concerns that the e-levy will weaken Ghana’s financial system and slow down the development of e-commerce, the government argued that the e-levy was necessitated by a drive to “widen the tax net,” which would increase the country’s tax to GDP proportion from about 11.3 percent to over 16 percent and serve as a driving force for Ghana’s economy.65\n\nNews of the e-levy was immediately met with great outcry from the public, with panic withdrawals occurring a day after the announcement.66 To warm the public to the idea of the levy, a number of town hall meetings were held in different parts of the country.67 Initially, the Electronic Levy Bill 2021 did not pass Parliament,68 and public protests against it continued.69 Notwithstanding the protests and opposition, Ghana’s parliament approved the e-levy after members of parliament reintroduced the bill.70 The president thereafter signed the e-levy bill into law, effective May 1, 2022. An application for an injunction against the e-levy was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ghana on May 4, 2022, meaning that the controversial e-levy is now in force. While the e-levy is not exclusive to mobile money, mobile money is the biggest and most clearly affected enterprise in the electronic transactions space. For every transaction from one mobile money wallet to any other recipient source, the sender pays an additional 1.75 percent in transaction fees as e-levy. Mobile money is also the reason the e-levy has gained so much media attention, since many Ghanaians increasingly rely on mobile money transactions as a primary means for conducting digital finance.\n\nObjectively, the e-levy can hinder DFI. It has already created the unintended effect of generating not only panic but also user distrust and insecurity, as evidenced by the withdrawals and concerns that fraudsters running social engineering schemes will begin initiating a reversal of the e-levy on mobile money transactions.71 In rural areas especially, many people’s mobile money wallet is the closest thing they have to a bank account. It is the primary means by which they send and receive money. The e-levy will certainly discourage such people from sending taxable amounts and will reduce mobile money transactions and encourage people to use cash if there is no viable alternative.\n\nAnother reason for the pushback on the e-levy is the double taxation it will inadvertently introduce. For example, many employees are paid their salary via mobile money. Paying an additional levy for transactions with money that has been already taxed is burdensome to the average Ghanaian worker. Businesses use merchant mobile money accounts since transactions may involve large sums of money. For enterprises to pay a levy of 1.75 percent—in addition to the usual charges each time a payment above GH₵100 is made—may cause them to reduce transactions and seek a more cost-effective option, which may well be cash. However, the government has assured citizens that it is in talks with the telcos to ensure the combination of the levy and the transaction fees are not burdensome to the public. Regardless, doubts and worries about the levy are far from settled and will inadvertently impact financial inclusion in Ghana.\n\nCyber Incidents Reporting and Information Sharing\n\nAnother curiosity stems from the reporting of fraud incidents. There is a general underreporting of fraud incidents and a dearth of statistics, as highlighted above, as companies typically fear the loss of customers in the wake of disclosing such incidents. It is very common to leave customers to their fate when they report incidences of fraud, thereby passing the burden of security on to consumers and complicating the goal of DFI. Addressing the challenges of fraud was one of the reasons the NCA recently directed all Ghanaians to reregister their SIM cards by presenting their national IDs or Ghana Card to telcos.72 It remains to be seen if the SIM reregistration process will enhance the government’s strategy to police fraud in the financial services sector through filtering SIM cards used for fraudulent purposes.\n\nDigital Identification Systems\n\nDigital identification systems present a challenge for DFI in Ghana.73 Many services in Ghana are dependent on forms of identification that can be digitally verified or authenticated; however, this leaves many Ghanaians, especially those in the rural areas, financially excluded and unable to participate in available digital financial services. The government of Ghana introduced the Ghana Card to document national identity and mandated that from July 1, 2022, it would serve as the only ID document required for all financial transactions with institutions under the authority of the Bank of Ghana. To bolster digital identification, the government also required that all telcos use Ghana Cards to reregister all SIM cards; however, not all Ghanaians have registered for and acquired the Ghana Card.74 Public opinion suggests that the time allotted for the SIM reregistration exercise (October 2021 to March 2022) was overly short and that adequate measures were not put in place to facilitate mass registration while observing appropriate COVID-19 protocols. The National Identification Authority and the NCA have acknowledged that the backlog of unprinted cards, uncollected cards, and duplicate applications warrants a deadline extension.75 At the time of writing, no SIM cards have been deactivated and registration has not been officially ended.\n\nNew telco policies also direct that mobile money transactions require proof of identity for conducting transactions.76 Valid forms of ID include a driver’s license, voter ID, passport, Social Security and National Insurance Trust ID, National Health Insurance card, or Ghana Card (national ID). According to research, Ghanaians without formal ID tend to be the poor and those living in rural areas, where mobile money is their only access to financial services.77 Obtaining and replacing IDs in Ghana is also hampered by bureaucratic processes, which means that new digital ID policies could discourage customers from using mobile money. Linking SIM reregistration to the Ghana Card means that people will be unable to use mobile money services if SIM cards are indeed deactivated for failure to reregister. For enhanced ID policies to advance financial inclusion rather than retard or diminish it, the government must ensure that all Ghanaians are registered for and receive the Ghana Card. There can be no DFI without adequate and efficient identification systems. This will further facilitate interoperability, enabling people to make different payments in a secure manner through single transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nFour challenges continue to hamper digital financial inclusion in Ghana: capacity, skills, trust, and security. To ensure DFI benefits everyone, there is a need to provide more than just access; it is important to equip citizens with the capacity, skills, and trust to go online. Outlined below are areas for improvement within Ghana’s digital financial ecosystem.\n\nIncreased cybersecurity enforcement within digital financial ecosystems to ensure resilience against digital technology–related risks: Cybersecurity is important to ensure DFI. However, the interface between cybersecurity and economic viability remains a complex policy challenge. Domestic policies and regulations on cybersecurity should be enforced while paying due consideration to issues like DFI; for example, the cybersecurity of DFI is not stated as one of the pillars of the trailblazing Ghanaian Digital Financial Services Policy. This is notwithstanding the continued increase in reports of fraudsters targeting mobile money accounts; along with the loss of funds and data, privacy, and security breaches, these incidents risk diminishing trust in digital financial services.78 Ghana’s digital financial policies ought to incorporate cybersecurity if they are to be effective in achieving their lofty goals. Advancing digital inclusion infrastructure: With the rapid expansion of mobile-phone banking in Africa helping to bring financial services to unbanked communities, development efforts to advance infrastructure that will enable the functioning of digital systems should be a priority. Factors such as access to internet and electricity are key success determinants for enhancing DFI. Many of Ghana’s financially excluded live in rural areas without access to internet, electricity, or systems that can function when offline, thereby compounding digital divides. Increasing digital capacity, skills, and trust: Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, digital technology has become, more than ever, a defining tool for the pursuit of work, business, and life across the continent, and importantly, for promoting financial inclusion. The meaningful use of mobile money services requires digital skills, literacy, accessibility, and trust in the digital ecosystem. Digital financial capability is vital to achieving wider policy outcomes such as improving employment, health, education, and economic growth; therefore, government must make DFI part of wider government policy and programs. Government must identify where increasing digital financial capability will improve policy outcomes and integrate it into relevant programs. While enhancing digital capability for citizens, it is important also to enhance cyber trust so that cyber risks will not be perceived to outweigh the benefits of being financially included. For example, since 2017, Ghana has observed National Cybersecurity Awareness Month as an annual event spearheaded by the National Cyber Security Centre of the MOCD to intensify capacity building and awareness creation efforts on cyber hygiene and cybersecurity in Ghana for the general public. Subsequent efforts can embed cross-government digital financial capability and skills programs as part of wider cybersecurity initiatives. Measuring DFI and security through data and research: It is important to agree on a common definition for DFI as well as the identifiers that signify DFI and capabilities. Measuring DFI and the security of services through data and research will provide opportunities for practically implementing and measuring success for the This will also allow government and DFI stakeholders to measure how secure DFI systems are, provide a basis to share best practices across DFI sectors, and further assist DFI providers to design services in a way that understands the capabilities of their service users and enhances security and trust in services. Improving collaboration and partnership: The key regulatory and security issues raised by DFI relate to consumer protection, regulation of digital money and payment systems, cyber fraud policing, anti–money laundering efforts, and measures to counter financing of terrorism.79 While the government continues to play a central role across a range of functions, including regulation, policymaking, and provision of digital infrastructure, effective directing of these issues will require multiple sectoral and stakeholder competencies, which necessitates effective partnership and collaboration.80 For example, activities across other sectors—such as sectoral computer emergency response efforts—should be aligned to government efforts. This will require the Bank of Ghana, the NCA, market regulators, and other relevant authorities to cooperate toward ensuring security of DFS. While Ghanaian financial institutions and telcos continue to collaborate and invest in their sectoral CERTs, Ghanaian authorities must establish clear legal and regulatory standards and guidelines to ensure the safety and security of DFS and further enhance security cooperation among sectoral CERTs. Public-private partnership is an imperative for cybersecurity initiatives according to Article 26 of the African Union Convention of Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.81 Such partnership will further assist in identifying best practice initiatives. It is also important to create a support network to use expertise and resources to assist victims of digital financial fraud. The Bank of Ghana, along with the financial sector and telcos, must also link DFI and cybersecurity into its wider policy programs and make digital financial capacity building and security a core requirement for providers of financial services.\n\nThe growth of financial inclusion in Ghana has been mainly due to the development of DFS. Ghana’s DFS and DFI space continues to evolve with the entry of other players like fintech services, as well as the new DFS policy, which signaled that the government is focused on an agenda that will continue to ensure DFI. However, Ghana’s approach to ensuring DFI must leverage cross-sectoral partnerships and whole-of-government collaborations to improve security for DFS as Ghana continues to lead in the West African region by number of mobile money transactions—which represent 82 percent of the country’s GDP—and remains the fastest-growing mobile money market in Africa over the past five years.82\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDr. Nnenna Ifeanyi-Ajufo is an associate professor of law and the head of law at Buckinghamshire New University (United Kingdom).

    "Africa needs to upgrade food system": "As Africa continues with its Year of Nutrition, which was declared for 2022 by the African Union, two leading agronomists have said that the time is right for African countries to transform their food systems to tackle hunger.\n\nWriting recently on the Devex website, a global media platform for the development community, Josefa Sacko, a leading agronomist and AU Commissioner for Agriculture, and Agnes Kalibata, President of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), noted: “As the world scrambles to address the current crises, the continent is reminded that only Africans can take responsibility for building climate resilient, nutritious, and inclusive systems that leave no one behind — as envisioned by the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n“This is why the African Union declared 2022 as the Year of Nutrition and why we must implement the national food systems pathways agreed upon at the UN Food Systems Summit in 2021.\n\n“Progress made to date will be undone if we fail to lead and fail to act now,’ Sacko and Kalibata argued.\n\nLast week in New York, President Nana Akufo-Addo echoed this call when he addressed the UN General Assembly, urging investors to support the roll-out of Africa’s lucrative agro-industry to guarantee global food security.\n\nIn the wake of overlapping food systems shocks, such as climate-induced drought and floods, locust attacks, the Covid-19 pandemic, and conflict, the World Bank has warned that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty.\n\nIf food prices stay this high for a year, global poverty could go up by more than 100 million people, it added.\n\nSacko and Kalibata highlighted a number of achievements in African agricultural production after decades of stagnation, pointing out that the continent witnessed sustained agricultural growth of 4.73 per cent a year on average between 2000 and 2018.\n\nBut, currently, “Africa is struggling to achieve the SDGs”.\n\n“The African Common Position and national food systems pathways will not happen without stakeholders at every stage of the food system taking ownership — governments, the private sector, finance institutions, producers, and civil society,” Sacko and Kalibata wrote.\n\nThe IMF, in a recent blog, also picked up on the issue of weak food systems in Africa, pointing out that “climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, where Russia’s war in Ukraine and the pandemic are also adding to food shortages and high prices”.\n\n“One-third of the world’s droughts occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and Ethiopia and Kenya are enduring one of the worst in at least four decades.\n\n“Countries such as Chad are also being severely impacted by torrential rains and floods,” the IMF said.\n\nThe multiple crises that have created rippling effects on Africa’s food systems were brought into sharp focus at this year’s Africa Green Revolution Forum (AGRF) in Kigali\n\nThe AGRF is Africa’s premier platform for discussing the continent’s food systems and agricultural transformation and managing food crisis.\n\n“We have already heard from the governments of Ghana, Malawi and Rwanda at the AGRF on how they are implementing their food systems pathways to inspire other countries,” Sacko and Kalibata said.\n\nIn New York, President Akufo-Addo made a direct call for more investors in the continent’s agro-industry: “Africa is ready for business. Africa needs you and you need Africa.”\n\nIn Angola, Paramount Energy and Commodities has pumped $500 million into the country’s food sector, as it looks to develop the agro-industry in Africa.\n\nIt said that poor processing capacity in Africa was leading to post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables of between 35-50 per cent or 15-25 per cent for grains.\n\nThe company said in a statement that sustainable, long-term, and self-sufficient solutions to the current global commodities crisis must be carried out rapidly, “otherwise even more people will face alarming levels of hunger and poverty”.\n\nParamount pointed out that by enabling access to affordable energy and food supply the economies of Africa could “flourish, economic activity is stimulated, and local entrepreneurship encouraged, ultimately leading to a more equal distribution of wealth and power”.\n\nSacko and Kalibata noted optimistically: “Farmers are increasingly using innovative approaches and scientific research combined with traditional knowledge to increase the productivity of their fields, diversify their crops, boost their nutrition, and build climate resilience.”\n\nSource: GNA",

    "Ghana’s economy to take almost 6 years before full recovery – Professor Bokpin": "Financial Economist, Professor Godfred Bopkin is warming that the Ghanaian economy will take almost five to six years before it fully recovers from its present predicament.\n\nGhana’s economy has been hit by an unsustainable debt, which has now reached alarming levels, increasing inflation and weakening the cedi. This has culminated in the high cost of living and doing business.\n\nIt has subsequently led to the downgrade of the country’s credit rating to deeper junk status by rating agency, Fitch,\n\nSpeaking to Joy Business, Professor Bopkin who is an Associate Professor at the University of Ghana Business School said scaling up the challenges facing the economy now is a very difficult one.\n\n“When you get to a junk status like this, it will take you probably not less than five to six years before you recover because scaling up is very difficult, is very difficult. I wish the country well”.\n\n“Now beyond the economic programme to be presented to the Fund, I think government will also have to look at some governance reforms and productivity reform that should be pursued concurrently with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme which also will entail some kind of revision to our constitution. Certainly, we couldn’t get to this level without the support of the constitution”, he explained.\n\nHe again called for the downsizing of the government since it will send a positive signal to investors about the commitment of the managers of the economy in addressing the imbalances within the economy.\n\n“Again, we also have to look at the size of the government. It is not a good news going into any negotiation table with that size of government. We have said that right from the beginning of the year”.\n\n“It is not as though downsizing the government will save huge billions of dollars, but the signal and the confidence that it will generate. When it happens that way, whatever you put on the table, it will be harder for people to infer genuine commitment and that you yourself will appreciate the situation; and you are taking steps to internalize the austerity before you ask others to come on board”, he added.",
    "Ashanti Airlines Wins Tender To Establish New Ghanaian Airline": "The government of Ghana has confirmed its next investor in its aviation industry. Following the demise of Ghana Airways in 2004 and that of Ghana International Airlines in 2010, Ghana has been with no national carrier, although the country intends to make its capital Accra an aviation hub in West Africa.\n\nAirline companies such as Ashanti Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Egyptair, and the Ghanaian management consultancy and brokerage firm JNH Group showed interest and competed for the deal to run the West African country’s airline. The criterion followed to confirm the suitable partner rotated on preferred routes, duration of the management contract, and financing terms. The minister of transport, Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, formed a committee to vet and evaluate all the proposals presented by the different bidders earlier this year. In May 2022, the Ghanaian government started showing all the positive signs to the home-based flight company, and after serious consideration, Ashanti won the bid to operate Ghana’s national airline. The wait is finally over.\n\nAshanti Airlines ‘comparative advantage\n\nAshanti Airlines was chosen because it is a Ghana-based airline, and it showed more willingness to meet the required terms and conditions of the contract. The company owners, Osei Kwame Despite and Ernest Ofori Sarpong, the Founders of the Despite Group of companies (DGC), won the much sought-after deal when they agreed to hire more employees and procure more aircraft to be better positioned to operate all the required routes.\n\nThere has been a need for a shakeup. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe company has already acquired an Air Carrier License (ACL), allowing it to operate scheduled and chartered passenger and cargo flights. It is now in its final financial arrangements and procedures of acquiring other licenses like the Air Operator Certificate from the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). Ashanti Airline's management holds high hopes that by the end of this year, the carrier will be set to take to the Ghanaian skies. The airline will fly to domestic, regional, and International destinations. The minister of transport confirmed that there is an evident need to connect Ghanaians to destinations like Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\nDiscover more aviation news here.\n\nWide Smiles for the Ghanaian population and tourists\n\nMany Ghanaians received the news confirming the choice of Ashanti Airlines with joy. To them, this is more like hitting two birds with one stone. Ashanti is made in Ghana, and the economic and social impacts of working with one’s compatriots are a cause for celebration.\n\nThe nationals of the West African country will soon be reaping big both economically and socially. The Ashanti Airlines partnership with its government will create more job opportunities. The company has already embarked on the search for qualified staff. Many will land their dream jobs in the aviation sector and improve their standards of living and those of their loved ones.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this update?

    "'Akufo-Addo is the source of Ghana's economic woes but plays the blame game' - Prof. Hanke": "Business News of Monday, 26 September 2022\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nProfessor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke has once again criticized President Akufo-Addo of absolving himself of any blame over the handling of the Ghanaian economy.\n\n\n\nGovernment has routinely explained that recent economic headwinds are attributable largely to the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the banking sector clean-up.\n\n\n\nBut Professor Hanke believes President Akufo-Addo has often played the blame game without taking full responsibility over the challenges in the economy which is now seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF), support programme.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet sighted by GhanaWeb, Prof. Hanke in his regular commentary referenced Akufo-Addo’s remarks at the United General Assembly where he indicated that the Russia-Ukraine war has aggravated an already difficult situation for Ghana.\n\n\n\n“Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa,” Akufo-Addo earlier said.\n\n\n\nIn his reaction, Professor Hanke on September 25 wrote, “When it comes to the source of #Ghana’s economic problems, Pres. Akufo-Addo plays the BLAME GAME. You know, it wasn’t me, it was the guy behind the tree. Today, I measure GHA's inflation at 83%/year. That's more than DOUBLE the phony official rate.”\n\n\n\nProfessor Hanke who has taken a keen interest in the economic issues of Ghana in a separate tweet said Ghana’s economy was tanking – an expression which means the economy is down and there are fears of a recession.\n\n\n\nHe has in on numerous occasions blamed the Akufo-Addo-led administration for putting the economy in a dire situation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghana Statistical Service recently announced that consumer inflation for August 2022 hit 33.9 percent from 31.7% in July, making it the highest rate recorded in 21 years.\n\n\n\nSee Professor Hanke's tweet below:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the source of #Ghana’s economic problems, Pres.

Inasmuch as all those challenges are confronting us, we should also look at some positives that are happening in terms of government interventions.\"\n\n\n\nLast month, Ghana’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to a record-high 22% in a bid to curb inflation.\n\n\n\nThe government is also in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout of around $3 billion to strengthen the ailing economy.",

    "Audiobooks: Ghana’s AkooBooks Is Relaunching With Beat": "Exclusive: The new AkooBooks/Beat platform will reach 19 African nations with audiobooks, podcasts, and ebooks.\n\nBy Porter Anderson, Editor-in-Chief | @Porter_Anderson\n\n‘For Those Who Love Stories’\n\nW\n\nhen trade visitors and exhibitors at Frankfurter Buchmesse hear from Accra-based Ama Dadson and Nathan Hull at the new Publishing Perspectives Forum (12 p.m. October 20), they’ll be talking about a forthcoming major relaunch of Dadson’s AkooBooks Audio as Ghana’s first publisher and streaming platform for Black and/or African audiobooks and other spoken-word content.\n\nThe new evocation of AkooBooks is to be active this year, well ahead of the handover to Accra as UNESCO World Book Capital in 2023.\n\nDescribed as a “multi-tiered, credit-based service” available in both Android and iOS, the AkooBooks platform is being designed as a pan-African service reaching consumers in at least 19 countries and allowing users to pay using their mobile wallets, the most common digital-payment form in most African countries.\n\nAkooBooks’ new redevelopment as a platform is backed by the Bergen-based Beat Technology, familiar to Publishing Perspectives readers for creating platforms for European publishers and groups of publishers.\n\nA Beat platform allows publishers to sell and/or stream audio and ebook products to their own consumer bases. Examples of Beat’s work in the field are the Netherlands’ service Fluister (Dutch for Whisper); the Echo platform in Romania; a partnership with Germany’s Skoobe.de; and a trio of publishers in Denmark–Gyldendal, Gads Forlag, and Modtryk. Beat’s installations’ users now total some 300,000 paying subscribers.\n\nThe forthcoming “rebranded and reimagined” business will feature audiobooks, podcasts, and ebook titles in indigenous African and Ghanaian languages including Ga, Twi and Kiswahili, as well as curated content in English and French.\n\nDadson: ‘African Stories by African Authors’\n\nIf the name AkooBooks is ringing a bell, it’s because Dadson—winner of the 2021 Startup of the Year award from Women in Tech Africa—has built a substantial local catalogue, as well as casting and recording titles in Accra for major players including Hachette Audio. That has resulted in local Ghanaian authors including Efua Sutherland, Ama Ata Aidoo, and Meschack Asare, having work available side-by-side with internationally popular authors such as Alexander McCall Smith (WF Howes) and Tayari Jones (Recorded Books).\n\nAs far back as 2019, Dadson in an interview with Publishing Perspectives talked of having identified a major swath of African populations and “the challenge faced by the busy urban working class in many of our high-traffic cities.\n\n“They spend hours commuting to work each day,” Dadson said, “either walking or by public transport, and are unable to read during such commutes. Audiobooks can be extremely convenient for them and a way to use their time profitably and keep them enthralled and [let them] escape from the chaos for a little while.”\n\nDadson, an experienced Frankfurt Audio exhibitor, spoke in June 2019 at the International Publishers Association‘s (IPA) “Africa Rising” seminar in Nairobi, hosted by the Kenya Publishers Association. Initially, she’d been drawn to the audiobook field as a response to vision-challenged readers: her mother had lost her site.\n\n“African stories by African authors, told in African voices. We want to push the richness and vibrancy of our continent’s literature for those who love stories. “ Ama Dadson, AkooBooks Audio\n\nAnd her survey work with 10,000 students at the University of Ghana–where she had served as deputy director of IT–had found that only 43 percent said they’d downloaded or listened to an audiobook at least once. Of those who had engaged with audiobooks, only 10 percent said they’d listened to content by African writers.\n\nBy 2017, Dadson had set up the original edition of AkooBooks, proving that the need and interest was there in the strong reaction she had from consumers.\n\nAnd now, Dadson says, “Black and African voices, stories, and authors deserve their own platform and that’s what we’re delivering here.\n\n“African stories by African authors, told in African voices,” she says. “We want to push the richness and vibrancy of our continent’s literature for those who love stories.\n\n“We want to reach children with accessible digital formats. And we want to reach our entrepreneurs with inspirational business titles.”\n\nHull: ‘Finally We’re Collaborating on a Project’\n\nFor his part, Hull, who is Beat’s chief strategy officer, tells Publishing Perspectives, “Ama’s drive and passion for audiobooks and storytelling has impressed me for years. Finally, we’re collaborating on a project, and it truly has the potential fulfil one of Beat’s aims in major way—making books and literature available to everyone possible.\n\n“Our platform, combined with the backing support of Ayoba.me and MTN—as well as a raft of other plans in the pipeline—means the all-new AkooBooks can get stories into the eyes and ears of millions of African citizens across the vast continent, all with zero-rated data. Removing data charges for African consumers accessing these large audio files was a crucial step in our planning.\n\n“While available in multiple markets from the outset, the initial focus for onboarding customers onto the service will be Ghana, Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, South Africa, Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Cameroon. After that, we’ll watch the data carefully to guide us on where our marketing attention goes next.\n\n“The service will live and breathe on the quality of the content it offers.” Nathan Hull, Beat Technology\n\n“The service will live and breathe on the quality of the content it offers, so it has been very encouraging to hear enthusiastic responses in our talks with major English- and French-language publishers who are keen to support growth in literacy and access to books in Africa.”\n\nAkooBooks will feature titles from presses including Ghana’s Afram Publications and Sub-Saharan Publishers, Nigeria’s Ouida Books, and major international works by writers including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Dorothy Koomson; and Michael Donkor from Harper Collins’ United States and United Kingdom catalogues, Macmillan UK, WF Howes, and RB Media.\n\nPublishing Perspectives understands that further English and French catalogues are currently under negotiation for inclusion in the initiative.\n\nAt Frankfurt, please join us for the inaugural edition of Publishing Perspectives Forum, a two-day program of leading and influential professionals in the international publishing industry discussing today’s challenges, dynamics, and trends.\n\n“The Audiobook Retail Evolution” panel which includes commentary from Hull and Dadson will also feature Bookwire’s Jens Klingelhöfer and will be moderated by Publishing Perspectives’ Hannah Johnson. Attendance is free of charge for all Frankfurter Buchmesse exhibitors and trade visitors. The program language is English.

    "GNPC begins decommissioning of Saltpond Oil Field": "The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) will from Monday, September 26, begin the technical decommissioning of the Saltpond Oil Field in the Central Region, Ghana’s oldest oil field.\n\nThis follows the arrival of the long-awaited jack-up rig and supporting vessels from Lagos, Nigeria, needed to undertake the exercise.\n\nThe rig got to Saltpond on Saturday, September 24, 2022 in the company of security officials and was about three hours away from the drilling installation (Mr Louie Rig) as of 1430 hours Sunday.\n\nThe GNPC will officially hand over the platform to the contractor, Hans and Co Gas and Oil Service Providers, on Monday, after which work will commence immediately.\n\nThe exercise, the first ever in Ghana, will permanently seal all six wells of the oil field, remove all pipes and completely dismantle the rusted and deplorable drilling platform to restore that area of the sea to its original state.\n\nAll the necessary permits have been secured to undertake the exercise.\n\nThe Saltpond Oil Field, about 105 kilometres west of Accra and 13 kilometres off the coast of Saltpond, was discovered in 1970.\n\nThe field is in a water depth of 85 feet and extends over an area of five square kilometres.\n\nIt was producing up to 4,800 barrels of oil per day at its peak from two out of six wells drilled.\n\nBut production plummeted to below 200 barrels of oil per day by 2015 to make the operational cost higher than production.\n\nConsequently, the Ministry of Energy, in August 2016, directed the GNPC to decommission the field based on the recommendations from state institutions including the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Corporation, therefore, initiated a field decommissioning process in 2018 with the first phase of studies and a development of a plan duly completed and approved by the Ministry of Energy.\n\nAddressing the press in Saltpond on Sunday, Dr Kwame Baah-Nuakoh, the General Manager, Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations, GNPC, explained that the decommissioning exercise had become necessary because the oil field was no longer economically viable.\n\nHe said the wells and wellheads were in a deplorable state, posing a threat of oil spillage, which would adversely impact aquatic life, the lives of fishermen, and those with facilities along the beaches.\n\n“If we leave this platform for the next two years, nobody knows what will happen because the structural integrity cannot be guaranteed,” he said.\n\n“virtually all metals have corroded and could cause disaster.”\n\nDr Baah-Nuakoh said the drilling installation would be cut, transported to the shore and recycled or sold as scrap to develop the catchment communities.\n\nHe assured that all safety measures were being strictly followed to avert any accident, including spillage.\n\n“The plan is to ensure that no hazardous waste is left on the sea. The Corporation has put in place a robust emergency response plan of international standards to manage any incident, in the unlikely event – it occurs,” he said.\n\n“What we are hoping to do is to restore the area to its economic level for fishing and hopefully reassign it to see if we can find oil there because history shows there’s oil there.”\n\nDr Baah-Nuakoh warned fishermen to keep a minimum distance of 500 meters away from the oil field and said the navy would be deployed to enforce the directive throughout the decommissioning process.\n\nHe noted that part of the decommissioning agreement with the contractor was to ensure the transfer of knowledge and technology so that future decommissioning would be done by Ghanaians.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to Parliament for its continuous support throughout the exercise.\n\nMadam Patience Lartey, Deputy Manager, Social Performance and Local Content Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations, GNPC, noted that all stakeholders within the affected catchment communities had been engaged in series of meetings to get their buy-in and support.\n\nNana Kwesi Brevo III, the Chief of Kuntu, appealed to the GNPC to compensate the community with some development projects for hosting the oil field since its inception.\n\nSource: GNA",

    "Campaign Council: APC Ghana faults list, demands inclusion": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ghana has faulted the party’s Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) list, insisting that it should be inclusive of a member from each of the diaspora chapters.\n\nChairman of APC in Ghana, Oghenosa Micheleti in a statement in Lagos on Monday, said that a member from each country chapter of the party should be included in the council and not be represented by just two persons.\n\n“We have a Forum of APC Diaspora Chairmen that have been representing the party and projecting its image in our various countries and therefore, we should not be relegated in an election that is the most powerful in the country.\n\n“The diaspora representation should be all-encompassing. Inclusion will make everyone work as a team to achieve the ultimate aim.\n\n“Here in Ghana, we have inaugurated a committee for the Tinubu/Shettima campaign and it is sad that none of us will be accommodated in the PCC,” he said.\n\nThe APC on Saturday released a 422-member Presidential campaign council list ahead of the commencement of its 2023 presidential campaign to be headed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSecretary of the council, James Faleke, said all nominees are to pick their appointment letters on Monday at the APC presidential campaign office.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity, APC PCC, Bayo Onanuga, said in a statement on Sunday evening that the inauguration earlier slated for Monday had been shifted to Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, in the list, two persons from the UK are to head the Diaspora Affairs in the APC presidential campaign council as Chairman and Secretary respectively.\n\nThe Ghana APC chairman said that this leaves out members in other countries.\n\nMr Micheleti said that the APC in Ghana participated actively in the election that brought in President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 and replicated the same in 2019, adding that “We did that for President Buhari and will do same for our leader, Sen. Bola Tinubu.\n\n“We erected billboards in Ghana and brought Nigerians together to rally support for Buhari, and even paid for Nigerians to return home to vote. We will do so again for the Tinubu/Shettima ticket.”\n\nThe chairman, however, appealed to the party leadership to review the list with a view to ensuring that those who ought to be in the council were swiftly included.\n\n“There are many diaspora associations that are already creating division in the diaspora.\n\n“Some of them are not enshrined in the APC constitution, they are parallel organs and shouldn’t be allowed to operate or parade themselves as representing the entire APC diaspora members.\n\n“Those organisations, if not properly handled, may bring division and tension into the party in the diaspora,” Mr Micheleti said, appealing to the party leadership to urgently look into the demands with a view to ratifying the issues raised.\n\n(NAN)",

    "Century-old family photo studio preserves Ghana's history in black and white": "Aug 31 (Reuters) - A generation before the Gold Coast became Ghana, local photographer J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije opened a small studio in the then-colonial capital Accra, where his family would become the de facto visual historians of a nation that had not yet been born.\n\nFor 100 years, three generations of Bruce-Vanderpuijes have painstakingly amassed the world's largest collection of 20th century Ghanaian photographs under one roof. They believe their Deo Gratias photo studio is the oldest in West Africa.\n\nFrom glass plates to digital files of nation-shaping events to intimate personal portraits, the family's 50,000-image archive offers a unique glimpse into Accra's transition from a colonial port into a bustling modern metropolis.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"The story they tell is that of [Ghana's] history,\" said Kate Tamakloe, Bruce-Vanderpuije's granddaughter and keeper of the modern archive. \"Without a history you have no future.\"\n\nVirtually unchanged since opening in 1922, Deo Gratias sits on a busy street in the heart of Jamestown, the capital's oldest district.

    "Ghana: Sub-Saharan Fertility Case Study": "Sub-Saharan Africa has grown quickly, at a rate about 1.5 times the rest of the world from 1960 to 2020. This has principally been the result of its higher fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. According to the United Nations medium variant projection, more than 90% of the world’s population increase between 2020 and 2100 will occur in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFertility in Ghana\n\nGhana, which was the first sub-Saharan nation to win its independence after World War II (1957) exemplifies fertility and population trends in the area.\n\nGhana’s rising population and dropping fertility reflects trends seen in other sub-Saharan African countries. This article explores population growth and total fertility rates (TFRs) of Ghana over the last six decades, with projections to 2100. Detailed TFR data is from the US AID Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS), in cooperation with the Ghana Statistical Service and the Ghana Health Service.\n\nThe Ghana DHS 2014 report includes not only TFRs, but also “wanted fertility rates.” A wanted fertility rate above the actual could indicate that higher fertility rates are likely. Where the wanted fertility rate is lower than the actual, it could indicate a future of less fertility. This is the situation in Ghana with its prospect of lower fertility, a characteristic it shares with just about every other sub Saharan nation.\n\nIn 1960, Ghana’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was nearly seven, meaning that the average woman of child-bearing age had that many children live births in her lifetime. In 1960, Ghana had a population under 7 million, and more than quadrupled to 32 million in 2020.\n\nNational TFRs: Past and Projections\n\nBy 2014 Ghana’s TFR dropped to 4.2 children over the life of a mother. This compares to a lower 3.6 wanted fertility rate and, by indicating preferences felt by women, should lead to lower fertility rates in the future. This would be consistent with the declining TFR projections of both United Nations and Vienna’s Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital. By 2100, the United Nations medium variant projects a Ghana TFR of 1.9, while the Wittgenstein Centre projects 1.7, both below replacement rate (Figure 1). This difference in TFRs would produce materially different populations, with 73 million projected by the United Nations and 61 million by the Wittgenstein. The Wittgenstein Centre TFR for Ghana in 2100 would be virtually equal to that of the United States today.\n\nUrban and Rural TFRs\n\nUrbanization is a key factor in making these predictions. Ghana’s population has become substantially much more concentrated in urban areas over the past six decades, rising 23% in 1960 to 57% in 2020, according to the United Nations (Figure 2).\n\nGenerally, higher TFRs are associated with greater urbanization, as is the case in Ghana. Ghana‘s urban TFR in 2014 was 3.4. This, however, is higher than the wanted TFR of 3.1 for urban women. Ghana’s rural TFR is considerably higher, at 5.1, well above the 4.3 wanted fertility rate for rural women (Figure 3).\n\nTFR’s by Education\n\nLower fertility is associated with higher levels of education at the national level.\n\nAmong women with secondary and greater education, the TFR is 2.6, above the wanted TFR of 2.3. For those with middle school education, the CFR rises to 4.2, compared to the 3.6 wanted TFR. For those with primary education, the TFR is 4.9 compared to the 4.1 wanted fertility rate. And, for those with no education the TFR is 6.2, compared to the 5.5 wanted TFR. Among those with greater education TFR is nearly 60 percent below that of those with no education.(Figure 4).\n\nFertility by Wealth\n\nLower TFR‘s are also correlated with higher incomes, also at the national level.\n\nAmong the highest wealth quintile household wealth quintile, the TFR in 2014 for Ghana was 2.8, compared to a wanted TFR of 2.6.The TFR rises in the intermediate wealth quintiles, reaching a peak of 6.3 in the lowest quintile, which is well above the 5.5 wanted fertility rate in the same category (Figure 5).\n\nFertility by Region\n\nAs shown above, TFRs tend lower with greater urbanization. This is apparent in the regional data. Data is provided for 10 regions in Ghana, with by far the lowest TFR in Greater Accra, at 2.8, compared to a wanted TFR of 2.5. Greater Accra has a population density nearly six times that of the Central region, which is the second most densely populated part of the country. Greater Accra has the nation’s capital and its urban area has about 5.5 million residents. The TFR of Kumasi, the second largest urban area (over 4 million) is masked by the much greater rural share of the population in its Ashanti region (Figure 6).\n\nProspects\n\nIt is notable that in each of the dimensions measured in Figures 3 through 6, the wanted TFR is lower than the actual TFR. The Wittgenstein Centre projections for 2100 TFR and population are materially below those of the United Nations but reflect the same tendencies. The difference between the UN and Wittgenstein Centre TFRs, according to founding director Wolfgang Lutz, are assumed improvements in female education and related employment gains. These TFR reductions, whether from the UN or the Wittgenstein Centre will require continued economic progress to be achieved.\n\nWendell Cox is principal of Demographia, an international public policy firm located in the St. Louis metropolitan area.

    "V&A likely to return looted Asante gold treasures to Ghana": "The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) is likely to return Asante gold regalia to Ghana after a recent visit there by its director Tristram Hunt. These treasures had been seized during a British punitive raid in 1874.\n\nAlthough international attention is now focused on the restitution of Benin bronzes to Nigeria from European and American collections, items from the Asante kingdom are arguably of equal significance. Together, Benin and Asante (now in Ghana) represent two of the greatest West African cultures. A return of treasures to Ghana by the V&A will inevitably increase pressure on the British Museum, which holds a much larger Asante collection.\n\nThe British colony of the Gold Coast was expanded in 1872 and conflicts then intensified with the Asante kingdom, which lay to the north. In January 1874 British troops entered Kumasi, the Asante capital. Queen Victoria’s forces looted and blew up the palace of the king (Asantehene), Kofi Karikari. They then demanded 50,000 ounces of gold, nominally to recover the expenses of the punitive raid. The seizure of the gold regalia stripped the Asante king of his symbols of government. Tensions continued over many years and further treasures were seized during later military campaigns in 1896 and 1900.\n\nTristram Hunt, the director of the V&A, wants to see restrictions eased on deaccessioning objects in his museum Peter Dewhirst/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nHunt, in the V&A’s latest annual review, writes: “I visited Ghana to begin conversations about a renewable cultural partnership centred around the V&A collection of Asante court regalia, which entered the collection following the looting of Kumasi in 1874. We are optimistic that a new partnership model can forge a potential pathway for these important artefacts to be on display in Ghana in the coming years.”\n\nOn his visit in February, Hunt held discussions with both the Ghanaian ministry of tourism, arts and culture and the current Asante king, Osei Tutu II.\n\nMost UK national museums are not normally able to deaccession, in the V&A’s case because of restrictions incorporated in the 1983 National Heritage Act. Hunt favours a loosening of this prohibition and with next year’s 40th anniversary of the act, he would like to see a debate over deaccessioning.\n\nLong-term loans\n\nFor the present, the V&A can only offer a long-term loan of Asante treasures, but eventually such loans might lead to a transfer of legal ownership. We can report that the V&A-Ghanaian discussions were partly facilitated by Ivor Agyeman-Duah, a Kumasi-born historian of Asante art and architecture. He served as an adviser to John Kufuor, a former president of Ghana (2001-09), and was a former director of the Ghana Museums & Monuments Board.\n\nOne of the sensitive issues that needs addressing is whether treasures returned from Britain should be displayed in the national capital, Accra, or the Asante capital, Kumasi.\n\nAgyeman-Duah tells The Art Newspaper that he believes it is important that looted Asante objects should be returned to where they were seized: “It is appropriate that they go to the palace in Kumasi.”\n\nThe venue there would be the Manhyia Palace Museum, a building erected in 1925, which served as the royal residence until 1970. In 1995 it became a museum. It has been closed since last year for refurbishment, including upgrading security and environmental conditions, which will pave the way for international loans.\n\nGolden fleeced: works in UK museums\n\nThe greatest part of the V&A’s Asante collection comprises 13 pieces of looted Asante court regalia. These were sold by the British army through the London crown jeweller Garrard.\n\nGold pectoral “soul” disc in the V&A’s collection © V&A London\n\nThey include a decorated gold pectoral “soul” disc, shaped like a flower, which would have been worn by priests involved in the ritual purification of the king’s soul. There is a also a pear-shaped pendant, either worn or possibly attached to a state sword or stool. The remaining pieces of regalia are of gold.\n\nThe British Museum’s collection of Asante objects is much larger, including 105 items that were seized in 1874. Of these, 83 were purchased from the crown agents for the colonies, 12 from Garrard and ten elsewhere. A further 12 pieces were acquired after an 1896 raid.\n\nGold “soul” disc inserted into a decorated surround by Marquis of Exeter © The Trustees of the British Museum\n\nAmong the most poignant objects in the British Museum’s collection is a large gold “soul” disc. When acquired by the Marquess of Exeter in 1874 he had it framed by Garrard in an impressive gold surround, made in London. On the reverse it is inscribed, along with the aristocrat’s crest: “The gold ornament in the centre of this dish is a portion of the indemnity paid by the Ashanti King Coffee Calcalli to Her Majesty’s Forces.” This transformed a sacred Asante religious object into an English war trophy. Perhaps surprisingly, the object was bought by the British Museum from the owner’s descendants in 1973, nearly a century after the looting.\n\nThe Wallace Collection has a stunning gold Asante trophy head which is the largest known piece of historic goldwork made in Africa, outside Egypt. This was bought by Richard Wallace in 1874.\n\nGold trophy head in the Wallace Collection © The Wallace Collection\n\nLondon’s National Army Museum owns an important ceremonial bowl which stood outside the royal mausoleum. This was once erroneously said to have ben used to collect the blood of beheaded sacrificial victims, a reflection of British colonial attitudes in the 19th century.\n\nCeremonial brass bowl in the National Army Museum © National Army Museum\n\nThe Royal Regiment of Artillery is believed to own an important Asante gold ram’s head. It is set on an elaborate stand, made in London in 1875, which includes three Atlantean figures of Africans.\n\nWhen The Art Newspaper asked for further information, we were told that the regiment “do not circulate details relating to their private property”.\n\nOther Asante pieces are in the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, Leeds Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford.\n\nIn 1974, the centenary of the looting, the then Asante king, Opoku Ware II, asked for “the return of regalia and other items removed from our country by British expeditionary forces in 1874, 1896 and 1900”. Although that claim was made nearly 50 years ago, it now looks likely that the V&A will be taking the bold step of leading the way in acceding to this request.\n\nThe V&A is not commenting further, although an announcement is likely later this year.\n\nA British Museum spokesperson says that a formal claim was received in 1974. Since then “there have been several spoken requests, most notably by the current Asantehene, during the visit of the deputy director of the British Museum to Kumasi in 2010”. The spokesperson says that there is “a cordial working relationship with the Asante Royal Court through the Asantehene and the Manhyia Palace Museum committee”.\n\nDiscussions have been held with the Asantehene, with both parties expressing the “ambition that objects from the British Museum collection might travel on loan to the Kumasi museum”."
