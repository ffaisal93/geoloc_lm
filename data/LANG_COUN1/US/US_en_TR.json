(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.\n\nTurkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.\n\nTurkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.\n\nErdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.\n\n“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.\n\nTurkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.\n\nTensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.\n\nMore recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.\n\nAthens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.\n\nA Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”\n\nThe official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.\n\nTurkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.\n\n“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries.\n\n———\n\nDerek Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.",

    "Turkey Signals Possible Rapprochement With Syria": "Recently there have been signs of reconciliation between Turkey and Syria, which have been at odds for more than a decade as Ankara supported Syrian rebel forces fighting Damascus.\n\nPro-government daily Hurriyet reported September 16 that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had expressed a wish to meet his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Uzbekistan, although Assad was not there.\n\n\"I wish Assad had come to Uzbekistan; I would have spoken to him,\" Erdogan said in a closed meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party, according to Hurriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi.\n\nAlso, last month, Erdogan reportedly said he would never rule out dialogue with Syria, adding that \"we should take further steps with Syria.\"\n\nReuters reported September 15 that Hakan Fidan, head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization, had met multiple times with his counterpart, Syrian National Security Bureau Chairman Ali Mamlouk, in Damascus in recent weeks, according to four sources.\n\n‘Change in rhetoric’\n\nGonul Tol, the director of the Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies, told VOA these developments are not new, as Turkey has been working closely with the Assad regime since 2016.\n\n\"I think the new thing that we're seeing right now is the change in rhetoric. We are hearing from Turkish officials more vocally that normalization with the regime is a possibility,\" Tol said during an interview via phone in response to questions about Erdogan’s recent statement regarding relations with Syria.\n\n\"But, in reality, if you look at all the developments that have been happening since 2016, I don't think this is shocking.\"\n\nTol said that since Erdogan started aligning his party with the nationalists to consolidate power, his top priority has shifted from toppling the Assad regime to curbing Kurdish advances in northern Syria.\n\n\"To realize that goal, he needed not only a Russian green light but also he had to work closely with the regime itself. … So, there was a tacit understanding between the two—while Erdogan attacks the Kurds, Assad looks the other way,\" Tol said.\n\nTurkey has conducted four military operations in Syria since 2016, and it considers the armed Kurdish YPG militia, a key part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in northern Syria to be a national security threat.\n\nAnkara views the Syrian Democratic Forces to be a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which both Turkey and the United States have designated a terrorist organization.\n\nNATO member Turkey has a military presence in large swaths of northern Syria. Damascus considers Turkey an occupying power and calls for its unconditional withdrawal from Syria.\n\nMilitary incursion\n\nErdogan announced plans in June to launch a new military incursion in northern Syria, targeting the Tal Rifaat and Manbij areas to form a safe zone along the Syrian border. But that has not happened yet.\n\nRussian and pro-Syrian government forces have a presence in these areas, and Russia has not endorsed Turkey's operation.\n\n\n\nAron Lund, a fellow at Century International and Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, thinks that Erdogan saw an opportunity for a new military operation while the U.S. and Russia mostly focused on Ukraine.\n\nLund notes that Ankara does not need to ask for Washington’s green light as the United States is not involved with the SDF forces in the area where Turkey is eyeing an operation.\n\n\"Erdogan felt that Russia has weakened and is under more international pressure, so they won't be able to bring the same level of push back in Syria. So, this is basically a good moment to go after the Syrian Democratic Forces because the United States and the Europeans will offer more muted criticism than they would normally do and the Russians will be more open to negotiating at Assad's expense,\" Lund told VOA in a conversation.\n\n\"But Russia successfully parried that and drew Erdogan into a negotiation process where the counter demand is that he must talk to Assad, or not Assad personally perhaps, but some form of normalization of their relationship,\" Lund added.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said last Monday that Moscow is willing to organize a meeting between Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\n\"We think that [a foreign minister-level meeting] would be useful. We are talking about establishing contacts, now so far through the military and intelligence services — there have been such contacts,\" Bogdanov said, responding to a question on the possibility of such a meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, Mekdad told Sputnik on Saturday that there was no contact or meeting with the Turkish officials during the UNGA. “There is no negotiation, no contact, at least nothing at the level of foreign ministers,\" Mekdad said.\n\nMekdad also accused Turkey of not fulfilling the agreed commitments in the Astana process without elaborating on them. Erdogan, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin came together in Tehran for Astana talks in July.\n\n\"The only obstacle to the peace process is Turkey's lack of commitment,” Mekdad told Sputnik on the sidelines of the UNGA.\n\nRefugees’ return\n\nTurkey's pro-government daily, Sabah, reported on September 17 that Syrian and Turkish intelligence officials discussed several issues, including the completion of Syria’s new constitution process, revoking its expropriation law that allowed Syria’s government to confiscate property left behind by refugees, and the safe return of those refugees from Syria. Turkey hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world.”\n\nTurkey’s state-run Disaster and Emergency Management Authority announced that over 68,000 briquette houses have been built in Syria for the return of the refugees.\n\nInternational rights groups, including Amnesty International, say war-torn Syria is still not safe for return.\n\nAaron Stein, a Turkey expert and the chief content officer at Metamorphic Media, says that the parameters of Turkish foreign policy on Syria have not changed since 2016, but what has changed is that domestic political dynamics in Turkey have gotten so bad for Erdogan’s party.\n\nStein cited rising anti-Syrian refugee sentiment in Turkey and the country’s economic crisis, with an official inflation last month of 80.2%.\n\n\n\nThe next presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next June, but the opposition parties are calling for snap elections, which Erdogan has dismissed. The six-opposition-party alliance against Erdogan has promised to return Syrian refugees humanely. On the other hand, the far-right Victory Party calls for forced deportations of Syrian refugees, blaming them for the rising food prices.\n\n\"No Turkish person cares about Bashar al-Assad. What people care about in Turkey is the cost of living is going up, and that food prices are out of control and wages are remaining stagnant,\" Stein told VOA.\n\nStein said he does not expect any real progress on Turkey and Syria rapprochement and added, \"I think the value for Erdogan now is that he can tell constituents he is working on a problem.\"\n\nThis story originated in VOA's Turkish Service.",
    "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul": "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey — Russian men continue to flee the country, by land or air, days after President Vladimir Putin's announcement to mobilize additional forces to bolster his flailing war in Ukraine.\n\nAt Istanbul's main airport, a constant stream of Russian men came through the arrivals terminal. Istanbul is a destination of choice because it is one of few places where Russians can travel to without visas, with a long history of Russian tourism.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has sought to cast itself as a neutral power broker between Moscow and Kyiv, and refused to join Western countries in economic sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, many anti-war Russians have settled here, along with refugees from Ukraine.\n\nFlights from Russia to Turkey are sold out for the next several weeks, despite skyrocketing prices. But that hasn't stopped people from finding ways to get out, not only from Russian cities like Moscow, Sochi, Makhachkala and Yekaterinburg but also through neighboring countries Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, at Istanbul Airport, didn't want to reveal their names out of fear of the Russian government. Just last week, Putin signed a law that sentenced those who refused to serve, or evaded service, to 10 years in prison. The men NPR spoke to described long lines at airports and border crossings because of the sheer number of crowds and because of interrogation by Russian authorities.\n\nOne 32-year-old man who flew from St. Petersburg, Russia, told NPR that his flight was \"completely full of men, from 20 and then till 50.\"\n\n\"And all men stopped and — we were interrogated by police,\" he said.\n\n\"There was questions about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you [serve] in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go serve?\" alluding to the conscription notices being served.\n\nA hurried dash to the border, and packed light\n\nNearly all the men said they had packed very light, trying to convince Russian authorities that they were leaving for short trips, and not to evade fighting in the war.\n\nMost said they have no future plans, and limited money. Those with families said their priority was to get settled and then try to bring their families out of Russia as well.\n\nA 35-year-old man, who left his family behind in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, drove first to the Mongolian border, where he waited six hours to cross. In Mongolia, he said, he ran into several of his friends who were also fleeing, before he caught a flight to Istanbul.\n\nSome men said they decided to leave the country as soon as they heard the conscription announcement last Wednesday. The man from Irkutsk said he waited a few days to see what would happen, but once his friends started getting rounded up at night, he made the decision to go.\n\n\"They aren't just taking the reservists, but also men who have no military history and even those with more than three children,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities, including Putin, had assured the public that only those with prior military service, no illnesses and fewer than three children would be called upon to serve.\n\nSeveral men told NPR that those who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war — which is why women have been overwhelmingly taking part in the recent public protests in Russia.\n\nIt's about to get worse\n\nNearly everyone who spoke to NPR said they believed the situation is going to get worse, that a full mobilization is imminent.\n\nRussia is now conducting what it claims are referendums — considered illegal under international law — in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. The 32-year-old man from St. Petersburg told NPR many in Russia see it as the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia.\n\n\"Then of course the Ukrainians will attack those areas because actually it's their territory. Then after that, I think [Putin will] decide 'OK, they attacked our territory,' and he'll make the full mobilization,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, in a hurry to leave the airport, only said, \"everything is worse than you know and Russian men are going anywhere they can now.\"\n\nOne 36-year-old man from Moscow told NPR that his reason to leave was not just because he didn't want to fight, but that it was his way of not supporting the military campaign.\n\n\"If you are against the war, the best thing to do is try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.,\" he said.\n\nJust a few said they were hopeful that there would be a peace agreement to end the war, and hoped to wait it out before eventually returning home.",

    "Russians against the war seek refuge in Turkey": "Russians against the war seek refuge in Turkey\n\nRussian men are fleeing the country to avoid being forced into the military and the war in Ukraine. Many are going to Turkey, where they do not need a visa to enter.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Russia, there are long lines along the border and flights out of the country are sold out as men of military age try to get out. The exodus follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to mobilize tens of thousands of reservists after the Russian military lost ground to Ukraine's counteroffensive. Many of those fleeing are headed to Turkey, one of the few countries that allows Russians to come in without a visa. NPR's Fatma Tanis was at Istanbul's main airport.\n\nFATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Of the many travelers trickling through international arrivals at Istanbul airport, the Russians stand out. There is a palpable sense of urgency, even frustration, and they're carrying little to no luggage to convince Russian authorities they were leaving for short trips and not to evade fighting in the war. Most of them declined to be interviewed. One man frantically looks around and asks if I have a secret camera on him, and those who did speak didn't want to reveal their names, fearing retribution from the Russian government. I meet two friends in their early 30s who just arrived from Saint Petersburg. They're carrying slim backpacks and small briefcases. I ask one of them if he has a plan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Don't know yet.\n\nTANIS: This is all you have?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes.\n\nTANIS: OK. Did you pack in a rush?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, actually, yes.\n\nTANIS: Switching to Russian, he says he made the decision to leave the day before after seeing news that police were interrogating men who are leaving the country. It was hard to find a ticket by that point.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Very expensive. Now it's very difficult to buy tickets abroad. It was about 3,000 euro.\n\nTANIS: When they both got to the airport in Saint Petersburg, they were interrogated, too. The other man described what that was like.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The whole flight was completely full of men, for example, from 20 and then till 50, I think. And all men just stopped and was - we were interrogated by police.\n\nTANIS: He says they were asked when they bought their tickets, the purpose of their trip, whether they'd served in the military before and if they'd received a notice to fight. These men haven't yet. But...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, I'm worrying. Yes. About this...\n\nTANIS: You're worried.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: For sure.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. Yeah.\n\nTANIS: Do you think that you can go back to your country any time soon?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: No, I don't believe.\n\nTANIS: So this is it?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. This is it. Now we can plan something because everything changing very fast.\n\nTANIS: Things are moving quickly in Russia. Just today, President Putin signed a refusal of service law - 10 years in prison for those caught fleeing service. Everyone I spoke with here said they were against the war in Ukraine. They know many people in Russia who are, too, and many others who do support the invasion. The issue has caused rifts between friendships and family. But people who speak out against the war and, more recently, the mobilization have been arrested. There are even reports that they're getting drafted while in police custody to be sent to Ukraine. One 36-year-old man who came from Moscow says the best thing to do is...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.\n\nTANIS: He says Russians who are against the war are very scared now, but they can't stop it.

    "‘Hostile narrative’: Turkey slams Greek PM’s UN remarks": "Ankara accuses Athens of distorting facts after Greek PM says Turkey is undermining regional peace and stability.\n\nTurkey has condemned remarks by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who accused Ankara of undermining peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and playing a “destabilising role”.\n\nLong-existing tensions between the two countries have flared up recently. Greece complained to NATO and the United Nations this month over what it called “inflammatory” rhetoric.\n\n“Unfortunately this statement [by Mitsotakis] was yet another example of distortion of facts and hostile narrative against Turkiye. Turkiye’s role in its region and beyond is well appreciated by the international community,” the Turkish delegation at the United Nations General Assembly said on Friday, using the country’s official name.\n\nThe two nations – North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies but historic foes – have been at odds for decades over a range of issues including where their continental shelves start and end, energy resources, overflights in the Aegean Sea, the status of demilitarised islands and divided Cyprus.\n\nDuring his address to the UNGA, Mitsotakis said Turkey’s leadership “seems to have a strange fixation with my country”.\n\n“They threaten that Turkey will come at night if it so decides. This is the language of an aggressor. From the UN I would like to address … the Turkish people directly: ‘Greece poses no threat to your country. We are not your enemies, we are neighbours. Let us move forward,” he said.\n\nThe Turkish delegation to the UN said Ankara does not challenge the territorial integrity or unity of Greece, calling it “a false propaganda”.\n\n“However, Turkiye does challenge Greece to enter into an honest and meaningful dialogue in accordance with international law to address not one but all legally interrelated Aegean disputes,” it said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece this week of “crimes against humanity”, referring to its treatment of refugees, and earlier this month of occupying islands in the Aegean Sea that have a demilitarised status.",
    "Turkey: Anti-LGBTQ display reflects nation’s political shift": "ISTANBUL (AP) — The 25-year-old translator by day and trans drag performer by night felt overwhelming panic and anxiety when several thousand demonstrators gathered and marched Sunday in Turkey to demand a ban on what they consider gay propaganda and to outlaw LGBTQ organizations.\n\nThe Big Family Gathering march in the conservative heart of Istanbul attracted parents with children, nationalists, hard-line Islamists and conspiracy theorists. Turkey’s media watchdog gave the event the government’s blessing by including a promotional video that called LGBTQ people a “virus” in its list of public service announcements for broadcasters.\n\n“We need to make all our defense against this LGBT. We need to get rid of it,” said construction worker Mehmet Yalcin, 21, who attended the event wearing a black headband printed with Islam’s testimony of faith. “We are sick of and truly uncomfortable that our children are being encouraged and pulled to this.”\n\nSeeing images from the gathering terrified Willie Ray, the drag performer who is nonbinary, and Willie Ray’s mother, who was in tears after talking to her child. The fear wasn’t misplaced. The Europe branch of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association ranked Turkey second to last, ahead of only Azerbaijan, in its most recent 49-country legal equality index, saying LGBTQ people endured “countless hate crimes.”\n\n“I feel like I can be publicly lynched,” Willie Ray said, describing the daily sense of dread that comes with living in Istanbul. The performer recalls leaving a nightclub still in makeup on New Year’s Eve and hurrying to get to a taxi as strangers on the street called out slurs and “tried to hunt me, basically.”\n\nSunday’s march was the biggest anti-LGBTQ demonstration of its kind in Turkey, where civil rights for a community more commonly referred to here as LGBTI+ — lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and other gender identities and sexual orientations — have been under assault in the years since an estimated 100,000 people celebrated Pride in Istanbul in 2014.",
    "What Erdogan’s Unusual Economic Ideas Mean for Turkey": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nSign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us @middleeast for news on the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not the only politician who doesn’t like it when the country’s banks charge people relatively heavily to borrow money. What sets him apart is his unorthodox belief in low interest rates and determination to wrest control of monetary policy from central bankers. The result: A succession of benchmark rate cuts that has fueled runaway inflation and precipitated a collapse in the currency.\n\n1. What’s Erdogan’s beef with high interest rates?\n\nHe says that they slow economic growth and fuel inflation. The thesis has unnerved international investors for years. While the country’s spending and credit binge during the pandemic propelled growth, the economy has also suffered from double-digit inflation and unpredictable policy moves. He has also referred to Islamic proscriptions on usury as a basis for his policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Are his arguments reasonable?\n\nThe point about weaker growth is. When a central bank increases rates, banks are less able to borrow to maintain mandatory reserves and tend to lend at their own elevated rates. This makes loans for businesses rarer and more expensive and so can slow the economy. But Erdogan’s second notion -- that elevated interest rates cause prices to rise -- contradicts conventional economic theories.\n\n3. What’s the basis of Erdogan’s theory?\n\nIt’s likely that it’s partly based on his experience running businesses, mostly in the food industry, before his career as a politician took off. Many Turkish companies borrow relatively heavily to cover operating expenses, making volatility in borrowing costs a source of uncertainty and rate hikes an added expense. In Erdogan’s view, higher rates result in higher prices because businesses have to pass on increased costs to their customers. This makes assumptions that orthodox economists challenge, namely that interest rates make up a significant part of companies’ costs and that producers have sufficient pricing power to impose their will on consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Who agrees with Erdogan?\n\nThe argument is based on a theory by Yale University economist Irving Fisher on the relationship between inflation, nominal interest rates and real interest rates. Critics of the neo-Fisherites say that even if their theory had merit, it wouldn’t apply to an economy like Turkey’s, which suffers from chronically high inflation and is reliant on foreign funding. That’s because cutting interest rates reduces the return on investing in Turkish assets, and the local currency tends to weaken when foreigners decide to put their money elsewhere. That increases the cost of imported goods in liras and results in higher prices, or more inflation.\n\n5. What has Erdogan done to put his views into action?\n\nMany central banks have raised borrowing costs to fight inflation after the pandemic. Turkey has gone the other way, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 7 percentage points to 12% in the 13 months to September. Over that period, the lira gradually weakened and inflation accelerated. The government increased the national minimum wage in December and July to limit the hit to households. This further inflamed prices, sending inflation to a 24-year high above 80% in August -- the fourth highest among 120 countries tracked by Bloomberg. Erdogan has held firm, saying what Turkey needs is more investment, production and exports, not higher interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. What’s been the impact on financial markets?\n\nInterest rates on commercial debt began to diverge from benchmark rates as lenders balked at offering ever-cheaper loans when the supply of short-term central bank funding was in doubt. In response, monetary authorities imposed rules to force banks to bring their loan rates closer to the benchmark. They were also obliged to increase their holdings of lira-denominated, fixed-rate government debt. As a result, the cost of lira debt fell, while yields on Turkey’s junk-rated dollar bonds went in the opposite direction.\n\n7. What’s it done to the economy?\n\nHomes, cars and many essential goods became unaffordable for a swathe of Turkey’s 84 million population. Food inflation hit low earners, while the middle class saw a squeeze in living standards. On the flip side, economic growth outperformed Turkey’s peers and unemployment was relatively low due to an abundance of cheap labor. While the stock market rallied, keeping pace with inflation, bond investors have struggled to adjust to a world of 68% real negative yields. The lira hit an all-time low against the dollar in September, even though the central bank has spent an estimated $75 billion to prop up the currency this year, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Could Erdogan reverse course?\n\nErdogan has signaled he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his low-rate policy intact. Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati told investors frustrated by low bond yields they can find good returns in Turkish stocks. With elections looming in 2023, Erdogan is wary of changing course and risking a blowout in borrowing rates that could inflict further pain on consumers. To shore up popular support, he announced a $50 billion project to increase home ownership, introduced a cap on rents, erased some student loans and promised another big minimum wage hike. He’s aware the economy is his biggest challenge, and economists aren’t ruling out a policy rethink after the elections.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Turkey's lira hits a new record low against the dollar as investors brace for another rate cut": "The Turkish lira hit a new record low on Thursday, trading at 18.377 against the dollar at 11:30 a.m. in Istanbul and continuing its downward slide of more than 27% against the greenback this year.\n\nThe drop comes as investors are bracing for another potential interest rate cut – or simply a hold on the current rate – as Turkey refuses to follow economic orthodoxy in battling its soaring inflation, now at more than 80%.\n\nOr indeed, the investors that can still stomach Turkey's market volatility.\n\nThe Eurasian hub of 84 million people – which many major banks in Europe and the Middle East still have sizable exposure to, and which is highly exposed to geopolitical tensions – witnessed major market turbulence in recent days, on top of the dramatic currency drops of the last few years.\n\nThis week saw a major rout in Turkey's stock market, the Borsa Istanbul, with Turkish banking stocks diving 35% over the week ending last Monday, after clocking a stratospheric 150% rally between mid-July and mid-September. It prompted regulators and brokers to hold an emergency meeting, though ultimately they decided not to intervene in the market.\n\nThe cause of the volatility? First, Turkey's high inflation had pushed investors to pour their money into stocks to protect the value of their assets. But it was fear of higher U.S. inflation, and consequent rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, that likely triggered the sudden downward turn, analysts believe.\n\nThe drop wiped out more than $12.1 billion in market value from the country's publicly-listed banks.",

    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society. This cannot be allowed.",

    "Israel and Turkey’s leaders meet at U.N. after years of tension": "Listen 3 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nTEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, thawing a 14-year chill and heralding hopes of collaboration fueled by the possibility of exporting natural gas to an energy-desperate Europe. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Lapid’s office said that Tuesday’s meeting in New York was the first face-to-face encounter between leaders of the two countries since 2008 and that they discussed “economic and energy cooperation.”\n\nA month ago, Israel and Turkey announced a full restoration of diplomatic ties and exchange of ambassadors, a development that Lapid described as “an important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel.”\n\nTurkey, the first Muslim country to recognize Israel as a state and, before 2008, one of its strongest allies in the region, has over the past decade and a half intensely challenged Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. Erdogan has repeatedly made parallels between his own democratically elected Islamist party and Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, calling it “a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey’s increasing criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians caused diplomatic tumult. In 2010, Ankara recalled its ambassador after an Israeli naval commando raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla resulted in the deaths of 10 Turkish activists. Tensions again boiled over in 2018, following bloody protests on the Gaza border provoked by President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and Turkey and Israel recalled their respective ambassadors.\n\nBut the tide has turned in recent months, as Israel, exploiting its recently discovered offshore natural gas sites, seeks to export billions of cubic meters to a European market seeking to wean itself from Russian supplies.\n\nIsraeli gas is part of a global, patchwork energy strategy being forged by European leaders looking ahead to a potentially difficult winter. Russia’s pipeline gas today makes up 9 percent of all imported gas to the European Union, compared with 40 percent before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of this effort, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a deal with Israeli and Egyptian leaders in June that will enable Israel to pipe natural gas to Europe via Egyptian liquefaction facilities.\n\nAs a result of the diplomatic strain, Ankara abandoned talks years ago to build an underwater natural gas pipeline linking Israel to Europe via Turkey.\n\nBut Erdogan called a visit to Turkey in March by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the first in over a decade, “an opportunity to revive the cooperation on the topic of energy that began before.”\n\nAt his speech before the General Assembly on Tuesday, Erdogan highlighted energy as a priority in Turkey’s foreign policy.\n\n“Turkey has always looked at energy as a field of cooperation rather than competition,” he said. “In addition to our own needs, we have implemented many projects that support regional and global energy security.”\n\nZeynep Karatas in Istanbul contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Turkey and the Arab World: Ankara’s Shifting Relations and Evolving Foreign Policy": "Speakers Hürcan Aslı Aksoy Deputy Head of the Center for Applied Turkey Studies (CATS) German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) Meliha Altunışık Professor at the Department of International Relations Middle East Technical University Nicholas Danforth Senior Non-Resident Fellow Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP) Gönül Tol Founding Director of the Turkey program and Senior Fellow for the Frontier Europe Initiative Middle East Institute\n\nModerator Mustafa Gurbuz Senior Faculty in the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture American University\n\nAbout the Webinar\n\nFor much of the past decade, and especially following the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has developed a policy in the Arab world that is focused on projecting power, expanding the country’s influence, and pursuing nationalist and Islamist ideological objectives. Turkey’s efforts in this regard include backing popular uprisings, supporting Islamist movements, expanding military activities in Syria and Iraq, military intervention in Libya, and publicly criticizing Gulf states, Egypt, and Israel. In the last couple of years, however, Turkey has been recalibrating its foreign policy and attempting to normalize relations with other countries in the region. Ankara’s recent rapprochement with Saudi Arabia despite the Khashoggi murder in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul; its increasingly warm relations with Egypt, Israel, and the UAE; and its potential reconciliation with the Syrian regime all represent a broader strategy aimed at improving relations with former rivals in the region and at ending Turkey’s isolation. This policy shift also responds to geopolitical reconfigurations and growing competition, and seeks to address domestic economic and political challenges that President Erdoğan is facing, especially in the run-up to Turkey’s 2023 elections.\n\nArab Center Washington DC is convening a panel of experts to discuss Turkey’s evolving foreign policy and its shifting relations with the Arab world. Panelists will address both global and regional dynamics, factors impacting Ankara’s foreign policy considerations, and the question of whether these changes reflect a real shift in Turkey’s regional policy. Is Ankara sending mixed messages to regional actors and to Washington by renewing its relations with Israel and Gulf countries while also expanding its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean? How do these shifts relate to Turkey’s concerns regarding security, energy, and Kurdish aspirations for self-determination? What role do the upcoming Turkish elections play in its regional policies? And what are the likely scenarios for Turkey’s policy decisions if Erdogan loses these elections?",
    "Russian men are flying to Turkey to avoid military service in Ukraine": "Russian men are flying to Turkey to avoid military service in Ukraine\n\nRussia's call-up of additional troops has prompted many men to look for ways to avoid military service. Some of them are packing flights to Turkey.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThere are long car lines at Russian border crossings. Airplane flights out of the country are sold out or skyrocketing in price. This is after the Kremlin announced this week that Russia will be partially mobilizing hundreds of thousands of reservists to bolster their forces in Ukraine. NPR's Fatma Tanis is in Istanbul, where flights from Russia have been arriving with men trying to avoid military service. She spoke with some of them and joins us now.\n\nFatma, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nFATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Thank you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: You were at Istanbul's main airport yesterday, and what was the scene like?\n\nTANIS: Right. So first, I should note that Turkey is one of few countries that doesn't require a visa for Russians. Since they can't go to European Union countries or the U.S. easily, lots of Russians have been coming here. There are multiple flights every day from Russian cities to Istanbul and other places in Turkey. And nearly all of them have been booked solid for the next few weeks. Tickets were sold for upwards of $3,000, even.\n\nAt the airport, I found Russians coming in the arrivals terminal. Most of them were men, and many didn't want to talk because they're afraid of Russian government tracking them. One of them actually asked if I had a secret camera around as I was trying to interview him. But one thing really stood out. Most of the men had very little luggage, and that's because they had to convince Russian authorities that they were just leaving the country for a short trip, not to evade conscription.\n\nSIMON: So they have to act like they're not leaving to avoid the war. Were you able to speak with some of these men, and what did they tell you about how they got out?\n\nTANIS: Yes, they said it wasn't easy. After they heard the announcement, they rushed to find tickets, paid a lot of money, packed quickly. Then at the airports in Russia, they described crowds, long waits as men who tried to leave were being interrogated by police. And because they were concerned about government retribution, they didn't want to use their names when talking to me. But here's one 35-year-old man from Moscow describing the questioning he faced.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Police interrogated us. There was some question about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you service in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go?\n\nTANIS: He said nearly all of the people on his flight were men between the ages of 20 to 50, and he knows many more back in Russia who are desperately trying to leave, but it's very hard to find tickets now.\n\nSIMON: Fatma, did you get a sense of how they felt about the war, not just their own welfare, but the war generally?\n\nTANIS: I did. So the ones I spoke with said they were anti-war, and they believed that a full-on draft is coming soon. But they said that not only can you get in trouble for saying that publicly, it's caused divisions between friends and relatives. And people have been arrested for protesting the mobilization in Russia. There are even reports that they're getting drafted while in police custody to be sent in Ukraine. One man told me that for Russians who are anti-war today, there are only two choices - to leave the country or go to jail.\n\nSIMON: What do they plan to do now that they're out of Russia?\n\nTANIS: They have limited options. You know, they moved quickly to leave and were limited to taking out just $10,000 in cash. It's difficult to use the Russian payment system abroad because of sanctions. But while in Turkey, most said they'll try to get a residence permit, look for apartments and jobs so they can bring their families out of Russia, too. Some of them already have friends here. There's a Russian anti-war community already here that can help. They've been coming in large numbers since the invasion began in the spring.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Fatma Tanis in Istanbul.

    "US designated key operatives of IRGC Quds Force who work with Turkey’s intelligence chief": "Abdullah Bozkurt/Stockholm\n\nThe US designation of a Turkish-based money laundering network run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force hit the close associates of Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, a pro-Iranian Islamist figure.\n\nThe designation, announced by the US Treasury in May, sanctioned key operatives of the Quds Force that have secretly been working with Fidan for years. The information provided by US officials corroborated the findings of Turkish police, who had already identified the designated individuals as part of the Quds Force network during a criminal probe run by public prosecutors between 2011 and 2014.\n\nAccording to the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Turkish nationals Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı, Abdulhamit Çelik and Seyyid Cemal Gündüz worked with IRGC official Behnam Shahriyari in an international oil smuggling and money laundering network that generated hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe US move rings alarm bells for Turkish spy master Fidan, a confidant of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who was groomed in Shiite study circles during his youth and described as a high value asset by the IRGC.\n\nSummary of wiretaps from confidential Quds Force probe reveals how Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı said Turkish intelligence stopped monitoring him after Hakan Fidan, code-named Emin (trusted man) by Quds Force operatives, became the head of Turkish intelligence agency MIT:\n\nThe confidential Turkish probe into the Quds Force had already revealed Fidan’s secret contacts with Quds Force operatives including Şanlı and Shahriyari, the latter operating under the cover name of Sayed Ali Akber Mir Vakili. Shahriyari was part of an illegal cell based in Ankara working closely with Şanlı as well as with Faruk Koca, a former lawmaker, in communicating with Fidan.\n\nIn various intercepted communications, the cell members described Fidan as “Emin,” which means “trusted man” in Turkish. They used burner phones and changed the numbers used for communications every two or three months.\n\nŞanlı was arrested on May 13, 2000 and was sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison for involvement in terrorist plots targeting Turkish and US interests. The trial revealed how he and his associates helped set up the Quds Force network in the 1990s on the order of then-IRGC general Nasir Takipur. The group was designated as a terrorist group under the Turkish name of Tevhid Selam.\n\nBut he was freed in 2004 when the government of then-prime minister and now president Erdoğan pushed an amnesty bill through parliament, reducing sentences for some convicts. He was put to use again by his handlers after keeping a low profile for years and started running several operations including moving funds on behalf of the Quds Force, providing financial support for jailed Quds Force convicts and managing a recruitment and asset development program for Iranian intelligence in Ankara.\n\nThe launch of new operations and reactivating old assets by the Quds Force in Turkey came after a meeting of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Erdoğan in 2008. The Quds Force shifted into high gear after Erdoğan appointed Fidan, who had no experience in intelligence, as the head of intel agency MIT two years later.\n\nIn fact, the criminal probe into the Quds Force, listed under case file no.2011/762, revealed how Iranian and Turkish operatives working for the Quds Force were pleased with the appointment of Fidan as the head spy master.\n\nIn a wiretap dated May 24, 2013, Şanlı said he had been under surveillance by MIT after he got out of prison but that that stopped after Fidan took over the agency. What they did not know, however, was that Turkish police, under orders from veteran counterterrorism prosecutors, were actually looking into the Quds Force after receiving tips about increased illegal activities from local contacts in Turkey as well as terror plot alerts passed to Turkey by the US and Israel.\n\nThe wiretaps, surveillance records, documents and other evidence obtained during that probe exposed senior officials in the Erdoğan government as conspirators in facilitating IRGC Quds Force operations.\n\nLike Şanlı, his associate Çelik also has a long rap sheet in the Turkish criminal justice system. In 1996 Çelik was convicted of killing two opponents of the Iranian regime in Turkey and sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison, though he was released in 2004 as a result of an amnesty. He admitted in testimony in May 2000 as part of the Tevhid Selam probe that he had been trained for over two months in Iran to stage attacks in Turkey and conduct intelligence operations on behalf of Iran.\n\nGündüz, another associate of Şanlı, was also red flagged in the Turkish probe. Married to an Iranian woman, Gündüz has had contacts with Iranian intelligence since the 1980s and established businesses in both Iran and Turkey.\n\nThe IRGC Quds Force case in Turkey never went to trial because the Erdoğan government hushed it up in February 2014 after learning about the probe. The investigating prosecutor was sacked before he had a chance to secure detention warrants for the suspects or file an indictment. The suspects avoided the long arm of the law thanks to the intervention of Erdoğan, who apparently protected pro-Iranian assets and helped their Quds Force handlers escape from Turkey.\n\nIrfan Fidan, the new prosecutor, personally selected by Erdoğan to torpedo the Quds Force probe, dropped all the charges against the Iranian and Turkish nationals who were identified as part of Quds Force cells. Fidan also launched a new criminal case against everyone who was involved in the investigation into the Quds Force and ordered the detention of the police chiefs who uncovered the sophisticated Iranian network in Turkey. Fidan was rewarded by the Erdoğan government for squelching the probe and appointed as a member of the Constitutional Court in 2020.",

(AFP)\n\nShort Url https://arab.news/pu638\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been away from Turkey for two successive occasions in recent days. One was his participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.

Erdogan, for the sake of teasing Russian President Vladimir Putin, told him: “Admit Turkey as a member to the SCO and we will revise our relations with the EU.” Erdogan’s words were actually reflecting Turkey’s weariness with the slow progress regarding its EU accession process. Then the joke evolved to become a serious proposal.\n\nTurkey officially applied to get involved in the SCO’s activities and was invited to join the organization as a dialogue partner. Following this move, there was a shower of criticisms and comments on whether Turkey should have any sort of relations with such an organization. Erdogan has said: “Inevitably, we may be looking for other ways, as the EU has not let us in for 52 years. The EU may ask why Erdogan is going to Shanghai, why he met the SCO leaders. Of course, I will meet. I don’t think that I owe any explanation to the EU.”\n\nThere will likely be proponents and opponents of Turkey becoming a full member of the SCO, but it is only natural for Ankara to cooperate with the world’s most populous countries, such as China and India. Furthermore, Turkey has ethnic and cultural ties with the Turkic countries in Central Asia, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. There is also a strong Turkic community in the Xinjiang province of China.\n\nThe geostrategic location of Turkey allows it to control Russia’s access to the “warm seas.” Erdogan and Putin are the two leaders who meet most frequently. Despite this, Turkey does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea and considers its invasion of Ukraine to be illegal. Furthermore, it has played a crucial role in unblocking the supply of Ukrainian grain to the world’s markets.\n\nTurkey is a country that has vested interests in both the transatlantic community and in Asian countries. It neighbors two Middle Eastern countries in deep crisis, Syria and Iraq. If such a country were to shift sides, it would have a heavy impact on the power balance between West and East.\n\nThe second visit that Erdogan made was to New York for his participation in the UNGA. While almost all world leaders were in London for Queen Elizabeth’s funeral at the beginning of last week, Erdogan was one of the notable absentees. He probably declined the invitation because he did not want to follow the advice of the UK authorities to avoid private planes.\n\nTurkey is a country that has vested interests in both the transatlantic community and in Asian countries. Yasar Yakis\n\nHis main reason for traveling to New York was actually to try and hold a private meeting as a showcase with US President Joe Biden. There were no scheduled meetings in either Biden’s program or that of Erdogan, but the latter maintained his hope of holding even a short private meeting with the president for the sake of boosting his image before next year’s elections in Turkey. Such a meeting did not materialize.\n\nErdogan’s disillusionment became even greater when the Greek authorities proudly announced that Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis had held a cordial meeting with President Biden. Turkey must have understood the message as being that, if the US has to choose between Turkey and Greece, it will choose Greece.\n\nErdogan did meet Sens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons in an effort to persuade them to sell Turkey 40 F-16 fighter aircraft and 80 modernization kits. After his meeting with the senators, Erdogan said that his interlocutors used positive language on the question of the F-16s. This is despite Graham tweeting in 2019: “Good decision by President (Trump) to work with Congress to impose crippling sanctions against Turkey.” The profitable defense industry may have persuaded Graham to change his mind.\n\nThere are other congressmen who are opposed to such a sale and are eagerly working to attach conditions to the use of these aircraft, preventing them from being used in circumstances that would not be endorsed by the US, such as against Kurdish terrorists in Turkey, Iraq and Syria. In response, Turkey questions why it should buy defense equipment that it will not be able to make full use of. In a sense, the US would be limiting the defense capabilities of a NATO ally.\n\nErdogan’s visit was overly publicized in the pro-government media, but dissimulating the disillusionment does not change the reality.\n\n• Yasar Yakis is a former foreign minister of Turkey and founding member of the ruling AK Party.\n\nTwitter: @yakis_yasar\n\nDisclaimer: Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not necessarily reflect Arab News' point of view",
    "Turkey working to organize Zelensky-Putin meeting – Cavusoglu": "Turkey continues to make efforts to hold a meeting between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, believing that they can make a decision about a \"just peace.\"\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said this in Tokyo, where he arrived for the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Ukrinform reports, citing TRT Haber.\n\n\"There must be a just peace, of course, especially for Ukraine. Because the lands occupied (by Russia) belong to Ukraine. Of course, actors who want the war to continue outside of these two countries also need to be convinced. As Turkey, we have not lost hope. We are increasing and continuing our efforts. Our goal is a meeting of both leaders and decision-making at the level of the leaders,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nHe also said that there are no winners in the war, and as soon as both sides realize this, they can return to the negotiating table.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President's Office, earlier said that there is currently no sense in holding negotiations between Ukraine and Russia or a meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.\n\nAt the same time, he added, the meeting of the presidents is possible if it is preceded by the complete withdrawal of Russian troops, and the subject of the conversation will be the \"discussion of post-war life, including the scope of reparations, compensation for damages and the extradition of criminals.\"",
    "Queer singer tries to create space for discussion in Turkey": "September 23, 2022\n\nIstanbul, Turkey — In early August, Fatih Karaca, better known as Mabel Matiz, stood on stage in Istanbul. As the first chords of one of his most famous songs, \"Alaimisema,\" an old Turkish word meaning “rainbow,” began to swell, he spoke to the sold-out crowd.\n\n“Humans are creatures that are very susceptible to excluding the other, to alienating the other, to becoming hostile, to excluding what they do not know,” Matiz said. “But underneath all that, I think we all know that we are the same deep down.”\n\nMatiz knows this intimately. Despite his queer identity, Matiz is beloved by fans across the political and religious spectrum. He says his music creates a space where people in Turkey can explore controversial topics — a space ever-rarer in a politically and culturally polarized country.\n\n“I have worked hard to create music that can share a common point with everyone,” Matiz told Al-Monitor.\n\nHe was born in 1985 in a small town in southern Turkey. A solitary child, he says music was his “savior,” a way to explore the wider world and a form of expression. When young he had a stutter, but when he sang, it disappeared.\n\nWhen he moved to Istanbul in the early 2000s to study dentistry, the city teemed with youthful energy. Many were hopeful that the election of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in 2002 would lead to a more liberal environment, as the party then espoused a more open stance on rights for minority groups, including LGBTQ people.\n\nIn 2008, he started a page on MySpace, then a popular social media site, under the pseudonym Mabel Matiz. Mabel was a name from a character in a book by Buket Uzuner, \"Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna.\" Matiz was derived from the ancient Greek word for “drunkard.”\n\nWithin two years, Matiz was one of the most popular names on Turkey’s MySpace. Listeners and producers were taken by his fusion of pop, rock, and Turkish folk. His lyrics wove together folklore and poetry with urban stories.\n\n“My songs can talk about anything. They could talk about a story in a village or the back streets of Berlin, they could talk about a love affair or a more spiritual, divine kind of love,” he said.\n\nIn 2011, the underground success of his first album, “Mabel Matiz,” allowed him to pivot full-time to music. Now, Matiz has four albums, over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and his YouTube videos get more than 5 million views.\n\nBut in the meanwhile, Turkey has seen a dramatic rise in homophobia, as the AKP seeks to shore up its conservative base.\n\nLast week, Turkey’s largest-ever anti-LGBT rally took place in Istanbul, with signs that called queer people “perverts.”\n\n“In the last two years, the government has ramped up the anti-LGBT [stance],” Kenan Sharpe, an academic who studies Turkish pop culture, told Al-Monitor. “It’s become a specific policy of theirs, this culture war they’re trying to start.”\n\nFollowing the Gezi Park protests of 2013, the government has hardened its rhetoric against LGBTQ people, many of whom joined the protests.\n\nIn 2021, Erdogan said there was “no such thing as LGBT” people in Turkey. Pride marches have been banned since 2015.\n\n“The LGBTI+ community is under great pressure,\" Matiz said. \"What happens every year at Pride saddens me.”\n\nDespite the increasingly hostile climate, on July 1 — just days after police violently cracked down on this year’s Pride events — Matiz released his controversial recent hit \"Karakol\" or \"Copshop,\" gaining more than 17 million views to date.\n\nThe video depicts a young man leaning on Matiz’s knee as Matiz sings that his heart has been “put in the police station,” and his love put in a grave. He compares his lover to forbidden fruit.\n\nThe song and video were met with an outpouring of both praise and outrage. The head of Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog RTUK reportedly called television stations, demanding they not air the clip.\n\nDespite that, Matiz was pleased that the song got people talking.\n\nAccording to Ozan Korkmaz, Matiz’s manager, censorship has failed to scrap the song's impact as it inspired rare and important conversations.\n\n“I think it is very, very critical to make people think about it, talk a little, feel something different even within themselves, by throwing something new at them from time to time,” Korkmaz told Al-Monitor.\n\nAs he works on a fifth album that’s slated to be released in early 2023, Matiz says he will write more songs exploring similar themes.\n\n“I'm not afraid,” he said. “There is no room for such fear in my life or my head.”",
    "The roots of Turkey's balancing act with Russia on Ukraine": "Often exasperating to Western powers, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is performing a difficult balancing act ultimately designed to help him retain power in the 2023 elections despite a deeply troubled economy.\n\nJust a few days before reports came out about the territorial gains of the Ukrainian army in the country’s northeast region, Erdogan had warned the West not to “underestimate Russia” and criticized its “provocation-based policy” toward Putin.\n\nIt was one of several previous episodes where Turkey surprised its watchers, wherever they might stand on the war in Ukraine.\n\nI have given more than a dozen interviews and lectures on Turkey’s foreign policy in Ukraine since the start of Putin’s “special military operation” in February 2022. Two questions came up in nearly every single one of them. The first was whether Turkey was effectively on both sides of the war in Ukraine. The second asked if Turkey’s positioning was an asset or liability for the Western alliance, especially in the context of NATO’s support for Ukraine. The answer to the first question is a simple yes. The second, however, needs a lot more elaboration.\n\nTurkey (or Türkiye, as the country now demands to be called) stands at a key juncture between the West and Russia. This position, both politically and geographically, has fundamentally shaped its Ukraine policy.\n\nOn the one hand, Turkey is a U.S. ally and a longstanding and critical member of NATO as the alliance’s second largest troop contributor. The country served key roles in the NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Even though it was not taken up, Turkey had also offered to operate the Kabul airport after Washington’s withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. And even though its relations with the United States have strained more than quite a bit over the last decade, Turkey still considers itself a U.S. ally and has no intentions to sever ties.\n\nOn the other hand, Turkey maintains strong relations with Russia especially in terms of trade. The country is one of the biggest buyers of Russian natural gas and exports food products and chemicals worth billions of dollars. Turkey also attracts millions of Russian tourists each year with its affordable beach resorts and visa-free travel regime with its Black Sea neighbor. Most importantly, the two countries have forged increasingly critical security and defense relationships in the last few years. The most critical of these include their military coordination in Syria and, of course, Turkey’s controversial purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system in 2017.\n\nThat is quite some baggage. And Turkey has been maintaining a balancing act in Ukraine precisely because of it.\n\nFor instance, Turkey declared the “special military operation” in Ukraine a “war” soon after its onset. Doing so, Ankara exercised its Montreux Convention rights to close the straits, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, to outbound Russian battleships. Ankara also provided the now infamous Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine early on in the conflict, and once again more recently. The drones helped Ukraine achieve some early tactical gains that bolstered morale when it was most needed.\n\nYet, unlike its Western allies, Turkey did not close its airspace to Russian aircraft, nor did it impose any economic sanctions on Russia. In fact, the country has doubled its gas imports from Russia and monetized its visa-free travel regime at a time when it has become increasingly difficult for Russians to get Schengen visas for Europe.\n\nClearly, Turkey is on both sides of the war. But is its position an asset or liability for the West?\n\nThere are two ways to answer that question. Some would argue that Turkey’s positioning is an asset not just for the West but for the developing world as well. Ankara was able to negotiate the deal that lifted the Odessa port blockade and allowed the shipment of Ukrainian grain, potentially mitigating a global food crisis. Turkey was able to mediate between Ukraine and Russia precisely because it has chosen to hedge its bets on both sides of the conflict. Further, Turkey’s position may also have played some role in preventing further escalation between NATO and Russia, such as stalling Finland and Sweden’s NATO bids earlier this spring.\n\nOthers would certainly argue, however, that Turkey has proven to be an unpredictable ally that undermines the West’s determination to stand against Russian aggression. After all, one man’s balancing act is another’s lack of commitment. Given the importance of credibility in international relations, especially for organizations of democratic states like NATO, Turkey’s “half-hearted” approach to the war in Ukraine can be considered a liability for NATO’s resolve and its ability to deter Russia in the future, further destabilizing the region.\n\nSo what is Erdogan’s endgame?\n\nIt has become impossible to understand Turkey’s foreign policy, including its Ukraine policy, without understanding the country’s domestic politics and Erdogan’s future in it.\n\nNational elections in Turkey are coming up in 2023, which will also mark the republic’s centennial. The race has enormous political and symbolic significance for Erdogan and his AKP. After having lost the mayorships of Turkey’s three largest cities to opposition candidates in 2018, Erdogan has vowed to renew his and his party’s mandate next year. That looks like an increasingly difficult challenge, however, given the country’s grim economic outlook. Turkey’s currency, the lira, has lost more than half of its value against the dollar since 2021. Interest rates remain shockingly low (it’s personal for Erdogan) and prices have shot up nearly 100 percent in major cities like Istanbul. The opposition bloc is energetic and hopeful even though they have yet to decide on their presidential candidate.\n\nPerhaps for the first time, electoral defeat is a very likely outcome for Erdogan next year. Turkey’s position in Ukraine is directly tethered to his political future. He cannot turn his back to Russia and send the country’s economy into a tailspin. Instead, he pursues this difficult balancing act that he packages as Turkey’s “strategic autonomy” in foreign policy while scoring additional points by mediating high-profile negotiations between the warring parties. “Turkey doesn’t take orders from others; we are a key actor in the region and the makers of our own foreign policy” is a powerful and compelling message that attracts voters from every corner of Turkish society. He needs popular support more than ever, and his Ukraine policy might just help him get it.",
    "Americans Face Tight Turkey Supplies, Higher Prices for Thanksgiving": "The US’ ongoing turkey shortage will intensify in the runup to Thanksgiving. If that sounds familiar, consider this - the number of turkeys available for slaughter between now and Thanksgiving is only 0.7% above 2020 levels and turkey cold storage quantities are currently at a 22-year low.\n\nThe US turkey flock is also being whittled down by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak that started just ahead of wild birds’ spring migratory season. In the US, about 6.5 million turkeys — roughly 3% of annual production — have been administratively destroyed because of HPAI, including half a million since August 29.\n\nThe darker shades of green in this chart show which states have experienced the most turkey deaths linked to this year’s HPAI outbreak.\n\nGro’s Bird Flu Outbreak Monitor shows how the epidemic has progressed and which parts of the country it has most affected. The summertime bird deaths levels correspond with the lack of seasonal migration of wild birds, which are believed to significantly increase the spread of the virus. The monitor also shows the US’ top turkey producing state, Minnesota, has suffered the highest losses of turkeys from HPAI (3.2 million lost of 40 million produced), but the greatest proportional losses have occurred in South Dakota (1.5 million lost of 12 million produced).\n\nThis is bad news for Thanksgiving hosts as wholesale turkey prices are already at $1.10 per pound, 10% above their all-time high, and expected to climb to about $1.20 per pound, 25% higher than last year’s price as the holiday approaches. The previous wholesale turkey price record of $0.97 per pound was set ahead of Thanksgiving of the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak.\n\nElevated food price inflation will likely factor into Thanksgiving planning this year. While year-over-year inflation is down from a recent peak in March, food prices are still 8.5% above year-ago levels, according to Gro’s US Food Price Index, which reflects prices based on consumption of a wide range of food items.\n\nStill, few Americans are likely to skimp on the holiday’s signature dish. And with higher COVID-19 vaccination rates and an almost steady decline in new cases since the mid-January peak, this year’s Thanksgiving gatherings are expected to bear a closer resemblance to pre-pandemic celebrations.\n\nGetting US turkey production back to pre-pandemic levels will take time. Last year, US turkey production was 7.2 billion pounds, 3.9% lower than 2019’s production level. This is because turkey producers could not increase production fast enough to meet 2021’s Thanksgiving demand, which surged as COVID-19 vaccine came out. Turkey production is a 54-week process. It takes 32 weeks to raise a layer, another month to incubate an egg, and 18 weeks to grow out a Thanksgiving turkey.",
    "SDF receives more than 100 civilians forcibly deported from Turkey": "The SDF has received more than 100 civilians, including elders, women, and children, in areas close to the front lines in the village of Al-TirwazIya, in the eastern countryside of Raqqa. The 100 civilians had been forcibly deported from the refugee camps located in the Turkish Occupying State.\n\nUpon their arrival in their areas, the SDF provided them with relief assistance and first aid. They were exhausted and stranded. Moreover, some of them were urgently hospitalized since they were tortured by the Turkish police.\n\nOne of the forcibly deported men said, “While I was on my way to work, suddenly the Turkish police arrested me without any accusation. I was subjected to severe torture at the police station, and then they transferred me to a prison-like camp in the desert surrounded by a fence with tight security.”\n\nHe added, “They promised the Syrians to grant them citizenship cards, but they were lying. Turkey treated us badly, and no one defended us. The Turkish police force Syrian refugees to sign a deportation document by which the deportee becomes banned from entering Turkish territory for five years.”\n\nAnother deportee said, “The Turkish army tortured us brutally when we were arrested at the border, some of us fainted due to brutal torture.”\n\nThese criminal practices by the Turkish Occupying State attest to its inhuman nature.",
    "Can the SCO be Turkey’s alternative to the West?": "Erdogan suggests Turkey will seek full membership of the Russia and China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation amid strained ties with the West.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed his NATO-member country’s intention to become a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), suggesting Ankara is seeking alternatives to its problematic ties with the West.\n\nErdogan, who made the remarks after attending last week’s SCO summit in Uzbekistan, was also quoted as saying by the Turkish media that the SCO’s 2023 meeting in India will be a venue to discuss this prospect further.\n\nChina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India and Uzbekistan are the full members of the of the political, economic, and security organisation.\n\nAfghanistan, Belarus, Iran, and Mongolia are SCO observer countries, while Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey are the bloc’s dialogue partners.\n\n“Our ties with these countries will be moved to a much different position,” Erdogan told reporters on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if he meant Turkey would seek to become a member of the organisation, the president said: “Of course, that’s the target.”\n\nThe SCO is not seen as an alternative to NATO, a military alliance with collective defence responsibilities under Article 5 of its founding treaty, which considers an armed attack against one or more members to be considered “an attack against all”.\n\nMensur Akgun, a professor of international relations, told Al Jazeera that the SCO is an hybrid bloc that seeks to prevent a vacuum in Central and South Asia through cooperation.\n\n“It aims to increase dialogue and cooperation, solve problems among its members when needed and stand in solidarity with one another against interventions in the region by outside powers,” he said, adding that the SCO is closer to the model of the European Union than to NATO.\n\n“An organisation that has arch-rivals India and Pakistan under its umbrella would not be able to have automatic military interdependence like NATO has,” Akgun said.\n\nAkgun also said that growing political and economic ties between Turkey and Russia in recent years contributed to Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership, especially considering Turkey’s often tense relations with Western powers.\n\nTurkey bought Russia’s S-400 defence systems, which prompted US sanctions in addition to Turkey’s removal from a US-led programme developing F-35 fighter jets. Russia is also building Turkey’s first nuclear power plant and the two countries signed an economic cooperation deal in August.\n\nEven though Turkey and Russia backed opposing sides in Syria’s war, the two countries have largely coordinated closely during the conflict.\n\nThe Turkish government has also taken a balanced stance over Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. It has provided Ukraine with arms, in particular with drones, but it has not imposed sanctions on Russia and criticised what it calls Western policies “based on provocations” towards Moscow.\n\nAnkara has tried to act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict and helped broker an agreement in July for Ukrainian grain ships to sail to outside markets.\n\nStrained ties with the West\n\nGalip Dalay, a nonresident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said that Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership stem from Ankara’s tensions with the West.\n\n“Whenever there is discontent with the West – in particular, with the US [over] the perception that Turkey is treated unfairly – the idea of alternatives come up,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“And because of that Ankara currently believes Turkey’s interests are better served by a balancing act between different centres of powers – meaning China, Russia and the West,” Dalay said.\n\nAnkara has also been at odds with the US and certain EU member states over their support for Syrian Kurdish fighters who allied with the West in the fight against ISIL (ISIS) in the war-torn country.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), the main part of the anti-ISIL alliance, to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been fighting against the Turkish state for decades.\n\nErdogan threatened to block Sweden and Finland’s NATO bids over what he said was their support for these groups, but lifted his opposition after a meeting with US President Joe Biden in June.\n\nFollowing the move, Biden expressed support for sales of F-16 jets to Turkey – warplanes currently in use and inferior to the F-35s in development. However, he needs the approval of the US Congress for the move.\n\nIn July, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment creating a new hurdle for Biden’s plan to sell F-16s to Turkey, imposing strict conditions to any sales.\n\nErdogan said last week that his government might consider other options if the US is unable to fulfil its promise to provide the jets.\n\nRecently, escalating tensions in the Mediterranean Sea between NATO members Turkey and Greece have also prompted the EU and the US to condemn Turkey.\n\nAnkara and Athens are at odds over an array of issues such as overflights, the status of islands between the two countries, maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon resources.\n\nHowever, Akgun believes that Turkey is unlikely to gain SCO membership for several reasons, considering the bloc’s structure and purposes.\n\n“Turkey’s membership to the SCO does not seem possible as a NATO member and an EU candidate, but also because it is currently geographically and politically irrelevant to the SCO’s purposes of existence,” Akgun said.",

    "218 Ships Have Left Ukraine Under Black Sea Export Deal, While U.S. Thanksgiving Turkey Prices in Focus": "Reuters writer Pavel Polityuk reported late last week that, “A total of 211 ships with 4.7 million tonnes of agricultural products on board have left Ukraine so far under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry said on Saturday.”\n\nAnd yesterday, Reuters writer Max Hunder reported that, “Seven more ships laden with agricultural produce left Ukrainian ports on Sunday, the country’s infrastructure ministry said, bringing the total to 218 since a U.N.-brokered corridor through the Black Sea came into force at the start of August.”\n\nHunder noted that, “In a post on Facebook, the ministry said this brought the total amount of agricultural produce shipped through the corridor to 4.85 million tonnes.\n\n“‘On September 25 … 7 ships with 146.2 thousand tons of agricultural produce for countries in Africa, Asia and Europe left the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi,’ the ministry said.\n\n“Ukraine shipped up to 6 million tonnes of grain per month before the war.”\n\nIn a separate Reuters article late last week, Pavel Polityuk reported that, “Ukraine’s 2022 grain harvest could total between 54.1 to 55.7 million tonnes compared with a record 86 million tonnes due to the Russian invasion which has reduced the harvested area, analyst APK-Inform said on Saturday.”\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters writer David Ljunggren reported last week that, “Russia will maintain contact with the United Nations about a deal to export grain from Ukrainian ports, but says concrete results are needed, Tass news agency cited a senior official as saying on Friday.\n\n“It also cited Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin as saying Russia had a positive assessment of the U.N.’s efforts to resume the export of Russian fertilizers.”\n\nMore broadly, Reuters writer Ana Mano reported on Friday that, “South American soybean production will hit a record high in the season that is now being planted, agribusiness consultancy Datagro said on Friday, citing an expected area expansion to an all-time high.\n\n“South American farmers will reap an estimated 219.34 million tonnes in the 2022/2023 season from a planted area of 66.09 million hectares (163.3 million acres), according to Datagro’s first estimate for the new crop.”\n\nIan Austen indicated on Saturday at The New York Times Online that, “Forecasters anticipate near-record harvests for wheat and other crops from Canadian farmers this year. It is a remarkable reversal from 2021, the season of scorching temperatures and parching drought that devastated farms throughout Western Canada.”\n\nAusten noted that, “Statistics Canada is projecting that the harvests of wheat, canola, barley, oats, soybeans and corn will all be up this year, many of them by double-digit percentages, because of milder weather. The wheat crop, a mainstay of Canada’s farm exports, is expected to increase by 55.6 percent from last year, to 34.7 million metric tons. If that forecast proves correct, it will be one of the top three harvests on record going back to 1908.”\n\nIn more specific developments in the U.S., Reuters writer David Shepardson reported late last week that, “The U.S. Energy Department on Friday issued a plan detailing a government-wide strategy for ramping up production and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\n\n“In September 2021, the Biden administration launched a government challenge to supply at least 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and have enough SAF by 2050 ‘to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand, currently projected to be around 35 billion gallons a year.’ U.S. airlines have pledged to work with the government to make 3 billion gallons of SAF available to aircraft operators by 2030.”\n\nAnd Bloomberg writers Diego Lasarte, Elizabeth Elkin, and Michael Hirtzer reported on Friday that,\n\nTurkeys are selling for record high prices ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday as a resurgence of bird flu wipes out supplies across the US.\n\n“Avian influenza is devastating egg and turkey operations in the heartland of the country. If just one bird gets it, the entire flock is culled in order to stop the spread. Millions of hens and turkeys have been killed in recent weeks. As a result, prices for turkey hens are nearly 30% higher than a year ago and 80% above pre-pandemic costs.\n\n“Just as concerning are inventories of whole turkeys, which are the lowest going into the US winter holiday season since 2006.

Meanwhile, wholesale egg prices are at $3.62 a dozen as of Wednesday, the highest ever, up from a previous record of $3.45 a dozen set earlier this year, said John Brunnquell, chief executive officer of Egg Innovations, one of the biggest US producers of free-range eggs.\n\n“Consumers have seen prices for eggs at grocery stores triple this year, while turkey meat rose a record-setting 60%, according to a Cobank report.”",
    "Ombudsman reveals conditions of stay of Azov Regiment commanders in Turkey": "The Azov Regiment commanders, freed during Ukraine–Russia prisoner exchange last week, now stay in good conditions in Turkey.\n\n\"They are in good conditions there, under the personal, let's say, guarantee of the President of Turkey. All the conditions for a safe normal life were created for them, as far as possible. And the only condition that was put forward to them as part of the prisoner exchange is a restriction and ban on returning to Ukraine while the war against the Russian Federation continues in our country,\" Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said during the nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\nAccording to him, this condition made their release possible through the mediation of the President of Turkey and the personal assistance of the President of Ukraine.\n\nLubinets added that he was not aware of any restrictions on the movement of freed commanders. In particular, in Turkey they meet, including, with representatives of Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked whether the five Azov Regiment commanders will be able to talk with Ukrainian journalists, the Ombudsman expressed the opinion that this would happen but did not outline the terms.\n\nThe Commissioner also emphasized that the authorities had the task to return absolutely all captives, and public comments on certain processes in this area can sometimes hinder the next steps. He underscored that the work on the return of Ukrainian citizens from Russian captivity was ongoing.\n\n\"We are constantly working towards the release of both prisoners of war and civilian captives. Our goal is to liberate absolutely everyone. This process does not stop, it is permanent. Even when we already have an exchange, we agree on the next steps,\" he said, adding that \"some nuances we cannot and will not say publicly.\"\n\nAt the same time, Lubinets noted that no groups of prisoners were prioritized. The authorities work towards the return of service members from Snake Island, the National Guard members captured in the Chornobyl zone, and other Ukrainian defenders.\n\nThe relevant officials also deal with the release of civilian captives, some of whom were sentenced to 15, 17, 19 years in prison in the Russian Federation.\n\nAs reported, more than 200 Ukrainian defenders, as well as 10 foreigners who fought on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, returned from Russian captivity within the prisoner swap on September 21.\n\nThe five freed Azov Regiment commanders will stay in Turkey until the end of the full-scale war under the personal security guarantees of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nol",
    "Turkey: Plastic Recycling Harms Health, Environment": "(Istanbul) – Plastic recycling in Turkey is harming the health of many people and degrading the environment for everyone, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.\n\nThe 88-page report, “‘It’s as If They’re Poisoning Us’: The Health Impacts of Plastic Recycling in Turkey,” documents the consequences of the Turkish government’s ineffective response to the health and environmental impacts of plastic recycling on the right to health. Air pollutants and toxins emitted from recycling affect workers, including children, and people living near recycling facilities.\n\nThe government fails to enforce laws and regulations that require strict licensing and regular, thorough inspections of recycling facilities and occupational health, greatly exacerbating facilities’ impacts on health and the environment. Plastic waste imported from the European Union is significantly contributing to these abuses.\n\n“Turkey has regulations to protect people and the environment, but a lack of enforcement is increasing people’s risk of serious, life-long health conditions,” said Krista Shennum, Gruber Fellow in the Environment and Human Rights division at Human Rights Watch. “The government of Turkey needs to do more to meet its obligations to protect people from the effects of toxic plastic recycling.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 64 people, including 26 who currently work or previously worked in plastic recycling facilities in Istanbul and Adana and 21 who live near plastic recycling facilities. Five of the workers were children at the time of the interview, and four adults interviewed began working in a plastic recycling facility as children.\n\nWorkers and residents of neighboring communities described respiratory problems, severe headaches, skin ailments, lack of protective equipment, and little to no access to medical treatment for occupational illnesses. Many of the facilities Human Rights Watch visited were located dangerously close to homes, in contravention of Turkish laws and environmental regulations.\n\nTo be recycled, plastic waste is shredded, washed, melted at high temperatures, and then turned into pellets. This process emits air pollutants and toxins that, without adequate protections, can contribute to short-term health problems, including asthma, difficulty breathing, and eye irritation. Scientists have also linked exposure to these toxins to an increased risk of cancer, neurological impacts, and reproductive system harm. In addition, plastics are made from fossil fuels and toxic additives and also release significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the climate crisis.\n\nSince the Chinese government banned plastic waste imports in 2018, many countries in the Global North have scrambled to find new destinations for their plastic waste. Because of its geographic proximity, strong trade relations with the European Union, and status as an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member, Turkey has become the primary destination for the EU’s plastic waste, receiving nearly half of the EU’s plastic waste exports in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMany recycling facility workers are from the most vulnerable populations in Turkey and include children, refugees, and undocumented migrants. Some workers, including undocumented migrants, said they do not have access to medical services if they get sick or are injured in the workplace. Fear over losing their jobs made workers wary about raising concerns with their employers over harmful working conditions, including working without access to personal protective equipment.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that children work in plastic recycling facilities in Turkey even though Turkish law prohibits them from working in such hazardous conditions and the exposure to pollution and toxins is especially damaging to their health.\n\n“There’s a huge cauldron where they’re cooking the material, they keep adding water which comes back up as steam,” said a 20-year-old waste picker in Adana who had worked at a plastic recycling center as a child. “When I inhaled that, it would feel like my lungs were squeezed and under pressure … I stopped working there two months ago, but I still have a problem with breathing.”\n\nResidents of neighboring communities said intense odors and pollution from plastic recycling prevent them from sleeping, opening their windows, and spending time outside.\n\n“My 27-year-old sister died of colon cancer, this was 10 years ago,” said a 35-year-old man whose family lived for decades near recycling facilities. He believes that living near recycling facilities is a factor in the deaths of four relatives. “My brother died at 34 years of lung cancer four years ago. I believe it is the effect of the recycling plants.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that workers and nearby residents are not provided with basic information about levels of toxins in their environment, risks from those toxic exposures, or ways to minimize those risks despite the law requiring Turkish authorities and employers to monitor conditions and share this information.\n\nWhile it is mandatory for plastic recycling facilities to acquire licenses and permits from the relevant authorities, it is unclear exactly how many meet this requirement and how many operate without licenses. Licenses require adherence to environmental and occupational health standards that would limit health risks. For licensed facilities, environmental, occupational health, and labor inspections often fail to adequately examine environmental and health conditions.\n\nHuman Rights Watch wrote to key ministries and municipalities in Turkey to share initial research findings and seek information on plastic recycling facilities, air quality data, inspection reports, rates of illness related to toxic exposure, plastic waste import data, and child labor. In some cases, Human Rights Watch did not receive a response. In other instances, the responses received were incomplete and did not provide answers to the questions posted. For example, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change said that it had undertaken thousands of inspections of waste disposal and recycling facilities since 2018 and fined facilities and closed unlicensed ones. Yet, the ministry did not provide specific data for plastic recycling facilities, and the findings of Human Rights Watch's report show the need for more resolute steps to address pervasive violations of the right to health.\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change should conduct independent and thorough inspections of recycling facilities to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to make information about the risks of air pollution and toxin exposure readily available and accessible, Human Rights Watch said. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security should enforce Turkey’s ban on child labor in hazardous workplaces, including plastic recycling facilities.\n\nCountries that export plastic waste, including those in the EU, should take steps to more effectively manage their plastic waste domestically, rather than shipping their waste to countries with weak or inadequate government enforcement of environmental and labor regulations. The Turkish government should reinstate the ban on imported plastic waste for recycling, which it introduced in July 2021 but quickly lifted.\n\n“Europe’s wealthiest countries are sending their trash to Turkey, consigning some of Turkey’s most vulnerable communities, including children, refugees and migrants, to serious environmental and health risks,” Shennum said. “The EU and individual plastic-exporting countries should take responsibility for their own plastic waste, end the export of plastic to Turkey, and reduce the amount of plastic they produce and consume.”",
    "Women in Turkey Protest Iranian Woman's Death": "A group of Iranians living in Istanbul and Turkish citizens gathered Wednesday in front of the Iranian Consulate in Istanbul to protest the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran.\n\nIstanbul police, who on Tuesday repeatedly dispersed groups that gathered in Taksim Square, watched the action from afar.\n\nDuring the demonstration, at least three women cut their hair to protest the treatment of Amini, who was detained by Iran's morality police because she didn't wear her headscarf correctly and therefore her hair was showing. She later died while in custody.\n\nProtesters shouted slogans in Persian, Turkish and Kurdish. The Turkish chants included, \"We do not keep silent, we do not fear, we do not obey,\" and \"My body, my decision.\"\n\nThe Persian and Kurdish slogans included, \"Women live freely\" and \"We do not want a mullah regime.\"\n\nBanners carried by the group of about 300 people included harsh criticism against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iranian regime.\n\nMahdi Sağlar, one of the Iranians who participated in the protest, has been living and working in Turkey for 20 years.\n\n\"They beat a girl to death because her hair was showing,\" Sağlar told VOA Turkish. \"Their own children dress as they want in Europe and America, they behave as they want, but in Iran, they arrested her because her hair is out, and they killed her by causing a brain hemorrhage with a blow to the brain at the police station. We are here to protest this. Our citizens in Iran are protesting here on the street as well.''\n\nGelare Abdi, another Iranian protester, said that although she loves her homeland very much, she can't live in her country due to heavy pressure.\n\n\"I need freedom,\" she said. \"But I have no freedom in Iran. I have been here in Turkey for two years out of necessity. … They killed Mahsa because her hair was showing a small forelock. She was just 22 years old. I am also a woman and I want freedom.''\n\nThis story originated with VOA's Turkish Service.",
    "DNR to offer wild turkey forum next week in Marquette": "Wildlife Through Forestry series of special events continues\n\nThe Michigan Department of Natural Resources will continue its popular Wildlife Through Forestry series of special events next week with a turkey forum being presented in Marquette Township.\n\n“Wild turkeys have long been established in southern parts of the Upper Peninsula but have been expanding their range north in increasing numbers over recent years,” said Gary Willis, a DNR service forest in Baraga and organizer of the popular wildlife forum series. “People are seeing wild turkeys in remote locations, even in heavy snow zones like those in Keweenaw County – the region’s northernmost county. Our upcoming forum will discuss this expansion and answer numerous questions often posed by the public.”\n\nThe forum will be held from 6-9 p.m. EDT, Thursday, Sept. 29 at the Marquette Township Hall, located a 1000 Commerce Drive. The event will also be livestreamed via Zoom.\n\nThe forum will feature three wildlife biologists: Pam Nankervis, habitat biologist for the U.S. Forest Service’s Ottawa National Forest, Jim Hammill, a wildlife biologist consultant and Safari Club International biologist and Ryan McGillviray, DNR wildlife biologist and wild turkey specialist.\n\nTogether, during the first half of the event, the biologists will delve into the adaptive traits and environmental factors that are making this wild turkey range expansion possible. Which factors are driving this migration north? How are wild turkeys surviving in heavy snow cover?\n\nDuring the second half of the forum, McGillviray will talk turkey hunting techniques based on his many years of traveling around the country in pursuit of turkeys. He will demonstrate decoy layout and calling techniques, while entertaining questions from those in attendance.\n\nPrizes will be awarded for first correct answer to pop-up questions.\n\n“This event is the latest in a fascinating series of ‘Wildlife Through Forestry’ forums held in the western Upper Peninsula since 2017,” said John Pepin, DNR deputy public information officer. “These sessions link wildlife topics to the numerous ways habitat for birds and animals may be developed and enhanced for a range of species on private lands.”\n\nEach of these sessions has included a presentation on an interesting and important wildlife-related topic, with additional information provided to private landowners on the value of a Forest Management Plan.\n\n“We want to get folks fired up about sound resource management so that they establish a family legacy with their forest ownership,” Willis said. “We want to show folks the importance of working closely with a resource professional to accomplish their goals and objectives for ownership. We also want folks to have a good time getting together to discuss topics of interest to us all.”\n\nA panel of resource professionals will be on hand at the forum to discuss the development, preparation and implementation of Forest Stewardship Plans.\n\nMore than 150 professional foresters and 20 wildlife biologists develop Forest Stewardship Plans for forest landowners in Michigan.\n\nFor information about these plans or the Commercial Forest Program, contact Gary Willis, DNR Service Forester, 427 U.S. 41 North, Baraga, Michigan, 49908; 906-353-6651, ext. 207-0122 or willisg2@michigan.gov.\n\nConservation districts in many Michigan counties have foresters available for a free site visit to private landowner properties. They can discuss landowner wildlife habitat and forestry goals and help decide if there are financial assistance programs that can provide cost sharing for resource management plan preparation and implementation.\n\nIn Marquette and Alger counties, contact forester Sara Kelso at 906-236-9484 or call the Marquette County Conservation District office at 906-226-8871, ext. 3071.\n\nNote to editors: Accompanying photos are available below for download.

    "The Bird Flu Hit This Year’s Turkey Supply Hard. Here’s What That Means for Thanksgiving": "Thanksgiving turkey will be more expensive than usual this year due to a nationwide bird flu outbreak that’s already shortened the country’s supply ahead of the holiday.\n\nOne of the country’s largest commercial turkey processors, Hormel Foods, anticipates that “lower industry-wide turkey supplies [will] keep prices higher” through the holiday, according to Hormel CFO Jacinth Smiley on an earnings call this month. Hormel’s own supply, also hit by avian flu, is considerably lower this year, Food Dive reports.\n\nWith pricier turkeys and far fewer of them than normal, the race to snag the best bird well in advance of the holiday may be even fiercer this fall. But high prices could very well lower turkey consumption altogether around the holiday season. Last year, when fresh turkey prices rose 10% above those of 2020, turkey sales dropped 6%, according to a Forbes report. Turkey shopping may happen earlier this year, too, and some shoppers may opt instead for cheaper chicken or turkey breast, Carman Allison, a vice president at NielsenIQ, tells Forbes.\n\nAvian influenza doesn’t pose a health concern to humans, but it’s deadly to birds that contract it. In order to contain outbreaks, farmers must kill entire flocks of turkeys—and this year, they killed around 5.4 million turkeys between January and July due to exposure, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nSince mid-July of this year, 10 outbreaks have impacted roughly 617,200 birds in 39 states. July is also when producers begin raising Thanksgiving turkeys.\n\nWhile outbreaks aren’t unusual on their own, they’re normally halted by the onset of warmer weather. That’s not the case this year, with the flu persisting into the hottest months and even in a late-summer heat wave in California.\n\nIn fact, this outbreak could match or outpace the worst in recent history: In 2015, the bird flu afflicted over 50 million turkeys before control measures and warm weather saw it plateau. Since January of this year, 40.8 million birds have already been affected by the outbreak.",

    "Erdogan was different at the UN this time": "In the spring of 2006, for one of my first jobs in journalism, I worked as a reporting intern for a wire service at the UN headquarters in New York. Two days a week I marched into the sleek Secretariat building looming over the East River, eager to cover the day’s most urgent issues – the Darfur crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global hunger and more.\n\nI soon discovered that diplomats were much better at their jobs than I had imagined. They would look me dead in the eye and respond to my questions with intelligence and apparent insight. Yet, once I had typed up the interview and dropped it into my article, I would realise they had simply used different words to express sentiments that had been said a hundred times before.\n\nReporting at the UN was like panning for gold: high hopes inevitably crumbled as the sifting turned up only sand. Amid the flurry of flashbulbs, it turned out, very little of substance occurred. By the time I left, I viewed the UN as little more than the world’s pre-eminent public relations platform.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Liz Truss holds a bilateral meeting with Turkey's President Erdogan at the Turkey Mission Building in New York during the 77th UN General Assembly, on September 21. Pool photo via AP\n\nThis might explain why Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has over the years shown a knack for grabbing the world’s attention on his autumnal visits to Turtle Bay. In his first UN General Assembly speech in 2005, he declared terrorism “the enemy of humankind” and launched the Alliance of Civilisations initiative with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain’s then prime minister, to unite international counter-extremism efforts.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Erdogan invoked, for the first time on the global stage, the phrase that has since become his refrain on the UN Security Council’s five permanent members. “I should emphasise that the world is bigger than five,” he said.\n\nIn 2016, he denounced Europe’s “degrading treatment” of a wave of newly arrived, mostly Arab refugees and, just weeks after a failed coup had shaken Turkey, urged the world to take measures against his government’s main suspect, the Gulen movement.\n\nIn 2019, he proposed a controversial safe zone in northern Syria and defended the rights of Palestinians. “Where are the borders of the state of Israel?” he wondered, denouncing Israeli annexations as illegitimate.\n\nQuote Absent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US\n\nLast year, Mr Erdogan handed out copies of his new book, urging reform at the UN and other international bodies, and inaugurated the $300 million Turkish House. He described Turkey’s new consulate and permanent UN mission – 17 metres taller than Secretariat, just across the street – as an expression of his nation’s growing influence.\n\nThis year, in contrast, Mr Erdogan seemed more subdued, seeking to highlight his country’s positive role in world affairs. Citing the need for food security in the Horn of Africa and peace talks in Ukraine, he said Turkey had endeavoured “to be part of the solution” around the world.\n\nHe’s half right, as we’re in the midst of another Tale-of-Two-Cities moment for Mr Erdogan. At home he may be less well liked than he’s been since his last days as Istanbul mayor, a quarter-century ago. And tensions with Greece, Turkey’s Aegean neighbour, have spiked in recent weeks as the two have traded insults and accusations.\n\nBut farther abroad, despite lingering tensions with the US and EU, Turkey has made real diplomatic gains, including renewed ties with Gulf powers, Israel and Egypt. In New York, Mr Erdogan held a meeting with Israeli Prime Minster Yair Lapid, marking the first time since the George W Bush presidency that an Israeli prime minister met a Turkish president.\n\nMore from David Lepeska What 'Devil Village' tells us about the future of the Ukraine war\n\nHowever troubling Mr Erdogan’s threats to “open the gates” of migration have been, it’s Turkey – not Greece, as top EU officials have asserted – that has served as Europe’s refugee shield, hosting 4-5 million foreigners for nearly a decade and keeping them out of the EU.\n\nAlso, even as Turkey has strengthened ties with Azerbaijan, potentially providing Europe with a much-needed alternative to Russian natural gas, Ankara has inched toward normalisation with historic rival Armenia and the opening of their long-closed border.\n\nLast but not least is Ukraine. Ankara’s western and Nato allies have been largely unable to criticise its continued friendly relations with Moscow because of how it has leveraged them. With more than 40 countries at risk of famine in late summer, Turkey played a crucial role in bringing Ukraine and Russia to agree on a plan to release millions of tonnes of grain from Ukrainian ports.\n\nSince March, Ankara has spearheaded efforts to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. “There will be no losers in a fair peace process,” Mr Erdogan told the UN General Assembly, calling for support of Turkey’s diplomacy.\n\nAbsent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US for their unwillingness to help solve the refugee issue. He also stayed his hand on Moscow’s military mobilisation, even as reports emerged that four of five military summons in Russian-occupied Crimea have gone to Crimean Tatars – a persecuted Turkic-Muslim minority Mr Erdogan regularly defends.\n\nHis most notable activity in New York was an afternoon stroll in Central Park. He met a local rabbi, sat for photos with parents and their children, and from one passerby, received a hearty \"thank you\" on Ukraine, for the drones, the grain deal and “helping to make Nato stronger”.\n\nThe President’s communications team released a seven-minute video of the park visit, which some critics said had been staged. This is understandable; in Turkey, Mr Erdogan does not stroll through parks or chat with everyday citizens. But it all seemed real enough.\n\nErdogan receives expressions of deep gratitude from a passerby in Central Park, in an impromptu exchange that does not look staged at all. https://t.co/EJBoBs0LFP — Paul T. Levin (@PaulTLevin) September 19, 2022\n\nTurkey’s lira hit yet another record low last week, at 18.42 to the dollar, and the governing AKP has been trailing in polls for months. With elections looming next year, the Central Park video was probably an attempt to humanise Mr Erdogan, to present a warmer leader who is also comfortable in the world.\n\nMaybe after years of relishing his moment in the spotlight, Mr Erdogan has come to share my view that the UN is mostly sound and fury. Perhaps he decided to take a break and enjoy his time in the Big Apple, walk in the park, revel in recent successes, speak in the third person.\n\nA Turkish reporter at the UN asked if he hoped to meet US President Joe Biden and he shook his head. “He is Biden,” Turkey’s leader responded with a grin. “I’m Erdogan.”",

All these countries know that the upcoming century is going to be Africa’s. One more exhibition of power play can be witnessed in the Saharan country of Niger. Niger is playing pawn into the hands of Turkey in a very old and big game of geopolitics. But to understand this complex situation between Turkey, France, Greece we need to understand the decades old Greco-Turkish conflict.\n\nUnderstanding the conflict between Greece and Turkey\n\n“We can come suddenly one night,” said the Turkish President Reccep Tayyp Erdogan while he was attending the Teknofest, the country’s largest technology event in the northern city of Samsun.\n\n“Coming suddenly one night”, is a line from a love poem which is written by a romantic poet Umit Yasar Oguzcan which was later composed into a song by Rustu Sardag and sung by Emel Sayın. This line was assimilated into Turkish political discourse after radio commentators and writers used this line to refer to Turkey’s illegal occupation of Northern Cyprus.\n\nErdogan used this line to threaten Greece against the fortification of Greek islands which are more close to Turkey than mainland Greece. France backed Greece says it needs to secure its islands including the tourist hotspots Rhodes and Kos islands.\n\nThe tensions are increasing in the Eastern Mediterranean, with Greece warning that a conflict similar to Ukraine is possible after Turkey threatened a military action against it. A number of disagreements between Turkey and Greece date back a long time, which include airspace boundaries, natural gas, maritime rights, and the sovereignty of Aegean islands.\n\nTurkey’s agenda behind Bayraktar deal with Niger\n\nAs it can be seen, since two years the economy of Turkey has been in doldrums. Turkey is struggling from an economic crisis which is fueled by Covid-19 and further deteriorated after the West sanctioned Turkey for violations in the F-35 manufacturing programme.\n\nErdogan is seeing the possible potential of reviving the economy by its only saleable Bayraktar drones which are in news after Azerbaijan used them against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\nThe conflict between Turkey and Greece is century-old and Turkey sees Greece as a formidable enemy which is backed by France and Russia. So, to weaken the influence of Greece, Turkey is playing its own game against France in Niger by selling the Bayraktar drones in the name of fighting against terrorists groups. As per the official statement the drones will be used against terror groups backed by Islamic state and Al-Qaeda which are currently in the tri-border region between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which also is a major part of the Sahel region.\n\nIn recent times Greece has started to challenge Erdogan’s might in the region, rattled by which Erdogan reiterated his veiled threat, stating that Turkey could “come all of a sudden one night,” in response to what he claimed were hostilities emerging from Greece backed by France.\n\nAt a press conference at the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, Erdogan stated, “If what I said was that we could come one night all of a sudden [it means] that, when the time comes, we can come suddenly one night.” (sic)\n\nTurkey’s Diversionary Tactics\n\nAs we can see, Turkey basically is not at ease owing to France’s support to Greece. France’s debacle in the Sahel region in Africa, the diminishing popularity of the France backed Barkhane Forces in the region has provided an opportunity to Turkey. Just a few days ago Niger saw large scale protests demanding the exit of 3000 French-Barkhane troops from Niger. These protests came in light owing to the allegations on the Barkhane forces to have sided with the Islamic jihadi extremists in the region. Taking cue from this event, Turkey is taking advantage of the same and using its diversionary tactics to keep France busy in Africa by supplying the requisite arms to Niger. It is doing this because when the time comes of a conflict or a small-scale war between Turkey and Greece, France will be busy in Africa and shall not overtly help Greece.\n\nThe clever Erdogan knows that France is currently struggling with its stagnant economy and keeping it busy in Africa will help Turkey in having a chance against Greece.\n\nAlso Read: Russia backed citizens of Niger come out in the streets to protest ‘Pro Jihadi elements’ in the government\n\nThe geopolitical game is more complicated than it looks and Niger needs to understand that it is just playing pawn in the hands of Turkey. The Bayraktar drones are a pile of junk as it is being proven in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. Erdogan is weaker than ever and he is just trying to fiddle with the situations to drum up support in his favour as he did in Libya and Syria.",
    "Turkey's skyrocketing inflation is flashing warning signals for Gulf banks": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Banks with exposure to Turkey have faced losses ever since the country's currency began steeply depreciating in 2018; now, lenders in several oil-rich Gulf states in particular are set to take a hit in the next year because of their links to the country, according to a recent report by ratings agency Fitch.\n\nBanks in the Gulf Cooperation Council — that's Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — with Turkish subsidiaries had to adopt \"hyperinflation reporting\" in the first half of 2022, Fitch wrote this week, as cumulative inflation in Turkey over the last three years surpassed a whopping 100%.\n\nFitch calculates that GCC banks with Turkish subsidiaries posted net losses of roughly $950 million in this year's first half. Among the hardest hit were Emirates NBD — Dubai's flagship bank — and Kuwait Finance House, the second-largest bank in Kuwait. Turkish exposure for Kuwait Finance House and Emirates NBD is 28% and 16% of their assets, respectively. Qatar National Bank was also among those affected.\n\n\"Fitch has always viewed GCC banks' Turkish exposures as credit-negative,\" the ratings firm wrote. \"Turkish exposures are a risk for GCC banks' capital positions due to currency translation losses from the lira depreciation.\"\n\nThe lira has lost 26% of its value against the dollar year-to-date, making imports and the purchase of basic goods much more challenging for Turkey's 84 million residents.",
    "As Turkey Backs Azerbaijan’s Recent Strikes on Armenian Towns, Where Are Russia, the EU, and the US?": "Azerbaijan’s Sept. 13 military strikes on Armenian border towns were just the latest reminder that “upper-handism” – the temptation to take full advantage of perceived military superiority – is alive and well in the south Caucasus. Armenia practiced “upper-handism“ for more than 20 years after its emergence as an independent state in 1991. With Russia’s backing, it enjoyed a military advantage over Azerbaijan that enabled it to maintain control not only over ethnic Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh, but also roughly 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. During this time, with rare exceptions, Yerevan showed no willingness to recognize Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe first signs that this was going to change became evident in 2016, when Baku initiated the first major clash with Armenia in years. It was called the four-day war, and Azerbaijan recovered a small amount of territory under Armenian control. Azerbaijan had spent the preceding and following years strengthening its military. A second clash followed in July 2020, but it was never clear which side had initiated it. But all of this was a prelude to the war in the fall of 2020 that Baku decisively won.\n\nSince then, the shoe has been on the other foot. Upper-handism is alive and well in Baku. With strong diplomatic support from Turkey in that conflict, and ample supplies of Turkish and Israeli weapons, including drones, Azerbaijan quickly regained control of Nagorno-Karabakh and the additional territory held by Armenia for nearly three decades. Azerbaijan’s latest maneuver would not have been possible without strong support from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as well as lethargy in Moscow. In the meantime, the European Union and the United States have been largely on the sidelines (even with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s meeting this week in New York with his Armenian and Azerbaijani counterparts), though constructive involvement could ease tensions all around.\n\nIn the diplomatic tango that followed the 2020 war, Armenian leaders in Yerevan have at times expressed a willingness to compromise – even as this remains a controversial matter in Armenian political circles — but Baku has insisted that any peace deal should focus on recognizing Azerbaijan’s territorial borders, which include Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, Baku does not currently appear ready to consider specific measures to provide safeguards for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. The latest outbreak of fighting, which reportedly has killed at least 286 people, might be interpreted as an effort to coerce Armenia to sign a peace agreement on Baku’s terms, or to not oppose a transportation corridor to connect most of Azerbaijan with Nakhichevan. (Armenian territory sits between Nakhichevan and the rest of Azerbaijan.)\n\nSince the start of the 2020 war, Turkey has emerged as the most active and perhaps influential outside power in the region. Baku’s win in the 2020 war enhanced Ankara’s prestige in the region. Russia partly recouped when President Vladimir Putin, after initial failure, shut down the fighting with a ceasefire and appeared to strengthen his hand by placing Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nYet those peacekeepers have been largely inactive during the occasional fighting that has broken out since the ceasefires, and that has been true this time as well. What is more, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), created by Moscow to provide security in the post-Soviet space, has also been inactive. CSTO members include Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Armenia, whose Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan heads the organization, convened a virtual meeting of the CSTO on Sept. 13, the day Azerbaijan conducted its strikes , and formally asked the CSTO to intervene the next day. The CSTO turned down the request.\n\nNotably, the CSTO did provide troops to help restore order in Kazakhstan last January (Pashinyan was head of the organization at the time, too). The refusal of the CSTO (which really means Russia’s refusal) to help Armenia has not gone unnoticed in Yerevan. The CSTO justified its position by noting that a ceasefire had been established. But from Armenia’s point of view, Baku had launched new attacks – in violation of a previous ceasefire – and the CSTO did nothing.\n\nRussian lethargy in this crisis is certainly a result of Armenia and the south Caucasus ranking lower in Moscow’s priorities at the moment, especially considering Putin’s sinking position in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military’s successful counteroffensive around Kharkiv follows its thwarting of the Kremlin offensive to “take all of Donbas” – two defeats for Putin. These defeats were amplified during Putin’s visit to Samarkand, Uzbekistan, last week for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit, where he publicly apologized to dictator-pal Xi Jinping of China for the way events are unfolding in Ukraine and received a scolding from Indian partner Narendra Modi for the same. Putin is likewise facing public criticism in Russia from both relatively liberal local officials calling for his resignation and ultra-hawks who want a major escalation of the war.\n\nThis means not only that Putin has less time and resources to deal with tensions in the south Caucasus, but that he has a specific reason for being less responsive to Armenia – Turkey’s Erdoğan. Turkey is not just a major player in the south Caucasus; it is also a player in Ukraine, which has benefitted recently both from Turkish drones and Erdoğan’s role in reaching the summer agreement on grain shipments from Ukrainian ports. Putin does not want Turkey to become an even greater supporter of Ukraine; so he takes no steps against Turkey’s regional client.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the United States and the European Union are largely absent from this crisis. Yes, Blinken issued a statement calling for a ceasefire, spoke with both Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, and then met with their top envoys this week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly opening. But the United States is not having the same impact as either Ankara or even Moscow. Partly as a response to this, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, long a supporter of Armenia, led a congressional delegation to Yerevan on Sept. 17, during which she condemned the Azerbaijan strikes.\n\nPelosi is likely hoping that her trip will spur the Biden administration to play a more active role in this crisis. Joe Biden last year became the first U.S. president to declare the World War I Ottoman-era massacre of Armenians as a genocide, and in this instance, the United States does have cards to play. Relations with Turkey’s Erdoğan remain strained, and he may well find value in improved ties with Washington.\n\nThe Biden administration could consider outreach to Erdoğan suggesting that greater cooperation both on Ukraine and the south Caucasus could lead to improved bilateral relations. In the Caucasus, such cooperation would work to prevent further violations along the Armenia/Azerbaijan border and to normalize Turkish-Armenian relations. Such cooperation also could include regional economic cooperation, which Baku too would find attractive.\n\nIMAGE: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (C) meets with an Armenian delegation including Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan (3rd L) and a delegation from Azerbaijan including Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov (3rd R) on September 19, 2022 in New York.
