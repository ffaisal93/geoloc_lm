    "U.S. warns of 'horrific' consequences if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine": "Washington responded to Russian President Vladimir Putin's veiled threat of using nuclear weapons, warning of serious consequences and that the U.S. response would be \"decisive.\"\n\n\"The consequences would be horrific,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during an interview.\n\nThe Kremlin later said it is in \"sporadic\" contact with Washington over nuclear issues.\n\nThe first Russians drafted in the country's mobilization drive have started arriving at bases, and military analysts are raising doubts as to Moscow's ability to equip and train all of the new troops. The number cited for the mobilization — 300,000 — is nearly double the size of the initial invasion force.\n\nAnti-mobilization protests appear to be continuing, with reports of standoffs with authorities and several arrests in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan. A gunman in eastern Siberia was detained for opening fire in a military draft office.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian-led referendums in the occupied areas of Ukraine are in their fourth day, and Ukrainian officials as well as people inside the territories say that some people are being made to vote at gunpoint, and that Russian forces are staging votes.\n\nWestern and Ukrainian officials condemn the referendums as a sham they say will allow Putin to annex the territories, and then use them to justify deploying nuclear weapons to protect them. Moscow says the referendums are legitimate.",

    "‘Huge problem:’ Iranian drones pose new threat to Ukraine": "Over the past week, Russia has deployed Shahed and Mohajer combat drones imported from Iran in greater numbers across Ukraine, with devastating results. Some hit combat positions, smashing tanks and armored vehicles, while others struck civilian infrastructure, including in the port city of Odesa.\n\nIn his nightly address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country’s anti-aircraft forces had shot down more than a dozen drones in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. The Ukrainian Air Force identified them as Shahed-136 kamikaze drones and Mohajer-6 drones that carry munitions and can also be used for reconnaissance.\n\nBut in interviews, a Ukrainian activist and three soldiers said the Iranian drones pose a major threat to both fighters and civilians. Their arrival on the battlefield makes the need for the West to send additional modern weaponry even more urgent, as Kyiv tries to seize on recent gains to retake as much territory as possible before winter sets in, they said.\n\nThe Iranian drones appear to be a potential game-changer for the Russians. They are relatively small and fly at low altitude, evading Ukrainian radars. Arekhta said she could shoot them down with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, but only during the day because the U.S.-provided weapons do not come with a night-vision system.\n\nUkraine needs modern air defenses, such as the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar systems the U.S. used in Afghanistan, and 360-degree radar to counter the new threat, the visiting group said.\n\n“I need to be in position against Russian helicopters on one side and Iranian drones came from another side,” Arekhta said. “It’s very hard to close the huge area with Stingers, with other weapons that can hit these drones.”\n\nArekhta uses the Switchblade 300 drones provided by Washington, but they are essentially commercial systems that are not powerful enough to work against armored vehicles and artillery, she said. Ukraine needs the upgraded Switchblade 600 drones, a loitering munition she described as “a flying Javelin.”\n\nWashington has contracted with manufacturer AeroVironment to send the 600 version, but they likely won’t arrive for many months.\n\nUkrainian forces are now fighting the Russians on two fronts: advancing east from the Oskil River into the contested Donbas region, and south from Kherson. After an initial breakthrough at the beginning of the month during which Kyiv recaptured much of the Russian-occupied Kharkiv region, gains have slowed significantly. Ukrainian soldiers are now pushing into the entrenched Donbas, where the two sides have been essentially deadlocked since 2014.\n\nIn the Donetsk oblast, the battle is now more difficult because Russian forces are fighting from trenches and shelters built years ago, said Ivanna Chobaniuk, a medic who was serving near Kharkiv before she traveled to D.C. last week.\n\nIn the northeast, Ukrainian soldiers are trying to retake ground using Toyotas and other civilian cars — which are particularly vulnerable to drone attack — because their old armored vehicles were destroyed, Chobaniuk said.\n\nThe old Soviet-era tanks Kyiv operates have a myriad of problems, Arekhta said. The soldiers frequently get error messages when using the aiming system and there is no fire protection system, forcing them to use a small fire extinguisher on the outside of the tank if they are hit. The tanks don’t connect to the soldiers’ Western-provided radios, so Arekhta has to use her cell phone to communicate. In the winter, “Soviet tank doesn’t work at all,” she said.\n\nKyiv needs modern tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Humvees to help Ukraine’s forces advance in the face of heavy Russian artillery, the soldiers said.\n\n“It is now when we have momentum,” said Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Ukrainian nonprofit the Anti-Corruption Action Center. “We keep counterattacking and counterattacking in Toyotas, in civilian cars — it is very inconvenient, especially if Iranian drones are flying over.”\n\nKyiv is trying to recapture as much ground as possible before winter sets in, the soldiers said. But now they have a new problem: in response to their counteroffensive, Vladimir Putin has mobilized 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine.\n\nWhile there are questions about the quality of the soldiers Putin has called up, Russia will use the colder months, when fighting typically slows, to train and equip them, the Ukrainian soldiers said.\n\n“If we give them that time, in spring there will be an epic battle — another epic battle,” said Daria Zubenko, a senior sergeant who has served as a paramedic and sniper.\n\nUkraine could use the winter to train its forces on more advanced weapons that the West has not yet greenlighted — for instance, modern battle tanks and fighter jets, Kaleniuk said. The Ukrainian Armed Forces two weeks ago submitted an official letter of request asking for either used or new fighter jets, and its air force has identified a few dozen pilots who speak English and are prepared to begin training immediately, she said.\n\nBut modern tanks and jets may be little more than a pipe dream , at least for now. Although Pentagon officials have left the door open to sending Kyiv the U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet, top generals said the planes wouldn’t arrive for years after any political decision was made to donate them.\n\n“I’m really fed up of losing my friends,” Arekhta said. “Sometimes I just say ‘happy birthday’ on social media, on Facebook, and the answer is: ‘he is dead.’ ”",
    "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul": "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey — Russian men continue to flee the country, by land or air, days after President Vladimir Putin's announcement to mobilize additional forces to bolster his flailing war in Ukraine.\n\nAt Istanbul's main airport, a constant stream of Russian men came through the arrivals terminal. Istanbul is a destination of choice because it is one of few places where Russians can travel to without visas, with a long history of Russian tourism.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has sought to cast itself as a neutral power broker between Moscow and Kyiv, and refused to join Western countries in economic sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, many anti-war Russians have settled here, along with refugees from Ukraine.\n\nFlights from Russia to Turkey are sold out for the next several weeks, despite skyrocketing prices. But that hasn't stopped people from finding ways to get out, not only from Russian cities like Moscow, Sochi, Makhachkala and Yekaterinburg but also through neighboring countries Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, at Istanbul Airport, didn't want to reveal their names out of fear of the Russian government. Just last week, Putin signed a law that sentenced those who refused to serve, or evaded service, to 10 years in prison. The men NPR spoke to described long lines at airports and border crossings because of the sheer number of crowds and because of interrogation by Russian authorities.\n\nOne 32-year-old man who flew from St. Petersburg, Russia, told NPR that his flight was \"completely full of men, from 20 and then till 50.\"\n\n\"And all men stopped and — we were interrogated by police,\" he said.\n\n\"There was questions about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you [serve] in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go serve?\" alluding to the conscription notices being served.\n\nA hurried dash to the border, and packed light\n\nNearly all the men said they had packed very light, trying to convince Russian authorities that they were leaving for short trips, and not to evade fighting in the war.\n\nMost said they have no future plans, and limited money. Those with families said their priority was to get settled and then try to bring their families out of Russia as well.\n\nA 35-year-old man, who left his family behind in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, drove first to the Mongolian border, where he waited six hours to cross. In Mongolia, he said, he ran into several of his friends who were also fleeing, before he caught a flight to Istanbul.\n\nSome men said they decided to leave the country as soon as they heard the conscription announcement last Wednesday. The man from Irkutsk said he waited a few days to see what would happen, but once his friends started getting rounded up at night, he made the decision to go.\n\n\"They aren't just taking the reservists, but also men who have no military history and even those with more than three children,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities, including Putin, had assured the public that only those with prior military service, no illnesses and fewer than three children would be called upon to serve.\n\nSeveral men told NPR that those who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war — which is why women have been overwhelmingly taking part in the recent public protests in Russia.\n\nIt's about to get worse\n\nNearly everyone who spoke to NPR said they believed the situation is going to get worse, that a full mobilization is imminent.\n\nRussia is now conducting what it claims are referendums — considered illegal under international law — in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. The 32-year-old man from St. Petersburg told NPR many in Russia see it as the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia.\n\n\"Then of course the Ukrainians will attack those areas because actually it's their territory. Then after that, I think [Putin will] decide 'OK, they attacked our territory,' and he'll make the full mobilization,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, in a hurry to leave the airport, only said, \"everything is worse than you know and Russian men are going anywhere they can now.\"\n\nOne 36-year-old man from Moscow told NPR that his reason to leave was not just because he didn't want to fight, but that it was his way of not supporting the military campaign.\n\n\"If you are against the war, the best thing to do is try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.,\" he said.\n\nJust a few said they were hopeful that there would be a peace agreement to end the war, and hoped to wait it out before eventually returning home.",

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight In a virtual address to the U.N. General Assembly last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was clear about the endgame. He dismissed making concessions to the Kremlin, called for military aid to help “return the Ukrainian flag to the entire territory,” and urged the international community to punish Russia for its invasion of his country and the alleged atrocities its forces have carried out since.\n\n“Russia will be forced to end this war, the war it has started,” Zelensky said. “I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president received a rare standing ovation after finishing his remarks, a sign of the global sympathy for his cause. No matter Kyiv’s frustration with the equivocation of countries in the “nonaligned” world, many of which have maintained friendly relations with Moscow as the war raged, Ukrainian officials had reason to feel heartened after diplomats aimed numerous stern rebukes of Russia at the United Nations. The disquiet with Moscow grew all the more pronounced after it took two escalatory steps last week — greenlighting illegal, sham “referendums” in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine, while ordering a partial mobilization of some 300,000 more Russian troops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more “neutral” powers voiced their disapproval of a Russian war effort that is widely viewed as violating international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi insisted “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.” His Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, warned against “egregious attacks committed in broad daylight” going “unpunished.”\n\nBut even as Russia’s international standing takes further hits, Ukraine may have reason to worry about shifting winds in the West’s democracies. Analysts have long fretted over the West’s stamina in the defense of Ukraine, aware of mounting concerns over surging energy prices and old suspicions of the liberal establishment in Brussels and Washington. That resolve has largely endured as we enter the eighth month of the conflict. But polls show flagging interest among some voters for supporting Ukraine, not least as economic challenges build up closer to home.\n\nElectorally, Europe is seeing a mini-surge for traditionally Euroskeptic, Russia-friendly political factions. The far right has emerged as kingmakers in ongoing coalition talks in Sweden. And on Sunday, Italian voters elected what will likely be a coalition of right-wing parties led by the far-right Brothers of Italy and the charismatic politico Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeloni herself has rhetorically backed Kyiv in recent months, but key allies have made no secret of their affinity for the Kremlin. Matteo Salvini, head of the nativist League, has questioned the efficacy of sanctions on Russia. Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, took to Italian TV this month to defend Putin, a longtime buddy on the world stage.\n\n“Putin was pushed by the Russian population, by his party and by his ministers to invent this special operation,” Berlusconi said. “The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv within a week, replace Zelensky’s government with decent people and then leave. Instead they found resistance, which was then fed by arms of all kinds from the west.”\n\nCenter-left challenger Enrico Letta was scathing in response: “Those comments demonstrate that in part of our electoral system, on the right but not only, there are those who, in short, say: ‘Let’s stop this war, let’s give Putin what he wants.’ I find that unacceptable.”\n\nFavorable opinions of Russia and Putin have declined sharply among Europe’s populists following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, especially among right-wing populists in Italy. 1/4https://t.co/vxTnds4jan pic.twitter.com/m3urQSE8Ha — Pew Research Global (@pewglobal) September 23, 2022\n\nTo be sure, polling in Europe after the Feb. 24 invasion shows significant drops in approval for Russia and Putin among right-wing populist parties, especially in Italy. But, as a recent Pew survey noted, these right-wing parties still remain far more positive toward the Russian regime than the rest of the public in their societies. Such sentiments underlay a controversial planned “fact-finding” trip by politicians in Germany’s far-right AfD party to Russian-controlled areas in Ukraine, which was called off last week only after a massive backlash at the possibility of elected German officials directly boosting Putin’s propaganda machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the war drags on, there are fears among both Ukrainians and Western strategists that public skepticism over the toll of sanctions on Russia — which has seen energy prices spike in Europe — and the significant financial outlay to support Kyiv may mount. Hungary’s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has long bridled at E.U. pressure on Russia, announced Monday plans to launch a “national consultation” on the continent’s sanctions regime.\n\nThere’s also the risk of growing indifference. Pew recently found that fewer Americans are concerned about the prospect of Ukrainian defeat than they were in the spring and a significant majority believe now that current aid to Ukraine is sufficient.\n\nThat’s not surprising given the tens of billions dollars of support already disbursed by the Biden administration. Pew also found that U.S. Republicans are more likely to believe their government is giving too much to Ukraine than too little. Distaste for the costs of the war are influencing the upcoming midterm elections, while a segment of the Republican base — championed by former president Donald Trump and cultivated by notoriously Putin-friendly Fox News host Tucker Carlson — has long harbored sympathy for Putin’s Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think we’re at the point where we’ve given enough money in Ukraine,” J.D. Vance, Ohio’s Republican nominee for Senate, said this month. “I really do.”\n\nExperts believe the latest round of congressionally sanctioned funding for Ukraine could be the last to pass smoothly through the American legislature. “It would be too simplistic to say it is one issue more than another at this point. But voters are speaking up to conservative members of Congress,” Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, told Politico. “This is really driven from the grass roots to Washington and not the other way around.”\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are finding themselves in unusually hawkish positions compared with their domestic rivals. “The Ukrainians are making serious progress and are likely to continue to make progress into next year,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told The Washington Post. “If Republicans win the House, and word starts to leak out that they’re done funding Ukraine, that has potentially catastrophic impacts on Ukrainian morale and their ability to carry the fight.”\n\nWar in Ukraine: What you need to know The latest: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of troops in an address to the nation on Sept. 21, framing the move as an attempt to defend Russian sovereignty against a West that seeks to use Ukraine as a tool to “divide and destroy Russia.” Follow our live updates here. The fight: A successful Ukrainian counteroffensive has forced a major Russian retreat in the northeastern Kharkiv region in recent days, as troops fled cities and villages they had occupied since the early days of the war and abandoned large amounts of military equipment. Annexation referendums: Staged referendums, which would be illegal under international law, are set to take place from Sept. 23 to 27 in the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk regions of eastern Ukraine, according to Russian news agencies.

    "Russia-Ukraine war live: 2,000 detained during protests in Russia – as it happened": "From 2d ago 03.11 More than 2,000 people detained during protests in Russia, says human rights group More than 2,000 people in total have been detained across Russia for protesting against President Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation, including 798 people detained in 33 towns on Saturday, according to independent monitoring group OVD-Info.\n\n\n\nReuters reports that frustrations even spread to pro-Kremlin media, with one editor at the state-run RT news channel saying problems such as call-up papers being sent to the wrong men were “infuriating people”. When Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was asked on Saturday why so many Russians were leaving the country, he pointed to the right of freedom of movement.\n\nUpdated at 03.13 EDT\n\n23h ago 16.53 We are closing this blog now, please see all our Ukraine news here.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.05 Summary It’s slightly past 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The Ukrainian defence ministry on Sunday made fun of Moscow’s partial mobilization order, posting on Twitter a compilation of social media videos of Russian police beating and arresting men protesting the call-up. The mockery came as Russia’s two top lawmakers expressed concern about the drive, ordering regional officials to resolve “excesses” that have ignited public anger, triggered demonstrations and prompted military-age men to make for border crossings.\n\nRussophiles rallied across Bulgaria on Sunday in celebration of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Wearing T-shirts showing Russian bears, waving flags with “Z” symbols, and holding pictures of Putin aloft - the Ukraine war has not deterred Bulgarian Russophiles, who rallied in the centre of the country on Sunday to show their support, AFP reports.\n\nSerbia will not recognize Russian annexation ‘referendums’ in occupied Ukrainian areas. “[The annexation referendums] completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders,” said Nikola Selakovic, the Serbian foreign minister.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed calls for Western allies to cut Russian banks from SWIFT, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from SWIFT, we need to cut all Russian banks from SWIFT, but we need to make sure and I will repeat this, some countries do not follow and they are not completely involved in these sanctions. So Russian banks, the whole system, the whole Russian banking system must be cut from SWIFT,” he said.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also said that Ukraine has received NASAMS (National Advance Surface-to-Air Missile Systems) air defence missiles from the US in a TV interview. Zelenskiy thanked Joe Biden and confirmed that they now have the systems in Ukraine. The Pentagon said ten days ago that two systems were due to be delivered. However he said he needed more to protect Ukrainian citizens.\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needs “much more” help from the UK as the country fights back against Moscow’s invasion, with the partial mobilisation of Russian reservists amounting to “something formidable.”\n\nUK prime minister Liz Truss has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of increased threats by Vladimir Putin and his mobilisation order. Truss said Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake.\n\nProtests against the mobilisation order to recruit more people for Russia’s army appear to be continuing in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media shows the police arresting demonstrators. The order will see thousands more Russians drafted to be part of the war effort in Ukraine.\n\nIsrael will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients will arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, said envoy Michael Brodsky.\n\nThe US and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, its national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday, reaffirming the Joe Biden White House’s previous response to mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin’s threats are in increased danger of being realised. “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,” Sullivan told CBS.\n\nAiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia earlier this week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog.”\n\nLong queues of vehicles are at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia as people continue to flee the Kremlin’s partial mobilisation order, AFP reports. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday.\n\nUpdated at 16.06 EDT\n\n1d ago 15.44 The Ukrainian defence ministry on Sunday made fun of Moscow’s partial mobilization order, posting on Twitter a compilation of social media videos of Russian police beating and arresting men protesting the call-up. The mockery came as Russia’s two top lawmakers expressed concern about the drive, ordering regional officials to resolve “excesses” that have ignited public anger, triggered demonstrations and prompted military-age men to make for border crossings. “Russia still has remnants of a professional army” that the Ukrainian army “hasn’t yet destroyed,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said in an English-language tweet, referring to this month’s rout of Russian forces from much of the northeastern Kharkiv region. “Looks like we’ll be ‘de-mobilizing’ these Russians ahead of schedule.” “We also know that soon these ‘soldiers’ will be at the front, and with such a love for alcohol, it will be easier for them to die on our land,” the defence ministry added. We understand that not all russian troops are like this;russia still has remnants of a professional army that #UAarmy hasn’t yet destroyed.\n\nWe also know that soon these \"soldiers\" will be at the front,and with such a love for alcohol,it will be easier for them to die on our land. pic.twitter.com/Y7EgS0c5ze — Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) September 25, 2022 Multiple reports have documented how people with no military service have been issued draft papers - contrary to Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s guarantee that only those with special military skills or combat experience would be called up.\n\nUpdated at 15.45 EDT\n\n1d ago 15.05 Russophiles rallied across Bulgaria on Sunday in celebration of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Agence France-Presse reports: Wearing T-shirts showing Russian bears, waving flags with “Z” symbols, and holding pictures of Putin aloft - the Ukraine war has not deterred Bulgarian Russophiles, who rallied in the centre of the country on Sunday to show their support. The Balkan state - an EU and NATO member with historically close ties to Russia - still has many citizens nostalgic for the former Communist regime. The pro-Moscow rally came as Sofia readies to return to the polls and the country grapples with its identity. Hristo Ganev, a 60-year-old driver, had arrived at Sunday’s event early and bought a T-shirt emblazoned with the “Z” of the Ukraine offensive from one of the many stalls selling trinkets and souvenirs. “Without Russia, Bulgaria would not have existed,” he told AFP, referring to the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in which Russia freed Bulgaria from five centuries of Ottoman domination. Ganev is married to a Russian he met when he was working in Siberia in the 1980s, and says he supports President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He believes Putin’s claim that the troops are needed to “fight Nazism” and says he is even in favour of a nuclear war, “if that is the price to pay to free yourself from American domination.”\n\n\n\n1d ago 14.44 Serbia will not recognize Russian annexation ‘referendums’ in occupied Ukrainian areas, the Kyiv Independent reports. “[The annexation referendums] completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders,” said Nikola Selakovic, the Serbian foreign minister. He added that his country would comply with international law and the UN Charter.\n\n\n\n1d ago 14.26 Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed calls for Western allies to cut Russian banks from SWIFT, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from SWIFT, we need to cut all Russian banks from SWIFT, but we need to make sure and I will repeat this, some countries do not follow and they are not completely involved in these sanctions. So Russian banks, the whole system, the whole Russian banking system must be cut from SWIFT,” the president told CBS in an interview. He went onto add, “If we talk about an embargo for energy, we need not to look for compromises, or we need to make sure that this embargo will be working and all the prices would be implemented according to the embargo because the profits from these imports support the Russian army and fund the war.” “We see that it’s a very expensive toy for Putin. It’s a very bloody toy. So he needs more money, all the money and super profits from oil and gas Russia’s using, and we need to limit that.”\n\n\n\n1d ago 13.56 Zelenskiy says Ukraine has air defence missiles Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine has received NASAMS (National Advance Surface-to-Air Missile Systems) air defence missiles from the US in a TV interview. Speaking to US broadcaster CBS, Zelenskiy thanked Joe Biden and confirmed that they now have the systems in Ukraine. The Pentagon said ten days ago that two systems were due to be delivered. However he said he needed more to protect Ukrainian citizens. Zelenskiy told Margaret Brennan on Face The Nation: “I want to thank president Biden for a positive decision that has been already made. And to the US Congress, we received NASAMS. It’s the air defense systems. But believe me, it’s not even nearly enough to cover the civilian infrastructure, schools, hospitals, universities, homes of Ukrainians.\" “Why do we need this? We need the security in order to attract our Ukrainians to come back home. If it’s safe, they will come, settle, work here and will pay taxes and then we won’t have a deficit of $5 billion in our budget. So it will be a positive for everybody.”\n\n\n\n1d ago 13.28 The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needs “much more” help from the UK as the country fights back against Moscow’s invasion, with the partial mobilisation of Russian reservists amounting to “something formidable”. Addressing a fringe event hosted by Labour Friends of Ukraine in Liverpool, the ambassador said people who found refuge in the UK through the government’s sponsorship scheme continue to need support, PA Media reports. “We hoped to reach a six-month period by the sponsorship agreement between most of the UK citizens and Ukrainians who came here,” he said. “I just hope that the generosity, tolerance, kindness, patience of these people will allow us to engage with Ukrainians who still need some support here.” He added: “Still we need support here, helping these people to go through the most difficult times of the war.” In March, the UK government launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme so people could sponsor refugees fleeing the war-torn country by offering a spare room or home for at least six months. Ministers have since faced calls to consider increasing the monthly thank-you payments to hosts who extend their offer beyond the initial period they committed to. Prystaiko said it should be Russia that pays to rebuild Ukraine. “I know there are so many generous people in nations around the globe, who told us, ‘don’t worry guys, we will help you to rebuild’. I believe the Russians have to pay for this, not you, not your taxpayers’ money,” he said. The ambassador said the partial mobilisation of Russian reservists looks to be “something formidable”. “We are adults here and I have to be frank with you,” he said. “We obviously understand that three, four, five (hundred) thousand people Russia has promised to mobilise... this make a difference in the battlefield. “Yes, Russians will struggle to re-arm them, feed them, equip them, and most of these people are not fit for... service. But (the) sheer mass of these people is something formidable.”\n\n\n\n1d ago 13.10 UK prime minister Liz Truss has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of increased threats by Vladimir Putin and his mobilisation order. Truss said Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. “I think he didn’t anticipate the strength of reaction from the free world,” Truss said in the interview broadcast on Sunday, Reuters reports. “We should not be listening to his sabre-rattling and his bogus threats. Instead, what we need to do is continue to put sanctions on Russia and continue to support the Ukrainians.” Truss, who became prime minister earlier this month, has pledged to raise defence spending to 3% of the UK’s GDP.\n\n\n\n1d ago 11.25 Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. “Israel will receive for treatment 20 Ukrainian servicemen who were seriously wounded during the war,” envoy Michael Brodsky tweeted. The first two patients will arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, he added. A medical source confirmed to Agence France-Presse that two soldiers were en route to Israel, while a spokesperson for the Ukrainian embassy in Tel Aviv said she expected the first patients to arrive “soon”. They will be treated with prosthetics and rehabilitation. Sheba Medical Center, Israel’s largest hospital, ran a field hospital in western Ukraine for six weeks following the Russian invasion in February.\n\nUpdated at 11.32 EDT",
    "Inside the Ukrainian Counterstrike That Turned the Tide of the War": "It would be easy to underestimate Valeriy Zaluzhny. When not in uniform, the general prefers T-shirts and shorts that match his easygoing sense of humor. When he first heard from aides to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July 2021 that he was being tapped to lead the country’s armed forces, his stunned response was, “What do you mean?” As it sank in that he would become commander in chief, he tells TIME in his first interview since the Russian invasion began, he felt as if he had been punched “not just below the belt but straight into a knockout.” George Patton or Douglas MacArthur he is not.\n\nYet when the history of the war in Ukraine is written, Zaluzhny is likely to occupy a prominent role. He was part of the Ukrainian brass who spent years transforming the country’s military from a clunky Soviet model into a modern fighting force. Hardened by years of battling Russia on the eastern front, he was among a new generation of Ukrainian leaders who learned to be flexible and delegate decisions to commanders on the ground. His dogged preparation in the run-up to the invasion and savvy battlefield tactics in the early phases of the war helped the nation fend off the Russian onslaught. “Zaluzhny has emerged as the military mind his country needed,” U.S. General Mark Milley wrote for TIME of his counterpart last May. “His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.”\n\nPhoto illustration by Neil Jamieson for TIME (Source Photo: Gleb Garanich—Reuters Pool Photo/AP)\n\nThat initiative has now taken a key turn in Ukraine’s favor. In Kyiv’s biggest gains since the war began in February, a lightning counteroffensive in the country’s northeast in early September stunned Russian troops, who fled in disarray and ceded vast swaths of occupied territory. Combined with a second operation in the south, Ukrainian forces say they wrested back more than 6,000 sq km from Russian control in less than two weeks, liberating dozens of towns and cities and cutting off enemy supply lines. The Ukrainian army’s deft game of misdirection, touting a counter-offensive in the south before attacking in the northeast, caught Russia off guard. And it validated the Ukrainians’ arguments that intelligence collaboration and billions of dollars in weapons and materiel supplied by Western allies would yield results on the battlefield.\n\nThe sudden victories came at a critical point in what had become a grinding war of attrition. As the economic pressures built across Europe and around the world, skeptics were beginning to doubt whether Ukraine could endure a protracted fight. The dramatic rout rattled Moscow, forcing Kremlin propagandists to admit the setback and upping the military and political pressures on Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Sept. 21 he responded by announcing the first mass conscription since World War II, a partial mobilization of up to 300,000 citizens.\n\nUkrainian and U.S. officials alike believe the war will be longer and bloodier than most imagine. Putin has shown he’s willing to sacrifice his troops and commit atrocities to exhaust his adversary. In a menacing speech, he warned that he was “not bluffing” when he threatened to use everything at his disposal to defend Russia—an allusion to nuclear weapons. The recent Ukrainian offensive may be a turning point, but it is not the decisive blow. “In hindsight, we’ll look at this like the Battle of Midway,” says Dan Rice, a U.S. Army combat veteran and leadership executive at West Point who serves as a special adviser to Zaluzhny, referring to the pivotal 1942 clash that preceded three more years of war.\n\nA woman rides a bicycle on a street in Izyum, Sept. 14. Juan Barreto—AFP/Getty Images\n\nZaluzhny is just one of many Ukrainians responsible for the grit and progress of the nation’s outmanned army. Other key officers include General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, who led the defense of Kyiv and, more recently, the counteroffensive in the east, and Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service. But after the President, Zaluzhny has become the face of the war effort. His persona is omnipresent on Ukrainian social media. One widely shared image shows the “Iron General” kneeling in front of the sobbing mother of one of his soldiers, head bowed in grief in front of a casket. In another he flashes a grin presiding over the wedding of one of his servicemen during a lull in the fighting. Fan channels on Telegram have hundreds of thousands of followers, with many changing their profiles to a photo of the general with his hands held in the shape of a heart. “When Zaluzhny walks into a dark room he does not turn on the light, he turns off the darkness,” one viral TikTok video jokes.\n\nIt’s hard to predict where the war is headed or the part Zaluzhny will play in the end. But perhaps for the first time, it now seems possible that the army he commands could achieve victory.\n\nZaluzhny was drinking a beer at his wife’s birthday party when he stepped outside to take a cell-phone call and learned about his new job. The 48-year-old general’s rank and stature at the time were far below the position Zelensky was offering him. Commander in chief of the armed forces of Ukraine is the nation’s top military title, outranked only by the President himself. The height of that perch induced a feeling like vertigo. “I’ve often looked back and asked myself: How did I get myself into this?” Zaluzhny told TIME in a June interview.\n\nTo some, the choice seemed rash. While he had earned a reputation as an aggressive and ambitious commander, Zaluzhny was also considered a bit of a goofball, better known for clowning around with his troops than disciplining them. Born on a Soviet military garrison in northern Ukraine in 1973, he says he had dreams of becoming a comedian, much like Zelensky himself. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of his military family, entering the academy in Odessa in the 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine descended into crisis.\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny attends a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv on April 24, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nZaluzhny rose through the ranks with a new generation of officers that bridged very different eras: raised in Soviet Ukraine, but eager to shed USSR military dogma. For a master’s thesis, Zaluzhny analyzed U.S. military structure. Seeing how Ukrainian forces were still weighed down by the Soviet model that relied on rigid, top-heavy decision-making, he began to implement changes to mirror the forces of U.S. and NATO partners.\n\nZaluzhny worked his way from commanding a platoon to leading the country’s forces on the eastern front following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he developed junior officers and encouraged more agile decision-making, pushing down authority to commanders on the ground. Unlike in the Russian army, sergeants would not be “scapegoats,” but rather real deputies meant to create a pipeline of military talent, he said in a 2020 interview published by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. “There is no going back,” he said, to “the army of 2013.”\n\nBut Zaluzhny also respected and admired the institutions of his Russian counterparts. In his office, he keeps the collected works of General Valery Gerasimov, the head of the Russian armed forces, who is 17 years his senior. “I was raised on Russian military doctrine, and I still think that the science of war is all located in Russia,” Zaluzhny says. “I learned from Gerasimov. I read everything he ever wrote … He is the smartest of men, and my expectations of him were enormous.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends a flag hoisting ceremony in Izyum after the Ukrainian forces took back control of the city from the Russians. Metin Aktas–Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nWhen Zelensky took office in 2019, the war in eastern Ukraine was already in its fifth year, and Zaluzhny was acting commander in the war zone. It fell to him to brief the new President on military operations and command structures. He knew Zelensky had never served in the military, and had no plans to school him in the tactical details of warfare. “He doesn’t need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge building,” Zaluzhny says. To his surprise, Zelensky seemed to agree. “This has turned out to be one of [Zelensky’s] strongest features,” says Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian Assistant Defense Minister. He has allowed his generals to run the show “without direct interference into military business.”\n\nIn 2020, Zaluzhny oversaw an ambitious set of military exercises, which included a test of the Javelin anti-tank missile. With the President watching from the observation deck, the demonstration failed, and pundits went on Ukrainian TV to debate the bad omen for the nation’s military. Zaluzhny was sure he would be known in the President’s office as “the loser with the faulty Javelins.”\n\nYet Zelensky has shown a determination to jettison an older generation of officials in search of new blood, and a habit of elevating leaders with whom he feels a rapport, regardless of rank. In July 2021, with the Russians hauling tanks to the border and the Americans warning that Ukraine could soon face a full-scale attack, the President decided to put Zaluzhny in charge. “I gave my opinion that he strikes me as a fairly professional, smart person,” says Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. “But the President made the call.”\n\nUnlike Zelensky, who was skeptical of intelligence reports that a mass-scale Russian invasion was imminent, Zaluzhny was part of a corps of Ukrainian officers who viewed it as a matter of time. Within weeks of taking up his post, he began to implement key changes. Officers would be free to return fire “with any available weapons” if they came under attack, with no need for permission from senior commanders. “We needed to knock down their desire to attack,” Zaluzhny says. “We also needed to show our teeth.”\n\nLon Tweeten\n\nBy early February, the pressure of his new role was starting to show. The launch of an ambitious set of military exercises involving thousands of Ukrainian troops had been a disappointment, with basic maneuvers meant to simulate a Russian attack exposing cracks in Ukraine’s defenses. In Zaluzhny’s view, the drills were a centerpiece of Ukraine’s defensive strategy, its best chance of survival, and the commanders were not taking them seriously enough. “I spent an hour yelling,” he recalls. “I lost it.” The men seated around the table were mostly older and more experienced than Zaluzhny, who did not have a reputation for losing his cool. “I explained to them that if they can’t pull this off, the consequences will not only cost us our lives, but also our country.”\n\nAfter the outburst, the generals picked up their preparations. They relocated and camouflaged military hardware, moving troops and weapons out of their bases and sending them on tours around the country. This included aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles, as well as the antiaircraft batteries Ukraine would soon need to maintain control of its skies. “There’s no mistaking the smell of war,” Zaluzhny says, “and it was already in the air.” But when it came to the details of his strategy, Zaluzhny held them close. “I was afraid that we would lose the element of surprise,” he says. “We needed the adversary to think that we are all deployed in our usual bases, smoking grass, watching TV, and posting on Facebook.”\n\nWhen the invasion started on the morning of Feb. 24, the general had two strategic goals for Ukraine’s defense. “We could not allow Kyiv to fall,” he said. “And, on all the other vectors, we had to spill their blood, even if in some places it would require losing territory.” The aim, in other words, was to allow the Russians to advance and then destroy their columns in the front and supply lines in the rear. By the sixth day of the invasion, he concluded it was working. The Russians had failed to take airports around Kyiv and had advanced deep enough to begin straining supply lines, leaving them exposed.\n\nMilley, Zaluzhny’s U.S. counterpart, was in some ways astounded when he saw the Ukrainians holding out. He asked Zaluzhny whether he planned to evacuate to safer ground. “I told him, ‘I don’t understand you,’” Zaluzhny says. “For me the war started in 2014 … I didn’t run away then, and I’m not going to run now.”\n\nHe too was surprised by Russia’s blunders. When the enemy faced heavy resistance or lost the ability to resupply, they did not retreat or shift to a different approach. “They just herded their soldiers into the slaughter,” Zaluzhny said. “They chose the scenario that suited me best of all.”\n\nEven as the U.S. and allies continued to flood the country with billions in military aid, the news was grim. Russia pounded the strategic port city of Mariupol, killing thousands of civilians. In May, hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who had defended the last stronghold in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, surrendered. (More than 150 were returned Sept. 21 in a prisoner swap, including five top Ukrainian commanders.) Mass graves were discovered in towns and villages occupied by Russian troops. Still, Ukrainian officials insisted they could win. “We will fight until the last drop of blood,” Zaluzhny told TIME.\n\nA few weeks later, Ukraine began to do something that struck military analysts as unusual. From the top of the government, Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky and Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, began to publicly tout their preparations for a large-scale operation to retake territory in the south. In anticipation of an attack, Russia began to reposition troops, including some of its most elite units from other regions to reinforce its positions in the south. On Aug. 29, the Ukrainian military announced that the long-anticipated southern offensive had begun.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier assists a wounded comrade on Sept. 12 in the Kharkiv region. Kostiantyn Liberov—AP\n\nBut there were indications something else was afoot. “We have a war on, not only in the south,” Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told TIME on Sept. 1. “The front line is 2,500 km long.” Many experts doubted that Ukraine would be capable of mounting a counter-offensive on one front, let alone two.\n\nFive days later, Ukrainian troops launched a surprise strike in the country’s northeast. The Russians were caught off guard. Many fled in disarray, leaving behind weapons and equipment. Local reports painted a humiliating picture of retreat, describing soldiers stealing civilians’ clothes, bicycles, and cars to escape.\n\nIn six days, the Ukrainian military retook an estimated 3,000 sq km of Russian-held territory, including strategically important rail hubs used to resupply its forces. The strike stunned the Kremlin, U.S. officials, and even top Ukrainians. “I taught myself to moderate my expectations, so as not to be disappointed later,” Reznikov tells TIME. “Some breakthroughs occurred a little faster than planned.”\n\nIntelligence and advanced weaponry provided by the West also helped. “They gave us the location of the enemy, how many of them are at that location, and what they have stored there,” Reznikov says. “Then we would strike.” The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) provided by the Pentagon allowed Ukraine to destroy warehouses of ammunition, fuel, and command posts. Lighter vehicles like U.S.-donated humvees, as well as trucks and tanks sent by the U.K., Australia, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic, allowed them to outmaneuver the Russians. “Ukrainians have demonstrated much better distributed tactical-level operations,” says Jeffrey Edmonds, a former CIA analyst and Russia director on the National Security Council. “They’re much more disciplined.”\n\nAlso crucial, Ukrainian officials say, was the flexible command structure that allowed them to exploit the quick Russian collapse. “The Ukrainian army has the freedom to make decisions at every level,” Reznikov says, likening it to NATO standards. “They do it quickly, unlike the Russians.”\n\nA boy rides a bicycle near an armored tank with a Ukrainian flag in the town of Izyum on Sept. 19. Oleksii Chumachenko—SOPA Images/LightRocket/ Getty Images\n\nUkrainian officials are careful to spread the credit for the military successes so far. “It’s not a story of one star, but a constellation of our military elite,” Reznikov says, naming a long list of celebrated officers from the armed forces—the infantry, navy, air force, medical corps and others.\n\nThere are rumors of tensions between Zelensky and his top military commander, though the President and his aides have dismissed them. “The so-called conflict with Zaluzhny was invented by our opposition from start to finish,” says Oleksiy Arestovych, a Zelensky aide and veteran of Ukraine’s military intelligence service. “On the one hand, it’s obviously made up. On the other, it has a painful effect, because stirring up conflict between the military commander and the commander in chief is a catastrophe.”\n\nHardened by war, Ukrainian leaders know the recent successes have only bought time. “Russia has staked everything on this war,” says Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. “Putin cannot lose. The stakes are too high.”\n\nUkraine’s operations in the south have moved slowly. As winter approaches, Kyiv must take care not to overextend its forces. And there are forces at play outside Ukraine’s control. The looming energy crisis could sap Western military support, with Russia already cutting its gas supplies to Europe from 40% to 9%.\n\nFor his part, Zaluzhny is girding for a long and bloody slog. “Knowing what I know firsthand about the Russians, our victory will not be final,” he told TIME. “Our victory will be an opportunity to take a breath and prepare for the next war.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah\n\nWrite to Vera Bergengruen at vera.bergengruen@time.com.",

    "What meaningful action could the United Nations take to help Ukraine?": "What meaningful action could the United Nations take to help Ukraine?\n\nAs the U.N. General Assembly comes to a close, NPR's Leila Fadel asks Yale law professor Oona Hathaway how nations can unite in responding to Russia for its war against Ukraine.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nAs Russians of fighting age flee to avoid conscription, much of the world is still trying to put enough pressure on Russia to stop the war. Here's Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on CBS \"Face The Nation,\" speaking through a translator.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")\n\nPRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: (Through interpreter) They do not want any dialogue. We see referenda or we see mobilization that's emphasizing their will.\n\nFADEL: The United Nations General Assembly meeting could have been a place to make progress, but there's been no significant movement. So what can the U.N. do at this point? To explore that question, we're joined by Oona Hathaway. She's a law professor at Yale who used to work with the Department of Defense. Oona Hathaway is on the line from Paris. Good morning. Thanks for being on the program.\n\nOONA HATHAWAY: Good morning. Thank you for having me.\n\nFADEL: So let's start with that question. What meaningful action could the United Nations take to put pressure on Russia or to stop Russia's war on Ukraine?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, the United Nations took a first important step back in March, shortly after the invasion, when it voted to deplore Russian aggression and voted - 141 members of the United Nations - against the invasion and only five members voting with Russia to oppose the General Assembly resolution. The International Court of Justice, which is a body of the United Nations, has also ordered Russia to suspend its military operations. And there have been a number of other important symbolic moves, suspending Russia, for instance, from the Human Rights Council.\n\nBut it is important to note that because Russia is a member of the Security Council - it's one of the permanent five members of the Security Council - that limits what the United Nations can do in terms of enforcement action. So it can't, for instance, order a military invasion. And there are a number of other enforcement measures that, ordinarily, the U.N. would have at its disposal that it can't with regard to a Security Council member.\n\nFADEL: So it sounds like a lot of the moves are symbolic. So really, what type of pressure can actually come to play, and what type of accountability could come to play for Russia?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, symbolism matters. And it's important to remember that these denunciations of the war and declarations of the war as acts of aggression help set the stage for really important enforcement actions that followed by individual states. So it helped legitimate the unprecedented global sanctions against Russia and the really, truly unprecedented marshalling of resources to support Ukraine in opposing the war of aggression by Russia. So while it's symbolic, that symbolism really matters because it enables states and companies and others to respond to Russian aggression and to recognize that the world sees it as aggression. It's not just individual states that are deploring it but the institution as a whole.\n\nFADEL: Now, the world has seen evidence of atrocities in areas that the Ukrainian military took back from Russia - bodies in the streets, mass graves discovered, accusations of mass rape. But now, Ukraine nor Russia are parties - state parties to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court. So what type or what path to accountability could there be for these alleged crimes?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, there's already investigations underway by the International Criminal Court. And as you said, Ukraine and Russia are not state parties to the Rome Statute, but Ukraine, back in 2014, agreed to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. And so that does give the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide that have been committed in Ukraine since 2014. And so there is already significant investigations.\n\nI would expect that there will be prosecutions at the International Criminal Court. Those wheels turn slowly, but they do turn. And there will be, I expect, trials taking place in the International Criminal Court. In addition, the Ukrainian courts themselves have been already beginning trials for war crimes. So we have international accountability, but we also have accountability in Ukraine.\n\nFADEL: Professor Oona Hathaway of Yale University, thank you so much for joining us and exploring that question with us.\n\nHATHAWAY: Thank you for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "US Warns Russia of 'Horrific' Consequences of Any Nuclear Attack in Ukraine": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has made it clear publicly and privately to Russia to “stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons” in the Ukraine conflict following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement that he would use any means to defend Russia.\n\n“It’s very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific, and we’ve made that very clear,” Blinken told CBS News’s “60 Minutes” show in an interview broadcast late Sunday.\n\nBlinken said using nuclear weapons “would have catastrophic effects for, of course, the country using them, but for many others as well.”\n\nThe U.S. response came after Putin signaled the possibility of a nuclear attack last week as he called up 300,000 military reservists to help Russia fight in its seven-month invasion of Ukraine. The troop augmentation came after Russian battlefield setbacks, with Kyiv’s forces recapturing large swaths of territory in northeast Ukraine that Russia had seized in the early weeks of the war.\n\nBritain’s defense ministry said Monday that the first of the call-ups had started to arrive at military bases, but that Russia faces administrative and logistical challenges in training those troops.\n\n“Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years,” the ministry said. “The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilization, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate.”\n\nProtests against call-up\n\nWidespread protests against Putin’s troop call-up have erupted in Russia, with police arresting hundreds of demonstrators participating in street protests in Moscow and elsewhere.\n\nIn Russia’s Siberia region Monday, a 25-year-old man shot a military commandant at an enlistment center, the local governor said.\n\nMany men opposed to Putin’s war or fearful of being killed in the battlefront have abruptly fled Russia on flights to other countries, while others have joined long queues of cars on land routes headed to the Russian borders with Finland, Georgia and other countries.\n\nRussia is in the midst of staging five days of disputed referenda in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially controls, votes where it assumes the local residents will support Russian annexation, which would give Moscow a pretext to defend the newly claimed territory. In some instances, Russian soldiers have been going door to door to order Ukrainians to vote at gunpoint.\n\nBut Ukraine, the U.S. and other Western allies are calling the referenda sham votes and of no legal consequence. Any Russian annexation of Ukrainian land would not be globally recognized.\n\n“These so-called elections are a sham, period,” Blinken told CBS. “They go in, they put in puppet governments, local governments, and then they proceed with a vote, which they’ll manipulate in any event in order to try to declare the territory Russian territory. It is not. It will never be recognized as such. And the Ukrainians have every right to take it back.”\n\nFears are running high that Moscow may close the borders to men of fighting age after the referendums in Ukraine end to stem the mass exodus.\n\nNuclear saber-rattling\n\nA State Department official said Putin gave the U.S. and its allies a gift last week by engaging in nuclear saber-rattling, calling for a troop mobilization and announcing the referenda while the U.S. was at the United Nations “talking about sovereignty and international peace and security.” The official said Russia “couldn’t have timed it better to put a spotlight on the grave offenses that Russia is committing to Ukraine and the international order.”\n\nAt a commemoration of the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday that nuclear weapons do not offer security, just “carnage and chaos” and said eliminating them would be the greatest gift humanity could offer future generations.\n\n“Let me be clear: The era of nuclear blackmail must end,” Guterres said. “The idea that any country could fight and win a nuclear war is deranged. Any use of a nuclear weapon would incite a humanitarian Armageddon. We need to step back.”\n\nIn an interview aired Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” show, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainians who refuse to vote in the referenda face significant retribution from Russian forces.\n\n“Russians can turn off their electricity and won’t give them an opportunity to live a normal human life,” Zelenskyy said. “They force people, they throw them in prisons. They force them to come to these pseudo-referenda. And also, they also announced mobilization [of 300,000 reservists.] They’re forcing people to fight, people from the temporarily occupied territories.”\n\nBut Zelenskyy said, “There is no support in the society for this referendum.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said the referenda are “a very dangerous signal” from Putin that he does not intend to end the war.\n\n“He knows that he’s losing the war,” Zelenskyy said. “In the battlefield, Ukraine has seized the initiative. He cannot explain to his society why, and he is looking for answers to these questions.”\n\nWith the West and Ukraine saying the voting is almost assuredly preordained to favor Russian annexation, Zelenskyy said Moscow will then say, “Now, it’s the West who attacks Russia. Now, the West attacks our territories. We have to let the society join Russia, the society that wanted to be with Russia.”\n\nZelenskyy said a Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine “could be a reality. He wants to scare the whole world. These are the first steps of his nuclear blackmail. I don’t think he's bluffing.”\n\nBut Zelenskyy added, “I think the world is deterring it and containing this threat. We need to keep putting pressure on him and not allow him to continue.”\n\nHe concluded, “I think that the military strategy of military and political leadership of Russia has not changed: its occupation of our country. And of course, they want to destabilize our country from inside.”\n\nHe said Ukrainians are united against Putin, “even more united now than ever, over the 31 years of our independence from the Soviet Union.”\n\n“So, he does everything possible to destabilize our country to make sure we’re weaker. And for that he wants to divide us of course, I’m one of the targets, of course, it goes without saying,” Zelenskyy said. “It’s not because of my personality, just because... because the president is a leader of their country.”\n\nSome information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

    "As Russian Losses Mount in Ukraine, Putin Gets More Involved in War Strategy": "The divisions over Kherson are only the latest disagreements between Mr. Putin and his top commanders. Senior Russian officers repeatedly questioned the early plans for the war, American officials said, particularly an initial stage that envisioned a quick strike on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. The Russian officers believed Mr. Putin was going to war with insufficient troops and weaponry, American officials said.\n\nThe Russian officers’ concerns proved correct, and after the defeat of the Russian army outside Kyiv, Mr. Putin eased up his control of military planning. He allowed senior generals to create a new strategy focused on massive artillery barrages, American officials said. The new strategy was effectively a grinding war of attrition that played to the Russian military’s strength and succeeded in pushing the army forward in eastern Ukraine.\n\nSince Mr. Putin ordered his commanders to continue fighting in Kherson, the Russian military has tried to halt the Ukrainian advance there. Last week the Russians blew up a dam on the Inhulets River to make the current counteroffensive more difficult.\n\nBut Ukrainian strikes have blown up the crossings over the Dnipro River, which has largely cut off Russian troops from their supply lines on the other side. Russians have had to use pontoon bridges to cross the river, only to see them hit by Ukrainian fire, Ukrainian officials said. “They’ve got units in there who, if the Ukrainians break through the lines, will be cut off and surrounded,” said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I cannot overstate how dicey the situation is for them.”\n\nPulling back past the Dnipro River would likely allow Russian commanders to hold the line in the south with fewer troops. That would give them more latitude to redeploy forces from Kherson to other areas, either pushing back against the Kharkiv counteroffensive in the northeast, solidifying defensive lines in the eastern Donbas region or opening up a new front in the south.\n\nBut Mr. Putin has told commanders he will set the strategy.\n\n“In this war there has been a consistent mismatch between Putin’s political objectives and the military means to attain them,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a defense research institute in Arlington, Va. “At important decision points Putin has procrastinated, refusing to recognize the reality, until the options turned from bad to worse.”",
    "Responding to Ukraine’s Displacement Crisis: From Speed to Sustainability - Ukraine": "Some seven million people are displaced inside Ukraine, many of them with no home to return to. The grassroots effort organised to help them is not sustainable. Donors should keep channelling aid to civil society but lay the groundwork for the state to step in.\n\nWhat’s new? Tens of millions of Ukrainians have fled fighting since Russia invaded in February, in Europe’s largest movement of people since World War II. As the war rages on, local volunteer networks, aid organisations and the Ukrainian state are stretched thin trying to respond to the mounting humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhy does it matter? Though Ukraine’s recent military advances might enable some of the displaced to go home, millions have nowhere to return to. Helping them is a serious challenge for Ukraine and its backers – one growing more urgent as people struggle to overcome trauma, get jobs and find shelter ahead of winter.\n\nWhat should be done? Speeding up the delivery of financial support to ease the humanitarian toll is vital to Ukraine’s survival. A long view and a finely calibrated division of labour among the state, local civil society and international organisations will be critical for what will be a decades-long effort to assist the displaced.\n\nI. Overview\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has forcibly displaced people on a scale unprecedented in Europe since World War II. In addition to the millions of refugees who have left the country, some seven million people have fled combat zones for safer areas inside Ukraine. A sprawling grassroots network has organised to help them. Local governments and civil society groups, using donated money and goods, have worked to provide housing, food and medicine to those in need. The response’s ad hoc nature made it fast and flexible. But it is not sustainable. Nor is it easy to scale up for the long-term displacement crisis the country faces, for one thing because it poses challenges in ensuring accountability for flows of supplies. Donors and the international organisations they fund will need to make new arrangements that, while continuing to give civil society a prominent role, shift the burden onto the broader shoulders of the government.\n\nWith millions of Ukrainians living in cramped apartments, dormitories and gymnasiums, out of work and unable to return to homes destroyed or now in Russian-occupied territory, the scale of need is staggering. How displaced people will weather the winter to come, amid rising prices and fuel shortages, is already worrying humanitarian workers. International agencies face huge challenges in getting aid to those most in need at a time when the global humanitarian system is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and food and energy price volatility, not to mention several other major wars, and when the collapse of Russian-Western relations looks set to deepen dismal trends in multilateral crisis management, complicating diplomacy aimed at helping the displaced and those living near the front lines as well as in Russian-occupied areas.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is all the more important that the humanitarian response take a long-term approach, even while responding quickly to the emergency. Donors and international agencies should channel their assistance so that local civil society takes the lead now, but start laying the groundwork for government services to step in. Ukrainian authorities, civil society groups and foreign supporters should work together on more transparent rules for the incoming aid to clear up concerns about whether assistance is going to the people who need it most. A swifter, steadier flow of funds to the displaced would free recipients from dependence on charity and could eventually be a model for reconstruction when the war ends.\n\nII. Who is on the Move?\n\nOne third of Ukraine’s pre-invasion population of 41 million had to leave home during the first six months after Russia’s large-scale attack on 24 February. Some 7.3 million people fled the country, the biggest share of whom travelled through or stayed in Poland.1 Ukraine introduced martial law on the day of the invasion, prohibiting most men between the ages of eighteen and 60 from departing.2 As a consequence, more than 90 per cent of those who arrived in neighbouring countries were women and children.3 Among the internally displaced people (IDPs) as well, the majority, about two thirds, are women, as men face greater obstacles in travelling or seeking accommodation. Many men have also enlisted or stayed behind to guard property or hold on to jobs. More than half – 53 per cent – of IDP families have children, making child care and schooling a major concern.",

From New York they flew to Birmingham, arriving shortly after noon on Saturday, the Drueke family statement said.\n\nDrueke’s mother, Lois “Bunny” Drueke, and Huynh’s fiancee, Joy Black, met the pair in New York and accompanied them home to Alabama.\n\nDrueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw, who has served as a spokesperson for the two families, said the two men were “in excellent spirits”.

    "Ukraine war: Russia's mobilisation efforts are likely to fail, according to ISW think tank": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to overcome fundamental structural challenges in attempting to mobilise large numbers of Russians to continue his war in Ukraine. That's according to the think tank the Insitute for the Study of War (ISW), in a special edition of the campaign assessment, focused on Russian military mobilisation efforts.\n\nPutin already conducted at least four attempts at rounding up Russians to fight over the past year, which has likely drained the pool of available combat-ready and willing reservists ahead of the “partial mobilisation,\" the ISW added.\n\nRecruitment efforts\n\nThe first started in autumn 2021 when the Russian military launched an initiative called the Russian Combat Army Reserve with the aim of recruiting 100,000 volunteers. This effort largely failed, the ISW says.\n\nThen there was a pre-invasion call-up, right before February 24th when Russia invaded Ukraine. This was followed by a third and smaller effort during the invasion period itself in early March 2022.\n\nRussia then launched a fourth effort in June 2022, with a call for the formation of “volunteer battalions”.\n\nMap of where Russia is recruiting its troops Euronews\n\nThe Kremlin directed all of Russia’s “federal subjects”, to generate at least one volunteer battalion each and to pay enlistment and combat bursaries out of their own budgets.

    "Is Ukraine Putin’s Iraq?": "A careful reading of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine speech last week raises two contrarian questions. First, is Ukraine Putin’s Iraq? The parallels are striking.\n\nAs the United States was propelled into the second Iraq war 20 years ago over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that did not exist, Putin’s manufactured arguments for invading Ukraine to protect the people of Donbas and Crimea from Kyiv’s “neo-nazi” repression resonated with similarly fraudulent arguments. Most Americans accepted the George W. Bush administration’s reasons for the invasion. So too, many Russians believe or have chosen not to reject Putin’s deceit.\n\nFurther, as George W. Bush used the fatuous “mushroom cloud argument,” Putin repeats it for home consumption. He asserts that Western states “have even resorted to nuclear blackmail. I am referring … (to) high ranking representatives of the leading NATO nations on the admissibility of using … nuclear weapons against Russia.” Really?\n\nPutin is also recreating the U.S. “surge” in Iraq, calling up 300,000 reservists. But unlike the U.S. surge, this one may prove a Potemkin village. It takes considerable time to recruit, retrain, equip and deploy these forces, probably longer than the General Staff in Moscow has calculated. Russia cannot provide adequate logistics for its forces in Ukraine. How will it provide basic food, shelter, training, weapons, equipment and other support for this cohort that on paper is 50 percent larger than the number of troops in Ukraine?\n\nRussia also lacks generals with the competence of America’s in Iraq, such as David Petraeus, to execute a surge. And unanswered is whether Russian protests against the call-up and de facto draft will have an impact. The U.S. public initially supported the Iraq War despite the absence of WMD. More likely, Russian security and police forces will quickly contain any riots and major protests.\n\nThe second question is that while the speech was interpreted in the West as escalatory, threatening the use of nuclear weapons and an energy embargo to shatter NATO cohesion, is there an alternative explanation? Could that threat have been a form of maskirovka (deception) concealing Putin’s real aim of ending the war through forced negotiations? The “tell” could have been Putin’s previously undisclosed claim of Kyiv’s representatives initially voicing “a positive response to our proposals” for a settlement.\n\nTo non-Russians, Putin’s accusations of NATO wielding a nuclear threat are preposterous. NATO is a defensive alliance, possessing a relatively small number of so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Nowhere has any NATO leader even intimated using nuclear weapons: Quite the opposite. And Presidents Biden and Putin have agreed that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.\n\nOther than invention, how could Putin possibly have concluded that NATO was overtly making a nuclear threat? The answer actually makes sense to a Russian, especially a paranoid one. U.S. military strategy since the Obama administration has been “to contain, deter and, if war comes, defeat” potential enemies led by Russia and China.\n\nAs a world war almost certainly would be nuclear, Moscow perceives this strategy as a direct nuclear threat to it. And, the U.S. has deployed nuclear capable B-52 bombers in proximity to Russia as a show of force. Moscow has regarded these deployments as a direct nuclear threat. Perhaps Washington and Brussels did not consider this reaction.\n\nHow then should the West react to the lines in the speech that were perceived as particularly provocative, such as “In the event of a threat to our territorial integrity and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all means available to us. This is not a bluff.” That threat needs to be taken seriously but not overly dramatized.\n\nOne conclusion is that the West may be in a much stronger position than it realizes. To deal with the unlikely but not impossible nuclear scenario, the West must make it absolutely clear that in that circumstance all Russian military forces in Ukraine would be vulnerable to attack. And the West has the ability to cripple Russian forces with precision strikes that would put the Ukrainian army in a dominant position.\n\nThere is another conclusion. As recommended last week, a three-pronged strategy must be implemented that combines diplomacy with judicial use of force.

    "Russia’s call-up splits EU; Ukraine says it shows weakness": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s rush to mobilize hundreds of thousands of recruits to staunch stinging losses in Ukraine is a tacit acknowledgement that its “army is not able to fight,” Ukraine’s president said Sunday, as splits sharpened in Europe over whether to welcome or turn away Russians fleeing the call-up.\n\nSpeaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said he’s bracing for more Russian strikes on Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure, as the Kremlin seeks to ramp up the pressure on Ukraine and its Western backers as the weather gets colder. Zelenskyy warned that this winter “will be very difficult.”\n\n“They will shoot missiles, and they will target our electric grid. This is a challenge, but we are not afraid of that.” he said on “Face the Nation.”\n\nHe portrayed the Russian mobilization — its first such call-up since World War II — as a signal of weakness, not strength, saying: “They admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZelenskyy also said Ukraine has received NASAMS air defense systems from the U.S. NASAMS uses surface-to-air missiles to track and shoot down incoming missiles or aircraft. Zelenskyy did not say how many Ukraine received.\n\nAlthough the European Union is now largely off limits to most Russians, with direct flights stopped and its land borders increasingly closed to them, an exodus of Russian men fleeing military service is creating divisions among European officials over whether they should be granted safe haven.\n\nThe partial mobilization is also triggering protests in Russia, with new anti-war demonstrations on Sunday.\n\nIn Dagestan, one of Russia’s poorer regions in the North Caucasus, police fired warning shots to try to disperse more than 100 people who blocked a highway while protesting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military call-up, Russian media reported.\n\nDozens of women chanted “No to war!” in the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala on Sunday. Videos of the protests showed women in head scarves chasing police away from the rally and standing in front of police cars carrying detained protesters, demanding their release.\n\nWomen also protested in the Siberian city of Yakutsk, chanting “No to genocide!” and marching in a circle around police, who later dragged some away or forced them into police vans, according to videos shared by Russian media.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt least 2,000 people have been arrested in recent days for similar demonstrations around Russia. Many of those taken away have immediately received a call-up summons.\n\nUnconfirmed Russian media reports that the Kremlin might soon close Russian borders to men of fighting age are fueling panic and prompting more to flee.\n\nZelenskyy in his nightly address on Sunday described Russia’s mobilization as “criminal” and reiterated his call for Russians to stand up to it.\n\n“Fight so that they don’t send your children to die, all of those who they can take in this criminal Russian mobilization,” Zelenskyy said, switching to Russian for a brief portion of his speech. “Because if you come to take the lives of our children, I will tell you as a father — we will not let you go alive.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGerman officials have voiced a desire to help Russian men deserting military service and have called for a European-wide solution. Germany has held out the possibility of granting asylum to deserters and those refusing the draft.\n\nIn France, senators are arguing that Europe has a duty to help and warned that not granting refuge to fleeing Russians could play into Putin’s hands, feeding his narrative of Western hostility to Russia.\n\n“Closing our frontiers would fit neither with our values nor our interests,” a group of more than 40 French senators said.\n\nYet other EU countries are adamant that asylum shouldn’t be offered to Russian men fleeing now — when the war has moved into its eighth month. They include Lithuania, which borders Kaliningrad, a Russian Baltic Sea exclave. Its foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, tweeted: “Russians should stay and fight. Against Putin.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis counterpart in Latvia, also an EU member bordering Russia, said the exodus poses “considerable security risks” for the 27-nation bloc and that those fleeing now can’t be considered conscientious objectors since they did not act when Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nMany “were fine with killing Ukrainians, they did not protest then,” the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkevics, tweeted. He added that they still have “plenty of countries outside EU to go.”\n\nFinland also said it intends to “significantly restrict” entry to Russians entering the EU through its border with Russia. A Finnish opposition leader, Petteri Orpo, said fleeing Russian military reservists were an “obvious” security risk and “we must put our national security first.”\n\nRussia is pressing on with its call-up of hundreds of thousands of men, seeking to reverse recent losses. Without control of the skies over Ukraine, Russia is also making increasing use of suicide drones from Iran, with more strikes reported Sunday in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Ukrainian and Russian military planners, the clock is ticking, with the approach of winter expected to make fighting much more complicated. Already, rainy weather is bringing muddy conditions that are starting to limit the mobility of tanks and other heavy weapons, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Sunday.\n\nBut the think-tank said Ukrainian forces are still gaining ground in their counteroffensive, launched in late August, that has rolled back the Russian occupation across large areas of the northeast and which also prompted Putin’s new drive for reinforcements.\n\nThe Kremlin said its initial aim is to add about 300,000 troops to its invasion force, which is struggling with equipment losses, mounting casualties and weakening morale. The mobilization marks a sharp shift from Putin’s previous efforts to portray the war as a limited military operation that wouldn’t interfere with most Russians’ lives.\n\nThe mobilization is running hand-in-hand with Kremlin-orchestrated votes in four occupied regions of Ukraine that could pave the way for their imminent annexation by Russia.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies say the referendums in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south and the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions have no legal validity, not least because many tens of thousands of their people have fled. They also call them a “sham.” Some footage has shown armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting.\n\nThe voting ends Tuesday and there’s little doubt it will be declared a success by the Russian occupiers. The main questions then will be how soon Putin’s regime will annex the four regions and how that will complicate the war.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Jari Tanner in Helsinki and John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",
    "Ukraine: civilian casualty update 26 September 2022": "Date: 26 September 20221\n\nFrom 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 25 September 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 14,844 civilian casualties in the country: 5,996 killed and 8,848 injured. This included:\n\na total of 5,996 killed (2,334 men, 1,605 women, 157 girls, and 190 boys, as well as 35 children and 1,675 adults whose sex is yet unknown)\n\na total of 8,848 injured (1,850 men, 1,356 women, 191 girls, and 264 boys, as well as 221 children and 4,966 adults whose sex is yet unknown) In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 8,382 casualties (3,591 killed and 4,791 injured) On Government-controlled territory: 6,657 casualties (3,213 killed and 3,444 injured) On territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups: 1,725 casualties (378 killed and 1,347 injured) In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Poltava, Rivne, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Volyn, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 6,462 casualties (2,405 killed and 4,057 injured)\n\n\n\nMost of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes.\n\nOHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.\n\nCivilian casualties from 1 to 25 September 2022(individual cases verified by OHCHR)\n\nFrom 1 to 25 September 2022, OHCHR recorded 897 civilian casualties:\n\n216 killed (71 men, 50 women, 2 girls, 4 boys, as well as 1 child and 88 adults whose sex is yet unknown); and\n\n681 injured (151 men, 105 women, 10 girls, 24 boys, as well as 15 children and 376 adults whose sex is yet unknown).\n\nThis included:\n\n160 killed and 564 injured in 120 settlements in regions (parts of regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred (81 percent of the total); and\n\n56 killed and 117 injured in 8 settlements in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups (19 percent of the total).\n\nPer type of weapon/incident:\n\nExplosive weapons with wide area effects: 210 killed and 637 injured (94 per cent);\n\nMines and explosive remnants of war: 6 killed and 44 injured (6 per cent).\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine\n\nSince 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available andnumbers may change as new information emerges over time. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.\n\nENDS\n\nUkrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page.",
    "Ukraine has more pluses than minuses for climate": "TINOS, Greece, Sept 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - There are lots of reasons to worry about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but its impact on the fight against climate change is not one of them. Indeed, one of the silver linings of the terrible war is that it should make it easier to combat rising temperatures by spurring the global economy to emit less carbon.\n\nRecent depressing headlines give a different impression. As gas prices have soared across the world, many countries have switched to using more coal, which emits twice as much carbon dioxide for each unit of energy as gas. Demand for the black rock, which had been falling, is set to return to its all-time high this year, led by China and India, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nMeanwhile the developed world is desperately searching for alternative gas supplies. African countries are keen to exploit their reserves, while European countries are building liquefied natural gas terminals and exploring pipeline projects. This new “dash for gas” could lock in irreversible global warming or create a mass of stranded assets, according to Climate Action Tracker.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nZOMBIE DIPLOMACY\n\nAs if this is not enough, climate diplomacy has broken down. World leaders are preoccupied with the war, the energy crisis and high food prices. Few expect big achievements at COP27, the next United Nations climate conference, which will take place in Egypt in November.\n\nParticularly worrying is how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated tension between China, Moscow’s most important friend, and the United States, Kyiv’s top weapons supplier. After Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan last month, the People’s Republic froze climate discussions with America.\n\nCollaboration between the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide paved the way for the vital Paris Agreement in 2015. Dialogue between Xie Zhenhua and John Kerry, the two countries’ top climate diplomats, created momentum around last year’s COP26 talks. But relations have now reached “zombie status”, according to Isabel Hilton, the founder of China Dialogue.\n\nWhat’s more, the invasion of Ukraine means both rich and poor countries are paying more for energy, food and in some cases arms, leaving less money for climate projects. Debt levels have risen almost everywhere. So has inflation, which central banks are attempting to bring down by hiking interest rates – in turn adding to debt burdens.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nSECURITY AND CLIMATE ALIGNED\n\nThe good news more than drowns out the doom and gloom, though. Governments and their populations may now care more about securing energy supplies and making ends meet than saving the planet. But what they want for geopolitical and economic reasons will help in the fight against climate change.\n\nThink of a Venn diagram with three circles – one for security, another for prosperity and the third for climate. The war in Ukraine has created a bigger overlap between them.\n\nLook first at security. Many governments want to build up secure sources of energy, in part by increasing domestic supplies. In many cases, the only options are zero-carbon technologies, led by renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.\n\nEurope has lost its top energy supplier, Russia, more or less overnight. China and India, which produce little domestic fossil fuel apart from coal, have also seen the dangers of being overdependent on other countries. Even as they buy Russian oil at discounted prices, the two countries are ramping up production of renewable energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the tension between America and China helped shape Joe Biden’s so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which will provide $369 billion for clean energy. Part of bill’s motivation is to build a domestic clean tech manufacturing sector to avoid America depending on Chinese kit for batteries, solar panels and wind farms.\n\nPOWERFUL ECONOMICS\n\nEconomic forces unleashed by the war are also driving changes that are good for the planet. Gas prices are five times higher than they were a year ago, and markets are betting they will stay high for many years.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nThis would normally spur more investment in gas projects and the infrastructure to get it to customers. But these are incredibly capital-intensive investments which, with the exception of shale gas, take a long time to develop and then an even longer time to pay back their upfront costs. Many investors are sceptical about the long-term demand for gas. As a result, new investment is being constrained, according to Michele Della Vigna, author of Goldman Sachs’ Carbonomics research.\n\nMany gas infrastructure projects will stay on the drawing board, except for those configured to switch to green hydrogen – made with renewable energy – when it becomes economically feasible. Moreover, much of Russia’s gas may stay permanently in the ground, as it will be expensive to build new pipelines to China, and Beijing won’t want to be too dependent on Moscow’s gas.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, aren’t just switching to renewable energy because it is cheaper. The Ukraine war has also made people around the world more aware of the damage caused by volatile fossil fuel prices, says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Renewable power is set to break another global record this year, according to the IEA. The agency now expects global gas demand between 2021 and 2025 to rise by less than half the amount it previously forecast.\n\nGOOD AND BAD TIPPING POINTS\n\nThe accelerated rollout of clean technologies is creating economies of scale, pushing down costs more rapidly than previously expected. This will make solar and wind power even more economically viable, once supply chains are expanded. It will also accelerate the point when infant technologies become financially attractive and take off rapidly, says Nigel Topping, the High Level Climate Action Champion at COP26. There is particular excitement about green hydrogen which can store electricity, be used to make steel, and power ships.\n\nNone of this is a reason to relax about climate change. Governments can do more to mitigate the damage the war is doing to the climate. It is in western countries’ long-term interests to help poor countries accelerate their green transitions. It is also in China’s and America’s interests to revive their climate diplomacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the world is way off the Paris Agreement’s commitment to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world is heading to at least 2.4 degrees of warming, if not more, according to Climate Action Tracker.\n\nWhat’s more, the planet may be closer to tipping into catastrophic climate change than expected. This year’s massive floods in Pakistan and heatwaves throughout Europe suggest the effects of global warming have already arrived. The invasion of Ukraine may have spurred the world to emit less carbon. But it may also have less time to act.\n\nFollow @Hugodixon on Twitter\n\n(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

    "Lyman, A Supply Hub In Eastern Ukraine, Is The Last Place A Russian Soldier Wants To Be Right Now": "A Ukrainian 2S7 howitzer in action. Ukrainian defense ministry capture\n\nThe Oskil River, running north to south from Russia all the way to the Donets River in eastern Ukraine, is a natural defensive barrier.\n\nSo it made sense that, when a dozen eager Ukrainian brigades punched through fragile Russian lines outside the free city of Kharkiv the first week of September, the Russians retreated 30 miles east across the river.\n\nIf the Russian army weren’t exhausted from seven months of combat against an increasingly inventive and determined foe—and if the Kremlin hadn’t raided units in the east in order to reinforce the south, where a second Ukrainian counteroffensive also is underway—the Oskil defensive line might’ve held.\n\nIt didn’t. Now a key Russian supply hub is in danger farther to the south: the town of Lyman.\n\nAfter crossing the Oskil, the Ukrainians kept right on pushing. Today, they hold at least five bridgeheads on the east side of the river.\n\nYes, the Kremlin has announced a nationwide mobilization and chaotically is drafting into army service potentially 300,000 men. No, these draftees won’t arrive in time—or, given the utter lack of training, in any condition—to save the Russian position east of the Oskil.\n\nAnd that has huge implications for Russia’s hold on the northern part of Luhansk Oblast, which since 2014 has been under the control of pro-Russian separatists—and which now is subject to a sham “referendum” that purports to make the oblast officially part of Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainians are on the move across eastern Ukraine. Three prongs of their counteroffensive are poised to surround and cut off the Russian garrison in Lyman, a key railway hub through which rolls much of the supply for the Russian army in the east.\n\nRussian forces east of Kharkiv now are falling back to a new defensive line threading a valley running from the town of Svatove in the north to Kremmina in the south, 25 miles away. A valley, surrounded on both sides by high ground, isn’t exactly a strong position for any defender.\n\nThe Russian air force in recent days has dialed up its sortie rate in the east in a desperate bid to save the beleaguered Russian ground forces, but stiff Ukrainian air-defenses have blunted the impact of these air ops. The Ukrainians shot down four Russian jets on Saturday alone.\n\nThe likeliest question now isn’t whether the Ukrainians capture Lyman, but when. Separate Ukrainian forces are rolling north across the Donets from positions east of Lyman, north across the same river from positions west of Lyman and east across the Oskil from positions north of Lyman.\n\nThe northern gambit might be the most catastrophic for the Russians, as it’s a wide enough envelopment that it could cut off several battalions with thousands of troops. Or even more troops if the Kremlin manages to shove reinforcements into the area.\n\nMike Martin, a fellow at the Department of War Studies at King's College in London, is betting on the latter. “Lyman looks like the old bait-and-switch,” he tweeted. “Drive flanks north and east of Lyman, causing the Russians to reinforce this critical railroad junction. Then drive a much bigger encircling movement to trap the whole lot.”",
    "What's next for the war in Ukraine": "What's next for the war in Ukraine\n\nNearly seven months of war in Ukraine, Kyiv's counteroffensive succeeded and Russia ordered more troops to mobilize. Ukrainian lawmakers have been visiting Washington to petition for more arms.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nAfter nearly seven months of war in Ukraine, a lot has happened recently. There was Ukraine's successful counteroffensive in the east. Then, the Kremlin ordered more Russian troops to mobilize, and its puppet authorities in Ukraine announced plans that would lead to further annexation of Russian occupied territory. And if all that is not enough, Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening to deploy nuclear weapons. Three members of Ukraine's parliament recently met their U.S. congressional counterparts and requested longer-range artillery and tanks. Here's how one of those lawmakers put it through an interpreter.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Through interpreter) In order to actually drive Russia out of our territory, we do need more weapons.\n\nKELLY: More weapons - well, we have got NPR's Jason Beaubien in eastern Ukraine and our Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman here in the studio with me to walk us through this. Welcome to you both.\n\nTOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.\n\nJASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: Thanks, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: Jason, I will let you kick us off. You're in eastern Ukraine right now. I'll let you tell us exactly where, but this is where we've just seen this successful counteroffensive. What does it look like? What are you hearing?\n\nBEAUBIEN: Yeah, that's right. I'm in the city of Kharkiv, in the northeast of the country. And one of the things that we're seeing is a lot of military equipment that the Ukrainians seized from the retreating Russian forces during this latest counteroffensive. You're seeing tanks being hauled off on flatbed trucks. You're seeing armored personnel carriers rolling through the streets. And you can tell that this stuff was seized from the Russians because the Russians have spray-painted on almost all of their equipment a white Z...\n\nKELLY: Oh.\n\nBEAUBIEN: ...On the side of it. Some of this equipment has been completely destroyed. But you also see, by the side of the road, as you're driving through some of these recently liberated territories, Ukrainian soldiers are out there in the ditch, trying to, like, put new tracks on a stuck Russian tank. Officials are saying, here in Ukraine, that they have gained dozens, potentially hundreds of additional tanks during this counteroffensive. There's also been a lot of ammunition that was left behind by Russian-aligned forces. I was in this one tiny, little town that had been right on the front line prior to the counteroffensive, and residents there were showing me piles of rocket-propelled grenades and boxes of ammunition that the Russians had left behind as they fled.\n\nKELLY: Tom, talk to me about those Ukrainian lawmakers we just mentioned who came to Washington. You talked to one of them.\n\nBOWMAN: Right. There were three Ukrainian lawmakers here. I spoke with one of them, Roman Kostenko, who is also, by the way, an Army colonel. And, again, they want American tanks, longer-range artillery. Now, Ukraine is getting tanks from Poland, and a couple of dozen more will be provided by Slovenia. All those are Soviet-era tanks, but the American tanks have greater firepower and are faster. That's why they want them. Now, with artillery, there's a system called HIMARS provided by the U.S. Sixteen of these highly accurate rocket artillery pieces are now in the fight. Now, the rounds the U.S. provides can only travel up to 50 miles. But Colonel Kostenko told me they want rounds that can travel up to nearly 200 miles. And he said that's on the list. Now, let's listen to what he said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROMAN KOSTENKO: (Through interpreter) HIMARS is only one of the items on that list. And as we talked with the members of Congress, we emphasized that, in order to regain our territories that are now under Russian occupation, we need more offensive types of weapons. And so we were raising questions about such weapons as tanks, aircraft, armored vehicles - things we need in order to successfully continue the offensive.\n\nKELLY: Is the U.S. going to keep providing more weapons? Will we provide this additional military aid?\n\nBOWMAN: You know, it's uncertain. Officials fear that providing the longer-range artillery could hit targets deep inside Russia, and they don't want to further antagonize Vladimir Putin. And a senior defense official said the U.S. may provide tanks in the future, but not for the immediate fight. This official said the Ukrainians are familiar with the Soviet-era tanks and would need further training on the American one, both how to operate them and maintain them. Now, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's call to bring up 300,000 reservists, that may spur even more talk of giving the Ukrainians these more powerful weapons. And the people I talk with, Mary Louise, say it's more likely you'll see longer range artillery shells, but not the tanks. So we'll just have to see.\n\nKELLY: Jason, what are you hearing about all this, actually inside Ukraine - this need for more weaponry that the Ukrainians are putting out there?\n\nBEAUBIEN: Yeah, despite that recent haul of seized Russian weapons from the counteroffensive, officials in Kyiv are saying that they really need these modern Western weapons and that they are highly effective - you know, particularly as Tom mentioned, the longer-range missiles and also equipment for air defense systems. There's sort of two prongs to this. First, they want these better weapons to try to really aggressively push forward with another counteroffensive in the south of the country at a time when Russia is clearly on its back foot. You know, this is sort of like Muhammad Ali would come charging out of his corner at this point, from a tactical point of view, and really try to push back the Russians from the territory that they've taken here.\n\nThe second prong is defensive. Ukrainian officials and, you know, even local people that I talked to - they're very concerned that this could turn into a long, drawn-out conflict. And if that happens, they want to be able to protect their cities against Russian rocket attacks. At the moment, Russian cruise missiles can still strike anywhere in the country. You know, since the invasion, all commercial air traffic in Ukraine has been shut down. A better air defense system might allow them to get at least an airport out in Lviv, in the west of the country, open. And, you know, you're hardly even seeing any military aircraft in the air here. Ukrainians really would like some international help in regaining control of their airspace.\n\nKELLY: Before I let you both go, Jason, respond to something Tom just dropped into the conversation - that Russia may be possibly sending up to 300,000 more troops. How is that news being received in Ukraine?\n\nBEAUBIEN: You know, I have to say, Ukrainians seem remarkably unfazed by Putin's latest saber-rattling. People are saying that, so far, they've dealt with everything Russia's been throwing at them. It's been tough, but they say that they're going to deal with whatever comes next.\n\nKELLY: That's NPR's Jason Beaubien reporting from eastern Ukraine and NPR's Tom Bowman covering all things Pentagon. Thanks to you both.\n\nBOWMAN: You're welcome.\n\nBEAUBIEN: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Leading economies sliding into recession as Ukraine war cuts growth, OECD finds": "The world’s leading economies are sliding into recession as the global energy and inflation crises sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine cut growth by more than previously forecast, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nA dependency on expensive gas for heavy industry and home heating will plunge Germany, Italy and the UK into a long period of recession after global growth was projected by the OECD to slow to 2.2% in 2023 from a forecast in June of 2.8%.\n\nWith the global economy needing to grow by about 4% to keep pace with rising populations, the OECD said incomes per head would be lower in many countries.\n\nOECD’s interim chief economist, Álvaro Pereira, said the world was paying a steep price for the Ukraine war and Russia’s decision to restrict access to gas supplies more tightly than was forecast in June.\n\nHe said governments would need to encourage households and businesses to reduce their consumption of gas and oil to help weather a difficult winter.\n\nPereira also supported the determination of central banks to reduce inflation by raising interest rates. “We need to reduce demand, there is no doubt about that. And monetary and fiscal authorities need to work hand in hand to achieve it,” he said.\n\nChina’s growth rate is expected to drop this year to 3.2% – its lowest since the 1970s – causing a large decrease in trade with neighbours South Korea, Vietnam and Japan, dragging down their capacity to grow.\n\nA recovery in China next year to 4.7% will be weaker than expected, the OECD said, as Beijing wrestles with a property market and banking sector weighed down by huge debts.\n\nHowever, the Paris-based policy forum was most alarmed by the outlook across Europe, which is most directly exposed to the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe OECD forecast that UK GDP growth would be flat in 2023. However, this projection does not take into account the measures announced in the chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget on Friday.\n\nThe OECD forecast a drop in growth in the eurozone from 3.1% this year to only 0.3% in 2023, meaning that many countries in the 19-member currency bloc will spend at least part of the year in recession. A recession is defined as two straight quarters of contraction.\n\nFrance could escape a recession if it grows by 0.8% next year as predicted by the OECD, but will suffer along with other European countries after the downgrade in GDP growth since June of 1.3 percentage points.\n\nRussia will shrink by at least 5.5% this year and 4.5% in 2023. Berlin’s dependence on Russian gas before the invasion means the German economy will shrink by 0.7% next year, down from a June estimate of 1.7% growth.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

GDP growth has stalled in many economies and economic indicators point to an extended slowdown,” the organisation’s secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said.\n\nA review of the outlook for the US found that while it is likely to grow slowly this year and be in recession for part of 2023, it was less dependent than other countries on energy from Russia or other sources, allowing for a strong recovery in 2024.\n\nThe OECD forecast that the world’s biggest economy would slow from 1.5% growth this year to only 0.5% next year, down from June forecasts for 2.5% in 2022 and 1.2% in 2023.\n\n\n\nWorld Bank officials have called on central banks to refrain from competitive rate hikes that will push the global economy into recession and harm the economies of developing countries the most.\n\nNevertheless, the OECD said further rate hikes were needed to fight inflation, forecasting that most major central banks’ policy rates would reach at least 4% next year.",
    "On Ukraine, Russia repeats insistence that it had no choice": "Russia has told the world that it has “no choice” but to take military action in Ukraine\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- Russia made its case to the world Saturday for its war in Ukraine, repeating a series of grievances about its neighbor and the West to tell the U.N. General Assembly meeting of leaders that Moscow had “no choice” but to take military action.\n\nAfter days of denunciations of Russia at the prominent diplomatic gathering, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sought to shift the focus to Washington. His speech centered on a claim that the United States and its allies — not Russia, as the West maintains — are aggressively undermining the international system that the U.N. represents.\n\nInvoking history ranging from the U.S. war in Iraq in the early 2000s to the 20th-century Cold War to a 19th-century U.S. policy that essentially proclaimed American influence over the Western Hemisphere, Lavrov portrayed the U.S. as a bully that tries to afford itself “the sacred right to act with impunity wherever and wherever they want” and can't accept a world where others also advance their national interests.\n\n“The United States and allies want to stop the march of history,” he maintained.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine didn't retort at the assembly on Saturday but can still offer formal responses later in the meeting. Both countries' presidents have already given their own speeches describing Russia as a dangerous aggressor that must be stopped.\n\nLavrov, for his part, accused the West of aiming to “destroy and fracture Russia\" in order to “remove from the global map a geopolitical entity that has become all too independent.”\n\nThe Ukraine war has largely dominated the discussion at the assembly's big annual meeting, and many countries have laid into Russia for its Feb. 24 invasion — denouncing its nuclear threats, alleging it has committed atrocities and war crimes, and lambasting its decision to mobilize call up some of its reserves even as the assembly met.\n\n“Neither partial mobilization, nuclear saber-rattling, nor any other escalation will deter us from supporting Ukraine,” Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde declared Saturday.\n\nRussia does have some friends in the sprawling chamber, and one — Belarus — offered a full-throated defense Saturday of its big neighbor. Echoing Russia's talking points, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said “it was precisely the West that made this conflict inevitable” in Ukraine.\n\nThe speeches came amid voting in Russian-occupied parts of eastern and southern Ukraine on whether to join Russia. Moscow characterizes the referendums as self-determination, but Kyiv and its Western allies view them as Kremlin-orchestrated shams with a foregone conclusion.\n\nSome observers think the expected outcome could serve as a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin eventually to escalate the war further.\n\n“We can expect President Putin will claim any Ukrainian effort to liberate this land as an attack on so-called ‘Russian territory,’\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.\n\nLavrov dismissed the complaints as the West “throwing a fit” about people making a choice on where they feel they belong.\n\nRussia has offered a number of explanations for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Lavrov recapped a couple: risks to Russia from what it considers a hostile government in Kyiv and a NATO alliance that has expanded eastward over the years and relieving Russians living in Ukraine — especially its eastern region of the Donbas — of what Moscow views as the Ukrainian government’s oppression.\n\n“The incapacity of Western countries to negotiate and the continued war by the Kyiv regime against their own people left us with no choice” but to recognize the two regions that make up the Donbas as independent and then to send troops in, Lavrov said.\n\nThe aim was “to remove the threats against our security, which NATO has been consistently creating in Ukraine,” he explained.\n\nWhile Ukraine has recently driven Russian troops from some areas in the northeast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week warned the assembly that he believes Moscow wants to spend the winter getting ready for a new offensive, or at least preparing fortifications while mobilizing more troops.\n\nRegardless, he declared that his forces will ultimately oust Russian troops from all of Ukraine.\n\n“We can do it with the force of arms. But we need time,” said Zelenskyy, the only leader who was allowed to address the assembly by video this year.\n\nThe war has disrupted the trade of Ukrainian and Russian grain and Russian fertilizer, touching off a global food crisis. A deal recently brokered by the U.N. and Turkey has helped get Ukrainian grain moving, but fertilizer shipments have proved more difficult.\n\nAt a news conference after his speech, Lavrov said he discussed problems with the deal at a meeting this week with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nAlthough international sanctions against Russia did not target food and fertilizer exports, shipping and insurance companies and banks have been loath to deal with Moscow — and the Kremlin has frequently pointed to that in alleging that Western sanctions have exacerbated the crisis. Lavrov told reporters Saturday that Russia wants fertilizer stuck in European ports to be given to needy countries quickly.\n\nAt the Security Council on Thursday, Ukraine and Russia faced off, in a rare moment when Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, were in the same room — though they kept their distance.\n\nThe General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in March to deplore Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, call for immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces, and urge protection for millions of civilians. The next month, members agreed by a smaller margin to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report.

    "Ukraine War Risks Repercussions for Transnistria": "Destabilization in Moldova incited by Russia could prompt Kyiv and its allies to deprive Moscow of all its levers of influence there once and for all by purging the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic of Russia’s military presence there.\n\nWhen Russia embarked on its war in Ukraine, one of its undeclared goals was shoring up its position in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, and indeed in Moldova as a whole. Instead, the unrecognized republic has become one of the most vulnerable places on the map of what the Kremlin sees as the “Russian world.” Now Moscow runs the risk of losing its outpost on the Dniester River altogether.\n\nNot so long ago, Transnistria was the archetypal frozen conflict playing into the hands of the Kremlin. The government of the breakaway region’s main city Tiraspol has long publicly stated that Transnistria is Russian and will one day be formally recognized as such.\n\nFor decades, a largely symbolic military presence of 1,500 Russian troops in Transnistria has strengthened Russia’s position there. Those troops comprise two components: a peacekeeping contingent that has been there for thirty years, during which the conflict has remained frozen (something Moscow has prided itself upon), and Russian troops left to guard a Soviet-era ammunitions depot in the Transnistrian village of Cobasna, not far from the Ukrainian border.\n\nFor many years, the Moldovan capital Chisinau has seen its government alternate between pro-Russian and pro-European forces. Moscow had hoped that one day, it could use Transnistria to get all of Moldova back on its side by overseeing the return of the breakaway republic to Chisinau’s control, on condition that it would have special status within the country. By reincorporating the pro-Russian region into Moldova, Moscow believed Transnistrian voters would tip the balance in its favor and ensure that the country was always led by a pro-Russian government instead of continuing to drift toward the West. This is why Moscow has never recognized Transnistria’s independence.\n\nBut now Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine appears to have dashed any chances of Chisinau ever turning again toward Russia. In June this year, Moldova was granted EU candidate status, alongside Ukraine. Any future Moldovan government will be pro-European.\n\nBack in the spring, when few could imagine that the Ukrainian armed forces would be able to stop the advance of Russian troops, never mind launch their own counterattack, it seemed that once Ukraine was defeated, Transnistria and Moldova would be next. Russian Major General Rustam Minnekaev even said publicly that Transnistria was one of the targets of Moscow’s “special military operation.”\n\nAt that time, it seemed entirely possible that Russia might take control of all of southern Ukraine, giving it a corridor right up to Moldova’s borders. Today, following Russia’s humiliating retreat from the Kharkiv region, there is no longer any talk of Russian troops taking Odesa and reaching the Moldovan border.\n\nInstead, the overall picture for Russia looks bleaker with every passing day. Even Russia’s most fervent patriots do not deny that their country has been routed on the Ukrainian front. Ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s announcement on September 21 of a partial mobilization, fresh blood to swell the ranks was being recruited in Russian prisons. Donetsk and Luhansk, whose salvation was one of the purported aims of the “operation,” are being shelled more heavily than before Russia’s invasion, and local officials are being blown up in their own offices.\n\nIn other areas where Russia also claims the role of a security guarantor, it’s not much better. Azerbaijan and Armenia have resumed their war: fighting that Moscow had supposedly stopped in 2020. More recently, another military conflict erupted between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, despite them both belonging to the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. These factors cannot fail to take their toll on Russia’s authority and influence over its neighbors.\n\nAmid Moscow’s numerous diplomatic and military failings, Transnistria is becoming a tempting—and relatively easy—target for neighboring Ukraine. Kyiv’s claims that its armed forces could easily take control of the self-proclaimed republic are more than just talk.\n\nRussian troops there serve side by side with local residents: Transnistrians who are Russian passport holders. For the latter, military service has more to do with earning a decent wage by local standards than it does with identity. This puts their willingness to fight in doubt, especially since it would be hard to send in reinforcements from Russia: given the Russian army’s failure to carve out a corridor through southern Ukraine, they could not make their way there overland, and flying them in would risk them being targeted by Ukraine’s air defenses.\n\nTaking Transnistria would be a clear win for Kyiv. For a start, it could restock its arsenal with weapons from Cobasna. In addition, it would be a resounding victory over Russia. Losing its outpost on the Dniester River would be far more shocking and painful for Moscow than its recent retreat from the Kharkiv region.\n\nFor now, Ukraine hasn’t taken any concrete steps toward Transnistria: the most it has done is privately ask Moldova to open a second front against Russia in the breakaway region, which Chisinau declined to do. But there are signs that Russia is planning to stage a coup in Chisinau, which could provoke Kyiv to take action.\n\nDespite being held under house arrest since May on treason and corruption charges, the Kremlin’s longtime partner in Moldova, former president Igor Dodon, regularly calls for mass protests that could bring about a snap presidential election, something the Communist Party led by former president Vladimir Voronin would also like to see.\n\nThe fugitive politician and businessman Ilan Shor has gone one step further. Having fled abroad to avoid a jail sentence for a fraud conviction, he has organized an ongoing anti-government rally that began on September 18 in the center of Chisinau. With claims that 50,000 people will turn out, complete with tents and a stage for speeches, the protests should have all the trappings of a revolution.\n\nThe factor Shor is relying on to bring people to the streets is the cost of Russian gas, which is currently an unprecedentedly high $1,800 per thousand cubic meters in Moldova, and has caused prices for pretty much everything in the impoverished country to rise.\n\nShor, Dodon, Voronin, and their supporters argue that the country is facing the prospect of a very uncomfortable winter, and all because Moldova’s pro-EU government led by President Maia Sandu has fallen out with its strategic partner Russia, and is neither willing nor able to reach an agreement with Moscow on an affordable gas price. If they were in charge, there would be no such problem, of course.\n\nRussia has done its best to support such claims. A delegation of Moldovan deputies from the Shor party (named after its leader) and the Communist Party visited Moscow on September 9 and met with Leonid Slutsky, head of the Duma’s foreign affairs committee. According to the Shor party’s press service, the topics of discussion included finding a solution to provide Moldova with gas at an affordable price.\n\nNo sooner had the Moldovans departed than Slutsky sent an official letter to Shor inviting them to return to discuss a roadmap for solving existing problems. The signal was clear: Russia is prepared to compromise, but the current Moldovan government is not, and should therefore be traded in for one that is. The revolutionary scenario instigated by Shor is designed to bring about that regime change, but whether or not that is possible remains to be seen.\n\nThe key question is how far Ukraine, Romania, and the West in general will be prepared to go to stop Chisinau falling back into Moscow’s sphere of influence, especially while Russia remains at war with Ukraine. The answer is impossible to predict, but the fighting in Ukraine has certainly expanded what is possible. It’s not such a huge leap from launching missile strikes against Russia’s Belgorod region to entering a pro-Russian enclave 1,000 kilometers from Russia.\n\nThere is every chance that destabilization in Moldova incited by Russia will prompt Kyiv and its allies to deprive Moscow of all its levers of influence there once and for all by purging the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic of Russia’s military presence there.\n\nBy:",
    "Putin knows he’s losing the Ukraine war and ‘cannot explain to his society why,’ says Zelensky": "Vladimir Putin is losing the Ukraine war and he knows it.\n\nThat’s according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who shared the message with Americans in a Face the Nation interview Sunday.\n\n“He knows that he’s losing the war,” Zelensky said of his Russian counterpart. “In the battlefield, Ukraine has seized the initiative. He cannot explain to his society why, and he is looking for answers to these questions.”\n\nZelensky made the comments after being asked whether Putin was using recent referendums to annex parts of Ukraine as an excuse to say that Russian territory was being attacked by the West.\n\nWith an invasion that was supposed to take days now in its seventh month, Zelensky said, Putin “has to justify” to his people the military’s struggles against a smaller nation.\n\n“He has to take steps to justify,” Zelensky said of Putin. “He says, ‘See, let’s look at it. I am not afraid of Ukraine. It was a special operation, but now it’s Russia. It’s our territory. Look, we conducted referenda. Now, it’s the West who attacks Russia. Now, the West attacks our territories.”\n\nZelensky also pointed to Putin’s announcement on Wednesday of a partial mobilization of up to 300,000 military reservists to fight the war.\n\n“For several months, they’ve been secretly mobilizing,” he said. “But now, they admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore…They did not expect the resistance that they received from us.”\n\nPutin becoming ‘quite desperate’\n\nZelensky wasn’t alone in noting the pressure mounting on Putin, which some fear will prompt him to respond with nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin is “becoming quite desperate,” said James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander for Europe, on Sunday’s edition of the Cats Roundtable podcast.\n\n“No one wants to be drafted,” the retired U.S. Navy admiral said of Putin’s mobilization announcement. “There are major protests popping up in Russian cities. It’s starting to have that Vietnam-era feel of a growing sense of civil discontent. I would score it a very bad week for Vladimir Putin.”\n\nProtestors risked arrest Wednesday night to demonstrate against the mobilization, and more than 1,200 were detained in Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, an independent Russian human rights group. Some of the detained protestors were handed draft papers while in custody, the group said.\n\nThe protests continued this weekend, with Russian police moving quickly yesterday to disperse the crowds in cities across the nation.\n\nYesterday Zelensky offered guaranteed protections to Russian soldiers who surrender to Ukrainian forces. Such soldiers would be treated in a civilized way, he said, and the circumstances of their surrender wouldn’t be disclosed. For those wanting to avoid a return to Russia, he added, his government would find a way to ensure they’re not exchanged.\n\n“Russian commanders do not care about the lives of Russians,” he said. “They just need to replenish the empty spaces left by the dead, wounded, those who fled or the Russian soldiers that were captured.”\n\nOn Saturday, just days after announcing the mobilization, Putin signed amendments enhancing punishments for citizens refusing to fight or deserting the battlefield, according to Radio Free Europe. They can now reportedly expect up to 10 years in prison.",

    "At UN, Russia’s war in Ukraine is both text and subtext": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After two years of discourse dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s U.N. General Assembly has a new occupant of center stage: the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe pleas made by leaders from around the world for peace were both an altruistic amplification of besieged Ukrainians’ plight as well as born from self-interest. As several speeches made clear, the repercussions of the Russian invasion have been felt even thousands of miles away.\n\n“It is not just the dismay that we feel at seeing such deliberate devastation of cities and towns in Europe in the year 2022. We are feeling this war directly in our lives in Africa,” Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said Wednesday. “Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa.”\n\nThe speeches that elided any direct reference to the conflict were few, but the war resonated even in the absence of its direct invocation. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the president of Kazakhstan, never let the words “Ukraine” or “Russia” slip from his lips, but he made several seemingly pointed allusions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe opened his remarks by painting a bleak picture of a world catapulted into a “new, increasingly bitter period of geopolitical confrontation” that’s engendered “the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, and not even as a last resort.”\n\nJust hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin — who is not attending the U.N. General Assembly — declared that he would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons to defend his country’s territory.\n\nRussia is a key ally of Kazakhstan, and the war in Ukraine has left the former Soviet country in an awkward spot. Tokayev performed a similar dance last week during Pope Francis’ visit, refusing to speak directly about Ukraine while generally decrying a morbid state of affairs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tokayev laid out “three primordial principles: the sovereign equality of states, the territorial integrity of states, and peaceful coexistence between states.”\n\n“These three principles are interdependent. To respect one is to respect the other two. To undermine one is to undermine the other two,” he said.\n\nThe theme of territorial sovereignty resonated in other speeches, as countries who have faced infringements invoked their own traumas or cited the fate of Ukraine as a fear.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We must not be silent in Bosnia and Herzegovina either. We owe that to our vivid memories of the horrors of war and aggression,” Šefik Džaferović, chair of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said Wednesday. “The United Nations system was unable to prevent or stop the war in my country in the period between 1992 and 1995. Unfortunately, that happened again with Ukraine.”\n\nRussia has long been accused of trying to destabilize the Balkans anew — including Bosnia and Herzegovina. Džaferović’s turn at the rostrum came a day after Putin met with a Bosnian Serb separatist leader in Moscow.\n\nRussian peacekeepers have been stationed in Transnistria, a breakaway region in Moldova, since the end of a separatist war in 1992. Sandwiched between description of how the war in Ukraine — “our neighbor and friend” — has affected her country, Moldovan President Maia Sandu called for the “complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops” from Transnistria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPoland is the Ukrainian ally that has taken in the most refugees, and President Andrzej Duda made 34 references to the country in his speech Tuesday.\n\n“We must not forget those who are suffering,” Duda said. “Let us remember that six months of Russian aggression in Ukraine has brought the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II.”\n\nBut Duda also highlighted how Ukraine has captured the world’s attention when many other momentous crises outside of Europe have not.\n\n“Were we equally resolute during the tragedies of Syria, Libya, Yemen? Did we not return to business as usual after two great tragedies of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wars in the Horn of Africa, and while condemning the invasion of Ukraine, do we give equal weight to fighting mercenaries who seek to destabilize the Sahel and threaten many other states in Africa?” he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the first day alone, Ukraine drew more than 150 mentions across speeches from leaders, including the U.N. secretary-general. Antonio Guterres opened the General Assembly by touting Ukraine and Russia’s deal — with the help of Turkey — over grain shipments as an example of successful multilateral diplomacy. The war was threaded throughout his speech, as he turned to its gloomier yields.\n\n“The fighting has claimed thousands of lives. Millions have been displaced. Billions across the world are affected,” he said.\n\nIn the lone video address to the General Assembly, for which he was given special dispensation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself called out the seven countries who voted against the allowance: “Seven.

    "Ukraine warns of 'massive cyberattacks' coming from Russia on critical infrastructure sites": "Written by AJ Vicens\n\nThe Russian government is planning “massive cyberattacks” against Ukrainian critical infrastructure facilities to “increase the effect of missile strikes on electrical supply facilities,” the Ukrainian government said Monday.\n\nThe Russians are also planning to “increase the intensity of the DDoS attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine’s closest allies, primarily Poland and the Baltic state,” the country’s Defense Intelligence agency said in a statement posted to a Ukrainian government website.\n\n“The experience of cyberattacks on Ukraine’s energy systems in 2015 and 2016 will be used when conducting operations,” the agency said in the statement. Russian military intelligence hackers infamously targeted the Ukrainian power grid in the 2016 “Industroyer” attack, which followed the December 2015 BlackEnergy attacks.\n\n“By the cyberattacks, the enemy will try to increase the effect of missile strikes on electricity supply facilities, primarily in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine,” the agency said Monday. “The occupying command is convinced that this will slow down the offensive operations of the Ukrainian Defence Forces.”\n\nTop Ukrainian cyber officials told reporters in April the county thwarted a planned attack aimed at taking out multiple electricity substations and other parts of a grid serving up to 2 million people. The group behind the attack, Sandworm, had modified and updated the Industroyer malware from 2016, researchers said at the time, and had also planned on using destructive malware to obfuscate any analysis and make the systems inoperable and unrecoverable.\n\nUkrainian government officials did not immediately respond to a request for additional detail Monday morning.\n\nMonday’s warning comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a call-up of roughly 300,000 military reservists and issued a veiled threat of using nuclear weapons as Russia has lost ground in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine over the course of the last several weeks.\n\n“Many of the disruptive and destructive cyber attacks we have seen thus far have been disrupted, isolated, or largely limited to Ukraine, where there is intense focus,” said John Hultquist, the vice president of intelligence analysis at Mandiant. “With a few exceptions, we have not seen the scaled, serious attacks we expected even before the war began. There is still significant room for Russia to escalate, especially with regards to Ukraine’s allies. So far, Russian cyber attacks outside of Ukraine have been very restrained.”\n\nThat said, Hultquist added, “Russia is under enormous pressure and cyber attacks may give them a means to respond without risking serious military consequences.”\n\nMultiple European countries have dealt with DDoS attacks from what they’ve said are Russian or pro-Russian groups, including Norway, Romania, Italy and others.",
    "Heavy-Hitting American Tanks Are ‘On the Table’ for Ukraine": "Last week, a senior U.S. official stated that advanced tanks are “on the table” for Ukraine.\n\nThe statement is a major change of policy, buoyed by Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive in the east.\n\nTanks like the American M1 Abrams appear likely—as long as Ukrainian forces prove the ability to operate and maintain them.\n\nFor the first time, U.S. officials stated last week that advanced, Western-style tanks are “absolutely on the table” for Ukraine. The statement is a reversal of policy that meant mostly defensive weapons would be provided to the beleaguered Eastern European country, now in its seventh month warding off a Russian invasion. Modern tanks, like the American M1 Abrams, would allow Ukraine to take back most (if not all) of its territory lost to Russian forces.\n\nIn a discussion on September 19 with Pentagon reporters, a reporter for NPR mentioned that a Ukrainian delegation had visited Washington D.C. and pushed for the U.S. government to provide tanks to Ukraine. A senior defense official replied that the Biden Administration was constantly looking at what Ukraine needed at that particular moment, and also what it would need further down the road. “Tanks are absolutely on the table along with other areas,” the unnamed official said.\n\nU.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks at the Pomorskie training area, Poland, May 2015. JANEK SKARZYNSKI // Getty Images\n\nUnlike the tanks already delivered, the official clearly hinted he or she was referring to Western-style tanks. This is a whole new level of aid, one that could provide Ukraine with some of the most lethal tanks in the world. The Pentagon is only contemplating such an escalation in aid due to Kyiv’s successful counteroffensive into Kharkiv and Kherson, which have freed more than 3,000 square miles of formerly occupied territory.\n\nMore From Popular Mechanics\n\nNATO countries have heaped billions of dollars of aid onto Ukraine, including approximately 300 main battle tanks . These tanks, procured from Poland, the Czech Republic, North Macedonia, and Romania, are patterned on Soviet Cold War tanks, especially the T-72 series of main battle tanks. Ukrainian and Russian tanks are also patterned on the T-72 series, and to a lesser extent, the similar (but gas turbine-powered) T-80. This has allowed Ukrainian tankers and maintenance crews to quickly familiarize themselves with the donated tanks, pressing them into service faster.\n\nHow Western Tanks Could Upend the Battlefield\n\nA Ukrainian Army tank in eastern Ukraine, September 2022. Tanks like these are effective, but not as effective as modern NATO tanks, and are more hazardous to the crew in the event of a penetration. JUAN BARRETO // Getty Images\n\nThere are some problems with the tanks provided so far. For one, they are largely obsolete by modern standards, though some—like the Polish PT-91 Twardy and the Romanian-provided T-55S—have seen modest improvements in firepower, fire control, sensors, and mobility. Second, the shared engineering DNA means that NATO’s T-72s, like Russia’s frontline T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks, have the same engineering tradeoff that means a penetration of the turret tends to send it hurtling some distance, with catastrophic consequences for the crew.\n\nModern NATO-style tanks, which the Pentagon was clearly referring to, are decades more advanced than most tanks on the Ukrainian battlefield (the lone exception being a handful of Russian T-90M tanks.) NATO primarily fields the American M1A2 Abrams series of main battle tanks and German Leopard 2 tanks. These tanks include 120-millimeter main guns; advanced fire control and passive infrared night vision; and better engines, transmissions, and suspension systems. NATO tanks are faster, much more efficient killers than Ukraine’s existing tanks.\n\nAll of that capability comes at a cost though, and not all of that cost is financial. Western tanks are complex fighting machines, and although an American and a Russian tank are designed to do the same thing—provide decisive firepower and mobility on the battlefield— they are fundamentally different from the ground up. Despite the differences, the abrupt shift would well be worth it, because NATO tanks are decisively superior to Russian tanks, and their presence would be an earthquake on the Ukrainian battlefield.\n\nThe Trouble With Operating NATO Tanks\n\nThe German Leopard 2A7V is one of the two main types of NATO tanks. Although highly effective, the Leopard 2 would put Ukraine at the mercy of Germany, a country that has punched under its weight in this crisis. picture alliance // Getty Images\n\nUkrainian tankers and tank maintainers, though they may have mastered their T-64 and T-64BM tanks , would have to relearn most tasks. They would also have to learn how to operate and repair a whole new level of electronics, including central computer systems, infrared sensors, ballistic computers, and digital communications equipment. It would take months to retrain even seasoned Ukrainian tank units with American tanks.\n\nThere are also logistical considerations: NATO tanks use 120-millimeter tank ammunition and 7.62-millimeter machine gun ammunition, incompatible with current Ukrainian tank ammo. The American M1A2 Abrams tank also uses a gas turbine engine, which would require regular shipments of gasoline fuel to the front. Finally, a shift to NATO equipment would make Ukraine reliant on NATO for supplies, giving NATO a veto on Ukraine’s military actions. If NATO felt that Ukraine’s liberation of the Crimean peninsula, seized by Russia in 2014, was too provocative, it could threaten to withhold supplies. That said, shipments of howitzers, drones, rockets, missiles, and other equipment over the last seven months means that ship probably sailed a long time ago.\n\nThe Ukrainians have been here before, though. In June, the United States sent an initial shipment of four HIMARS rocket systems to Ukraine. The small consignment was both a response to an urgent request, but also a test to see if Ukraine would properly employ and maintain them. The Ukrainians used the first four rocket trucks to great effect, prompting the Pentagon to send 12 more.\n\nWhich Western Tanks Could We See in Ukraine?\n\nMarine Corps M1A1 Abrams sit in defensive positions before conducting a mechanized assault during Steel Knight 2015, December 2014. The Marine Corps recently retired its entire fleet of 200 tanks. DVIDS\n\nOf the two main NATO types, the Leopard 2 appears out of the running. Germany’s ruling coalition has refused to provide modern, Western tanks, and even if another country decided to donate theirs, the Ukrainians would still be reliant on Germany for ammunition and spare parts. The United States would likely send the M1 Abrams tank. One option is to send older tanks, particularly the 200 M1A1 Abrams tanks recently retired by the U.S. Marine Corps . Another is to send more modern M1A2 tanks currently equipping U.S. Army and Army National Guard units. While this would leave American tankers sitting on their hands until replacements arrive, the argument is that the war is in Ukraine, and the tankers won’t have to fight Russian forces if the Ukrainians destroy them first.\n\nThe decision to send tanks to Ukraine is a major shift in NATO strategy and could open the alliance up to providing more advanced Western equipment, including fighter jets, infantry fighting vehicles, and more. It could also force Russia, which has suffered heavily from the deployment of just a handful of rocket launchers, to the negotiating table. The success of Ukraine’s September offensive strongly suggests that a Ukrainian Army properly outfitted with modern NATO equipment would completely rout the Russian Army. For Russia, the choices could be leaving Ukraine of its own accord ... or facing annihilation.",

    "Orthodox Church leader says Russian soldiers dying in Ukraine will be cleansed of sin": "Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia conducts the Orthodox Christmas service at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, Russia, January 6, 2022. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nSept 26 (Reuters) - The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said that Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will be cleansed of all their sins, days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's first mobilisation since World War Two.\n\nPatriarch Kirill is a key Putin ally and backer of the invasion. He has previously criticised those who oppose the war and called on Russians to rally round the Kremlin.\n\n\"Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,\" Kirill, 75, said in his first Sunday address since the mobilisation order. \"The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.\"\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"But at the same time, the Church realises that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath ... goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice.

    "Zelenskyy ‘shocked’ by Israel’s failure to give Ukraine weapons": "Kyiv has been asking for air defence systems and other arms from Israel since shortly after the war started in February.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is “in shock” at Israel’s failure to give Kyiv anti-missile systems to help counter Russian attacks.\n\nThe president has been asking for the weapons since shortly after the war started in February. Zelenskyy mentioned Israel’s Iron Dome system, often used to intercept rockets fired by Palestinian fighters in Gaza.\n\n“I don’t know what happened to Israel. I’m honestly, frankly – I am in shock because I don’t understand why they couldn’t give us air defences,” he said.\n\nZelenskyy’s comments were stronger than those he made in March when he chided Israel for its reluctance to send weapons. At the time, Israel was non-committal, saying it would help Ukraine as much as it could.\n\nZelenskyy made the latest remarks in an interview with French reporters on Wednesday and his office released a recording on Saturday.\n\n‘Stating the facts’\n\nIsrael, which has condemned the Russian invasion, is wary of straining ties with Moscow, a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria where Israeli forces frequently launch attacks on what they say are pro-Iranian fighters.\n\nIn the same light, Israel sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and expressed support for its people, but the government did not join international sanctions against Russia.\n\nRussia in the past accused Israel of supporting “neo-Nazis” in Ukraine.\n\n“I understand – they have a difficult situation, regarding the situation with Syria and Russia,” Zelenskyy said, adding he was not making accusations.\n\n“I am stating the facts. My conversations with the Israeli leadership have done nothing to help Ukraine.”\n\nIn a phone call with Zelenskyy on September 1, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said he and his counterpart “talked about the fighting situation in Ukraine”, and he expressed his “condolences for the dead and injured in the war”.\n\nLapid said he has called for “a diplomatic solution to end the fighting” in Ukraine."
