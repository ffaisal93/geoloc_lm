    "Rain on the range – Getting muddy with NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania": "Earlier this year, Allies agreed to enhance NATO’s presence in the east of the Alliance by establishing four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia (in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which have been in place since 2017). Now, Allied troops are training together in these new battlegroups, demonstrating their ability and commitment to working together – come rain or come shine.\n\nFrench soldiers observe a live-fire exercise at the new NATO multinational battlegroup in Romania, where they are working alongside their Polish and Romanian counterparts.\n\nFor a soldier, rain is a fact of life.\n\nIt streams from the brim of your Kevlar helmet. It plasters your cold, wet combat uniform to your skin. And it turns the Romanian soil of Cincu Training Area into cake-batter mud that gloms onto your boots and adds a kilogram to every step.\n\nBut for these French soldiers assembled for a live-fire exercise, the rain seemed like an afterthought. They stood outside their armoured personnel carriers, which were parked in a line beside Polish and Romanian infantry fighting vehicles, waiting for the order to move out. Perhaps they’d simply grown used to the weather after several months of being deployed to Romania as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\nThe call came down the line: “Allons-y.” Let’s go. The French, Polish and Romanian soldiers grabbed their rifles and ducked into the cramped confines of their vehicles for the short ride to the gunnery range.\n\nFrench soldiers get into position under cloudy grey skies during a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nThe French Army – which in 2022 is serving as the lead nation of the highest-readiness element of the NATO Response Force – deployed troops to Romania following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, alongside a contingent of Belgian soldiers. In May, the French and Belgians formally stood up NATO’s first multinational battlegroup in Romania, with a contingent of Dutch soldiers due to arrive in the coming months.\n\nThe battlegroup is backed up by rotational deployments of US and Polish mechanised infantry elements – including troops from the US Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, forward deployed from Vilseck, Germany, and the Polish Army’s 17th Mechanised Brigade. While not under direct NATO command, these units greatly enhance the Alliance’s defensive posture while giving their troops invaluable time to cross-train with their Allies.\n\nPolish soldiers hold positions following a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nAs the French, Polish and Romanian armoured vehicles raced towards the firing line underneath dark, woolly clouds, it was hard to shake the sense that this felt different from your standard exercise – the gloomy sky matched the mood of the continent, where Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered peace and created the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nThe vehicles came to a halt and opened fire at simulated targets downrange, the .50-calibre machine gun mounted on the French armoured personnel carrier chattering against the deeper chug-chug-chug of the 30-millimeter autocannons mounted on the Polish and Romanian vehicles. After laying down a blanket of suppressing fire, the hatches opened and the soldiers spilled out, sprinting towards their firing positions.\n\nFor a few minutes, every rifle on the firing line was sending rounds downrange, soldiers pausing only to change magazines. Combined with sustained cannon fire from the infantry fighting vehicles, the volume of firepower was deafening. When it was over, the only sound was the voices of French, Polish and Romanian platoon leaders confirming over the radios that they’d spent all their ammunition. The soldiers mounted up and headed back to camp on the groan of diesel engines.\n\nA soldier with the French Army’s 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment crawls under a barbed wire obstacle in Cincu, Romania. Troops go through a wide variety of physical tests and training in NATO multinational battlegroups, in addition to live-fire exercises.\n\nAlong with the other new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania is a tangible manifestation of how European security has changed since February. While Allied soldiers routinely deployed to Romania in the past for training exercises, their permanent presence comes with a palpable sense of gravity.\n\n“In the first week of the deployment, we felt that it was a very important historical moment,” said Lieutenant Colonel Adrien, deputy commander of the battlegroup. He had deployed with the first French forces activated as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\n“We also felt the responsibility that we had as leaders of this spearhead battalion,” he explained, “the responsibility that we have to demonstrate our capabilities to be ready, totally, with our Allies to fulfil the mission that we have been given.”\n\nNATO troops from across the Alliance have continued to arrive at all four new battlegroups over the past several months, as they carry out the process of being set up and integrated into NATO’s military command structure. No matter where they’re from or where they’re deployed, these soldiers will stand side-by-side with their Allies and live, work and train in the toughest conditions – whether there are blue skies or grey skies ahead.",

    "Romania's abortion ban was deadly for women and is a warning for U.S.": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nCourtesy of the Supreme Court, an increasing number of American states — most recently West Virginia — are now in the company of the extreme antiabortion regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, from which Romanians were liberated when the communist dictator and his wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25, 1989. The provisional government swiftly moved to legalize abortion to the great relief of the population. A Christian Science Monitor headline proclaimed: “Freedom Triumphs and Romania Goes Pro-Choice: Romania’s Pre-revolution Abortion Laws Should Serve as Warning to the U.S.”\n\nRomania’s experience warns us about what happens when abortion is banned: When women cannot control their fertility, their physical and emotional well-being suffers, often with fatal consequences. Surveilling women’s reproductive lives contributes to the creation of a culture of fear that erodes not only social relationships and sexual intimacy but also the broader society itself.\n\nSoon after Ceausescu came to power in 1965, he embarked upon his own version of socialist nationalism, invoking the right to self-determination of the nation. This rationale kept Romania from joining the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and made him a hero — at least temporarily — at home and in the West. But national self-determination turned out not to include women’s self-determination to control their reproductive lives. Without warning, on Oct. 1, 1966, Ceausescu’s government issued Decree 770, banning abortion in almost all cases. This was a stark departure from a 1957 law that had liberalized abortion in Romania, something that happened across the Soviet satellite countries after Stalin’s death in 1953.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe criminalization of abortion became the centerpiece of a group of laws and policies aimed at increasing the future workforce, to counter the popular trend of families reducing the number of children they had. Increasing the birthrate was part of the socialist production plan; to that end, “ensuring women’s health” — a popular slogan — legitimated ever greater control over women’s bodies. Contraceptives were only obtainable on the black market. Contrary to the present-day United States, where women in states with the most restrictive abortion laws are least likely to have access to services for birthing and rearing children, the Romanian state — in keeping with its pronatalist goals — also provided at least minimal pre- and postnatal maternal and infant care and support for families after birth.\n\nThe 1966 surprise decree caught the population off guard and Romania’s birthrate almost doubled in the first year as doctors and women had no time to adapt, and providers had not yet created the kind of underground access women suddenly needed. But by 1968, they had, and the birthrate began declining. The government responded by modifying the law, but the same pattern ensued. This dynamic continued until the regime’s end, with the laws becoming ever more restrictive and women taking ever greater risks to access illegal abortions.\n\nRomania nevertheless allowed exceptions to the abortion ban for rape and incest, endangerment to the mother’s life and, in limited instances, to protect the health of mothers and children. But prosecutors had to authorize the procedure to ensure that doctors followed the law in determining if conditions for a legal abortion existed. By the 1980s, a secret police officer was typically present during an abortion when it was permitted, demonstrating the extent of state control over women’s bodies and lives. Women who were hospitalized for complications from an illegal abortion were often left to die on the operating table if they refused to incriminate themselves or anyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen who had unauthorized abortions and anyone who performed or helped procure one were often apprehended or incarcerated. The state also held doctors accountable for not meeting targets to increase births and lower infant mortality. As part of “ensuring women’s health” in the 1980s, the most repressive years of the regime, doctors were tasked with conducting compulsory gynecological exams, some 30-60 a day, at factories where women worked. Women I interviewed said they felt terrorized by the state’s intrusiveness and even by their own bodies, having come to view their reproductive capacity as the “enemy within.” A joke that circulated widely referenced the fear women felt: “Why does a Romanian hen sing every time she lays an egg? Because she is overjoyed that she is not pregnant!’\n\nThe ever-present Romanian secret police attempted to recruit as informers those suspected of having had or assisted in an abortion. They manipulated and intimidated family members, friends and others. Romanians never knew who might inform on them. Social interactions were dominated by fear.\n\nThese draconian measures did not stop the birthrate’s decline, nor did banning abortion prevent its practice. Women who needed an abortion did whatever they could to obtain one. In Romania, as in the United States, most women wanting an abortion were already mothers and an unsafe abortion risked leaving children motherless. By 1989, Ceausescu’s brutal antiabortion policies had tragically elevated Romania’s maternal mortality rate to the highest in Europe: 87 percent of maternal deaths were attributed to complications from illegal abortion. (For perspective, in 1965, the last year abortion was legal, 20 percent of maternal deaths were due to abortion complications.) Almost 10,000 women died over the 23 years in which abortion was criminalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these rates weren’t surprising. Coercive abortion bans teach a steadfast lesson: women die, especially those unable to pay for a “safe,” if illegal, abortion. Data from around the world consistently shows that when abortion is illegal, maternal mortality due to complications from unsafe practices increases.\n\nUnlike in other Eastern Bloc countries, the end of the communist era in Romania was violent, including the execution by firing squad of the Ceausescus following a summary military trial. The day after the dictator’s demise, women’s bodies were liberated from the centralized grip of the state.\n\nThe legalization of abortion had an immediate effect on the number of legal abortions recorded and the number of abortion-related maternal deaths: in 1990, abortions outnumbered live births three to one. By summer 1990, the main hospitals in the capital reported 70-100 abortions daily. In one year, maternal mortality due to abortion complications declined 10 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chaos of everyday life as Romania tried to create a market economy and democratic rule saw rapid class differentiation and a steadily declining birthrate, in part exacerbated by emigration. Abortion remains a popular means of fertility control in the country, although the Orthodox Church and conservative forces continue to pursue the recriminalization of abortion.\n\nGiven the proliferation of near-total abortion bans in numerous states in the U.S., many of the appalling experiences of Romanian women, doctors and health care providers will probably happen here. Maternal mortality due to pregnancy complications, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates is already three times higher for Black women than White women, will rise. Considering racial discrimination in access to pre- and postnatal health care, this disparity will increase in the absence of legal abortion.\n\nMany states with near-total bans also deny rape and incest exceptions, a burden even the Ceausescu regime did not inflict. Some antiabortion advocates are even seeking prohibitions of contraceptives, Plan B pills and medication abortions. States have moved to criminalize abortion providers, and sometimes women, and to make doctors liable for prescribing abortion pills or for performing an abortion for a woman from a state where it is illegal. Yet, as history repeatedly illustrates, abortion prohibitions are never fully enforceable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the most pernicious effects of the Dobbs decision is what it portends for the future of democracy in America. As in Ceausescu’s Romania, enforcement depends on surveillance. Today’s technological means far exceed anything available during Ceausescu’s rule. Menstrual trackers and web searches about obtaining an abortion leave digital traces that put women at risk. In the Texas (Senate Bill 8) and Oklahoma (Senate Bill 1503) abortion acts, individuals are offered monetary incentives to inform on anyone they suspect of having had or having facilitated an abortion.\n\nRomania teaches us that when individuals inform on each other, fear and distrust come to govern social interactions. When that happens, our already tattered social fabric will shred. Furthermore, when women lack the freedom to control their reproductive lives, they cannot participate in society as full and equal members nor be thriving partners and mothers to the next generation.\n\nThe Supreme Court has fanned the flames of radical societal transformation that threatens democracy. The U.S. ignores lessons from Romania at its peril.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Romania is second-largest digital commerce market in CEE, McKinsey says": "Romania’s digital commerce market stood at EUR 9.8 bln in 2021, making it the second largest market in CEE, after Poland (EUR 26.7 bln) but before Czechia (EUR 9.1 bln). The achievement takes place in a wider context of digital development in Europe and within Romania itself, according to a new McKinsey & Company report titled “Digital Challengers on the Next Frontier.”\n\nThe report analyzes the opportunities presented by the digital economy in ten economies of Central and Eastern Europe, small and medium-sized countries with strong potential for fast digitization. The three main components of the digital economy considered in the report are: digital commerce (online retail spending on goods & services), ICT (the value of spending of governments and companies across all sectors on hardware, software, infrastructure, and related services) and offline spend on digital equipment (PC, smartphones, IT infrastructure, Cloud, etc.).\n\nThe region’s digital economy totaled an estimated EUR 124 bln in 2021, with digital commerce representing around EUR 68 bln of the sum. The ten CEE countries, Romania among them, could reach a digital economy worth EUR 330 bln by 2030, with digital commerce being the main driver of growth.\n\nRomania’s own digital economy was estimated at EUR 14.8 bln in 2021, or 6% of GDP, in the same report. The value is shared between digital commerce (EUR 9.8 bln), expenditures on ICT (EUR 3.5 bln), and offline spending on digital products like PCs or smartphones (EUR 1.6 bln). McKinsey analysts reckon that the sector could be worth EUR 52 bln (9.6% of GDP) by 2030.\n\nICT showed promise in Romania, growing at around 8% annually between 2017 and 2021. However, investments in this sector are still low when compared to countries such as Poland or Czechia. As Romania’s ICT infrastructure develops, it may become an important driver of growth.\n\nDigital commerce, however, is the clear driver of Romania’s digital economy, representing 66% of it. The segment grew by 17% annually, almost doubling in value between 2017 and 2021. The share of SMEs selling online more than doubled as well, from 7% to 17% in the same period. The spectacular growth transformed Romania into the second largest digital commerce market in the CEE, not to mention the third-largest digital economy.\n\nThere is, however, still room to grow. The average expenditure on digital commerce per capita and the digital commerce penetration rate in Romania are some of the lowest in the region. Romania’s digital commerce per capita was around EUR 506 in 2021, lower than the ones in Czechia (EUR 849), Slovenia (EUR 866), or Lithuania (EUR 1,064). Digital represents just 14% of the total retail segment in Romania, the rest being offline commerce. With 14% penetration, Romania has one of the lowest rates of digital commerce relative to total retail in the CEE.\n\nThe use of innovations delivering ultra-convenience (payments, omnichannel, fast delivery and returns, and data-driven individualization) could help Romania double its digital commerce market size.\n\nThe report shows that the most significant categories for digital commerce in Romania are home goods and electronics (39% share of digital commerce), transportation services (31%), and apparel (14%). However, during the pandemic years, the fastest category growth was seen in groceries, which grew from EUR 123 mln (2% share of digital commerce) in 2019 to EUR 389 mln in 2021 (4% share of digital commerce).\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Nitsuki | Dreamstime.com)",

    "Customer experience in Romania": "For two consecutive years, the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) across six core Romanian industries are within a 10 percent range of each other, showing a lack of distinctive leaders; more than 90 percent of companies have a customer satisfaction score between 8 and 9, similar with last year.\n\nThis limited improvement could be explained by a mix of a lack of focus on improving customer experience along with a lack of speed and agility in adapting products and services, as no player managed to significantly improve its position within one year. The banking and retail industries were rated best this year, with a CSAT score of 8.8, while utilities landed last at 7.7.\n\nOverall, Romanian consumers don’t perceive any one company as standing out from the crowd regarding customer experience, but in 2022 emerging leaders and laggards are apparent, particularly in utilities, healthcare, and banking.\n\nSidebar LinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail Survey methodology The McKinsey Customer Experience Romania Survey is an annual survey that checks the pulse of the Romanian market, tracking the evolution of customer experience and delivering actionable insights for local companies. Launched in 2021 for the first time, the survey looks at the experience of Romanian customers across six industries: grocery retail, telecommunications, utilities, banking, insurance, and healthcare. This year, approximately 3,000 respondents were asked to rate their Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) on a scale from one to ten for each of the companies they use in the different industries.\n\nThis article, based on the most recent McKinsey Customer Experience in Romania (see sidebar, “Survey methodology”), as well as the 2021 edition of the survey, seeks to understand the customer-experience landscape of Romanian companies in six major industries. This new piece of research highlights significant opportunities for companies that aspire to differentiate themselves on the Romanian market and offers good case practices on how to begin to stand out from the crowd.\n\nLast year’s insights confirmed in 2022\n\nBetter customer experience leads to increased customer spend and higher market shares\n\nCustomer experience can be understood as the full delivery of a company’s brand promise via its products, price, service, and communication. Superior customer experience enables deep customer trust and loyalty, while also having a positive impact on costs (for example, a 20–50 percent decrease in service costs by lowering the volume of complaints), revenues (a 15–20 percent increase in sales conversion) and customer satisfaction (a 10–20 percent increase). Superior customer experience has also been shown to help companies deal with past financial crises: customer-experience champions suffer less and recover faster than customer-experience underperformers do.\n\nThe McKinsey survey of Romanian consumers confirms for two consecutive years many of these previous findings. It identifies a clear link between customer experience and willingness to spend: for a customer satisfaction score higher than 87, every point increase in CSAT score is likely to drive an additional 32–34 percentage points of increased spending. It also shows that market share and customer experience are closely correlated, with top-quartile companies by market share also displaying the highest CSAT scores (Exhibit 1). Clearly, an opportunity exists for Romanian companies to differentiate themselves from their peers through the customer experience they offer, and making improvements in this area should be a top priority for Romanian business leaders.\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nThoughtful digitization is key to achieving higher CSAT scores\n\nThis year’s survey confirmed that, with the notable exception of banks, higher levels of digital engagement haven’t resulted in improved customer experience in Romania. For instance, interactions with customers in retail are still predominantly nondigital, yet the industry has a high CSAT score (8.8), whereas the reverse is true for utilities (7.7). This trend is likely driven by rudimentary and noncustomer-centric digitization, in which cumbersome, mandatory digital interactions are more likely to decrease than to increase customer satisfaction. This finding also highlights the importance of a thoughtful, integrated approach to digitizing customer experience, such as a consistent omnichannel approach.\n\nThis recommendation is particularly relevant as the survey identified distinct preferences among Romanian consumers, such as the ability to switch smoothly between different channels (online versus in person) depending on the customer journey. Thus, in-person interactions are preferred for resolving issues, whereas online is preferred for everyday use. Preferences also differ by customer age group: younger consumers are less satisfied on average than older ones, with the largest gaps in insurance (a CSAT score of 8.1 versus 8.6) and utilities (7.8 versus 8.3). This may also be an area in which companies would wish to make targeted improvements in their offerings or services.\n\nTailoring customer experiences to reflect their preferences regarding interaction type and preferred channels should move up on the agenda of Romanian companies. Progress could be achieved, for instance, by improving customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities and developing microcampaigns tailored to different customer groups. An earlier McKinsey study found that when a one-size-fits-all sales approach is replaced by offers tailored to individual customer profiles, it can generate a revenue increase of up to 30 percent or more.\n\nHigher customer satisfaction levels can be achieved by increasing customer trust in the brand, derived from choice, fairness, and product performance\n\nThe survey analyzed the contribution of four different customer experience drivers—brand, price, customer service, and product. Brand emerged as the most important contributor in all industries except for banking (in which product and price are more important).\n\nFor each of the four drivers, their contributing elements were ranked by their importance to customers. Romanian companies may wish to develop targeted actions that address each of these high-impact elements specifically for their industry. For instance, to improve product, banks could work on ensuring that their products meet all customer needs, while insurance companies could ensure their products are perceived as secure and reliable.\n\nFor banks, that might translate into spending more time with customers trying to understand whether their products really meet their needs; insurance companies might want to highlight the extent and benefits of their coverage in their communication with consumers.\n\nSimilarly, to improve customer service, healthcare, and utilities companies could invest in helping customers get support and resolve seamlessly their issues, while telecommunications companies could ensure that services for everyday use (such as checking balances) are in line with customer expectations. This might involve mapping out each customer journey step-by-step and testing new features with customers.\n\nWhat’s new in 2022?\n\nA focus (or lack thereof) on customer experience leads to the emergence of potential leaders/laggards\n\nThe 2022 survey showed that despite the relatively flat Romanian landscape, banks have managed to have the highest growth in customer satisfaction scores, and they have become the leading industry in Romania in terms of CSAT, dethroning last year’s leading industry, retail, which has remained flat.\n\nThe 2022 survey showed that despite the relatively flat Romanian landscape, banks have managed to have the highest growth in customer satisfaction scores.\n\nMoreover, within banking and utilities, certain players have grown their CSAT scores by almost one percentage point compared with 2021. In these industries, as well as telecom, we see the industry leader getting detached from the rest of the market players, suggesting a potential emergence of industry leaders as well as a clear nomination of the industry laggards, which are slow to invest and improve their customer experience (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nRomanian consumers feel that companies don’t act in their interest\n\nThe 2022 survey also analyzed how Romanian consumers feel about companies acting in their interest for the past three years. Consumers perceive that Romanian companies don’t act in their interest, with the highest percentage of consumers naming insurance and utilities (64 percent for each) as the industries that never act in their customers’ interests (Exhibit 3). At the other end, healthcare is perceived as the industry that is most willing to act in their customers’ interest (44 percent of respondents).\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nCompanies across sectors can improve the perceived level of commitment toward customers’ interests by focusing on seamless resolutions of customer complaints, simplifying customer claims processes, and improving staff goodwill.\n\nPrice is the main factor that would trigger customers to change their provider\n\nIn 2022, price has been nominated as the main factor to trigger a change of providers, followed by a better product and customer service. The weight of price in switching providers is higher in utilities, insurance, and retail, and the lowest in banking. This can be explained by the ease of changing providers in industries such as retail, with low opportunity costs.\n\nThe cyclicity of choosing a provider in insurance, as well as the new regulations in the Romanian energy market for utilities, gave Romanian consumers the opportunity to make price comparisons and switch providers. Moreover, in utilities and insurance, prices increased significantly in 2021 due to a supply-driven global energy crisis in utilities and due to the bankruptcy of City Insurance (the biggest player in the market for RCA, third-party liability auto insurance), which historically was the cheapest player in the market. Such significant price increases made consumers even more sensitive to this factor.\n\nAnother reason for the price being the main factor for switching providers is the fact that price is the most visible driver of customer satisfaction to consumers. Customer awareness of superior product performance and customer service is lower, and thus presents an opportunity to be capitalized on, to allow companies to achieve price differentiation in the future.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Romanian economy is expected to undergo significant changes in the coming years, with the industries studied in the survey at the forefront of this transformation. Moreover, the macroeconomic environment is putting additional pressure on disposable income, making Romanian consumers savvier and more cautious with how they spend their money, increasing willingness to shop around before making a buying decision.\n\nBanks and insurance companies would be well advised to focus, among other things, on improving customer loyalty and increasing the adoption of financial products. Telecommunications companies could look at how to best use new technology, such as 5G, to serve emerging or unmet customer needs. Retailers can respond to the growth of digital channels, while utilities will want to address the recent market liberalization, and healthcare providers may want to address the growing needs of an aging population and the limitations of the public system.\n\nAcross these industries, customer experience will be a crucial and much needed axis for growth—and an area where clear leaders have yet to emerge. The pursuit of better customer experience should have a positive impact not only on individual companies’ commercial success but also on the overall well-being and living standards of Romanian consumers.\n\nWhile some companies have improved the experience offered to their customers, there is no clear leader emerging in the six industries that were analyzed on the Romanian market. Improving in this area should be high priority for any company, as better customer experience leads to increased customer spend and higher market shares. Romanian companies can start by thoughtfully digitizing their products and services to achieve higher CSAT scores. Although in most industries customers are interacting with companies more and more via digital channels, there is limited to no improvement in customer satisfaction, showing a rudimentary or noncustomer-focused digitization. Furthermore, higher customer satisfaction levels can be achieved by increasing customer trust in the brand, derived from choice, fairness, and product performance.",

    "IAEA Team in Romania Concludes First Ever Site and External Events Design (SEED) Review for a Small Modular Reactor": "An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts has concluded a safety review of Romania’s process for selecting the site of the country’s planned Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which could become the first SMR built in Europe.\n\nIn May, the Romanian Government, through state company Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN), announced that it had chosen Doicești, approximately 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest, as the preferred site for the SMR, following an in-depth study conducted with a United States Trade and Development Agency grant. Romania requested the IAEA to conduct a Site and External Events Design (SEED) review mission to assess the process that was followed in choosing the preferred site. The SEED mission — which took place from 22 to 24 August — was the first ever IAEA SEED mission to look into site selection for an SMR.\n\nSEED missions assist IAEA Member States at different stages in the development of a nuclear power programme, including by reviewing site selection, site assessment and design of structures, systems and components, taking into consideration site specific external and internal hazards.\n\nThe three-day mission was conducted at the request of SNN. Romania currently has one operating nuclear power plant (NPP) in Cernavodă, which generates around 18% of the country’s electricity. The country is considering expanding and modernizing its nuclear power programme through the deployment of SMRs at suitable sites, in addition to other actions on the existing large plant site.\n\nSMRs have the potential to contribute to global access to reliable nuclear power. They are a fraction of the size of large reactors — about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors — and have lower upfront capital costs, shorter construction times (owing to prefabrication) and pose fewer risks to the population in case of an accident.\n\nThe IAEA’s review assessed how Romania conducted the process for the site selection of the SMR against IAEA safety standards, taking into account potential impacts to a site from external events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods, and potential impacts to the population from low probability accidents at the site.\n\n“This comprehensive review will provide assurances to the Romanian public and beyond about the SMR site selection,” said Paolo Contri, Team Leader for the review and Head of the External Events Safety Section in the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. “The recommendations made will help Romania to prepare for the construction of the SMR, by making sure that potential issues associated with site safety are carefully considered early in the process and that alternative sites are available in the event that the selected site does not meet the requirements on the basis of the detailed site characterization. It is important that potential external hazards are identified early to allow for adequate consideration and assessment of protective measures that may be necessary for the defence in depth approach.”\n\nThe mission team comprised three experts from Germany, Türkiye and the United Kingdom. They met with senior staff from SNN at its premises in Bucharest.\n\nThe team welcomed the effort spent by SNN to conduct an objective, feasible and safety oriented site selection process in Romania. Romania documented the site selection process in a preliminary SNN report, which will be followed by a preliminary Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The SEED mission said a limited amount of additional work is needed on sensitivity analysis and collection of confirmatory data for the FEED study, together with detailed recommendations on the minimization of project risks.\n\nThe team provided some recommendations to support the optimization of the site selection process and to minimize the risk that the following phases will identify important safety issues that may affect project implementation. In particular, the IAEA team recommended that:\n\nAll data be collected in a site selection summary report, according to the recommendations issued in IAEA Safety Guide SSG-35, to provide traceable support for later decisions and site evaluation phases.\n\nA suitable graded approach be applied for the specific technology selected for the SMR to be deployed, and in accordance with the potential radiological consequences of accidents, to meet overall safety objectives. Guidelines on the IAEA approach to grading were provided.\n\nA possible additional data collection phase for the selection process — through light investigation and monitoring — be implemented for the preferred site, as back-up solutions, focused on the most discriminating selection criteria.\n\nRomania informed the IAEA that further in-depth assessments of the Doicești site are to be conducted in the upcoming period and it is actively addressing the recommendations of the IAEA SEED mission to support this work.\n\n“We invited the IAEA SEED mission because it is a priority for us to build in Romania a state-of-the-art SMR project, in full compliance with the highest safety standards, as we have done in the 25 years we have operated the Cernavodă NPP,” said Cosmin Ghita, SNN CEO. “With the continued support of the IAEA, our experience in siting and building our first SMR can be used by other countries considering building SMRs. SNN is ready to share our experience on strategic and technical aspects of SMR deployment projects.”\n\nThe final mission report will be delivered to the Government of Romania within three months.",
    "EC wants energy reduction measures, Romania’s already lowest in Europe": "The average Romanian consumed 2.7 MWh in 2020, placing the country last in a ranking measuring energy consumption per capita in Europe.\n\nBy comparison, Ukraine’s average per capita energy consumption in the same year stood at 2.8 MWh, while Germans consumed 6.4 MWh per inhabitant in the same period. These values pale in comparison with the champions of per capita energy use in Europe, namely Norway (23.3 MWh) and Iceland (51 MWh), both outside the EU.\n\nOther figures serve to further contextualize Romania’s energy climate. The country’s energy consumption dropped by 19.48% since 1990, and its CO2 emissions by 58.33% in the same period, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n“95% of Romania’s energy consumption in the ‘90s was industrial, households accounting for the rest,” energy and infrastructure analyst Otilia Nuţu told ZF. Energy consumption is especially low in the countryside, the least developed areas in Romania, she says.\n\nLast week, the European Commission unveiled a series of “exceptional electricity demand reduction measures” meant to reduce the cost of electricity throughout the winter. The Commission hopes to tackle high energy prices brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\n\nOne of the measures will have states reduce electricity consumption by at least 5% during selected peak price hours. Member states will also have to reduce overall electricity demand by at least 10% until March 31, 2023.\n\n“Our problem is that we don’t even have the data. We don’t know how energy is consumed in Romania. We have the same production method, with very large units, close to the old former industrial units, while our consumption has moved to the urban area,” Nuţu says.\n\nDespite massive deindustrialization, households only take up around 25% of the energy consumed in Romania, while the European average stands at 27%. Few devices using electricity have made their way to the country’s rural households, something which can translate into something akin to an advantage in the coming period.\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: prudencio_alvarez | dreamstime.com)",

    "Romania Photo of the Day by Dreamstime: Vinderel Lake": "The Romania Photo of the Day created in partnership with stock photo provider Dreamstime aims to highlight the best of Romania. From stunning landscapes and popular tourist destinations and landmarks to people, traditions, and food, this series helps you discover Romania one photo at a time. This week, we put the focus on Romanian mountain lakes.\n\nThe small glacial Lake Vinderel is located on the ridge connecting Farcău Peak and Mihăilecu Peak, at an altitude of 1615m on the territory of Repedea and Poienile de Sub Munte, in the Maramureș Mountains. (Photo source - click on the number to get to the photo 172655297 © Volodymyr Martyniuk | Dreamstime.com)\n\nThe geological, faunal, and landscape reserve covers an area of 150 hectares, which is part of the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, and aims to preserve the local biological diversity, says infopensiuni.ro. The reserve includes the Farcău and Mihăilecu peaks, Julii Cave, Bologhii Cave, Wolves’ Cave, and Vinderel Lake.\n\nThe lake is fed by snowmelt and rainwater, and by the small basins of swamp-like water located on its southern shore. The banks are grassy and slope gently down to the lake, says Bogatiile Muntilor Maramures, with some juniper thickets to the east. Other species of plants found on the edge of the lake are Edelweiss, Peat Mosses, Cottongrass, and Hawkweed.\n\nVinderel Lake has given rise to many legends, some of which describe it as a bottomless lake, others saying it is inhabited by a dragon that feeds on whoever might enter its water. One such tale, told by Stirileprotv.ro, says the dragon once ate all the guests at a wedding that was held by the lake’s side. It is also said that it is not good to throw a stone into this lake because you will start a storm.\n\nMaramureș Mountains Natural Park's website tells us of two different hiking trails that can be followed, if you want to visit Vinderel Lake:\n\nRepedea - Chicerea – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 10 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, difficult in winter.\n\nFrom the center of Repedea the marker follows the lane leading to the school. From the corner of the school, the marked path changes direction to the east, winding its way up through the small farms in the Poposală area. Enter the forest, leaving the ridge and Chicera Peak to the left. One then reaches the stable in Laba. From here the path climbs steeply, passing the Runea hut and leaving the Rugașul ridge on the right. Then you reach an area from where you can see the Farcău massif. The trail continues, crossing several torrential streams, and after approximately 1 hour, you reach Vinderel Lake.\n\nRepedea - Pietriceaua – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 12 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, winter difficult.\n\nFrom the center of the village, the marker follows the road along the Repedea valley, and after approx. 4 km you reach the Repedea Forest Canton. Continue on the road until the confluence with the Tomnatecu valley. From here you cross the Repedea valley, going up to the mountain hollow below Pietriceaua. You keep going north until you reach the lake.\n\nmaia@romania-insider.com"
