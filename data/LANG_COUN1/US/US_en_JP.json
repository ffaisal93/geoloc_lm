But a strong yen is also painful,\" Suzuki said.\n\nWhile government officials' jawboning may keep markets nervous of the prospects of further intervention, stepping in repeatedly in the currency market and selling huge sums of dollars could be difficult due to the criticism Japan may face from its G7 counterparts.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said last week it \"understood\" Japan's intervention was aimed at reducing volatility, but stopped short of endorsing the move. read more\n\n\"It's unlikely Japan will continue intervening to defend a certain line, such as 145 yen to the dollar,\" former top Japanese currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara told Reuters. read more\n\n($1 = 144.1800 yen)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto in Tokyo and Leika Kihara in Osaka; Additional reporting by Daiki Iga; Writing by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes, Shri Navaratnam and Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Though Lauded Abroad, Japan’s Abe Leaves Complicated Legacy at Home": "Hundreds of foreign dignitaries are expected to attend Tuesday’s state funeral for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a reflection of his broad popularity overseas. But Abe, who was assassinated in July, leaves a more divided legacy at home.\n\nAbe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, won respect, especially among right-leaning nationalists, for making his country stronger amid increasing threats from China and North Korea. He also brought relative stability, ending a six-year period during which Japan averaged a new prime minister every year.\n\nBut Abe’s conservative policies also angered many Japanese, who say he brought the country closer to war — something unimaginable for a country with a technically pacifist defense architecture. While his signature “Abenomics” strategy was ambitious, it ultimately failed to spark higher growth.\n\nAbe’s mixed legacy helps explain the public backlash against his state funeral. Polls show a large majority of Japanese oppose the idea of holding a state funeral, which is usually reserved for the emperor and his family. Many say the event will be too expensive. The government projects the funeral will cost $12 million, much higher than an earlier estimate.\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether he served a long time or not,” said Mario Ito, a Tokyo resident walking outside the central Shibuya train station on Sunday\n\n“Seventy percent of Japanese people are opposed to doing this — the fact they’re going ahead with it shows the government isn’t working properly,” he said.\n\n“I really admire his legacy,” said Ms. Sasaki, another Tokyo resident. “But I don’t think there’s a need to spend this much money to hold a huge state funeral,” said the woman who would only provide her last name.\n\nThough Abe’s rule was long-lasting, his popularity had declined by the time he left office, said Jeffrey J. Hall, a Japanese politics specialist at the Kanda University of International Studies.\n\n“As a prime minister, he was successful in winning elections with his party again and again. But those elections had quite a low turnout. So even though he was winning, elections didn’t mean that he was a very, very popular politician or loved by the people,” Hall said.\n\nPart of the current backlash to Abe has to do with the ruling party’s ties to the controversial, South Korea-based Unification Church. Abe’s suspected killer said the group took excessive donations from his mother, leaving her impoverished. He accused Abe of supporting the church.\n\nAbe’s party, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, earlier this month revealed that at least 179 of its lawmakers had connections to the Unification Church, which some of the church’s former members see as a cult.\n\n“You can’t really separate this funeral and Abe’s legacy from the Unification Church scandal, because as the party is revealed to have more and more ties to this church, most of these people were close associates of Abe, many of them within his own faction of the party,” said Hall.\n\nIt has created a tricky situation for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, an Abe protege. His approval rating has sunk to new lows. However, the fallout may be limited, since the party doesn’t face any major national elections until 2025.\n\nAbe’s state funeral will be held Tuesday at Tokyo’s Nippon Budokan Hall. Over 190 foreign delegations are expected to attend. It will serve as an occasion for world leaders to say goodbye to one of the 21st century’s most influential leaders.\n\nThe U.S. delegation is led by Vice President Kamala Harris. Asked about Japanese criticism of Abe’s funeral, a senior U.S. official said he is “not going to comment on any internal Japanese attitudes.”\n\n“All I can say from our point of view is that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend of the United States,” the U.S. official said. “He was a great leader for Japan.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said in a statement Monday upon Harris’ arrival in Tokyo that the U.S. delegation “demonstrates the respect President Joe Biden has for former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and his family, and sends a strong signal of our deep commitment to the Japanese people.",

    "Kyoto Wants You Back, but It Has Some Polite Suggestions": "At the beginning of the pandemic, “people in the city were saying, ‘We’ve returned to the old Kyoto, isn’t that great?’” said Toshinori Tsuchihashi, the director of the city’s tourism department.\n\nBut, as the economic damage mounted, residents “have come to recognize tourism’s importance.”\n\nMany businesses have yet to recover. Before the pandemic, it was nearly impossible to get a reservation at one of the many restaurants lining Pontocho, an atmospheric alleyway running parallel to the Kamo River in Kyoto’s city center. But on a recent weekend night, “for lease” signs hung in darkened shop windows, and many of the terraces looking out on the water sat unused.\n\nHotel The Mitsui Kyoto, a luxury Western-style hotel, opened in late 2020 and has operated well below capacity for most of the pandemic, according to Manabu Kusui, the general manager.\n\nAs tourists begin returning to Kyoto, the hotel hopes to differentiate itself by providing guests with exclusive experiences it has negotiated with some of Kyoto’s beautiful but less trafficked destinations. One of the first is a private tour of Nijo Castle, the residence of Japan’s first shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, conveniently located next to the hotel.\n\nIt’s a style of tourism the city is trying to promote as part of its new strategic plan to address prepandemic crowding.\n\nBut Mr. Kusui knows that people come to Kyoto with a certain itinerary in mind, and “we can’t tell them not to go to some place like Kiyomizu Temple,” he said, referring to the famous Buddhist temple perched on a mountain face on Kyoto’s east side.",
    "As world gathers to honor Abe, Japan grapples with church’s influence": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nTOKYO — For nearly two decades, public discussion of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s ties with the Unification Church was taboo in Japan. Now, the organization’s decades-long influence in Japanese politics is at the forefront of a political outcry. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The turning point: The July 8 assassination of Shinzo Abe.\n\nDignitaries are gathering in Tokyo this week to commemorate Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. But the event has put a spotlight on the scandal ensnaring the ruling party over its links with the church and use of taxpayer money for the state funeral of a leader who was popular abroad but divisive at home.\n\nThe church has faced scrutiny after Tetsuya Yamagami, the suspected gunman, told police he wanted to carry out the assassination because his life and family had been ruined as a result of his mother’s large donations to a religious group to which Abe had apparent close ties. The Unification Church confirmed that Yamagami’s mother is a longtime member and that it had received donations from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther families emerged to say that their lives were similarly upended because of donations made by their relatives, some of whom have ongoing legal battles with the Unification Church. The accounts highlighted a controversial practice known as “spiritual sales,” in which goods or services that supposedly possess supernatural powers were sold to members at often exorbitant prices.\n\n“When I first heard that Abe’s death was related to a certain religious organization, I knew right away, that … something huge was going to unfold,” said Eito Suzuki, a journalist who has been tracking the church’s activities since 2002. “There is no other cult aside from the Unification Church which extends so deeply and widely within Japanese politics, reaching the ruling party, opposition parties, and beyond.”\n\nChurch officials said in a news conference last week that they are unaware of spiritual sales made after 2009, when the group signed a legal agreement after facing criminal charges over the practice. The church has addressed anger over its links with the ruling party by saying that on various issues its stance tends to align with the LDP membership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has apologized for his party’s cozy relationship with the church and vowed to sever relations. He reshuffled his cabinet, removing leaders with the strongest links to the group, and surveyed members to identify their relationships with the organization.\n\nBut Kishida’s approval ratings have plummeted, especially after it emerged that several members of his new cabinet had ties to the church. Last week, Kishida said he would not call for an investigation into Abe’s ties with the church.\n\nThe public — and even some members of the LDP — are increasingly skeptical of the party’s ability to divorce itself. Even after the party released the names of officials who reported links to the church and its affiliates, another top LDP official acknowledged ties. The internal review has drawn further criticism from those demanding an independent investigation.\n\nIn light of the controversy, there has been a backlash against the government’s decision to host a state funeral for Abe — the first in 55 years and only the second in the postwar era. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to oppose the move, and thousands have protested in front of the Diet, Japan’s national assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan is not a particularly religious country, but the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the official name of the Unification Church, controls dozens of ministries in Japan.\n\nThe church’s roots in Japan date to 1968, when it founded a political organization, the International Federation for Victory over Communism, with the support of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s grandfather, who had befriended the group’s founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.\n\nThe group became a reliable partner for the LDP in rallying against communism and left-wing protests through the 1960s. In the 1980s, conservative politicians began receiving endorsements, donations and grass roots support from the group, Suzuki said.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the group aligned with right-wing politicians over social issues, opposing the introduction of gender equality policies and sex education, according to its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Abe rose to power in the LDP and eventually became prime minister, the church’s members became a conservative voting bloc and mobilizing force, Suzuki said — an important source of support in a country that prohibits individual donations to political candidates.\n\n“We do not have a stance of asking members to support any specific party or one particular party,” Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the Japanese office of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, said at an August news conference. “Our fundamental stance is a stance in opposition to communism, so from that perspective there may be more points of encounter with members of the LDP.”\n\nOver those decades, Japan became the key profit center for the Unification Church and its offshoots, largely through door-to-door “spiritual sales” that often targeted grieving elderly people, according to several academic studies, government investigators and historians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese items included jars and miniature stone pagodas, which believers were told would absolve the sins of their ancestors for their occupation of South Korea, according to academic research. The group’s membership in Japan surpasses that of South Korea, where the organization was founded.\n\nThe Japanese government has set up a consumer affairs agency to investigate the proliferation of spiritual sales. It received more than 1,000 calls in the first five days.\n\nMainstream media at times covered church members’ political support for the LDP but in the mid-2000s, it gradually became a social taboo to discuss the topic openly, Suzuki said. In earlier times, media outlets had faced a torrent of calls after critical coverage of the issue, he said.\n\n“After Abe’s death, hearing the words ‘cult’ and ‘Unification Church’ so prevalently now in major media outlets for the past two months still feels unreal and shocking even for me, especially because those words had been taboo for so many years,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2021, Abe made his most public appearance at an event hosted by the church through a video message, alongside other prominent politicians who recorded messages.\n\nThat video message may have provoked the suspected gunman, according to police sources quoted in Japanese media. Yamagami’s uncle told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper that Yamagami had attempted suicide because of his family’s financial difficulties, and that the suspect’s mother was traumatized after her husband killed himself.\n\nYamagami is now detained and undergoing psychiatric evaluations until November, when prosecutors will decide whether to press formal murder charges.\n\nNobuya Fukumoto, a lawyer for the Unification Church, said in a news conference last week that the donations from Yamagami’s mother exceeded $704,000, including funds from a life insurance policy and real estate sales. The lawyer said he believed she made an “excessive donation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYamagami’s story of grief and financial turmoil has drawn some sympathizers. Thousands have signed a petition advocating for a reduced sentence, and people have donated over $7,000 in cash, clothing, books and other items to Yamagami, according to Japanese news outlet Jiji Press.\n\nHis story is not unique, said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, a lawyer with the National Network of Lawyers Against Spiritual Sales, a Tokyo-based advocacy group. From 1987 to 2021, there were nearly 35,000 cases brought by defendants claiming about $863 million in damages from the Unification Church, according to the advocacy group’s website.\n\n“His mother was mentally in a very difficult situation … and it is typical for people in a situation like her to become victims to the Unification Church,” Yamaguchi said.\n\nYamaguchi wants to see greater regulation of spiritual sales or excessive donations, and proper care of children of parents who are members of “new religion” groups who may be donating heavily to such organizations.\n\n“I really felt that it was a matter of time before something like this happened,” Yamaguchi said. “I have seen countless tragedies and difficulties faced by children of parents who are part of the Unification Church … I can easily imagine that Yamagami must have suffered in a similar manner.”\n\nMarc Fisher in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Joint Statement on the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea Trilateral Foreign Ministerial Meeting": "The following is the joint statement released by the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Ministers of the Governments of the Republic of Korea and Japan.\n\nBegin Text:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa, and Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Jin met today on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City to reaffirm their commitment to strong trilateral cooperation as we seek to address urgent 21st century challenges. The United States’ ironclad alliance commitments to the ROK and Japan and our close, enduring friendships are critical to the security and prosperity of our citizens, the region, and the world.\n\nThe Secretary and Foreign Ministers underscored the importance of working together to address the DPRK’s destabilizing behavior and advance our shared goal of achieving the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They condemned the DPRK’s numerous ballistic missile launches this year, each of which violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions and posed a serious threat to the region. They reaffirmed that a DPRK nuclear test would be met with a strong and resolute response from the international community. They also expressed their serious concern over the DPRK’s escalatory and destabilizing messaging related to nuclear weapons use, including its adoption of a new law on nuclear policy. Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the U.S. steadfast commitments to the defense of the ROK and Japan. The Secretary and Foreign Ministers urged the DPRK to abide by its obligations under relevant UN Security Council resolutions and called for full implementation of these by the international community. They stressed the importance of serious and sustained dialogue and urged the DPRK to return to negotiations. To this end, Secretary Blinken and Minister Hayashi expressed support for the goal of the ROK’s “Audacious Initiative.” They also reaffirmed the importance of achieving an immediate resolution of the abductions issue.\n\nThe Secretary and Foreign Ministers also affirmed a shared commitment to support the needs and priorities of our Pacific Island partners.

In particular, they noted the need to stand together in the face of economic coercion and committed to work together to deter and respond to such actions. More broadly, they pledged to work together to uphold the international order in which countries can choose their own path, free from undue pressure.\n\nFinally, the Secretary and Foreign Ministers condemned Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine and expressed unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. They stressed that they will oppose any attempts to change the status quo of territories and areas by force or coercion anywhere in the world. They reaffirmed the need to stand together with the international community to respond resolutely to this clear violation of international law and provide assistance to the Ukrainian government and its people.\n\nThe Secretary and Foreign Ministers looked forward to regular trilateral coordination toward a secure and prosperous future.

    "Japan simplifies COVID tracking to focus on elderly, high-risk people": "KYODO NEWS - 18 hours ago - 12:34 | All, Japan, Coronavirus\n\nJapan began Monday to simplify its coronavirus reporting system by targeting elderly and high-risk people in a bid to reduce the administrative burden on hospitals and local health centers.\n\nThe new system will not require medical facilities to report details such as names and addresses of younger people with milder symptoms that have made up around 80 percent of the country's COVID-19 cases since the Omicron strain drove numbers sharply higher and stretched the medical system thin.\n\nThe government will continue to oblige health facilities to report the number of people who test positive for the virus each day by age group in an attempt to monitor the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe measure, which places focus on the provision of appropriate medical care to the elderly and others at risk of developing severe symptoms, reflects the government's policy shift as it moves to transition the nation toward living with the coronavirus.\n\nHealth minister Katsunobu Kato said that some municipalities which introduced the system prior to Monday have expressed concerns about being unable to contact those not included in the reporting, saying it prevents them from responding swiftly to such patients when their symptoms become serious.\n\n\"We would like to keep in close contact with local governments and respond with improvements when issues come up,\" Kato told a press conference on Monday.\n\nSubject to the new reporting system are people aged 65 or older, those who require hospitalization, as well as pregnant women and high-risk patients who may require medicine or a supply of oxygen.\n\nThe new reporting system has already been adopted by nine prefectures as an emergency measure.

The hard-punching champ made a good start, leading on points: all 39-37 after the fourth. As the underdog Chiba mixed it up from the fifth, he overcame a points deficit to have it back to all 76-76 after the eighth. Chiba impressively accelerated his attack to hurt the champ in the eleventh and finally caught up with him with a last surge to prompt the ref’s intervention in the final session.\n\nSaka barely keeps Japanese 130lb belt in a seesaw game\n\nHard-punching Japanese champ Kosuke Saka (22-6, 19 KOs), 130, very barely kept his national 130-pound belt when he came off the canvas twice, dropped back Tsubasa Narai (8-2, 7 KOs), 129.5, twice and finally halted him at 0:55 of the sixth session in Osaka, Japan, on September 17. The ambitious challenger had the champ on the deck in the first and fourth, but Saka retaliated with a beautifully well-timed right to floor Nara in the fifth. The champ again decked the badly hurt challenger in round six, when the ref waived it off to save the loser. Narai deserves a rematch soon.\n\n_\n\n",

    "Japan’s Big Tourism Reopening": "Good morning from Skift. It’s Friday, September 23. Here’s what you need to know about the business of travel today.\n\nListen Now\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Overcast | Google Podcasts\n\nEpisode Notes\n\nTravel industry leaders gathered this week at Skift Global Forum in New York City to discuss significant topics and major trends in travel, and amid all the notable soundbites, Corporate Travel Editor Matthew Parsons reports on three big takeaways from this year’s event.\n\nOne of the takeaways Parsons cites came from Frederic Lalonde, the CEO of online travel agency Hopper. Lalonde said the key to building new products is being bold and experimenting, even if that means generating a loss. He said all of Hopper’s new products lose money but added the company is constantly trying to figure out what might work. Lalonde admitted he was stunned by Hopper’s success in selling loot boxes — treasure chests with a mystery gift — as part of a Puerto Rico promotion.\n\nAnother major takeaway from the forum was the call for tourism marketers to sell true images of destinations. Kenyan author and conservationist Dr. Mordecai Ogada blasted the travel industry for selling images of Africa from hundreds of years ago — themes he said are mostly based on Tarzan. Parsons also listed the importance of executives being approachable for all staff members as a major takeaway. Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said interacting with employees as much as possible is crucial in building trust with staff.\n\nWe turn next to major news from Japan. The country announced on Thursday it’s restoring visa-free entry for independent travelers from October 11, reports Asia Editor Peden Doma Bhutia.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida also said that Japan would lift the daily cap on arrivals on the same date. Those moves put an end to the two-and-a-half years of strict travel restrictions that severely limited the number of international travelers to Japan. However, foreign tourists would need to be fully vaccinated or test negative for Covid prior to arrival.\n\nAt the same time as the restrictions lift, the Japanese government will bring back its nationwide travel discount program to boost domestic tourism. The program was paused after a surge in Covid cases.\n\nFinally, hospitality company Ennismore is planning to expand its co-working spaces it calls “Working From” to all of its 14 hotel brands, reports Corporate Travel Editor Parsons in this Week’s Future of Work briefing.\n\nThe group’s Hoxton properties in London and Chicago are currently its only hotels to operate the co-working spaces. But founder and co-CEO Sharan Pasricha said at Skift Global Forum this week that Ennismore would expand Working From to other Ennismore hotels, which include Hyde and Mama Shelter. Pasricha described Working From, which he founded in 2019, as a “boomerang success,” citing the waiting list of 400 people wanting to join its London co-working space.",
    "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’": "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’\n\nScientists who drilled deeper into an undersea earthquake fault than ever before have found that the tectonic stress in Japan’s Nankai subduction zone is less than expected.\n\nThe results of the study led by the University of Washington and the University of Texas at Austin, published Sept. 5 in Geology, are a puzzle, since the fault produces a great earthquake almost every century and was thought to be building for another big one.\n\nAlthough the Nankai fault has been stuck for decades, the findings reveal that it is not yet showing major signs of pent-up tectonic stress. Authors say the result doesn’t alter the long-term outlook for the fault, which last ruptured in 1946, when it caused a tsunami that killed thousands, and is expected to do so again during the next 50 years.\n\nThe findings will help scientists home in on the link between tectonic forces and the earthquake cycle. This could potentially lead to better earthquake forecasts, both at Nankai and other megathrust faults, like the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Washington and Oregon.\n\n“Right now, we have no way of knowing if the big one for Cascadia — a magnitude-9 scale earthquake and tsunami — will happen this afternoon or 200 years from now,” said lead author Harold Tobin, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences and co-chief scientist on the drilling expedition. “But I have some optimism that with more and more direct observations like this one from Japan we can start to recognize when something anomalous is occurring and that the risk of an earthquake is heightened in a way that could help people prepare.\n\n“We learn how these faults work by studying them all over the world, and that knowledge will directly translate into insight into the Cascadia hazard as well.”\n\nMegathrust faults such as Nankai and Cascadia, and the tsunamis they generate, are among the most powerful and damaging on the globe. Scientists say they currently have no reliable way of knowing when and where the next big one will hit.\n\nThe hope is that by directly measuring the force felt between tectonic plates pushing on each other — tectonic stress — scientists can learn when a great earthquake is ready to happen.\n\n“This is the heart of the subduction zone, right above where the fault is locked, where the expectation was that the system should be storing energy between earthquakes,” said co-author Demian Saffer at University of Texas at Austin, who also co-led the scientific drilling expedition. “It changes the way we’re thinking about stress in these systems.”\n\nThe nature of tectonics means that the great earthquake faults are found in deep ocean, miles under the seafloor, making them incredibly challenging to measure directly. Tobin and Saffer’s drilling expedition is the closest scientists have come.\n\nTheir record-breaking feat took place in 2018 aboard a Japanese scientific drilling ship, the Chikyu, which drilled almost 2 miles, or just over 3 kilometers, into the tectonic plate before the borehole got too unstable to continue — 1 mile short of the fault.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers gathered invaluable data about subsurface conditions near the fault, including stress. To do that, they measured how much the borehole changed shape as the Earth squeezed it from the sides, then pumped water to see what it took to force its walls back out. That told them the direction and strength of horizontal stress felt by the plate pushing on the fault.\n\nContrary to predictions, the horizontal stress expected to have built up since the most recent great earthquake was close to zero, as if the system had already released its pent-up energy.\n\nThe researchers suggested several explanations: It could be that the fault simply needs less pent-up energy than thought to slip in a big earthquake, or that the stresses are lurking nearer to the fault than the drilling reached. Or it could be that the tectonic push will come suddenly in the coming years. Either way, the researchers said the drilling showed the need for further investigation and long-term monitoring of the fault.\n\n“Findings like this can seem like they muddy the picture, because things aren’t as simple as our theory or models predicted they were,” Tobin said. “But that just means we’re gaining more understanding of how the real world works, and the real world is messy and complicated.”\n\nThe research was funded by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, or JAMSTEC. Other co-authors are Takehiro Hirose at JAMSTEC and David Castillo at Insight GeoMechanics in Australia.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Tobin at htobin@uw.edu or Saffer at demian@ig.utexas.edu.\n\nAdapted from an article by the University of Texas at Austin.",

    "EU, South Korea, Japan Announce Metaverse Regulation Plans": "Every dramatically new technology, from cryptocurrency to drones to artificial intelligence, poses a regulatory challenge. Governments must decide how to characterize the technology within existing laws, how those existing laws apply and to what extent new tech requires new legal restrictions. Governments can take action in a variety of ways: through new legislation, by revising regulations and other policies under existing law, or through litigation. Many national governments and international bodies are having exactly this conversation as to the metaverse, with significant possible ramifications for metaverse companies, their business partners and end users.\n\nEU\n\nOn Sept. 14, 2022, Thierry Breton, the European Union's Commissioner for the Internal Market, published \"People, technologies & infrastructure – Europe's plan to thrive in the metaverse.\" In part, Breton signaled confidence in existing law on metaverse issues, noting that \"With the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA), Europe has now strong and future-proof regulatory tools for the digital space.\" But the commissioner also clearly indicated that the work of regulating the metaverse is just starting, announcing the launch of the Virtual and Augmented Reality Industrial Coalition, \"bringing together stakeholders from key metaverse technologies\" to develop a roadmap for further development. Breton stressed safety and competition concerns, promising that \"we will not witness a new Wild West or new private monopolies.\"\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea's National Data Policy Committee announced on Sept. 23, 2022, that it would develop regulatory amendments specific to the metaverse. The Committee is chaired by South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and co-administered by the Ministers of Science and ICT and the Minister of Interior and Safety.\n\nThe announcement focused on the metaverse as an issue that could \"lead the success of national competitiveness.\" The Committee found specifically that the South Korean framework that exists for videogaming was insufficient to deal with metaverse issues. Earlier in the week, Vice Chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, Ahn Hyoung-hwan, met with a metaverse platform provider to discuss growing concerns over South Korean minors being subjected to sexual harassment on metaverse platforms.\n\nJapan\n\nEarlier this year, Japan announced creation of a Web 3.0 Policy Office under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to formulate metaverse-related policies. The Ministry noted that \"as metaverses become new personal interfaces especially among younger generations such as Generation Z, digital spaces and assets could become much more important\" and that Web 3.0 entrepreneurs may be departing the country for less-regulated options.\n\nUSA\n\nIn the United States, the most direct regulatory statement on the metaverse has come in the context of the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit to block Meta's acquisition of a popular metaverse application. Per the FTC, \"The virtual reality industry offers a uniquely immersive digital experience and is characterized by a high degree of growth and innovation,\" but that Meta's drive to \"conquer virtual reality\" posed a threat to competition. \"Meta, the global technology behemoth that owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, is the largest provider of virtual reality devices, and also a leading provider of apps in the U.S.\" The FTC claims that by purchasing the fitness app, Meta discouraged anyone else from creating such an app, dampening future innovation and competitive rivalry.\n\nWhether by enforcing and expanding existing laws or developing new regulations, or through the soft regulation of policies and guidelines, the developing metaverse will continue to occupy a central place in government discussions around the world.\n\nHolland & Knight's Metaverse Strategy Team includes experienced attorneys who are recognized thought leaders in the field.

    "How Japan Won Its ‘Traffic War’": "In mid-August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that the surge in American traffic deaths is continuing: An estimated 9,560 people died on US roadways in the first quarter of 2022, 7% more than a year ago and the highest first quarter total in two decades.\n\nMeanwhile in Japan, the country’s innovative approach to transportation is bringing different results. Fewer than 3,000 people died in Japanese crashes in 2021, compared to almost 43,000 in the United States. On a per capita basis, Japan had just 2.24 deaths per 100,000 residents, less than a fifth the US rate of 12.7 per 100,000.\n\nAnd Japanese roads are getting even safer: 2021 saw the fewest road fatalities of any year since record-keeping began in 1948.\n\nRead more from CityLab",

(Chevron), and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd (MOECO) have announced the signing of a Joint Collaboration Agreement to explore the technical and commercial feasibility of advanced geothermal power generation in Japan.\n\nBuilding on Chevron and MOECO’s long-standing relationship, the new collaboration will study geothermal resource potential across Japan and will evaluate the effectiveness of Advanced Closed Loop (ACL) technology for a future joint pilot project in Japan. Both companies may also assess potential collaboration for advanced geothermal technology opportunities using ACL globally.\n\nUnlike conventional geothermal projects, which use traditional steam turbines requiring high temperatures often found in concentrated locations limited by geological characteristics, ACL can potentially enable access to geothermal resources at a wider range of temperatures and geologies through the application of alternative technology above and below the surface.\n\n“Chevron and MOECO share a goal of delivering lower carbon energy solutions, while meeting the need for reliable, affordable energy,” said Barbara Harrison, vice president of Offsets & Emerging, Chevron New Energies. “This collaboration provides an opportunity for Chevron to combine its subsurface capabilities and technologies with MOECO’s intimate knowledge of Japan’s geothermal potential resource geology and its long history of responsible resource development. The joint team will have the opportunity to test emerging geothermal technology in a real world setting with significant scaling up potential.”\n\n“MOECO entered the geothermal business in 2012 and has been expanding its geothermal portfolio since then. In parallel with conventional geothermal, we have been studying ACL technology for many years and we believe this collaboration with Chevron utilizing ACL technology could unlock tremendous geothermal resources in Japan,” said Hirotaka Hamamoto, CEO of MOECO. “This joint collaboration with Chevron, who has been a valued partner of MOECO for several decades in the energy industry, is intended to open a new chapter in the geothermal industry as MOECO aims to continue contributing to an environmentally sustainable world as a member of the Mitsui & CO’s group companies.”\n\nEarlier this year, MOECO also entered a partnership with TEPCO Renewable Power Inc. (TEPCO) for the joint consideration of using new heat recovery technology for geothermal power generation.\n\nSource: Chevron",

It was packing maximum winds of 162 kilometers (101 miles) per hour, and is forecast to reach Tokyo on Tuesday.\n\nThe weather agency predicted as much as 50 centimeters (20 inches) of rainfall by Monday evening and warned of flooding and landslides. It also alerted residents in the affected areas of \"unprecedented\" levels of powerful winds and waves, urging them to evacuate early.\n\nStorm and high wave warnings were in effect in Kagoshima, where residents were told to stay inside stable buildings on second floor or higher, if it's deemed a safer option than going to evacuation centers.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kyodo News via AP Kyodo News via AP\n\nMore than 12,000 people took shelter at evacuation centers. In neighboring Miyazaki prefecture, about 8,000 people left their homes.\n\nLocal officials said several people had been injured. In Kushima city in Miyazaki, a woman was slightly hurt by shards of glass when winds broke windows at a gymnasium. NHK national television said 15 people had been injured, citing its own tally.\n\nPower outages were expanded across the Kyushu region as the typhoon damaged more power lines and facilities while moving north. By Sunday night, 216,450 homes were without electricity, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co.\n\nFootage on NHK television showed a pachinko pinball parlor with part of its glass wall shattered by the gust in Kanoya city in Kagoshima.

    "With trips postponed, Franklin leaders maintain Kuji, Japan sister city relationship": "Kuji Alley across the Johnson County Courthouse in Franklin displays a vibrant mural of koi with patterns of orange, black, white and yellow on a red background.\n\nThe fish are a symbolic reminder of a sister city partnership between Franklin, Indiana, and Kuji, Japan, that became official in 1961.\n\nThe partnership, however, has become physically distant, even as leaders have kept in touch via holiday cards, emails and videos. In the fall of 2020, a group of students at Franklin Community High School were set to embark on a trip to the northern Japanese city for the first time since 2015. When the COVID-19 pandemic set in, however, it not only put that trip on hold indefinitely, but halted an annual tradition of students from Japan visiting Franklin.\n\nNow, even as many parts of the world have reopened to tourists and students alike, Kuji and Franklin officials have been unable to complete plans for the next visit. Franklin school board members will vote next month on a trip planned to send students to Switzerland to visit Endress+Hauser headquarters\n\nStill, the trip to Japan is a top priority, said David Clendening, superintendent.\n\n“I think it’s a great cultural experience when our kids can go over and spend seven to 10 days with their peers and go to school and see what it’s like at their school and in everyday life, to experience food, customs, shopping and language. All of these are benefits as we get kids ready for the future,” Clendening said. “(Japan) was a great experience for the kids. They made friends, and social media has allowed kids to stay connected even though they can’t travel back and forth.”\n\n1 of 5\n\nGreg Moore, a member of the mayor’s committee for the Kuji sister city relationship, has seen the value of the partnership first hand. Moore’s wife, Tamayo Fukomoto, is Japanese, and the two used to live in Japan. In years prior, they have helped organize trips of Japanese students visiting Franklin, including their stays with host families in Franklin.\n\n“It fosters friendship and learning growth for the kids. They can learn how much we are alike in this world and different in a fun way, too. I always hope these types of exchanges make the world a friendlier place and encourage our students to travel abroad themselves,” Moore said.\n\nThough organizers in both the United States and Japan see the value in the relationship, it has been stymied by the ongoing global pandemic.\n\n“The real difficulty is Japan’s very restrictive COVID policies,” Moore said. “They are not allowing anyone in without a Japanese passport. There are exceptions, this could be an exception, but they are a very conservative country in that regard. There are hoops and hurdles to go through and to send a group over there is really tough.”\n\nOn Sept. 23, some of those hurdles were removed as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced tourists would be welcomed startingOct. 11, not just those traveling with authorized groups. While the announcement is encouraging, the decision to send and host students still has to be a mutual one between Franklin and Kuji officials, Clendening said in an email.\n\nMoore said he was excited about the news.\n\nWhile there is a possibility of students from Japan visiting Franklin, they likely don’t want to risk bringing COVID back to their home country. The Kuji delegation has already announced it won’t be visiting this January, Moore said.\n\nThe partnership between Franklin and Kuji started in 1911, when Franklin College graduate Thomasine Allen went to Japan as a missionary and founded the Kuji Christian Center, Franklin College President Kerry Prather said in an email.\n\n“The relationship between Franklin and Kuji has, from the beginning, been rooted in a shared commitment to education and friendship,” Prather said. “For many years, Franklin College graduates have had the opportunity to travel to Kuji and work, learn and teach in our sister city through a program made possible by the Kuji mayor’s office. We are grateful for this longstanding community friendship and the special role Franklin College has played since its inception. We look forward to many more years of partnering with our friends in Kuji.”\n\nFranklin Mayor Steve Barnett, who first joined the city as part of the town council in 2008, has been heavily involved with the partnership, welcoming Japanese students every January until 2020, the last year students visited. That year, they stopped by not only Franklin schools, but also the Johnson County courthouse, the Historic Artcraft Theatre, the Garment Factory and City Hall.\n\nThey’ve also visited other American cities during their trips to visit Franklin, such as Chicago, Indianapolis, New York and Washington D.C., Barnett said.\n\n“To be able to meet and talk with other individuals with different cultures and just having a good time (is my favorite aspect). They’ll have chaperones for the kids and we’ll entertain them and exchange gifts. We go out to dinner and learn about their culture and they’ll learn about our culture,” Barnett said. “It’s been a great learning experience for myself. We have a good time when the chaperones get together. It’s good for our city to have somewhere like Kuji that wants to be an active sister city.”\n\nIn order to maintain the active relationship, the two cities exchanged videos earlier this year, each showing a day in the lives of some of their students. Additionally, Franklin officials have plans to enhance Kuji Alley for the next time Japanese students visit, but the details of those enhancements haven’t been finalized, said Tara Payne, the city of Franklin’s chief of staff.\n\n“We were all planned to go (to Kuji) and then COVID hit and we weren’t able to so both cities, Kuji and Franklin, were devastated,” Payne said.",
    "Japan is reopening. But the effects of its border closure will linger.": "Listen 7 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\ncorrection Christopher LaFleur is a special adviser and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that he is chairman. This article has been corrected. TOKYO — Japan is inching closer to a full reopening, with an announcement likely in the coming days. But the country’s prolonged closure during the coronavirus pandemic has done lasting damage to its reputation as a destination for international investors, academics and tourists, experts say. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Japan strictly limits foreign arrivals out of covid-19 concerns, a scientifically specious approach that has made the country an outlier among top economies and most Asia-Pacific neighbors that have reopened to tourists.\n\nXenophobia has festered as policymakers and news coverage have tied foreigners to the spread of the virus. Investors, academics and international students have diverted their plans elsewhere. Even after Japan began accepting group tours recently, the intense monitoring and bureaucratic hurdles have largely kept tourists’ interest at bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Japan faces a credibility gap as it looks to rejoin the world. Figures in business, academia, policymaking and diplomacy are concerned the closure has punctured Japan’s image as a culture that values hospitality. Even with a full reopening, Japan would need concrete steps to restore its standing, these people said.\n\n“In 2022, the extremes between the G-7 countries and even its own neighbors … have really exacerbated this perception gap,” said Joshua W. Walker, president and chief executive of the New York-based Japan Society, which works to promote U.S.-Japan relations. “There are so many other countries that have figured this out, whether it’s Britain, Singapore, even Taiwan or Korea, that have been more or less operating in a more normal fashion … and Japan is just now taking baby steps.”\n\nWalker is among a chorus of professionals who have become frustrated by the country’s apparent lack of interest in the perception problems caused by its isolation. They worry that without a robust effort to market Japan as open to foreigners, there will be lackluster interest from abroad and continued concern about the domestic impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic opinion polls over the past year have shown broad support for border closures, which analysts say made it politically difficult for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to fully reopen before July elections. A Nikkei poll conducted in late June found 49 percent in support of lifting the daily cap on visitors and 44 percent opposed.\n\n“I really do believe that Japan can recover from this if it puts its mind to it. But I’m not convinced that it is fully there yet,” Walker said.\n\nThe concerns come as Japan grapples with a sluggish recovery from the pandemic and a depreciating yen, which hit a 24-year low against the dollar recently. Business leaders have argued that fully resuming inbound travel would invigorate the economy and that many tourists would be eager to take advantage of the weak currency.\n\nBut the country’s approach has fueled a perception of Japan as a place that is “too cumbersome and takes too much effort” to visit, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives said this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Japan has disappointed many people who love Japan and have a potential to like Japan,” said Takakazu Yamagishi, professor of political science and health policy at Nanzan University in Nagoya. “The border closure not only made many tourists who had plans to visit Japan upset, but it also will make them more cautious of Japan at least for the next few years.”\n\nAfter enacting some of the most stringent pandemic restrictions, Japan began gradually reopening to some foreigners this spring, with complex requirements. Foreign tourists can book trips only through an approved tour company and must have medical travel insurance that covers covid-19. Until last week, tourists needed to be chaperoned by a guide. Visitors must wear masks unless they are six feet away from another person and not talking.\n\nIn June, when group tours resumed, only 252 tourists entered, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. In July, the number rose to about 7,900.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that is far from pre-pandemic levels: In 2019, Japan welcomed a record 32 million foreign tourists and had aimed to reach 40 million in 2020. Before covid, 80 percent of international visitors were individuals who were not part of group tours, according to the Japan Business Federation.\n\nTokyo is now considering a full reopening that could take place as early as October, according to Nikkei Asia. The prime minister’s office said in a statement that the country will ease borders to be on par with Group of Seven standards, “taking into account the infection situation and needs at home and abroad, as well as the border control measures of other countries.”\n\nThe closure has created cascading effects on academia that will last years, said Tomoyuki Sasaki, an associate professor of Japanese studies at William & Mary in Virginia, who conducted a survey of hundreds of academics and students of Japan studies in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents dropped out of Japan studies programs and researchers lost funding because they could not fulfill grant requirements to conduct research in the country, threatening the closure of Japan studies departments in some schools, the survey results show. One professor at a top-tier university responded in the survey that they are now recommending students not to study Japan as their sole focus as a result of the travel barriers.\n\nThe number of international students studying in Japan fell by roughly one-quarter between 2019 and 2021, according to Japan’s Education Ministry.\n\n“It took a long time for predecessors to build this field. But now, it’s really falling apart because of this Japanese government’s very strict border restrictions,” Sasaki said.\n\nBusiness leaders are pushing for a full reopening, warning of the loss of potential investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Japan really has a golden opportunity to expand foreign investment into the country, something the government has had as an objective for most of the last 20 years,” said Christopher LaFleur, special adviser to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. “The yen’s relative weakness at the moment, in principle, presents an incredible opportunity for those who might be interested in investing in Japan to consider it seriously.”\n\nBut domestic challenges stand in the way. Yamagishi said the government’s justifications for its border policies fueled public anxiety, stoking fears without providing facts — such as the low percentage of people testing positive at airports.\n\nFrom restaurateurs to museum operators, many people fear foreigners would flout Japanese social expectations of mask-wearing and social distancing, leading to an increase in coronavirus cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In foreign news, I often see images of foreigners not wearing masks,” one resident of Minato City in Tokyo remarked recently on the ward’s online public comments section.\n\n“I would like you to think about how to deal with foreign tourists by calling attention to them in English, Chinese, Korean, and other languages,” the person wrote. “I would also like you to protect the safety of the lives of Minato City residents.”\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Japan’s $2-billion initiative to prep pandemic vaccines in 100 days": "A new centre will invest in shots for a range of infectious diseases so the country is ready for future outbreaks.\n\nA new Japanese research effort will work on vaccines for infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, monkeypox and dengue virus.Credit: Eugene Hoshiko/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAfter recognizing that Japan was slow to develop vaccines for COVID-19, the government has pledged to invest US$2 billion in a vaccine-research initiative to ensure that the country is ready to respond promptly to future epidemics.\n\nThe Strategic Center of Biomedical Advanced Vaccine Research and Development for Preparedness and Response (SCARDA) will initially invest in vaccine research for eight pathogens, including coronaviruses, monkeypox, dengue virus and Zika virus, using a range of technologies for vaccine delivery, such as mRNA technology, viral vectors and recombinant proteins.\n\nJapan has been “too slow to catch up” with the rest of the world in making COVID-19 vaccines, says Ken Ishii, a University of Tokyo vaccinologist who is also part of the central research centre selected by SCARDA. The country’s three most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates are still in late-stage clinical trials and none is approved for use.\n\nIn recognition of this delay, the Japanese government established SCARDA in March; the centre will launch formally in November, says Ishii. The government has realized that developing vaccines is complicated and takes resources, and has given the field a boost, says Toshihiro Horii, a vaccinologist at Osaka University. “That is a tremendously huge amount of money,” he says.\n\nThe initiative will bring together researchers from across Japan, says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Tokyo, and head of the SCARDA central research centre. “That is unique, at least for Japan.”\n\nHundred-day goal\n\nSCARDA’s aim will be to produce diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines ready for large-scale production within the first 100 days of a pathogen with pandemic potential being identified. This 100-day mission was first proposed by the United Kingdom in 2021, and backed by the other countries in the G7 group of wealthy nations. Similar initiatives include the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA); this coordinates the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics in response to public-health emergencies, including pandemics, and invested in several COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“Since SCARDA is a new organization, it has much to learn from BARDA” and other initiatives funding vaccines, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, says Michinari Hamaguchi, director-general of SCARDA.\n\nTwo of SCARDA’s first approved projects aim to develop universal coronavirus vaccines and vaccines against a group of coronaviruses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), such as SARS-CoV-2. Another project will create a fast-track system for evaluating vaccine candidates.\n\nJapan’s centre will operate with around 30 members of staff and funding to last 5 years. Of the allotted $2 billion, $1.2 billion will go to vaccine research and development projects, and $400 million will be used to support start-ups in drug development. Another $400 million will be spent on setting up a virtual network of centres of excellence for basic research in vaccine science, and testing vaccine candidates in early-stage trials. The goal is “to find seeds for future vaccines”, says Kawaoka.\n\nIn addition to the central research centre based in Tokyo, there will be four core institutes — Osaka University, Nagasaki University, Hokkaido University and Chiba University. Another five institutions will provide support services such as animal models.\n\nHorii, who leads several clinical trials for malaria and is not involved with SCARDA, says that the current bottleneck in vaccine development in Japan is the translation of research into clinical practice. SCARDA will have to move beyond basic science to develop expertise in taking vaccine candidates through clinical trials, he says. “We have many vaccinologists in Japan, but the majority of them are basic researchers.”",

She said coming in to work also offered some upsides for her dog, a six-month-old Pomeranian named Toramaru.\n\n\"Compared to being at home, your dog gets to meet up with its dog friends and with people, so there's a good incentive for them as well,\" Inoue said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Rocky Swift; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "At U.N., Micronesia denounces Japan plan to release Fukushima water into Pacific": "A worker, wearing protective suits and masks, takes notes in front of storage tanks for radioactive water at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan February 10, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nUNITED NATIONS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The president of the Pacific island state of Micronesia denounced at the United Nations on Thursday Japan's decision to discharge what he called nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, David Panuelo said Micronesia had the \"gravest concern\" about Japan’s decision to release the so-called Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) water into the ocean.\n\n\"We cannot close our eyes to the unimaginable threats of nuclear contamination, marine pollution, and eventual destruction of the Blue Pacific Continent,\" he said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"The impacts of this decision are both transboundary and intergenerational in nature. As Micronesia’s head of state, I cannot allow for the destruction of our Ocean resources that support the livelihood of our people.\"\n\nJapan said in July that its nuclear regulators had approved a plan to release into the Pacific ocean water used to cool reactors in the aftermath of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster.\n\nThe water has been stored in huge tanks in the plant, and amounted to more than 1.3 million tonnes by July.\n\nJapan's Foreign Ministry said at that time that regulators deemed it safe to release the water, which will still contain traces of the radioactive isotope tritium after treatment.\n\nAsked about Panuelo's statement, Yukiko Okano, the ministry's deputy press secretary, said in reference to Fukushima that Japan would try its best \"to gain understanding from the international community about the safety of our activities there.\"\n\nThe plant operator, Tokyo Power Electric Company (Tepco), plans to filter the contaminated water to remove harmful isotopes apart from tritium, which is hard to remove. Then it will be diluted and released to free up plant space to allow the decommissioning of Fukushima to continue.\n\nThe plan has encountered stiff resistance from regional fishing unions which fear its impact on their livelihoods. Japan's neighbors China, South Korea, and Taiwan have also voiced concern.\n\nPanuelo also highlighted the threat posed by climate change, to which Pacific island states are particularly vulnerable. He called on geopolitical rivals the United States and China to consider it \"a non-political and non-competitive issue for cooperation.\"\n\n\"For the briefest period of time, it seemed as if the Americans, with whom Micronesia shares an Enduring Partnership, and the Chinese, with whom Micronesia shares a Great Friendship, were starting to work together on this issue, despite increases in tension in other areas,\" he said. \"Now, they are no longer speaking to each other on this important issue.\"\n\nChina announced in August it was halting bilateral cooperation with the United States in areas including defense, narcotics, transnational crime and climate change in protest against a visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPanuelo's remarks coincided with a meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted of the Partners in the Blue Pacific countries, which include Japan with the aim of better coordinating assistance to the region in the face of competition from China. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by David Brunnstrom; editing by Grant McCool and Stephen Coates\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "As economies worldwide struggle with inflation, Japan faces another problem: a weak yen": "After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday to tamp down inflation, central banks in the U.K., Switzerland and Norway followed suit Thursday. The European Central Bank is almost certain to do the same in a few weeks.\n\nThere was a notable exception, though. The Bank of Japan decided to keep its rates near zero — and said it expects that to be the case for some time.\n\nJapan is dealing with inflation just like everybody else is. But its government is facing another big problem: the falling value of the yen.\n\nRelative to the dollar, the currency’s value has fallen by more than 20% this year.\n\nThat’s in large part because the Bank of Japan has kept interest rates low, while the Federal Reserve has been raising them. And that makes Japanese government bonds less attractive to investors.\n\n“They sell Japanese yen and buy U.S. dollars, so that leads to the yen’s depreciation,” said Sayuri Shirai, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo and a former member of the Bank of Japan’s policy board.\n\nShe said the bank is keeping interest rates low to prop up Japan’s economy after the pandemic by helping people with mortgages and business loans.\n\n“There are still many small and medium enterprises that are suffering, and so they need to borrow money from commercial banks. So if the interest rates start to go up, that’s very bad for them,” Shirai said.\n\nA weak yen can be a good thing, especially for Japanese manufacturers, since it makes their exports cheaper.\n\nBut Takatoshi Ito, an economics professor at Columbia University, said Japanese exports have been slow.\n\nMeanwhile, the weak yen is making imports more expensive for Japanese consumers.\n\n“So the benefit seems to be less than before, while the costs from the imported inflation, especially energy and food, seems to be high,” Ito said.\n\nThe Japanese government is trying to boost the yen by buying its own currency and selling off reserves of other currencies.\n\nBut Christopher Vecchio at DailyFX said Japan can only do that for so long.\n\n“As those [foreign exchange] reserves wind down, they have less ammunition moving forward to try to prop up the value of the yen, plain and simple,” he said.\n\nAnd as the Fed keeps hiking interest rates, it’ll be even harder for Japan to prop up the yen.",
    "The 1963 Franco-German Reconciliation Treaty: A Guide for Japan and South Korea?": "Relations between Japan and South Korea are at a dead end. Officials on both sides have acknowledged the need to improve relations . Beset by stark differences over compensation for historical issues of coerced sexual slaves (so-called comfort women) and forced labor, and contemporary issues of trade, the relationship needs a game changer to alter course. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has called for a “rethink” of the relationship. Conflict-resolution practices beyond East Asia could help us to think outside the box.\n\nCould a variant of the successful 1963 Franco-German reconciliation treaty help resolve the impasse in Japan-South Korea relations? While the Franco-German relationship has faced vicissitudes, for almost 60 years, the treaty has remained an anchor and framework for confronting and managing differences, and for cooperating on all manner of bilateral, regional and international issues. The following analysis focuses on five dimensions of the 1963 treaty that may have lessons for the South Korea-Japan relationship: 1) setting and origins; 2) dialogue and preparation; 3) personalities and leadership; 4) provisions and institutions; and 5) the role of the United States.\n\nSetting and Origins\n\nIn the 18 months before the Franco-German Elysée Treaty’s conclusion on January 22, 1963, the international system was in a fragile state of flux. In August 1961, East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic, erected the Berlin Wall. The next year, the world came to the nuclear precipice with the U.S.-Soviet missile crisis in Cuba. One week before the treaty’s signing, French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed the United Kingdom’s bid to join the European Economic Community (EEC).\n\nDuring this early stage of European integration, France and West Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, held differing perspectives: a French intergovernmental community versus a German supranational community. While they maintained differences over the EEC and NATO, both France and West Germany saw the treaty as a way to create dependability and predictability in Europe and present an independent voice in global affairs. The treaty was a mechanism for embedding Germany in Western Europe and an opportunity for demonstrating Germany’s commitment to peace.\n\nThe international system today is undergoing an even more dramatic shift. Both Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Yoon have recognized three major global and regional challenges: the Russian invasion of Ukraine; a rising China in economic, strategic and military terms; and an increasingly bellicose North Korea. The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers have agreed that “bilateral and trilateral strategic collaboration also involving the United States is needed more than ever in the current international situation.” Unusual times call for unusual action. Thinking about the Elysée Treaty reveals new possibilities.\n\nDialogue and Preparation\n\nThe Franco-German treaty’s gestation occurred over a five-year period, starting with German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s first meeting with de Gaulle in France as chancellor. They met in de Gaulle’s home in September 1958, lending a symbol of personal friendship beyond their political ties. An intense epistolary exchange (some 40 letters) and visits in both directions (15 times) followed, as well as exchanges in the EEC framework. Officials in various cabinet ministries and politicians from the two countries also frequently discussed policy issues in bilateral and regional fora.\n\nIn the Japanese-South Korean case, a reconciliation treaty is not imminent, but the dialogue track seems to have commenced through phone calls, letters and visits at the highest level. Kishida called the president-elect after Yoon’s March win. The two men agreed to start a new chapter in their relationship, with Yoon emphasizing the need for resolution of bilateral differences in a “reasonable, mutually beneficial manner.” They also met, albeit with hesitation, together with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the NATO summit in June 2022.\n\nSix weeks after the March call, Kishida and Japanese cabinet ministers met with a South Korean delegation representing Yoon to discuss historical and contemporary differences. In a letter to Kishida, Yoon is reported to have floated the idea of resuscitating the 1998 Obuchi-Kim declaration, which promised the possibility of future-oriented reconciliation based on recognition of history.\n\nKishida sent his foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, to Yoon’s inaugural, obviating the opposition of conservatives in the Liberal Democratic Party to Kishida himself attending the ceremony. In a personal letter to Yoon, Kishida underscored the urgency of strategic cooperation. The foreign minister and president committed to continuing dialogue and betterment of ties.\n\nHayashi and his South Korean counterpart, Park Jin, met at Yoon’s inauguration where they opened the possibility of a second meeting in Tokyo to discuss substantive issues and the question of a face-to-face meeting between Kishida and Yoon. At the second meeting in Tokyo in July, the two foreign ministers agreed to find a quick solution to the forced labor issue. Given determined and vociferous political naysayers and seesawing popularity ratings in both countries, the two sides are engaged in a delicate minuet. Their next moves in this elaborate dance will require clear-eyed, pragmatic leadership. A helpful step is Yoon’s creation in June of a public-private advisory council on the forced labor issue.\n\nPersonalities and Leadership\n\nIn their intense five-year dialogue, de Gaulle and Adenauer developed deep friendship and trust based on personal chemistry and spiritual Catholicism. They were seasoned politicians with crystalline goals to direct them and political backbones to withstand the daunting domestic opposition to their plans. Both demonstrated moral leadership and profound courage. They had both been tested already many times in their long careers, especially in World War II, in which they both stood up to fascism. When they began down the path of reconciliation, they evinced wisdom and stature.\n\nOn the other hand, Kishida and Yoon barely know each other. Kishida has a depth of policy experience, but Yoon is a political neophyte. However, they both bring personal advantages to the burgeoning relationship. They are both political conservatives, reducing the danger of ideological clashes. Yoon was a top prosecutor, which could mean a deftness in dealing with the legal intricacies of the historical issues. As Japan’s longest-serving foreign minister, Kishida was an experienced negotiator, including on the controversial and ill-fated 2015 sexual slavery compensation agreement, so he knows where the pitfalls are on this contentious issue. They both need to show courage and political leadership to bring along domestic opinion on a difficult, but not impossible, road ahead.\n\nProvisions and Institutions\n\nDe Gaulle held Adenauer in high esteem yet recognized that partnership had to be enshrined in something less subject to change and chance than personal chemistry. He wanted to embed Germany for the long-term through permanent institutions. The treaty recognized the past of hereditary enmity and noted that it would “[bring] an end to the age-old rivalries.”\n\nIn a novel approach, the treaty focused on institutions at both the societal and governmental levels. Starting already in the immediate postwar period, years before the 1963 treaty, civil society — religious, educational, economic, cultural and political actors — was an essential ingredient of a new relationship. The treaty formalized that interaction, particularly in the creation of the Franco-German Youth Office for the promotion of exchanges “between … pupils, students, young artists and workers.”\n\nOn the governmental side, the treaty broached the two broad areas of politics and defense. On the former, the treaty provided for a minimum of two meetings every year between heads of state and government and four times every year between foreign ministers. On defense, the ministers were to meet four times a year, and the chiefs of staff were to come together at least once every two months. The treaty also encouraged exchanges between armed forces personnel. These regular meetings instilled habits of cooperation and mutual learning. The significance of institutions was borne out immediately: from 1963 to 1966, when political relations were very difficult between de Gaulle and Ludwig Erhard, Adenauer’s successor, the two leaders’ annual meetings prescribed in the treaty took place, as did the foreign ministers’ meetings. In later years, the neighbors created Franco-German Councils in defense, economics, finance, culture and the environment.\n\nA comparable Japan-South Korea reconciliation treaty would take time, but an interim step could be the revival of the 1998 Obuchi-Kim joint declaration. The declaration came about because of deep tension over historical issues, but it failed to deal with them specifically. Whereas it talked about past and future, history dominated relations thereafter. The declaration also lacked an enforcement mechanism. All of these lessons of failed implementation should be kept in mind if the declaration finds new life. Some analysts have referred to the 1965 normalization treaty and its third-party arbitration mechanism for the resolution of compensation claims, but the joint declaration may be a better framework for resolution as its language has not been open to divisive interpretation.\n\nLike the Franco-German treaty, the joint declaration provided for cooperation between societies and between governments. The joint declaration referred to expansion of “cultural and personnel exchanges” and promotion of interactions “among various groups and regions at various levels … inter alia researchers, teachers, journalists, civic circles and other diverse groups.” It also emphasized the crucial involvement of young people.\n\nPeople-to-people exchanges between Japan and South Korea have occurred since 1965, but they were unpredictable, inconsistent and intermittent. The COVID-19 pandemic has further dented societal interaction. Analysts advocate the ramping up of societal activity, including Sheila Smith’s proposal to use as a model the 1961 Japan-US Cultural and Educational Interchange Commission, which entailed “a network of exchanges in the arts, education, civil society, and local community leaders.”\n\nRegarding official exchanges, the 1998 joint declaration underscored the strengthening of “mutual visits and the close consultations between them, to conduct these visits and consultations regularly and to further enhance Minister-level consultations in various areas.” Currently, elements of an official dialogue track are evident in Japanese-South Korean relations, but they could be expanded and routinized and eventually formalized in something akin to the unimplemented 1998 joint declaration.\n\nThe dialogue track could prioritize negotiations over wartime forced labor and sexual slavery. Already in 2014, Martina Timmermann suggested as a model the German fund (Foundation for Remembrance, Responsibility and Future), which emanated in 2000 from the slave and forced labor negotiations between Germany and its victims. It was funded equally by the German government, making it official, and private companies. The fund made compensation payments to victims. An overlooked part of the foundation is its work for the future, in which it funds educational projects regarding history and its contemporary consequences. A Japanese fund could encompass a similar educational track that would not forget history but manage it productively. This educational track comports with the proposal by Seiko Mimaki to permit nongovernmental actors to establish the framework for negotiating sexual slavery compensation.\n\nTrade disputes are amenable to official bilateral resolution, but private business involvement could lubricate the process. Furthermore, the negotiations could be located in a trilateral cooperation mechanism among Japan, South Korea and the United States, such as the newly launched Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. In general, U.S. mediation between Japan and South Korea on thorny problems could be productive.\n\nThe Role of the United States\n\nThe influence of a third party (i.e., those who favored NATO) temporarily impeded the political passage of the Franco-German treaty. In West Germany, opinion was split between Atlanticists, who feared a treaty would have a negative impact on transatlantic relations, and Gaullists, who supported the agreement. The treaty made only glancing mention of NATO and no mention of the United States, as noted with great concern by then U.S. President John F. Kennedy and U.S. officials. The Atlanticists’ and U.S. concerns were resolved during ratification in the Bundestag when deputies insisted on a preamble emphasizing the importance of both NATO and the United States.\n\nSimilar to the eventual outcome of the Franco-German treaty text, U.S. involvement in negotiations and cooperation between Japan and South Korea is not an obstacle, but rather a plus in economic and strategic terms. Such involvement could mean that trade restrictions (e.g., Japanese export controls on the materials used for semiconductors) and sexual slavery issues are approached as universal challenges, thereby blunting national perspectives. Trilateral and international arrangements neither dilute nor replace bilateral interaction, but rather augment it.\n\nSixty years ago, in a daring treaty, two courageous leaders put behind them the past of ingrained Franco-German conflict. South Korean and Japanese leaders could launch a similarly audacious move in the medium term as the culmination of a two-step process entailing regular dialogue and the 1998 joint declaration’s revival. Such a process could bring stability and reliability to a brittle relationship in an increasingly dangerous world.\n\nLily Gardner Feldman is a senior fellow at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University.",
    "Japan to Suspend Myanmar Military Training Program": "Click to expand Image Officers march during a parade to commemorate Myanmar's 77th Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, March 27, 2022. © 2022 AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo\n\nOn Tuesday, September 20, Japan’s Defense Ministry announced that as of 2023 it would no longer accept new military personnel from the Myanmar military for training in Japan. The ministry cited the junta’s execution of four pro-democracy activists in July as a major factor in its decision.\n\n“We decided it’s not appropriate to continue the military cooperation and exchange in its current form,” said Takeshi Aoki, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry. However, two officers and nine cadets who are currently receiving training at Japan’s National Defense Academy and Japan Self-Defense Forces facilities will remain until their programs finish.\n\nSince 2015, Japan has accepted cadets and officers from Myanmar under article 100-2 of the Self-Defense Forces Act, which permits training and educating foreign nationals in Defense Ministry facilities with the defense minister’s approval. Following Myanmar military’s coup in February 2021, Japan accepted two officers and two cadets in 2021 and another two officers and two cadets in 2022.\n\nIn May, Human Rights Watch and Justice For Myanmar located Myanmar Air Force Lt. Col. Hlwan Moe, who received training at Japan’s Air Command and Staff College from August 2016 to March 2017, at Magway Air Base in Myanmar’s central Magway Region. Military units deployed at the air base have been implicated in serious abuses, including possible indiscriminate airstrikes in Magway. In August, Human Rights Watch found that Myanmar Army Brig. Gen. Tin Soe, who received training at Japan’s Ground Self Defense Force Staff College from August 2016 to March 2017, was based at Eastern Command headquarters from August 2021 to July 2022. Eastern Command oversees operations in southern Shan and Karenni (Kayah) States and its forces were responsible for a massacre of civilians and other atrocities.\n\nThe Defense Ministry’s decision to suspend the training program is critical to ensuring that Japan does not risk becoming complicit in Myanmar military abuses. It is a small and long overdue step, but one that should embolden the Japanese government to join with other democracies that are taking stronger action against the junta. Japan should publicly voice its support for the draft Myanmar resolution that Britain circulated at the United Nations Security Council. That resolution reportedly calls for a global arms embargo on Myanmar that would prohibit all military training and imposes sanctions on the junta.",

He landed hard to the body right before the finish then set up Asakura for the big right at the second-round bell, which ultimately ended the bout.\n\nAsakura was slow getting up, and referee Kenny Bayless waved the fight off before either boxer got to his corner.\n\n\"Thanks for having me,\" Mayweather told the crowd. \"I'll be back.\"\n\nMayweather, 45, acknowledged Pacquiao in attendance in his postfight speech, calling him oddly a \"future\" world champion. Pacquiao, 43, addressed the fans before the exhibition and again afterward.\n\nPrior to the fight, Pacquiao said Asakura, 30, had traveled to the Philippines to ask him for advice on how to compete against Mayweather. Pacquiao added that he was in attendance to support Asian combat sports. Afterward, Pacquiao said twice that he hopes he will be invited back, causing the commentators to speculate that there could be something brewing with Rizin, Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\n\"I hope this is not my last invitation to watch a good fight, a good exhibition,\" Pacquiao said.\n\nIn a strange scenario before the bout, a man who was supposed to bring Mayweather flowers -- a combat sports tradition in Japan -- threw the bouquet down on the canvas rather than handing it to Mayweather.\n\nMayweather came to the ring wearing a jersey with the number 50 on it, signifying his 50-0 pro record.\n\nIn December 2019, Mayweather finished Japanese kickboxing prodigy Tenshin Nasukawa in the first round after three knockdowns. Nasukawa competes at around 120 pounds. Asakura was much closer to Mayweather's weight, perhaps a bit bigger, on Saturday, though there was no official contracted weight.\n\nIn an undercard bout to the Mayweather vs. Asakura headliner, Mayweather's bodyguard Ray \"Jizzy Mack\" Sadeghi was knocked out in a boxing match by 135-pound kickboxer Kouzi. There was no weigh-in, but Sadeghi was significantly larger than Kouzi in the ring.\n\nMayweather had an exhibition bout against Don Moore in May in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Mayweather has said he will participate in another such matchup in the Middle East before the end of the year, though no opponent has been named.",
    "Japan's treatment of Ukrainians contrasts with its prior refugee policy": "Japan's treatment of Ukrainians contrasts with its prior refugee policy\n\nJapan has taken in hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing Russia. Japan's embrace of the Ukrainians contrasts with the less than 1% of refugees from other nations that Tokyo has recently accepted.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nMillions of Ukrainians fled their country once Russia invaded. A small number of them are living in Japan. Japan's embrace of the Ukrainians contrasts with less than 1% of refugees from other nations that Tokyo has recently accepted. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Recently arrived Ukrainians are learning basic Japanese to help them navigate life in a new country. Around 1,800 have fled the war and come to Japan, and around 70 have settled in the port city of Yokohama. Among them is 29-year-old Sergei Litvinov, a trained chef. He says his love of Japanese culture drew him here.\n\nSERGEI LITVINOV: Especially its music, rock music of Japan. Yes, I'm listening after 16 years old.\n\nKUHN: There's been an outpouring of sympathy for the Ukrainians in Japan. The government has given them residency and work permits for up to a year, and Yokohama is providing temporary housing, food and living expenses. Japan calls them evacuees, not refugees, and expects them to return to Ukraine after the war. Litvinov, though, says he likes it here and would like to stay on.\n\nLITVINOV: So my dream has come true, but I'm not happy because it's a horrible story in Ukraine.\n\nKUHN: The Ukrainians are an exception. Japan granted refugee status to just 74 applicants last year, the highest number ever. Japan has long considered itself not a nation of immigrants but of one ethnic group and one culture. Refugees applying for asylum in Japan have to demonstrate they face persecution at home. That's a heavy burden, as Heydar Safari Diman knows. He fled persecution in Iran. He's now been in Japan for more than 30 years. But authorities have repeatedly rejected his bids for refugee status. They've detained him a total of more than four years in what he says were hellish conditions. He speaks fluent Japanese.\n\nHEYDAR SAFARI DIMAN: (Through interpreter) I like Japan and Japanese people, but I hate the ones in the detention center. How could they bully us like that? What did we do? We are refugees. I have no criminal record.\n\nKUHN: In 2019, Safari Diman was one of about a hundred detainees who went on hunger strikes to protest their detention. Safari Diman says he sank into deep depression.\n\nSAFARI DIMAN: (Through interpreter) You need a lot of courage to commit suicide. It's very difficult to kill yourself in there. And I did not have that courage.\n\nKUHN: Tokyo-based attorney Chie Komai represents Safari Diman. She took his case to the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2019. She argued that her client's detention was arbitrary because immigration authorities can detain foreigners indefinitely without any judicial review. The U.N. agreed with her.\n\nCHIE KOMAI: (Through interpreter) They made it clear that the Japanese immigration detention system is in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nKUHN: The Japanese government rejected the U.N.'s criticism, but they did not dispute the details of Safari Diman's case, and he hasn't been detained since. Safari Diman says he doesn't expect the sort of benefits the Ukrainians are getting.\n\nSAFARI DIMAN: (Through interpreter) I'm not asking for Japanese taxpayers to support me. If authorities recognize me as a refugee, I will work and pay taxes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKUHN: Back in Yokohama, the Ukrainians work on their Japanese. It could come in handy, as they could be here for the long haul. The Japanese government is reportedly planning to extend their benefits. Kazuhiro Suzuki is a Yokohama city official who runs programs helping the Ukrainians. He says he's aware that foreigners in Japan from other conflict zones aren't as lucky.\n\nKAZUHIRO SUZUKI: (Through interpreter) We've only been supporting the Ukrainian evacuees, while the situation of refugees from other countries hasn't changed. Every day we keep working, this discrepancy bothers us.\n\nKUHN: The war in Ukraine and the arrival of refugees has helped to focus attention on a social problem that many in Japan were only dimly aware of. Some of the refugees' supporters are hopeful that this will push Japan's government to treat all people fleeing war and persecution more leniently.\n\nAnthony Kuhn, NPR News, Yokohama, Japan.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "The Return Of Japanese Visitors May Be Just In Time To Save Hawaii's Economy": "",
    "Japan: Submission to the UN Human Rights Committee": "This submission aims to contribute to the Human Rights Committee’s (“the Committee”) upcoming review of Japan’s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR or “the Covenant”). It focuses on the abuse of children’s rights by education technologies (EdTech) endorsed by the Japanese government for online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, the transgender legal recognition process, the death penalty and criminal justice, and child abuse in sport. It is submitted to the Human Rights Committee in advance of its review of Japan at the Committee’s 136th session.\n\nChildren’s Rights Abuses by Government-Endorsed Online Learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic (articles 17, 18, and 19)\n\nIn a global investigation of education technology (EdTech) products endorsed by the world’s most populous countries for children’s education during the Covid-19 pandemic, Human Rights Watch found that the Japanese government violated children’s right to privacy and other rights.[1]\n\nOf the EdTech products that were recommended by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) on March 2, 2020, Human Rights Watch randomly selected for analysis ten EdTech products that would serve as an illustrative sample of MEXT’s decisions.[2] These were Asahi Shimbun, Cisco Webex, eboard, Flying ClassRoom, Happy Lilac, LINE, NHK for School, schoolTakt, Study Sapuri, and Z-Kai.[3] Of these ten products, two were mobile applications (“apps”), six were websites, and two were available in both formats.\n\nOur analysis found that nine out of ten of these EdTech products surveilled or had the capacity to surveil children online, outside school hours, and deep into their private lives. Built by private companies, these EdTech products installed invasive tracking technologies on children’s devices that harvested data on who children are, where children are, who their family and friends are, and what kind of device their family could afford for them to use.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also found that seven of these EdTech products transmitted children’s personal data to advertising technology (AdTech) companies, and two products had the capability to do so.\n\nFinding Out Who Children Are\n\nThree EdTech products authorized by MEXT for children’s use had the capability to collect their users’ Android Advertising IDs, allowing them to tag, collectively, an estimated 1.5 million users and uniquely identify their devices for the sole purpose of advertising to them.[4] Another two EdTech products digitally fingerprinted children using invasive techniques that were impossible to avoid or protect against without throwing the device away.[5]\n\nThese identifiers enabled companies to infer the interests and characteristics of individual children for commercial purposes. Every time a child connects to the internet and comes into contact with tracking technology, any information collected about that child is tied back to the identifier associated with them by that company, resulting in a comprehensive profile over time. Data tied together in this way do not need a real name to be able to target a real child or person.\n\nNeither the government nor these five EdTech companies disclosed their use of these tracking techniques. Human Rights Watch finds that these tracking techniques are neither proportionate nor necessary for these products to function, or to deliver educational content to children. Their use on children in an educational setting arbitrarily interferes with children’s right to privacy.\n\nTracking Where Children Are\n\nInformation about a child’s physical location also reveals powerfully intimate details about their life far beyond their coordinates. Once collected, these data points can reveal sensitive information such as where a child lives and where they go to school; even without names or other obviously identifiable information, it is startlingly easy to identify real children and people without their awareness and consent.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that two apps recommended by MEXT for children’s learning had the ability to collect precise location data, or GPS coordinates, that can identify a user’s exact location to within 4.9 meters.[6] Both apps also had the ability to collect the time of the device’s current location, as well as the last known location of the device—revealing exactly where a user is, where they were before that, and how long they stayed at each place.\n\nAt a time when many children were remotely learning from home under Covid-19 lockdowns, the surveillance of their physical presence through location data likely revealed addresses and places most significant to them.\n\nTracking Who Children Know\n\nTwo apps recommended by MEXT for children’s use had the ability to collect information about their users’ friends, family, and other acquaintances by accessing the contacts list saved on users’ phones.[7] This allowed these apps to learn personal details about these contacts, including any saved names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, relationships, and profile photos. Human Rights Watch found that this data was neither necessary for these apps to function, nor provided educational benefit to children.\n\nWhen details about the personal relationships of a child are collected without consent or awareness by the child or by the family member or friend in question, it is an arbitrary intrusion on the privacy of each of these individuals. For contacts, the right to privacy is affected by the “mere collection of personal data” in which they lose control over information, in addition to the risk of experiencing potential misuse of their personal data.[8]\n\nTracking What Children Do Inside and Outside the Classroom\n\nAd trackers and third-party cookies are generally used by AdTech companies to scrutinize a person’s every action and behavior, infer their characteristics and interests, and deliver customized ads and content that follow them around the internet.\n\nChildren in Japan were tracked at dizzying scale. Of the eight government-authorized EdTech websites reviewed by Human Rights Watch, seven collectively installed 120 ad trackers on children’s devices and browsers. These ad trackers identified and collected information about what children do within their virtual classrooms and sent their data to AdTech companies.\n\nFive websites collectively inserted 117 third-party cookies on children’s personal devices. These cookies followed children after they left these websites and across the internet, outside of school hours, and sent their whereabouts and activities to AdTech companies.\n\nNotably, Z-kai, an EdTech website endorsed by MEXT for all elementary, middle, and high school students in Japan to learn core subjects during Covid-19 school closures, deployed the highest number of ad trackers and third-party cookies among all the EdTech websites analyzed by Human Rights Watch in its global investigation. Within milliseconds of a child opening up Z-kai, 54 ad trackers and 76 third-party cookies began tracking the child’s behavior and transmitting this data to AdTech companies around the world.\n\nThis unnecessary, disproportionate data surveillance—the highest of any country reviewed by Human Rights Watch—enabled advertisers and other companies to use children’s data for commercial purposes, and exposed children to further risk of misuse and exploitation of their data. Their use on children in an educational setting unreasonably infringes upon children’s right to privacy.\n\nGovernment Failure to Protect\n\nNine out of the ten government-authorized EdTech products reviewed by Human Rights Watch engaged in data practices that unreasonably infringed on children’s rights or risked doing so. These nine products also sent or granted access to children’s personal data to AdTech companies that specialize in behavioral advertising or whose algorithms determine what children see online. In doing so, these companies not only distorted or risked distorting children’s online experiences, but also risked influencing their opinions and beliefs at a time in their lives when they are at high risk of manipulative interference.[9]\n\nThese nine EdTech products were marketed as free and provided to the Japanese government at no direct financial cost. In the process of endorsing these and promoting their wide adoption by schools, teachers, and students, MEXT offloaded the true costs of providing education online onto children, who were forced to pay for their learning with their rights to privacy, access to information, and freedom of thought.\n\nHuman Rights Watch did not find evidence that MEXT took measures to prevent or mitigate children’s rights abuses by companies, or that MEXT checked whether the EdTech products they were rapidly endorsing were safe for children to use. As a result, children whose families were able to afford access to the internet and connected devices, or who made hard sacrifices in order to do so, were exposed to the privacy practices of the EdTech products they were told or required to use during Covid-19 school closures.\n\nChildren, parents, and teachers were largely kept in the dark about these data surveillance practices. Neither the government, nor the nine EdTech companies, informed children and their parents of the data practices that risked or infringed on children’s rights. As these tracking technologies were invisible to the user, children had no reasonably practical way of knowing the existence and extent of these data practices, much less the impacts on their rights. By withholding critical information, the government and these companies impeded children’s access to justice and remedy.\n\nEven if children, parents, and teachers had known about these data practices, Human Rights Watch found that the data surveillance took place in virtual classrooms and educational settings where children could not reasonably object to such surveillance. These EdTech companies did not allow students to decline to be tracked; this monitoring happened secretly, without the child’s knowledge or consent. In most instances, it was impossible for children to opt out of such surveillance and data collection without opting out of compulsory education and giving up on formal learning during the pandemic.\n\nNHK for School\n\nNotably, NHK for School, developed by the public broadcaster, was the only one of the ten EdTech websites and apps endorsed by the government that protected their child users’ privacy by not installing any tracking technologies.[10] This demonstrates that it is possible for the Japanese government to uphold the obligations to protect and promote children’s rights by building and offering digital educational services to children that do not compromise their data and their privacy, and not resort to endorsing products that do violate these rights.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nDoes the government have plans to develop and enforce comprehensive child data protection laws?\n\nWhat recourse or remedy does the government provide, or is planning to provide, to children who have experienced infringements of their rights as a result of their use of these EdTech products and whose data remain at risk of misuse and exploitation?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nAdopt child-specific data protection laws that address the significant child rights impacts of the collection, processing, and use of children’s personal data. Where child data protection laws already exist, update and strengthen implementation to deliver a comprehensive child data protection framework that protects the best interests of the child in complex online environments, and ensures that companies respect children’s rights and are held accountable if they fail to do so.\n\nProvide remedy for children whose data were collected through their use of EdTech products. To do so: Conduct a data privacy audit of all EdTech websites and apps it has endorsed for children’s online learning. If the products fail this audit, rescind endorsement of these products, and immediately notify and guide affected schools, teachers, parents, and children to prevent further collection and misuse of children’s data. Require EdTech companies with failed data privacy audits to delete any children’s data collected during the pandemic. Require AdTech companies to identify and immediately delete any children’s data they received from EdTech companies during the pandemic.\n\nEnsure that any services that are endorsed or procured to deliver online education are safe for children. In coordination with data protection authorities and other relevant institutions: Require all companies providing educational services to children to identify, prevent, and mitigate negative impacts on children’s rights, including across their business relationships and global operations. Require child data protection impact assessments of any educational technology provider seeking public investment, procurement, or endorsement. Ensure that public and private educational institutions enter into written contracts with EdTech providers that include protections for children’s data. Define and provide special protections for categories of sensitive personal data that should never be collected from children in educational settings, such as precise geolocation data.\n\n\n\nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (articles 2, 26)\n\nJapan has no national law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Some municipal governments have such local laws. In October 2018, the Tokyo Municipal Government (TMG) passed an LGBT non-discrimination law, which requires the TMG and encourages private organizations such as companies, schools, and private groups to act to address discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In doing so, it became the first prefectural level non-discrimination law regarding sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn response to the national laws passed in May 2019 on workplace harassment, three ministries—the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology—issued ministerial regulations and formal notices requiring for the first time that corporations, local governments, and schools take actions to prevent harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the public outing of a person as LGBT.[11]\n\nLGBT groups in Japan launched a campaign for a national non-discrimination law in the lead-up to the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympics in 2021.[12] In January 2021, 116 Japanese and international groups sent a joint letter urging passage of such legislation to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.[13] In March 2021, the groups submitted a petition with 106,250 signatures from Japan and abroad to all Japanese political parties, including the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),[14] calling for the introduction of the Equality Act in the Diet.[15] Since then, over 40 corporations and other organizations from Japan and overseas have also endorsed the Equality Act.[16]\n\nIn response, the LDP announced that it would enact an LGBT law during the 2021 regular Diet session.[17] But the bill presented at the LDP’s Special Mission Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in April 2021 included no nondiscrimination protections and would only have required the government to “promote understanding of LGBT people.”[18]\n\nIn May 2021, leaders from the LDP and opposition parties agreed on a draft bill in which discrimination against LGBT individuals would be deemed unacceptable. While the parliamentary caucuses of all other political parties approved the proposed bill, the LDP parliamentary representatives failed to approve it. According to media reports, many LDP representatives opposed the bill.[19]\n\nDespite widespread national support and strong global pressure to pass such a law before the rescheduled 2020 Games, Japan failed to pass a national non-discrimination law at the end of the Diet session in June 2021.[20]\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat steps is the government taking to protect sexual and gender minorities against discrimination?\n\nDoes the government have plans to enact legislation to protect against discrimination nationally in line with its international human rights obligations? If so, on what timeline?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nPass a national non-discrimination law, specifying protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nTransgender Legal Recognition Process (articles 3, 16, 17, 23(2), and 26)\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented the persistent and discriminatory barriers transgender people face to change their legally recognized gender under the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Special Cases Act. Current processes to legally change one’s gender infringe on equal civil and political rights for all (article 3), the right to recognition for everyone before the law (article 16), the right to one’s privacy and family (article 17), the right of people of marriageable age to marry and to start a family (article 23(2)), and protection of the law of all persons without discrimination on any ground, including sex (article 26).\n\nThe current law has five requirements for a transgender person to be legally recognized according to their gender identity. They must be at least 18 years old, unmarried, not have any children under age 18, not have gonads or permanently lack functioning gonads, and have a physical form that is “endowed with genitalia that closely resemble the physical form of an alternative gender.” The procedure for changing one’s legally recognized gender requires sterilization surgery and a psychiatric diagnosis, which rests on an outdated and pejorative notion that a transgender identity is a “mental disorder.”\n\nWhile some trans people in Japan are willing to undergo the medical procedures listed in the law, many do not, and should not be required to do so. Further, the continuance of these medical requirements underpins extensive prejudice against trans people.\n\nGender non-conforming children lack access to legal recognition and suffer abuses as a result, such as in education settings. In the context of Japan’s education system, the state’s failure to accord legal recognition of transgender children’s gender identity contributes to discrimination and degrading treatment. Japan should recognize that it may be in the best interests of many transgender children to change their legal gender before they reach age 18.\n\nJapan’s requirement that all applicants for legal gender recognition be unmarried is effectively a mandatory divorce requirement for married transgender people who wish to be recognized. This is because Japan does not recognize same-sex marriages, which a gender transition would create.\n\nThe requirement that a transgender person not have any children under the age of 18 if they wish to secure legal recognition of their gender identity violates transgender people’s right to privacy and family life and the right to found a family, and discriminates on those grounds.\n\nThe surgery requirements force transgender people who want legal recognition to undergo lengthy, expensive, invasive, and irreversible medical procedures. It forces many would-be applicants—including those who would not otherwise choose to take these steps—to undergo physically transformative surgical interventions and undergo sterilization.\n\nIn a 2019 report documenting the barriers to legal gender recognition, Human Rights Watch interviewed 48 transgender people, as well as lawyers, health providers, and academics from 14 prefectures in Japan.[21] Some of the transgender people Human Rights Watch interviewed told us that they would not have chosen sterilization if they had had the option to have their gender legally recognized without doing so. Transgender people told Human Rights Watch that Japan’s law infringes on their rights. One transgender man said: “I don’t want to [have surgery], to be honest. However, I have to just because it is a requirement … I feel pressured to be operated on – so terrible.”[22]\n\nOver time, an increasing number of trans people in Japan have taken the legally prescribed steps and changed their legal gender. In 2020, 676 people were approved for legal gender change, making it a total of 10,301 people who have received the approval during the 16 years since the law came into force.[23] However, activists have said the law limits the number of people who are willing to undergo the full suite of medical interventions.[24]\n\nIn 2017, during its Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Japan pledged to revise the law.[25] But despite mounting domestic and international pressure, the government has failed to do so. In 2019 and 2021, Japan’s Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings that the law did not violate Japan’s constitution.[26] However, in the 2019 ruling, two of the justices recognized the need for reform.[27] “The suffering that [transgender people] face in terms of gender is also of concern to society that is supposed to embrace diversity in gender identity,” they wrote.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nDoes the government have plans to end the abusive and discriminatory requirements that serve as barriers for transgender people to have their gender legally recognized? If so, on what timeline?\n\nWhat steps is the government taking to ensure protection against discrimination for transgender people who cannot legally change their gender due to existing barriers?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nIntroduce legislation to amend the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Special Cases Act, removing the five criteria for changing legal gender, and replacing them with a self-declaration model that respects the rights of transgender individuals.\n\nEnsure that legal recognition of transgender people’s gender identity applies to all aspects of their lives.\n\nRecognize that it may be in the best interests of some transgender children to change their legal gender before the age of majority (age 18) and ensure that transgender children are not excluded from the possibility of applying for legal recognition of their gender identity.\n\nDeath Penalty and Criminal Justice (articles 6, 9, and 14)\n\nJapan executed one person on death row in July 2022.[28] Previously, Japan executed three people on death row in December 2021. In July 2022, there were 106 people on death row.[29] Anti-death penalty advocates have long raised concerns about death row inmates having inadequate access to legal counsel, being notified of their execution only on the day it takes place, and some being executed after their lawyers filed a request for retrial, among other issues.[30] In November 2019, two prisoners on death row sued the government, seeking compensation for the “extremely inhumane” same-day notices and executions.[31]\n\nHuman Rights Watch opposes the infliction of capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.\n\nJapan’s long overlooked “hostage” justice system, in which criminal suspects are held for long periods in harsh conditions to coerce a confession, received renewed attention after the high-profile arrest of former Renault and Nissan head Carlos Ghosn in November 2018. While Ghosn was detained for 108 days for financial misconduct allegations, he was granted bail quickly compared to other equivalent cases, apparently due to the international criticism. In December 2019, Ghosn fled Japan while on bail.[32] Ghosn’s defenders had alleged before his flight that the Japanese system abused his rights by using long pretrial detention and denial of bail to pressure him to confess, among other issues.[33]\n\nIn June 2019, a 2016 law came into force that requires video and audio recording of interrogations in a small segment of criminal cases, such as serious cases to be tried by the lay judge system. However, Japanese criminal procedure law continues to allow suspects to be detained for up to 23 days prior to prosecution without the possibility of release on bail and for investigators to deny legal counsel from being present during interrogations.\n\nInterviews by Human Rights Watch conducted in 2020 show that many victims of the “hostage” justice system have suffered greatly.[34] For example, in Tokyo, a tax accountant with cancer was charged with a bankruptcy law violation. His family told Human Rights Watch that his health worsened in custody as the jail authorities refused to give him the medication prescribed by his doctor or allow the doctor to assess his health. He was kept in custody for 156 days, during which his bail request on medical grounds was rejected at least seven times. The man kept a meticulous diary of the worsening of his medical condition. He died of cancer waiting for the decision on his appeal.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat steps has the government taken to respect the rights of detainees on death row, including their right to adequate legal counsel?\n\nWhy does the government provide little to no advance notice of execution for detainees on death row, and is the government open to changing this practice?\n\nWhat steps has the government taken to respect the rights of detainees, including their right to medical treatment?\n\nWhat plans does the government have to review criminal justice procedures and implement reforms, and on what timeline?\n\nWhat steps has the government taken, and what plans does the government have, to make sure that detainees are not pressured to confess to be released and that lawyers can be present during interrogations?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nEnd the use of capital punishment in all circumstances.\n\nUntil capital punishment is abolished, ensure detainees on death row have access to adequate legal counsel and advanced notice of their execution date.\n\nCommit to reforming the criminal justice system in a human-rights respecting manner, including by limiting the period detainees are held in pretrial detention, allowing for the possibility of release on bail as soon as they are detained, and making sure that investigators allow legal counsel to be present during interrogations and that detainees are not pressured to confess to get released.\n\nEnsure rights of detainees are respected, including their right to access medical treatment.\n\nChild Abuse in Sport (article 7)\n\nA 2020 Human Rights Watch report documented Japan’s history of corporal punishment in sport—known as taibatsu in Japanese—and finds child abuse in sports training throughout Japanese schools, federations, and elite sports.[35] Human Rights Watch documented experiences of more than 800 former child athletes—more than 50 from in-person interviews, and 757 from an online survey—including Olympians and Paralympians. The survey had participants from 45 of the 47 Japanese prefectures, and 50 sports.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that Japanese athletes from at least 50 different sports reported abuses that included being punched in the face, kicked, beaten with objects like bats or bamboo kendo sticks, being deprived of water, choked, whipped with whistles or racquets, and being sexually abused and harassed. Based on the children we interviewed, and media reports we reviewed, Human Rights Watch documented the results of abuse, including depression, suicide, physical disabilities, and lifelong trauma. One athlete Human Rights Watch interviewed said: “I was hit so many times, I can’t count ... we were all called to the coach and I was hit in the face in front of everyone. I was bleeding, but he did not stop hitting me. I did say that my nose was bleeding, but he did not stop.”[36]\n\nPublic outrage led to important reforms in 2013, such as setting up hotlines to report abuse. However, Human Rights Watch found that these reforms are optional “guidelines” instead of rules, that progress has been uneven and unmonitored, and that there is no mandatory reporting of abuse complaints or statistics.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that child abuse in sport remains accepted and normalized in many parts of society, and that it is difficult for young athletes to file complaints against a powerful coach or official. Schools and federations rarely punish abusive coaches, often allowing them to continue coaching.\n\nIn some cases, abuse of child athletes has directly resulted in life-long injury or death. For example, in 2004, a 15-year-old boy from Yokohama had skipped judo practice; his coach found him and made him spar one-on-one. According to the boy’s mother, the coach choked her son until he lost consciousness, and then hit him to wake him up and choked him again when he briefly regained consciousness. The injury caused internal bleeding in the boy’s brain, resulting in life-long cognitive impairment.[37]\n\nIn reference to another case, Keiko Kobayashi, former director of Japan Judo Accident Victims Association, said: “My son became severely disabled from taibatsu during judo training. His case is only the tip of the iceberg.”[38]\n\nBetween 1983 and 2016, there were at least 121 individuals who died while participating in school judo in Japan.[39] It is unknown how many of these cases involved abuse by coaches, but the rate of judo deaths in Japan has “no parallel” in other developed nations.[40]\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat efforts has the government engaged in to ensure child athletes of abuse are able to speak up and report abuses?\n\nHas the government investigated any reports of child abuse in sport, and what has been the outcome of the investigation?\n\nWhat support or remedy has the government provided to child athletes of abuse?\n\nWill the government follow other governments to set up an independent Japan Center for Safe Sport, to allow reporting of abuses, remedy for athletes, and get abusive coaches who use taibatsu out of sport?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nAmend the Basic Act on Sport or introduce a new law to explicitly: Ban all forms of abuse by coaches against child athletes in organized sport; Delineate the rights of athletes, including the right to participate in sport free of abuse; Mandate training for all coaches of child athletes; and Mandate that any adult who becomes aware of child athlete abuse must report it.\n\nAmend the Child Abuse Prevention Law to explicitly expand the existing definition of child abuse in article 2 so that it includes child abuse in organized sport.\n\nEstablish a Japan Center for Safe Sport, an independent administrative body tasked with addressing child abuse in Japanese sport. Among sports organizations, this independent body would have centralized administrative authority to address any allegation of child athlete abuse within organized sport in Japan. Responsibilities should include: Maintain standards to prevent and protect against child athlete abuse, and ensure full compliance with those standards by Japanese sports organizations; Receive complaints or reports of child athlete abuse directly, as well as via a centralized reporting system into which all existing reporting mechanisms would flow; Conduct investigations into all cases of child athlete abuse in organized sport, issue proportionate sanctions against coaches—such as revoking their coaching license, suspending or banning them from coaching—and provide an appeal system for sanctioned coaches; Refer abuse cases to law enforcement for criminal investigation, where appropriate; Track and report data on the number of allegations, and the outcomes of investigations; Create a public registry of coaches who are sanctioned; Ensure free, ongoing, professional psychological support services for child athletes who have experienced abuse; Establish training standards for all coaches of child athletes; and Conduct education and awareness campaigns about the existence of this independent body, and the resources it provides.\n\n"
