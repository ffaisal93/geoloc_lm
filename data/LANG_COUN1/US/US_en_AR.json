    "All tire-manufacturing plants in Argentina close down": "All tire-manufacturing plants in Argentina close down\n\n26th Monday, September 2022 - 10:16 UTC Full article\n\nThe automotive industry might follow suit shortly without the input\n\nArgentina has ceased to be a tire-manufacturing country as labor conflicts resulted in the closing of all three plants nationwide, although some of these measures have been reported to be a temporary issue.\n\nPirelli stopped production this weekend due to the lack of inputs because of union blockades dating back to over 100 days, joining Fate and Bridgestone. Unable to bring in nitrogen trucks Friday with such an essential input, the company Saturday closed down operations until further notice.\n\nBefore the union conflict, the plant had been operating at 50% of its capacity due to labor protests that kept part of the staff out of the premises.\n\nThese developments endanger the automotive industry, particularly companies that produce pickup trucks, which rely on local supply and may now too need to stop production. Nissan and Renault have already stopped production of the Frontier and Alaskan models in Córdoba.\n\nThe Sindicato Único de Trabajadores del Neumático Argentino (SUTNA), run by the left-wing Partido Obrero, has threatened to further radicalize the conflict, according to Ámbito. In the meantime, a nationwide shortage of tires has led to a huge increase in the price of the stock still available and also to the growth of smuggling.\n\nBridgestone announced the temporary closure of its operations in Argentina. As is publicly known, Bridgestone continues to face protracted union negotiations with Sutna in the framework of the 2021/2022 union review. At Bridgestone, the well-being and safety of our employees are our most important values and, as such, we are committed to providing a safe workplace for every employee, a statement from the company read.\n\nAs a result of the ongoing conflict on September 23, Bridgestone has decided to temporarily close all operations in Argentina to protect each person who is part of our team and to guarantee the integrity of our property, the document went on.\n\nWhile it has not yet been determined when we will be able to resume operations, we will do so when we can guarantee the safety of all collaborators, it also noted.\n\nBridgestone will continue to work with the commitment to overcome this situation that currently puts the supply of tires in the market at risk. The company currently employs some 1,600 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Union leaders have camped at the doorsteps of the Labor Ministry in Buenos Aires to press for a solution to the crisis. workers have deemed the salary increases offered by employers as insignificant in the country's current inflation scenario.\n\nLiberal Deputy José Luis Espert said it was necessary to apply a jail or bullet policy to the workers and union representatives who carry out protests. Espert, of Javier Milei's political movement, was heavily criticized for his remarks.\n\nWhile Fate said unions should be stripped of their legal status to close companies, the company still maintained it did share Espert's statements.",

    "Messi's best Argentina side? Super-charged Brazil? South America's World Cup-bound teams in action": "South America's four World Cup-bound squads -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador -- were in all in action on Friday as they prepare for Qatar. While Brazil and Argentina had looked the part of tournament favourites, Uruguay and Ecuador continue to be works in progress.\n\nTaking into account their performances, we answer a key question for each CONMEBOL side as their preparation for the game's biggest stage continues.\n\nAre we prepared for a super-attacking Brazil?\n\nBrazil coach Tite already has a Plan A and a Plan B -- and in an exhilarating first half against Ghana in Le Havre, France, he unleashed an ultra-attacking Plan C, which probably worked even better than he had hoped.\n\nOver the past year, his team have grown accustomed to playing with two wingers -- usually Raphinha on the right and Vinicius Junior on the left, with Neymar floating as a false nine, linking up with attacking midfielder Lucas Paqueta. The variation has been to include Richarlison as a centre forward, dropping one of the wingers and using Paqueta cutting in from one of the flanks.\n\nBut what if there was a way to have both a centre forward and two wingers? Now there is. This time Paqueta fills the role of Fred, dropping deeper to play from central midfield. With him to the right of Casemiro and Neymar to the left, there is room for a front three ahead of them. It means that Paqueta has to put in a defensive shift, but so does everyone. As soon as they lose possession, Brazil press collectively to win it back.\n\nGhana found it hard to work up any rhythm, and the few times they managed to beat the press, the imperious Marquinhos was on hand to use his pace and awareness to snuff out the danger. Brazil were on their way to the 3-0 win -- and could have been more -- at the end of a first half that, against respectable opponents, was almost absurdly one-sided. Brazil's collection of attacking talent passed holes in Ghana's 4-1-4-1 formation, and front-loading the team did not leave the team looking vulnerable.\n\nThis new formation will not work for all situations against all opponents. But it is an option that Brazil have added to their repertoire -- one that will surely send a shiver down their World Cup rivals.\n\nIs this Messi's best Argentina side?\n\nOn its own, Argentina's 3-0 win over this Honduras side hardly qualifies anyone for greatness. But 34 games unbeaten tells its own story. And what was striking was the utterly predictable nature of the Argentine triumph in Miami.\n\nHonduras brought back memories of an outclassed boxer coming up against Muhammad Ali in his prime. They never came close to laying a glove on Argentina, while all night their heads were being snapped back as, patiently and with purpose, Argentina jabbed away, pulling them out of position and setting them up for the big punch. Some might recall the 2006 side, eliminated on penalties by Germany in the quarterfinal, while a teenage Lionel Messi sat on the substitutes bench, unable to do anything about it.\n\nThat team revolved around playmaker Juan Román Riquelme. The focus of this team is a little higher up the field. With that midfield trio -- Leandro Paredes playing the first pass forward with quality, Rodrigo De Paul adding drive and changes of rhythm and Giovani Lo Celso stroking the ball around with rare precision -- Messi is brought into the game closer to the opposing goal, in a zone of the field from where he can do something to unlock the opposing defence.\n\nFor much of his previous time in the national team, Argentina were a shambles. Plan A was to give the ball to Messi and hope. Plan B was to give the ball to Messi and hope. And there was no Plan C. Not now. This is a side with an almost hypnotic quality about its possession-based game -- they took the match away from Honduras in the first 15 minutes. It is a team that functions, and one which, in his fifth World Cup, might even give Messi his best chance of winning the competition.\n\nWill Diego Alonso's first loss unsettle Uruguay?\n\nSince taking over as Uruguay coach at the end of last year, Diego Alonso had only known victory, plus a goalless draw against the United States in a June friendly when he fielded a reserve side. He has now tasted defeat after his side lost 1-0 to Iran in Vienna on Friday. As he said after the game, there are no grounds for despair but he does have food for thought.\n\nAgainst an opponent who dropped back deep and looked for the counterattack, Uruguay defended well enough with a couple of centre-backs who were making their debuts -- an injury crisis in the position that got worse when Ronald Araujo limped off in the opening minute. There were clear advantages in fielding a pair of full-backs who could push forward -- it allowed the wide men in the 4-3-3 system to get into the penalty area. This was especially important for Darwin Nunez, whose lack of an effective left foot was a problem when he was out on that flank. Nunez is surely more of a threat as a centre forward, and if there is only space for one in the team the Alonso could have a big decision to take.\n\nLuis Suarez looked well short of his best and missed some of the team's clearest chances. Uruguay ended up playing 4-4-2 with both Nunez and Suarez -- a switch which, at the other end, may have cost them the game (Edinson Cavani is not with the squad as he settles in with new side Valencia). Uruguay played most of the match with a trio in the centre of midfield, Matias Vecino holding while Rodrigo Bentancur and Federico Valverde looked for space between the Iranian lines.\n\nFor the last 20 minutes, Vecino was sacrificed as Alonso changed his system -- and the only goal of the game soon followed, the move originating in the space that Vecino was no longer protecting. Uruguay are surely at their best with three in the middle, which does not make it easy for Alonso to squeeze in all of his attacking talent.\n\nWhere will Ecuador's goals come from in Qatar?\n\nCoaches are always pleased with clean sheets, so after three games without conceding in June, Ecuador boss Gustavo Alfaro could take some comfort from a 0-0 draw with Saudi Arabia in the Spanish town of Murcia. But the lack of goals at the other end was a disappointment to the region's sizeable Ecuadorian community and a cause for concern for the coach. True, his team have now gone four games without conceding -- although Japan on Tuesday promise to provide a stiffer test.\n\nBut in these four matches, Ecuador have only found the back of the net twice. There were times in qualification when Ecuador were a free scoring side, but the goals have dried up. Alfaro could perhaps take some comfort from the way that his men created chances in different ways against the Saudis -- thrusts of Gonzalo Plata from the right, crosses of Pervis Estupinan from the left, through aggressive pressing in midfield, from set pieces played into the box or long balls over the top of the defence.\n\nBut the team lacks a cutting edge. Ecuador 's all-time top scorer is the veteran Enner Valencia. He is probably happier cutting in from the left than operating through the middle, as he did in this game. And his goals tend to come in spurts. Alfaro has had a look at options in the centre forward position, but probably can do no better than the rangy Michael Estrada, the side's top scorer in qualification, who came off the bench against the Saudis but is surely the favourite to lead the line in Qatar. All but one of his six goals came in the first half of the qualifiers, and Ecuador need him to rediscover his best form.",
    "Argentina eyes $664 million for fighter jets": "SANTIAGO, Chile — Argentina’s government has told lawmakers that it plans to spend about $684 million to procure new fighter jets and build related infrastructure.\n\nThe information, provided last week in response to questions from the Defense Committee within the Deputies Chamber, came from the chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Juan Manzur, and the office of Defense Minister Jorge Taiana.\n\nThe budget, included in the current year’s Decree 88/22, calls for the allocation of $664 million to buy combat aircraft, plus an additional $20 million for the new infrastructure needed to support their operation.\n\nThe answers received by the Deputies Chamber defines the aircraft as “a multirole fighter jet fitted with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an in-flight refueling system compatible with the tanker aircraft currently in the inventory of the Argentine Air Force, a tactical data link and an electronic warfare defensive suite.”\n\nAircraft with an open-architecture design would be required to integrate weapons and systems of any origin, but legal requirements demand that no British-made or -designed system, subsystem or component may exist in the purchased aircraft. The ban aims to mitigate pressure from the United Kingdom, which, since the Falklands war in 1982, has limited or banned the supply of spare parts and material for military hardware to Argentina.\n\nThe U.K. effort has hindered maintenance and the operational capacity of platforms and weapons in Argentina’s inventory, and in recent years played against the South American nation’s options to buy secondhand Dassault Mirage F1, Saab Gripen and Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 jets.\n\nThe answers sent to lawmakers also mention the aircraft types already assessed and under consideration as potential solutions, including the JF-17, which is jointly produced by China and Pakistan; the F-16, made by American firm Lockheed Martin; the Tejas, by India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.; and the Russian Mikoyan MiG-35.\n\nThe Tejas could prove cost-effective, but its original radar is partly of British origin, its in-flight refueling system is of British design and its ejection seat comes from British company Martin-Baker. While the radar could be replaced, swapping out the in-flight refueling system would be more complex, as it might require structural intervention. And replacing the ejection seat would require an expensive redesign of the cabin.\n\nA senior military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid workplace retaliation, said of the four aircraft listed by the government that it’s unlikely Argentina will choose the MiG-35 because of “political and logistical” reasons. The source felt similarly about the Tejas “because to replace components that can be vetoed by the British would be very expensive, beyond what the Argentine government is willing and can spend.”\n\n“The Argentine Air Force would rather prefer the [Lockheed Martin] F-16, but the U.S. government does not help with it, as it is only willing to authorize a sale under very restrictive conditions,” the officer told Defense News.\n\n“An Argentine request for allowance to integrate Rafael’s Derby BVR missile, as well as other Israeli weapons and systems, in the F-16 was made around a month ago,” the officer added. “No answer has come from Washington, and the silence sounds like a no here in Buenos Aires. Many here see these objections to the sale of AMRAAM and the integration of Israeli weapons as a product of British pressure or influence on the U.S. authorities.\n\n“All of this plays in the favor of the procurement of the Chinese JF-17/FC-1 fighter jet, a machine that has no British components or parts, not even a screw.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israel Aerospace Industries is launching a new campaign in Buenos Aires to promote the option of buying refurbished, upgraded Kfir jets.\n\nRetired Argentine Army Col. Guillermo Lafferriere, now a Buenos Aires-based independent defense analyst, is skeptical about Argentina’s intentions and commitment to procure a new combat jet.\n\n“They can hold long negotiations, can do several trips abroad to see offers, can even sign letters of intention short of contracts. [But] they have also powers to change the destination of approved budgets, so can take the funds for something else,” he told Defense News. “The people today in office in the government spent decades describing the military as criminals, as well as neglecting the armed forces while saying they are an unnecessary waste. Their voters believe that, and will get enraged if they now start spending in military hardware and getting international loans for it, even if it is a small amount like this for combat aircraft.”\n\nJosé Higuera is the South America correspondent for Defense News, covering South American and Latin American affairs.",

Fernández de Kirchner currently faces up to 12 years in prison and a lifetime ban from holding public office for allegedly directing construction contracts to a personal contact as part of the corruption scandal “La Causa Vialidad” (The Road Case). Meanwhile, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of the war in Ukraine, inflation in July soared 70 percent over 2021, with some economists predicting that number will reach 90 percent by the end of the year. These numbers are staggering even for a country that has grown accustomed to economic upheaval in recent decades. As a result, the center-left Frente de Todos has seen its approval numbers plummet: One recent poll indicates it has the support of less than 20 percent of the population.\n\nCecilia, a 38-year-old lecturer on international political economy who was among the masses in the capital, asked not to provide her last name, later saying she was “scared” that an extreme right-wing movement may be on the rise in Argentina. “I’m not a Kirchnerista”—a supporter of the vice president or her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, who served as president of Argentina from 2003 to 2007—“but I still think it’s important to be here,” she said. “This is not an outlier. This is the consequence of a global process of polarization brought on by economic distress.”\n\nFernández de Kirchner has called La Causa Vialidad a “media judicial firing squad.” Whether she has been unjustly persecuted depends almost entirely on one’s political orientation, as the former president and first lady remains perhaps the country’s most polarizing figure. Regardless, these kinds of investigations raise pressing questions about how judiciaries in Latin America often embolden the forces of reaction. And as cases like Vialidad in Argentina and the sweeping criminal probe known as Operation Car Wash in Brazil make clear, the consequences can be far-reaching and unexpected.\n\nThe latest charges against Fernández de Kirchner date back to the early aughts. According to a federal prosecutor, the then-senator for Santa Cruz began directing state funds to a close friend and associate via public works contracts. Nearly half of those contracts were never completed, and the money was allegedly routed through a shell company over a 12-year period. In 2019, a federal court sentenced one of Fernández de Kirchner’s co-defendants and former ministers, José Lopez, to six years in prison for stashing $9 million and an automatic weapon in a Buenos Aires convent.\n\nShortly after oral arguments in Fernández de Kirchner’s case began in August, Presidents Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Gustavo Petro of Colombia, and Luis Arce of Bolivia issued a joint statement with Argentina’s President Alberto Fernández (no relation to the vice president) denouncing her “unjustifiable judicial persecution.” This statement followed a separate missive from the Fernández government earlier that month deriding the judiciary’s use of “lawfare”—a legal means of persecution by which the courts can delegitimize a politician and subvert the will of the people.\n\nIn Argentina, however, lawfare is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n“It’s important to remember that this is not the first case of corruption involving the administrations of Nestor and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ,” said Ignacio Labaqui, a professor of Latin American politics and theory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. “I can’t speak to the case against her; that’s for the judges to decide. But she has the ability to appeal to higher courts, including the Supreme Court.”\n\nFernández de Kirchner is no stranger to scandal, as Labaqui notes. In addition to Vialidad, the Peronist firebrand faces charges stemming from a separate investigation known as “La Causa de los Cuadernos” (The Notebook Case). While the courts dismissed two charges against her in 2019 and another in 2021, the Cuadernos probe, which centers around alleged bribes paid to public officials in both Kirchner administrations, is expected to go to trial. But since then-President Fernández de Kirchner’s failed attempt to reform the justice system in 2013, the motivations of the judiciary in pursuing these probes remain murky.\n\n“That was really the opening salvo in what has become an open war [on Cristina Fernández de Kirchner],” said María Esperanza Casullo, a political scientist and professor at the National University of Río Negro. “Anti-corruption probes have evolved into a tool to be wielded against leftist or national popular governments, and I don’t think there’s a lot of controversy in saying this. Maybe there’s compelling evidence against Kirchner in this trial, but if you look at the totality of these cases, it’s hard to escape the notion that there’s a wider political intention here.”\n\nNeither are the circumstances surrounding the Vialidad and Cuadernos probes unique to Argentina. In 2014, a money laundering investigation in Curitiba, Brazil, that was later dubbed Operação Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) eventually came to enmesh broad swaths of the country’s political establishment, including members of the center-left Workers’ Party and the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, along with officials at the state-owned oil company Petrobras.\n\nMore significantly, Operation Car Wash led to the trial and subsequent conviction of former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on charges that he offered public works contracts in exchange for a beachfront apartment in the small coastal city of Guarujá. That conviction was ultimately voided, but not before Lula was prevented from running for office in 2018, paving the way for the far-right Jair Bolsonaro’s victory. (Sergio Moro, the federal judge who spearheaded the investigation, received a post in the Bolsonaro administration, while Lula was sent to prison.)\n\n“Argentina and Brazil are similar in the sense that, like most Latin American democracies, corruption is part of how the game is played,” said Eduardo Mello, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at the Fundação Getulio Vargas. “It’s not a left or a right or a center thing. Corruption is integral to the political system. These kinds of probes happen under all presidents, but they tend to move forward when an administration is deeply unpopular.”\n\n“It’s not that lawfare doesn’t exist,” he added. “It’s that it doesn’t have an explicit political orientation.”\n\nRecent history would appear to bear out Mello’s thesis. Although Lula was not in office at the outset of Operation Car Wash, the investigation gained momentum as the economy contracted under his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Similarly, the case against Fernández de Kirchner has advanced during a Fernández administration buckling beneath rampant inflation and several global catastrophes. Whereas Lula was disqualified from the 2018 election in Brazil, Fernández de Kirchner would be allowed to hold public office until she has exhausted the appeals process. Still, it seems inevitable that the trial and others like it will tarnish the public’s perception of the vice president, even if the full extent of the damage may prove difficult to assess. In the lower house of the Argentine Congress, at least one member of the opposition, Francisco Sánchez, has called for Fernández de Kirchner to receive the death penalty—a call that he has since retracted. Others have even intimated that the assassination attempt was staged.\n\n“What we’re seeing is an asymmetric radicalization in Argentina, with a far right confronting a more moderate left,” said Ernesto Semán, a political scientist and Latin American historian at the University of Bergen in Norway. “The right is [embracing] more violent and vitriolic rhetoric against individual leaders but also against the very idea of populism, which it treats as intrinsically criminal or corrupt. All of these elements come together in this latest assassination attempt.”\n\nThis month, police have arrested four people, including the apparent would-be assassin Sabag Montiel’s 23-year-old girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, for their alleged roles in the plot. An investigation into their possible ties to far-right organizations is ongoing, and the probe has already been marred by a possible breakdown in the chain of custody, but a few things about the alleged gunman are known: He bears a neo-Nazi tattoo on his elbow, and he’s a virulent anti-Kirchnerist who has openly railed against her political movement’s efforts to expand social benefits for the poor. In the aftermath of the botched assassination, authorities in the nearby city of La Plata also raided the so-called Kyle Rittenhouse Cultural Center—named for the teenager who shot and killed two Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin—after one of its patrons praised Sabag Montiel on Facebook.\n\n“There might be 150 people in Argentina who know who Kyle Rittenhouse is,” Casullo, the political scientist, said. “What’s interesting to me is how this global flow of [right-wing] memes and information combines with elements of each country. In Argentina, it’s anti-Kirchnerism. In Brazil or Chile, maybe it’s something else.”\n\nSince the fall of the military junta in 1983, Argentine democracy has proved remarkably resilient, withstanding multiple political and economic crises. Yet if Brazil’s descent into authoritarianism offers any kind of instruction, it’s that nothing is guaranteed.\n\n“We have a lot of problems in Argentina, but one that we didn’t have was the fear that someone could be hurt while speaking in public,” Casullo added. “The ability to speak face-to-face with the people is a very important part of doing politics in the country, especially for Peronists. If that were to change, it would be incredibly corrosive.”\n\nOn the morning of the march, Nora Cortiñas, another co-founder of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, issued a warning to Radio Provincia. “It’s not possible to tolerate this hatred, nor this poison that is released by the right,” she said. That rage “will keep increasing between now and 2023.”",

    "In Argentina, Returning the Country’s Remote Landscapes to Their Wildest States": "An hour before sunset, the Iberá Wetlands rustle to life as if cued by a conductor. Capybaras—large anvil-headed rodents—snuffle through the grass, raucous lapwings crisscross the sky, and three tawny, web-footed marsh deer wade along the edge of the swamp, which only two decades earlier had been a lifeless cattle watering hole.\n\nAs I amble by on horseback, our guide, Mingo Gonzalez, who names a few of Iberá's 370 bird species along the path—tiger heron, bare-faced ibis, strange-tailed tyrant—admits he wasn't all that well-versed in wildlife as a gaucho who grew up in the nearby village of Colonia Carlos Pellegrini. Back then, nature wasn't so much revered as ignored—or feared. Previous generations used to hunt jaguars to protect their cattle, selling the skins to fur traders. Although the big cat symbolized strength among the Indigenous Guarani of Corrientes province, the last one was seen here in the 1950s.\n\nRead more about the Future of Travel here.\n\nA garza mora, or cocoi heron, a bird endemic to the lowlands of Argentina Alistair Taylor-Young\n\nWe dismount in a savanna, where we find that staff at our lodge, Rincón del Socorro, have set a table with bottles of Argentine Malbec and a platter of local meats and cheeses. With the cracked yolk of the sun trickling behind a skeletal acacia tree, you could swear you were on safari in Africa—a resemblance that may be more than a wine-fueled illusion, given the Pangaea theory that South America and Africa once formed a supercontinent that broke apart more than 200 million years ago. From the small plane we flew in on from Posadas, we watched the landscape tip over from cattle ranches to a flat mosaic of floating grass islands that look strikingly like Botswana's Okavango Delta, though at 1.8 million acres, the Iberá Wetlands are only about half the size. More recently, Africa has inspired the most wide-reaching conservation effort ever in Argentina, a country notorious for the ravages of its beef industry. This has led to the restoration of massive swathes of land into flourishing, biodiverse ecosystems, sustained by income generated by tourism. This model—in which new wildernesses are secured with the creation of local jobs in ecotourism—is being adapted in South America on a huge scale by the foundations Rewilding Argentina and Rewilding Chile, heirs to the legacy of Tompkins Conservation. Starting in the 1990s, American husband-and-wife activists Doug and Kris Tompkins, a cofounder of The North Face and Patagonia's former CEO, respectively, started buying up strategic tracts of land to protect across the two countries; the NGOs spun off in 2015, after Doug was killed in a kayaking accident.\n\nBetween them, the two organizations are responsible for 15 million protected acres, which are now being donated in stages to the public as national parks. Meanwhile, the foundations are putting lodges and visitors centers in place, training rangers and guides, and reintroducing or stabilizing keystone species. Here in Argentina, where nature tourism is still in its infancy, Rewilding's long-term vision is to create a circuit of parks, from the Amazon-like El Impenetrable and Iberá Wetlands in the far north, where I've started my trip, to high-plateau Parque Patagonia, more than 1,000 miles south, where I'll head in a few days' time.",

    "Argentina’s socialist demons are coming for the West": "How did we arrive at the position where, throughout the Western world, political decisions to undermine the cheapest and most reliable energy sources are bringing about economic stagnation and possibly collapse?\n\nNotwithstanding evidence of this, why are policy settings intensifying the very measures that have created the breakdown?\n\nEurope is seeing record energy prices and the America’s renewable subsidy-oriented Inflation Reduction Act portends a following of suit.\n\nFor Australia, similar measures are intensified by law courts deciding that individual Indigenous voices, now extending to a need to protect ‘sea country’, can veto new gas and coal projects. The government wishes to strengthen these voices, which add to the damage of Mr Albanese’s ominous declaration that he ‘has a plan’ to combat climate change.\n\nThe vast majority of politicians have always seen themselves as improving on what they perceive to be the chaos of the market system. They would override the ‘dog-eat-dog’ market decisions on the best technologies, the location of facilities, the creation of skills, and the allocation of capital investment from a seductive ‘holistic’ perspective. Many also would argue that their own allocatory decisions would make savings by dispensing with so-called inessentials like advertising and the revenues siphoned off in profit.\n\nDisappointing outcomes from previous failures of such policies fail to dampen the enthusiasm of the next generation who chalk off those failures as being due to poor management, which they will avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, politicians are, with very few exceptions, simply the readers of political research and retailers of the voter preferences which that research reveals. In the main, they subscribe to the philosophy, ‘I got into this business because I wanted to make a difference’, as expressed in the words of a minister in the BBC series The Thick of It . The problem is that politicians most readily make a difference by awarding favours, righting wrongs, and addressing inequalities by drawing from funding they do not have. In doing so, they actually make things worse, not least because in raising funds and introducing regulations they create deterrents to invest and innovate, while at the same time imposing dead-weight public service paper-burden costs.\n\nConvictions that the present system of production and consumption is causing damaging climate change are superimposed on this tapestry. Irrespective of the impossibilities of coordinating the whole world to agree to a carbon constraint, the trivial effect of higher emissions on the climate and its measures’ adverse productivity imposts, this offers a powerful amalgam that combines supposed environmental externalities with the putative nectar of socialism.\n\nAs the strong political consensus in favour of market interventions to promote ‘clean energy’ demonstrates, most political activists who nominally reject socialism are not immune from those forces.\n\nBoris Johnson was lionised as a champion of small government conservative voices, but in power showed himself to be a market interventionist uxoriously besotted by the fashionable Climate Change agenda.\n\nAustralia is no stranger to such apostasy.\n\nDavid Kemp has been seen as an important contributor to libertarian free market thinking. But, as John Howard’s Environment Minister, his policies included coordinating with Labor state governments to expropriate thousands of landowners’ properties so they could be converted into non-productive ‘carbon sinks’ in order to meet the government’s Kyoto emission reduction goals. More recently, the Morrison Liberal government pandered to the environmental Woke by, for example, rejecting impartial advice to cease subsidising rooftop solar panels and in preventing gas exploration off the New South Wales coast.\n\nThe politicians who have successfully rolled back this socialistic interventionism are an exceedingly rare breed. None may be presently in power anywhere in the world.\n\nIn the past, we have seen giants like Thatcher, Reagan, Trump, Deng Xiaoping, and the architect of Germany’s economic miracle Ludwig Erhard create economic resurgences from the ashes of economies in seeming terminal decline. In all cases, the approach was to eliminate regulations and reduce spending. The closest we got to that in Australia was the early administration of Malcolm Fraser (with considerable help from a John Stone led Treasury) in reversing the statist politics of Gough Whitlam, and the doomed efforts of Tony Abbott who unfortunately presided over a parliamentary party so inept that they replaced him with Malcolm Turnbull, the epitome of green socialism.\n\nIt may be that disastrously high energy cost outcomes of the current policies will bring about a correction in Australia and elsewhere, but there is nothing pre-ordained about such a retreat from the precipice.\n\nArgentina offers a dismal precedent. Over the course of a century, the nation went from one of the richest to one of the poorest nations in the world.\n\nThe people elected governments some of which were nominally of the left and some nominally of the right. In all cases, the governments introduced regulatory restraints, spent money that they did not have, or raised funds with punitive taxes on the inevitably declining number of ‘haves’ to provide additional favours to their supporters. The upshot of lower living standards has, however, not resulted in a revolt against the policies causing that outcome. Rather, we see popular demonstrations demanding even more of the same policies.\n\nIt was Albert Einstein who said, ‘The true definition of madness is repeating the same action, over and over, hoping for a different result.’ Hopefully, sanity will be restored.",

    "Argentina vice president slams corruption case as ‘staged fable’": "Buenos Aires, Argentina – Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has delivered a fiery final word in her defence, calling corruption allegations against her a “staged fable designed to drag me by the hair to this trial”.\n\nIn closing arguments before a federal court on Friday, Argentina’s powerful vice president also linked the judicial proceedings to an assassination attempt on her earlier this month, and suggested that some of the people behind the September 1 attack have yet to be apprehended.\n\n“Until the first of September, I believed that this was all about stigmatising me, banning me, denigrating me, defaming me. But as of the first of September, I realised that there may be something else behind all this,” she said.\n\n“It’s like the judicial sphere is giving social licence so that anyone can think or do anything.”\n\nFriday’s hearing came just weeks after a man pointed a revolver at Fernandez de Kirchner’s head amid a crowd of supporters who had rallied outside her Buenos Aires home in a show of support amid the corruption case. The attacker pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire.\n\nThe assassination attempt drew widespread condemnation but it has had a negligible effect on the public’s opinion of Fernandez de Kirchner, with polls this month pegging her positive image rating at between 24 and 34 percent.\n\nDuring her address to the court, Fernandez de Kirchner made a point of calling the people now accused in the assassination attempt the “material authors” – saying that “no one can think that that group planned” or “were the intellectual authors” of the attack.\n\nThe accused gunman, Fernando Andre Sabag Montiel, 35, has been charged with attempted murder, along with his 23-year-old girlfriend Brenda Uliarte. Two other people have also been arrested.\n\nThe case\n\nFriday marked the last opportunity for Fernandez de Kirchner to defend herself before a panel of three judges in Buenos Aires.\n\nShe is charged with leading “an illicit organisation” and “aggravated fraudulent administration” in a case that covers a period between 2003 and 2015 during which she and her late husband, Nestor Kirchner, occupied the presidency of Argentina.\n\nProsecutors say that during her years at the helm, from 2007 to 2015, Fernandez de Kirchner illegally helped direct state funds into public roadworks contracts that were awarded to companies owned by an associate of the Kirchners in the southern province of Santa Cruz, which is their political stronghold.\n\nA total of 51 contracts were awarded to companies owned by Lazaro Baez, who is among 12 other people charged in the roadworks case. Baez was convicted of money laundering in a separate case last year.\n\n“When Nestor Kirchner took over the presidency of the nation, and later his wife … they installed and maintained within the national and provincial administration of Santa Cruz, one of the most extraordinary corruption matrixes that unfortunately and sadly ever existed in the country,” lead prosecutor Diego Luciani said in his remarks last month.\n\nEstimating that $926m was defrauded by the state, Luciani has asked the court to sentence Fernandez de Kirchner to 12 years in prison for her role in the alleged scheme and to impose a lifetime ban on her holding public office.\n\nThat triggered huge demonstrations in support of her outside her home, including the one during which the assassination attempt took place.\n\nPolitical implications\n\nIn court on Friday, Carlos Beraldi, Fernandez de Kirchner’s lawyer, went through the allegations made by prosecutors that he said are not backed up by the facts.\n\nUsing witness testimony from the trial, he refuted claims that road works were not completed, overpriced or delayed. He also said the cost of the alleged fraud was not a serious estimate. “Cristina Kirchner never issued any directive related to the works under investigation,” said Beraldi.\n\nFernandez de Kirchner said the prosecutors in this case should be investigated for the “incredible lies” that they propagated, adding that allegations that she headed up an illicit organisation are illogical and unconstitutional. “We were elected by the people. We can never be an illicit association,” she said.\n\nA ruling in the case could come as soon as December, or early next year, when Argentina will have presidential elections.\n\n“This case is important because of the political actors at play,” Argentinian political analyst Ricardo Rouvier told Al Jazeera, noting that Fernandez de Kirchner continues to be the leader of a political minority in Argentina that is nonetheless “very active”.\n\nThe implications for next year’s federal election are not yet clear, he added. “We’ll have to see what the outcome is.”",

    "Why 70% Inflation Is Just One of Argentina’s Problems": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nArgentina is facing some of the world’s highest inflation, with rates that have topped 70%. The government is on its third economy minister since July and President Alberto Fernandez’s leftist coalition looks permanently split. South America’s second-largest economy has almost no access to international capital, and it owes over $40 billion to the International Monetary Fund. Any bright spots? So far, a population hardened by decades of economic crisis has not turned to the kind of violent street protests that brought down the insolvent government of Sri Lanka. But the most likely paths forward all involve significant levels of pain.\n\n1. How serious is Argentina’s crisis?\n\nArgentina nosedived into an economic crisis in 2018 and it’s still far from fully recovered. Annual inflation has been above 50% about half the time since then, exacerbating three years of recession. Nearly 40% of Argentines live in poverty today, compared to about a quarter at the start of the crisis. Argentina has spent more time than almost any other nation in recession since the 1950s, according to the World Bank. Still, today’s price gains remain far from country’s last bout of hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. How did things get so bad?\n\nA currency crisis led to the peso losing half of its value against the dollar in 2018. The IMF responded by loaning a record $57 billion to the government led by then-President Mauricio Macri, but the deal failed to stabilize the economy. Fernandez’s election in 2019 sparked a massive selloff in government bonds that his government later defaulted on. Without access to credit following the default, Fernandez printed money during the pandemic to finance cash handouts and salary programs, which set the stage for inflation to surge higher.\n\n3. Where do things stand?\n\nIn March, the IMF and Fernandez negotiated a new deal with the IMF. The primary purpose from the government’s perspective is that it pushes out payments owed from the first program -- so long as Argentina complies with the deal. Although the original repayment schedule remains in place, the new deal disburses IMF money to Argentina in a timetable that refinances the original payments by at least four years. But the IMF doesn’t just give all the money at once. Argentina has to pass quarterly reviews where the government must show progress on key yardsticks, such as accumulating foreign reserves and cutting its fiscal deficit. If it doesn’t pass the so-called review, Argentina risks defaulting on the IMF loan, which would remove almost all remaining sources of international financing for the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Is Argentina at risk of running out of money?\n\nThe central bank is running low on net cash reserves, down to an estimated $2.1 billion as of last week, according to consulting firm Equilibra. Total reserves are at less than half the level they were in 2019. That’s raising the risk of a potential currency devaluation, which in the past has provoked social tension. The very expectation of a devaluation is causing more people to buy dollars, hold exports or speed up imports, exacerbating the government’s greenback drain. A gap between the official exchange rate and a smorgasbord of parallel rates has held above 100% for over a month, a level and stretch of time not seen since Argentina’s hyperinflation days. The gap creates perverse incentives, like buying stuff on a credit in dollars only to pay it down in pesos at a discount, that only put more pressure on the exchange rate.\n\n5. What’s the government’s plan?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, there hasn’t really been one, besides trying to meet the goals set in the IMF deal. Fernandez said in a 2020 Financial Times interview: “Frankly, I don’t believe in economic plans.” The most consistent theme of his policies have been a reliance on piecemeal steps to limit economic pain, such as temporary price freezes and a ban on firing workers. That’s one reason markets are hoping new Economy Minister Sergio Massa will at least implement some of the tough policies built into the IMF deal. A key test will be whether Massa can address energy subsidies that have largely protected Argentines from the soaring utility prices seen around the world.\n\n6. How does politics figure into this?\n\nAnalysts across the spectrum agree Argentina’s main issue is political, not economic. The infighting between President Fernandez and his powerful Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (who is unrelated), has created a leadership vacuum. Fernandez and Kirchner, who was president herself from 2007 to 2015, disagree over economic strategy. Kirchner’s loyalists favor measures like introducing a universal basic income and have impeded Fernandez’s policy makers from implementing unpopular measures, such as utility price hikes. Beyond that split, Fernandez is up for re-election next year, when he’s expected to have a limited appetite for unpopular moves. The increase in poverty and economic impact of inflation also make austerity measures with short-term political costs and long-term economic gains harder to push forward.\n\n• Story on Argentines withdrawing $1 billion from banks.\n\n• IMF’s first review of Argentina’s program in June.\n\n• Article on Argentina central bank’s king-sized August rate hike meant to cool inflation.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Argentina's 'Scaloneta' has given Lionel Messi and Co. the foundation for World Cup glory": "Lionel Messi and Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni have their sights set on the World Cup Gustavo Pagano/Getty Images\n\nWhen Argentina take on Honduras and Jamaica in upcoming friendlies, there will be few changes to the Albiceleste squad that has not lost a match in more than two years. And why should there be? Since a 2019 Copa America semifinal loss to Brazil, Lionel Scaloni's side has gone undefeated in 33 games, claimed the 2021 Copa for their first senior title since 1993, qualified for the 2022 World Cup in style, and thrashed European champions Italy in June in a showpiece match at Wembley.\n\nThis would be remarkable in any circumstances. But it is almost off the scale of extraordinary when two things are remembered. First, that Argentina were an absolute shambles at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Second, rookie coach Scaloni was appointed as a stop gap caretaker pretty much because he fulfilled the sole criteria at the time -- he wasn't a big financial risk. And now his team are referred to in Argentina as \"the Scaloneta\" -- the house that he built.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nArgentina had previously made a long term bet with high profile, dynamic Jorge Sampaoli. It was a disaster that should have been predicted. Argentina simply did not have the quick defenders and ball-playing keepers that are needed to play the Sampaoli way. The ageing squad limped away from Russia -- where they flirted with first-round elimination. With a huge pay off, Sampaoli was sacked. Money was in short supply, and so in came Scaloni. He didn't talk like a caretaker.\n\n\"[World Cup finalists] France and Croatia robbed the ball and were in a position to shoot in 3 or 4 seconds,\" was his post-Russia conclusion. \"That's the way football is going, it's the football I like and the moment has come to introduce this in Argentina. We're going to be more direct and vertical.\"\n\nLionel Scaloni revamped the way Argentina played, which has already paid dividends. Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThere was an obvious problem with this approach. It is not a model of play which is a good fit for Lionel Messi. It got off to a bad start. Scaloni's first competitive match was their 2019 Copa America opener against Colombia. Argentina were all stretched out, and easily picked off on their way to a 2-0 defeat. The rest of the competition was Argentina's attempts to edge towards a more workable idea of play. They played well in that semifinal loss to Brazil. But with Messi plus two strikers -- Lautaro Martinez and Sergio Aguero -- they were top heavy and too easily hit on the counter attack.\n\nMessi, though, was clearly on board. For the first time in his career, playing for the national team seemed like the most important thing in his career. He had come across as a remote figure to his Argentina teammates, happy in his own little world. Now he was a more vocal, encouraging figure, integrated into the group as never before. And by the time the World Cup qualifiers came around, Argentina were not vertical and direct. They were forming a possession based side, where the midfield trio of Leandro Paredes, Rodrigo De Paul and Giovani Lo Celso could dictate the rhythm of the game and bring Messi into play close to the opposing goal. It is the most coherent collective idea that Argentina have had all through Messi's long international days. On song, once the game has opened out -- such as the second half against Italy at Wembley in June -- they are a joy to watch.\n\nThe defence has long been a key problem area. It certainly was four years ago in Russia, and it will surely come under pressure at times in Qatar. But there has been a newfound confidence ever since June of last year when keeper Emiliano Martinez and centre-back Cristian Romero came into the side together. The statistics are certainly impressive. In the last 12 games, Argentina have only conceded two goals.\n\nIt would be something of a surprise if Honduras on Sept. 23 in Miami and Jamaica four days later in New Jersey, worsen those figures. But that is hardly the point. These are mere warmup games, serving to get the group together and making any late tweaks -- it might be interesting, for example, to see if Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister is given another chance in the deeper midfield role that he played in the last game, a friendly against Estonia back in June.\n\nBut even a shock defeat in these FIFA dates is not going to derail the Scaloni project and is highly unlikely to have an effect on confidence as Argentina build for the World Cup. Scaloni knows that his team have to lose some time -- he cites Italy as an example, where a long unbeaten run did not prove good enough to get them to Qatar. Given the choice between a long unbeaten run and winning the World Cup on Dec. 18, there is no doubt which one Scaloni would choose. Maybe he can have both.",

    "Tata Martino on why he skipped training to watch Argentina": "After drawing and losing their previous two outings, Mexico returned to winning ways on Saturday, beating Peru by the minimum in the first of two MexTour 2022 sendoff friendlies to be played in the United States. Prior to the game against the Incas, there had been a certain amount of controversy after coach Gerardo Martino was absent from the team’s final training session. Instead of overseeing the session, he was several thousand kilometres away in Florida watching the friendly between Argentina and Honduras.\n\nIn the post-match press conference, Tata explained why he didn’t show up for training. “Four or five weeks ago, they asked me if there was the possibility of doing open training for people and I automatically said yes. We are usually involved in preparing for the next game, so what we did was prepare a whole week of work,” the Argentine coach told reporters.\n\n🤔🚨 Se tenía que decir y se dijo. Gerardo Martino explicó el porqué de su ausencia en el entrenamiento de @miseleccionmx en el Rose Bowl:\n\n\n\n🗯 \"Me pareció mejor que tenía que ver a Argentina. El hincha no me quería ver a mi, entonces no tenía mucho sentido que estuviera ahí\" pic.twitter.com/xH9Hqd22TX — AS México (@ASMexico) September 25, 2022\n\n“The preparation for the match ended 48 hours ago, and since I had nothing more to do with the players, it seemed better for me to use that spare time to watch Argentina. One thing is very clear to me - the fans don’t come to see me. When we get off the bus, if I get off first, one of them might ask me to sign their shirt, but once the players start getting off they lose all interest in me. It’s perfectly normal, because the footballers are the ones who play, not the coach, so there wasn’t much point. I did not think that this would have caused so much debate; sometimes I think that even breathing becomes a reason for debate, but anyway...“\n\nSome fans turned up at the training ground to watch the session, and get autographs and pictures taken with the players. In spite of all the criticism, Mexico managed to overcome Peru with Hirving Lozano grabbing a late winner. On Tuesday, El Tri are back in action, taking on Colombia in what will be the team’s last game of the MexTour 2022 sendoff.\n\nMexico have two warm-up games lined up ahead of the World Cup. Martino’s team will face Iraq at the Montilivi in Girona, Spain on 9 November, then Sweden at the same venue on 16 November. Mexico make their Qatar World Cup debut against Poland on 22 November later before meeting Lionel Messi’s Argentina four days later. They bring the group stage to a close against Saudi Arabia on 30 November.",

    "Argentina looks to open new route to the sea for foreign trade": "José María Lojo, the president of the Port of La Plata to the south of Buenos Aires, agrees: “I see the Magdalena Channel as strategic and extremely important for Argentina. I believe it is a route that is necessary for the integration of navigation systems in the La Plata Basin, offering the possibility of a competitive and efficient alternative in the transport of goods.”\n\nFor Lojo, without this route, “the system is incomplete and inefficient”. This inefficiency lies, he says, in the greater distances that all ships coming to or from southern Argentina must travel, at great logistical expense due to frequent waiting times – between one and seven days – and costs as high as US$40,000 a day, because there is only a single one-way channel.\n\n“These waiting vessels receive services from Uruguay: water, foodstuffs, spare parts, technicians, waste removal and more. All this is estimated to be in the order of 150 million dollars a year,” Lojo explains. “The Magdalena Channel would serve to reduce waiting times, but if there were any, if a part of these ships were to wait near the Argentinean coasts, we would add a productive activity to supply the ships, for 30 or 40 million dollars a year.”\n\nFor the Port of La Plata president, the Magdalena Channel will allow Argentine producers to “improve their competitiveness” and consumers to “have lower prices” due to more efficient logistics.\n\nDoubts from the private sector\n\nAlfredo Sesé, technical secretary of the transport, infrastructure and waterway commission at the Rosario Stock Exchange (BCR), an organisation that brings together the main representatives of Argentine agribusiness, recognises that a modified Magdalena Channel would be beneficial for cabotage – domestic goods transport – to or from the south of Argentina, and for bulk carriers that have to deliver their cargo to the port of Bahía Blanca, in the south of the Province of Buenos Aires.\n\nWe are not opposed to any work, but we believe that there are other priorities, such as roads and railways\n\nHowever, in the BCR’s assessment, savings through the Magdalena Channel would be limited. “More than 90% of Argentina’s flour and oil production comes out of the port hub of the Greater Rosario area, whose destinations would not require navigation through this channel to reach the ocean, as they are heading north and the Magdalena points south,” Sesé says. “Its impact on this production would be nil.”\n\nElsewhere, Argentina already positioned itself as the world’s leading exporter of soybean meal and oil during the 2020-21 season. Amid this already high output, Sesé emphasises that for the agribusiness sector, the Magdalena Channel is “a multi-million dollar project that is not one of the sector's priorities”.\n\n“We are not opposed to any work, but we believe that there are other priorities, such as roads that require maintenance to avoid accidents and lower costs, all of which have been waiting for years, and there is a need for investment in railways, too,” the BCR secretary says.\n\nComings and goings\n\nA number of precursors to the Magdalena Channel project date back to the early years of the century, but it was in 2013, during the second government of now vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, that it gained concrete momentum: the route and width were defined and dredging was planned.\n\nThe proposed work obtained Uruguay’s approval in early 2016 under the Comisión Administradora del Río de la Plata (CARP), the binational body that regulates the shared use of the river, but the initiative became paralysed during the administration of former president Mauricio Macri.\n\nIt was not until 2021, with current incumbent Alberto Fernández in power, that the initiative regained momentum. A “special temporary executing unit” for the Magdalena Channel was created to call for tenders for the dredging, signalling and maintenance works. An environmental impact study was approved without objections the same year.\n\nThe work was included in the draft budget for 2022, put forward by the government last year. However, since the budget was not approved, the initiative has once again been stalled, this time due to lack of funds. It is now expected that the call for tenders will be made at the beginning of next year, once the 2023 budget is approved.\n\nThe international tender is expected to attract the interest of major players in the global dredging market, such as Belgium’s Jan de Nul, which has been operating on the Paraná-Paraguay waterway since 1995, and China’s CCCC Shanghai Dredging Company, which has experience in dredging the port of Mar del Plata on the Atlantic coast, and the Martín García channel further up the Río de la Plata, among other companies.",
    "Argentina’s pensioners suffer under weight of soaring inflation": "With inflation continuing to rise in Argentina, many struggle to pay for essentials like food and medicine.\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina – Villa Lugano, a collection of large social housing complexes in Argentina’s capital, was founded in the 1900s by a Swiss man who dreamt of building a neighbourhood that would compare with his home in Lugano, Switzerland.\n\nToday, it has become a symbol of the country’s working class – and it’s where I recently met Stella Maris Acosta and Walmiran Aramburu, two pensioners living off the minimum monthly instalment of about $170 each.\n\nIn a country where the monthly inflation rate has hit approximately 7 percent, their income is not enough to survive on. Stella Maris and Walmiran live in a modest apartment and they are struggling to pay the bills.\n\n“The only dream I had was owning a home and now look at us,” Stella Maris told me. “I am still paying for the mortgage, utility services, plus all the medicines we need – we cannot buy enough food.”\n\nShe then stood up and went to the refrigerator, proudly displaying some of the vegetables that she said she picks out of the rubbish, drops into vinegar and cleans up before eating. “People throw away food but it can be preserved and used,” said Stella Maris. “I can turn this tomato into sauce, bake it and other things.”\n\nArgentina is an agricultural powerhouse that produces food for 400 million people – yet amid soaring inflation and the daily struggles of people like Stella Maris and Walmiran, many here say the country’s ruling class has failed them over and over again.\n\nPeople are used to living with high inflation; it’s been a problem for decades. But with the rate expected to hit 100 percent by the end of 2022, Argentines are hoping for miracles.\n\nUnions are strong and they are pushing for wages to keep up with inflation. This year, deals have been reached for 65-percent salary increases and that’s one of the reasons why the government is still in control. There is anger, yes, and the government has lost support. But they are still in power.\n\nThe problem is that pensioners – who number about 7 million, of which 86 percent are getting the minimum amount every month – can rarely take to the streets and demand a better income.\n\n“Inflation, what it does is that you pay the new prices with an old salary. It happens to all workers,” Eugenio Semino, a public defender for the elderly in Buenos Aires, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe explained that even though labour unions have agreed to salary increases, that jump is already outpaced by the projected inflation, which “will be close to 100 [percent]”.\n\nArgentina’s government knows there is a big battle ahead over inflation. The problem is that until recently, President Alberto Fernandez and Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner could not agree on the antidote to fight it.\n\nAlberto Fernandez had been trying to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to cut down on subsidies and government spending, while Fernandez de Kirchner opposed many of his policies and insisted that inflation needed to be fought differently. But when she was president of Argentina until 2014, she, too, was unable to find a solution.\n\nNow, Sergio Massa is the new minister of the economy – the third to take up the post in August alone after a string of government shakeups.\n\nA seasoned politician with presidential ambitions, he has promised to jumpstart the troubled economy. Massa just came back from Washington, DC, where he made a desperate attempt to find investors and support for many of his policies. But whether his plan succeeds remains to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Argentina’s pensioners continue to struggle under the weight of the crisis.\n\nStella Maris has been working since she was 15. She has worked as a maid and a nurse, but now suffers from diabetes. Walmiran, who came to Argentina from Uruguay in the 1970s, worked as a doorman all his life. He, too, has health problems now, including epilepsy.\n\nDespite these challenges, Stella Maris and Walmiran still go out every day to try to make an extra living. They search rubbish bins for bronze, copper, aluminium, and food. If they are lucky, they can make an extra $80 every month by selling the recyclable materials.\n\nThey say Argentina’s political class has failed them. They are forced to take to the streets to survive as inflation continues to soar. But they are not humiliated by it. They say it’s a job and for now, it’s the only thing they can do to help them make it until the end of the month.",
    "Orwell in Argentina": "On September 1, a crowd gathered outside the Buenos Aires home of Argentina's vice president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (also known as CFK). They were there to signal support after a prosecutor asked for 12 years in prison for Kirchner following a corruption scandal that took place while she was president between 2007 and 2015. As CFK left her car and approached the building where she lives, a Brazilian man named Fernando André Sabag Montiel pointed a gun to her head. It misfired: Nobody was injured in the incident and crisis was averted. What came next, though, was deeply troubling.\n\nJust as Argentines were recovering from the shocking news of the assassination attempt, the government decided to use it to go on the offensive against its political opponents. At midnight—despite the lack of any indication that the attack was politically motivated—President Alberto Fernández declared a national holiday for \"reflection,\" contended that \"hate\" and \"political violence\" must be fought, and called for the masses to mobilize \"in defense of democracy.\" In a message he forced all TV and radio stations in the country to broadcast, he accused the opposition, the media, and even the judiciary of being hateful. The implication was clear: Those who opposed him were at least partially responsible for the attempted assassination.\n\nThe day after the incident, Twitter users began reporting that public employees were being forced to sign declarations supporting the vice president and opposing \"political violence.\" Supporters of the Fernández administration began harassing online influencers who do not generally comment on politics, attempting to bully them into joining the government narrative. Finally, and even more worryingly, officials began calling for the passage of a \"law against hate\" that would criminalize, among other things, \"offensive\" speech on social media.\n\nBut who is to define what hate is? And why the sudden focus on political violence allegedly perpetrated by Fernández and Kirchner's political opponents? The military today is not a player in national politics in Argentina, as it has been at times in the past; there are no politicians calling to overthrow the current government through force; and opposition-backed violent actions simply are not a part of daily life here. If anything, it is within kirchnerista circles that violent means have occasionally been praised. Only a few years ago, for example, a notorious Kirchner supporter suggested that Taser guns should be tried on the family of former president and now opposition leader Mauricio Macri before being used by the police. Some former government officials have even publicly demanded that Macri be hanged.\n\nAt this point, nobody can say why Sabag Montiel tried to shoot CFK. Though he was declared mentally fit to testify, he has refused to do so. All that is known is that Sabag Montiel, who routinely sought to be interviewed by journalists on the streets of Buenos Aires before the attack, has Nazi tattoos and appears to follow a number of occult beliefs on social media. He has shown no allegiance to any leaders or parties in the Argentine political landscape, and he has provided no indications that his actions were motivated by politics.\n\nThe sudden preoccupation with political violence comes at a convenient moment for the current administration. Recall that Kirchner stands accused of corruption; Argentina's economy is a mess; and opinion polls show that both the president and the vice president are deeply unpopular. To blame the opposition, sans evidence, for the assassination attempt against CFK reeks of a desperate attempt to change the subject. But it is also worrisome. Could the government be setting itself up for impunity? Sen. José Mayans, an ally of Fernández and Kirchner, is now demanding that corruption trials be suspended \"in exchange for social peace\"—an indirect threat to the judiciary.\n\nThe government's reaction to the assassination attempt is about more than distracting attention from corruption, however. The incident has provoked a resurgence for the relato—literally, a story or narrative, and the word commonly used to describe the Orwellian framing with which kirchneristas continuously seek to build an alternate reality where everything goes right or, if something does go wrong, their enemies are at fault. In 2015, that fairytale tried to convince Argentines that poverty was higher in Germany than at home. (In reality, even without taking into consideration purchasing power differences, during that time poverty was never below 27 percent in Argentina and above 15 percent in Germany). Today, the same fairytale blames businesses for the 100 percent annual inflation rate that Argentina is fast approaching. State truths, such as the one that says that opposition-driven \"hateful\" discourse is causing political violence, are not to be questioned: This seems to be the motto of the current regime.\n\nIn the past, Argentina has experienced authoritarian governments that made occasional turns toward totalitarianism. Juan Perón, for example, incarcerated political opponents and expropriated their assets even as he made himself out to be the \"liberator\" of the nation in school textbooks. Kirchneristas, who seek to vindicate Perón's legacy, are without any doubt headed in that direction. Whether they succeed or not will depend on many factors, particularly the state of a faltering economy that may cause the current administration to lose next year's presidential election. Nevertheless, dark clouds are gathering in Buenos Aires.",

Legionella spp. was isolated in the samples from four cases. Legionellosis is a pneumonia-like illness that varies in severity from mild febrile illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia. Cases were initially reported as being pneumonia of unknown cause. Legionella bacteria was identified as the causative organism on 3 September.\n\nAll cases presented with bilateral pneumonia, fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, and dyspnea between 18 and 25 August 2022 and are epidemiologically linked to one health facility. Of the 11 cases, eight are health workers of the facility; three are patients of the health facility. Three of the four deaths were among health workers.\n\nHealth authorities are coordinating cluster investigation activities, active case finding to identify additional cases, contact tracing and public health activities to limit further spread.\n\nOutbreak overview\n\nOn 29 August 2022, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of Argentina of a report from the Ministry of Public Health of Tucumán Province, of a cluster of six cases of bilateral pneumonia without an etiological cause identified in San Miguel de Tucumán city, Tucuman Province, Argentina 1. All six cases were linked to one private health facility in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán, with the onset of symptoms between 18 and 22 August 2022. The six cases included five health workers and one patient who was admitted to the clinic for an unrelated condition and then subsequently to the intensive care unit after developing pneumonia. In addition to bilateral pneumonia, all cases presented with fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, and dyspnea.\n\nOn 1 September, three additional cases were identified through active case finding - all health workers from the same private health facility, aged 30 to 44 years - with similar signs and symptoms to the initial six cases identified 2. The onset of symptoms for these cases was between 20 and 25 August 2022.\n\nBetween 2 and 3 September, two additional cases were identified, an 81-year-old male and a 64-year-old male, both with comorbidities, who were hospitalized and presented similar clinical presentation as the previous cases 3.\n\nAs of 3 September 2022, 11 cases have been identified, four of whom have died (three health workers). Eight of the 11 reported cases are health workers of the same health facility. The median age of the cases is 45 years; seven are male. Ten cases had underlying conditions and/or risk factors for severe disease, including the four reported deaths. Four cases are still hospitalized as of 3 September. Contacts of the cases are under follow-up and, to date, none have developed symptoms.\n\nLaboratory results\n\nBlood, respiratory and tissues samples were obtained from the 11 cases. Preliminary tests conducted at the local Public Health Laboratory were negative for respiratory viruses, and other viral, bacterial, and fungal agents. On 31 August, samples from the initial six cases were sent to the National Reference Laboratory - the Administration of National Laboratories and Health Institutes (Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud - ANLIS per its acronym in Spanish) - for additional testing 4 . As of 3 September 2022, negative results have been obtained for COVID-19 (RT-PCR), Influenza, detection of antibodies for Coxiella, urinary antigen for Legionella spp., panel of 12 respiratory viruses, hantavirus (Elisa IgM), histoplasma (RT-PCR), Yersinia pestis (PCR) and micro agglutination for leptospirosis.\n\nFurther analyses of two bronchoalveolar lavage samples by highly sensitive total DNA sequencing (metagenomics) found readings compatible with Legionella spp. On 3 September 2022, ANLIS reported that amplification products of the 16S ribosomal gene for Legionella spp. from the two samples of bronchoalveolar lavage sequenced by metagenomics and analyzed by four different bioinformatic methods, produced results compatible with Legionella pneumophila. Confirmation of these results is expected upon completion of the sequencing processes. This laboratory result supports evidence compatible with Legionnaires’ disease. Blood culture and seroconversion tests continue to be conducted to complement the diagnosis of Legionella infection.\n\nEpidemiology of Legionellosis\n\nLegionellosis is a generic term describing the pneumonic and non-pneumonic forms of infection with the Legionella species of bacteria. Legionellosis varies in severity from mild to serious and can sometimes be fatal.\n\nLegionnaires’ disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days have been recorded in some outbreaks). It is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia; and although uncommon, Legionnaires may cause outbreaks of public health significance. Initially, symptoms are fever, mild cough, loss of appetite, headache, malaise and lethargy, with some patients also experiencing muscle pain, diarrhoea and confusion. The severity of Legionnaires’ disease ranges from a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. Untreated Legionnaires’ disease usually worsens during the first week.\n\nMortality from Legionnaires’ disease depends on the severity of the disease, the use of antibiotic treatment, the setting where Legionella was acquired, and whether the patient has underlying conditions, including immunosuppression. The death rate may be as high as 40–80% in untreated immunosuppressed patients and can be reduced to 5–30% through appropriate case management, depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall, the death rate is usually between 5–10%.",
    "What we know about the failed attempt to assassinate Argentina's vice president": "What we know about the failed attempt to assassinate Argentina's vice president\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nA man aimed a loaded handgun at point-blank range at the face of the vice president of Argentina last night. But the gun failed to fire, and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is still alive. The suspected gunman has been detained. Argentina's president has called the incident, quote, \"the most serious event since we recovered democracy.\" Here with more details is Natalie Alcoba, a journalist based in Buenos Aires. She is outside the courthouse, where a judge has been taking witness statements on what happened to Fernandez. Welcome.\n\nNATALIE ALCOBA: Hello. How are you?\n\nCHANG: I'm good. So can you tell us a little more about what happened last night?\n\nALCOBA: Yes. So at around 9 p.m. local time, the vice president was returning home to her apartment in a upscale neighborhood of Buenos Aires. This has been the scene for over a week now of very enthusiastic demonstrations and rallies in support of her, which stem from a corruption case that she's currently in the middle of.\n\nCHANG: Right.\n\nALCOBA: But people have been rallying and defending her and kind of showing their support of her outside of her house. And so there was a large crowd. And there is this scene that is captured on - by several, you know, cellphone videos. And a man does pull out a revolver and pulls the trigger, and nothing fires out. She kind of raises her hands, crouches a bit. The man pulls away and is then chased by people who have seen what has happened and quickly apprehended by the federal police, who later retrieve a gun. And he has been detained.\n\nCHANG: What do we know about this man so far? Do we know anything about motive?\n\nALCOBA: We do not. I mean, this is early hours in the investigation. His name is Fernando Andres Sabag Montiel. He's 35 years old. He's born in Brazil but appears to also be an Argentine citizen. And that's about as...\n\nCHANG: OK.\n\nALCOBA: ...Concrete as we have at this stage.\n\nCHANG: OK. Well, let's just step back for a bit and talk about Fernandez because, as you mentioned, she's in the middle of a corruption trial at the moment. Can you explain why she's being prosecuted and then also tell us - you know, she's been a fairly divisive figure in the country. Can you explain the context for that?\n\nALCOBA: Yes. So Fernandez de Kirchner is probably, I would say, one of if not the most polarizing political figures in Argentina today - you know, is deeply loved but then also strongly reviled by different sectors of society. She's in the late stages of a corruption trial that dates back to her years as president, which were from 2007 to 2015. She's accused of leading, like, an illicit association during her years in the presidency that essentially siphoned state dollars into public works contracts that were awarded to a family friend. She has repeatedly declared her innocence and says that she is a victim of judicial and political persecution. And so she spoke some more about that last week. And it was the culmination of those two events that have led to these strong demonstrations out on the street, different clashes as well between police and people who support her. So it's been increasingly tense here.\n\nCHANG: Yeah. Well, since what happened last night, can you talk about how people have been reacting, not just the government but people all around the country and beyond Argentina?\n\nALCOBA: Absolute horror, really. I mean, the images that you see are quite shocking. She's received, you know, expressions of solidarity and support from numerous leaders across Latin America. You know, the pope issued a telegram to her expressing his support. You know, it's certainly news around the world. I mean, she's somebody whose image and whose politics have kind of transcended outside of Argentina. She's a strong figure of leftist governments in Latin America that have had different moments in power. And certainly, Latin America's seen in some countries, like, a return to leftist governments. And so the repercussions have been huge. It's also clear that, like, the political rhetoric has become increasingly aggressive here in Argentina, certainly in the last couple of weeks in the wake of this latest step on the corruption trial - so very strong language...\n\nCHANG: Yeah.\n\nALCOBA: ...And back-and-forth from both sides.\n\nCHANG: That is Natalie Alcoba, a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

    "In Argentina, 19 people are indicted for ties to yoga sect that used sex to lure powerful": "BUENOS AIRES — A judge in Argentina indicted 19 people on Thursday for their alleged involvement in a yoga school in Buenos Aires that operated like a sect and coerced female members to have sex with rich and powerful men in order to obtain money and other benefits.\n\nJudge Ariel Lijo formally charged 19 people on crimes including criminal conspiracy, human trafficking with the purpose of sexual exploitation, money laundering and smuggling.\n\nThe Buenos Aires Yoga School, which operated for more than 30 years in Argentina’s capital under the leadership of 84-year-old Juan Percowicz, did not actually offer yoga classes. Instead, it lured in people with promises of eternal happiness before it exploited them sexually and financially, prosecutors say.\n\nThe investigation into the group revealed that opera star Placido Domingo had contact with the organization’s leaders for more than two decades.\n\nLijo ruled that 14 of the 19 people indicted will be remanded in custody and an embargo has been placed on their assets. Prosecutors had requested indictments of 20 people.\n\nLaw enforcement officials continue to search for six suspects believed to be in the United States, where the school had offices in New York, Las Vegas and Chicago.\n\nIn his resolution, Lijo says the school tricked vulnerable people to join, noting leaders preyed particularly on those who were underage or had serious health problems, including addictions. People were wooed to join with promises of healing and support, but were later exploited, often sexually, for the benefit of the organization’s leaders.\n\nThe group operated by cutting students off from the outside world by giving them living quarters, work within the organization and making sure they started socializing exclusively with people who were part of the organization.\n\nStudents were used and exploited, both sexually and financially, to obtain economic benefit for Percowicz and other top leaders of the organization, Lijo said. Members were often forced to have sex with wealthy or powerful men in order to build a commercial relationship with the men deemed their “boyfriends.”\n\nFemale students were forced to determine what they could get from each person and they had to do everything possible to obtain it, Lijo said.\n\nPercowicz claimed to have great wisdom and even “divine powers” as a way to indoctrinate students and explained his beliefs on a mixture of classic literature as well as religious and spiritual texts.\n\nIt was up to Percowicz to decide how students moved up the seven levels of the school’s strict hierarchy that had the leader at the top, a system that amounts to psychological coercion, according to Lijo.\n\nEven though the leaders of the group promised students they would receive teachings in philosophy and they would be healed, the only goal of the group’s leaders was to make money, Lijo said.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

They suggested residents of cities bordering Argentina be given VAT discounts on different products and complement them with rebates in the different distribution sectors through the Banco República app, among other initiatives.\n\nAccording to Uruguayan migration authorities; 91,462 Uruguayans; 15,830 Argentines; 4,320 Brazilians, and 438 Chileans left the country during last weekend, mainly through Fray Bentos.

    "Invest in homes in Argentina, England, and more for as little as $100 via these fractional-ownership startups": "US home prices are still hovering near record highs, making real-estate investing a costly venture.\n\nFractional-ownership firms help people invest in real estate even if they are short on cash.\n\nTwo startups that allow Americans to buy shares of overseas properties break down the process.\n\nOwning one home in the US is hard — and expensive — enough.\n\nNow Americans are showing more interest in Europe and other — relatively — cheaper spots abroad to buy pieds-à-terre and investment properties. The moves are not without challenges: Inflation and other costs are eating into homebuying budgets, and prospective investors must often navigate foreign-investment regulations.\n\nBut some startups make it easier for Americans to enjoy the benefits of buying a second home abroad or becoming a landlord overseas — without the high up-front costs.\n\nTake Housie and Flyway, new startups that embrace a growing trend in real-estate investing: fractional ownership. The trend allows everyday people to purchase a share of a property instead of footing the entire bill. In return, investors get a share of the profit from renting it out or, in some cases, a set amount of time to visit the property.\n\nThe dining area of a Housie unit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Housie\n\nCan't afford a whole Airbnb? Buy a share of one and reap profits as a co-landlord.\n\nHousie, a platform founded in July 2022 in Argentina, gives customers the opportunity to fractionally invest in studio apartments in attractive locations for short-term visitors to popular South American cities including Buenos Aires, Argentina and Santiago, Chile.\n\nAccording to Germàn Rimoldi, the cofounder and CEO of Housie, the company is admittedly taking advantage of some countries with down economies, like Argentina, which he added is a common approach to real-estate investing.\n\n\"I saw the opportunity of investing when prices are significantly low when Argentines started purchasing property in the US in 2008,\" Rimoldi told Insider. \"That's when I realized that that approach is easy to understand for most investors.\"\n\nA few of the listings on Housie. Housie\n\nRight now, for a minimum of $100, users can buy shares of properties and receive dividends quarterly depending on how well the property does on the short-term market.\n\nData from Redfin shows the average price per square foot in Argentina was $195 in August 2022 — a 16.5% decrease from the previous year. According to Rimoldi, Housie is buying studios in the heart of Buenos Aires' downtown district for around $200 per square foot, which he believes is well undervalued.\n\nOnce purchased, the company lists the properties on Airbnb. According to AirDNA, a vacation-rental-data firm, Buenos Aires has 12,105 active rentals. For comparison, Miami has 13,280. So far, Housie has six apartments in total — one in Chile, two in Argentina, and three in Florida — and has over 1,200 US investors registered on the platform, according to Rimoldi.\n\nOn the other side of the world, the London and Athens, Greece-based startup Flyway is taking a different approach to fractional ownership.\n\nBuy a share of a London apartment for as little as $150,000 and stay there a few weeks a year\n\nFlyway, which was founded in 2021 and raised $10 million in funding in August , targets a wealthier investor. Its clientele deal in luxury pieds-à-terre, or second homes that owners visit infrequently.\n\nFlyway has raised $10 million in funding. Flyway\n\nCustomers can buy up to six shares out of 12 of a turnkey home in London — and soon to be other large cities — in exchange for at least one month to spend in the home during the year.\n\n\"Throughout my whole life, I traveled very frequently in a number of cities and I always wanted a solution like this,\" Nikos Drandakis, the founder and CEO of Flyway, told Insider. \"I threw away so much money on hotels.\"\n\nCurrently, Flyway offers four homes in London with the lowest share price starting at 131,000 pounds a share — or $149,121 — for a one-bedroom unit on Liverpool Street, while the highest is 519,000 pounds per share for a two-bedroom apartment. The dollar is strong against the pound and the euro right now, making investing in European cities relatively more affordable, and more appealing, for Americans.\n\nThe least expensive pied-à-terre starts at 131,000 pounds. Flyway\n\nAfter splitting the property between investors, Flyway takes on a property-manager role and charges a monthly fee. Still in the preliminary stages, Flyway has sold some shares but the homes have yet to be rented out.\n\nAs for future plans, Drandakis wants to first see if his product works in London, but intends to focus on large metros as he believes those homes will hold more interest during the year compared to beachfront spots.\n\n\"With vacation homes, everybody wants to be there in July, and if you have eight, ten owners, it's very hard to split the time,\" Drandakis said. \"But when you have homes in the city, you usually don't have this kind of seasonality. It's throughout the whole year demand for these homes.\"",

    "Argentina great Andres Nocioni against naturalization of players": "2022-09-24T17:11:56+00:00\n\n2022-09-24T17:11:56+00:00\n\n2022-09-24T21:02:37+00:00.\n\nBy Eurohoops team/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nAndres Nocioni, one of the greats of Argentinian basketball and a former EuroLeague champion and Final Four MVP, criticized the use of naturalized players by national teams, especially when there are no links between them and the country they represent.\n\n“I would never sign a foreign player,” Nocioni said to Infobae, when asked about the recent comments by Argentina head coach Pablo Prigoni on the naturalization of American-born guard Lorenzo Brown by 2022 EuroBasket champion Spain. “I think it shouldn’t be allowed. It’s one thing if a player is an import who comes from practicing from a very young age, lives in the country and plays on a team. In that case, it is possible, he can be selectable. But going out to sign players, according to need… no. That’s what the clubs are for, not the national teams. Also, buying players for your team is not cheap. It is better to invest that money in training and it is a process of monitoring inferior players who in the future can participate in our selected teams.”\n\nNocioni was one of the prominent members of the “golden generation” of the Argentinian national team that also included Manu Ginobili, Luis Scola, Prigioni and Fabricio Oberto, among others. He won 12 medals in international competitions, including the gold in the 2004 Olympic Games, the silver in the 2002 World Cup and the bronze in the 2008 Olympics.\n\nIn 2015, Nocioni pushed Real Madrid to win its first EuroLeague championship in 20 years while being named Final Four MVP. He spent six years in Spain from 2012 to 2017 until his retirement.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012, Nocioni played in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls, the Sacramento Kings and the Philadelphia 76ers."
