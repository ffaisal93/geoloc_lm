    "Four arrested over alleged plot to kidnap Belgian justice minister": "Police in the Netherlands have arrested four suspects over what Belgium’s justice minister described as a plan to kidnap him.\n\nVincent Van Quickenborne, who is also the mayor of the city of Kortrijk in western Flanders, appeared to blame a “drug mafia” in a video message run by state broadcaster RTBF.\n\nAddressing an audience at a local ball, he said that in a phone call on Thursday, a federal prosecutor had warned him of a kidnap plan targeting him.\n\nOn Saturday Van Quickenborne said: “I will be placed under strict security for the time being and will not be able to participate in some planned activities in the coming days. It’s not pleasant, but understandable.\n\n“Let me be clear: the people behind this are achieving the opposite of what they aim for. It strengthens me in the belief that we need to keep fighting. The criminals feel trapped. That feeling is right. Because we will continue to fight organised crime, with more manpower and resources than before.\n\n“In our democratic rule of law we will never fold to violence. Never.”\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Saturday that police had beefed up security for Van Quickenborne, citing a serious “threat”. They said three people had been detained in the Netherlands and that Belgian authorities were seeking their extradition.\n\nA spokesman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office in the Hague said the trio, all Dutch, were aged 20, 29 and 48. On Sunday, a judicial source said a fourth suspect had been arrested in the Netherlands.\n\nBelgian prime minister Alexander De Croo tweeted on Saturday that the threat to Quickenborne was “totally unacceptable. But it must be clear: we will not be intimidated by anyone. The work continues.”\n\nFollowing a report in the Flemish daily Het Laatste Nieuws, the source confirmed to AFP that an automatic weapon had been found in a vehicle spotted near the minister’s home in Kortrijk. Belgian news outlet VRT reported that the vehicle contained Kalashnikovs, other firearms and two bottles of petrol.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said it had been informed last week of a “possible threat”, which led to an investigation. It would not provide further details.",
    "Ghent is Belgium’s unsung capital of cool": "Listen 14 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe sun beat down on Ghent. It was the hottest day I could remember ever spending in Belgium, and it was a relief to be on the water. I paddled the canoe through the confluence of the Lys and Scheldt rivers. The voices of sunbathers carried from the quay, where moored houseboats bobbed beneath gabled houses and planters popping with pink flowers. But I didn’t dwell on Ghent’s undeniable charm. Instead, I watched the water … until I saw it up ahead, partially submerged: a plastic bottle, riding the currents on its way to the North Sea. I extended my trash-grabber and snatched it.\n\nOver the years, I keep returning to Belgium’s second city. Once I made a pilgrimage to see a world-famous masterpiece, Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,” also called the Ghent Altarpiece. (It’s also known as the most stolen painting in history, but more on that later.) The city’s energy was so irresistible that I’d returned to survey the happening restaurant scene with a friend from Brussels. On each successive trip, I’ve been amazed that Ghent — just about half an hour by train from Bruges and Brussels, and about an hour from Antwerp — isn’t overrun with tourists. Most recently, I wanted to dive into Ghent’s green ethos. Beyond its cool vibe, the city has been making waves for its sustainability initiatives and eco-minded tourism strategy.\n\nSo I boarded a boat by DOKano. The idea behind this nonprofit: Rent a canoe for the price of a bucket of trash that you retrieve yourself from Ghent’s waterways. (A donation is also welcome.) What started in 2017 as the brainchild of five parents at school pickup has morphed into an organization that’s popular with both locals and visitors. DOKano also offers team-building outings and educational excursions with school groups, who are encouraged to sort the trash before nominating the “catch of the day.” Some of the more curious finds? A toy monkey, sneakers and perfectly usable heart-shaped luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“DOKano’s mission is to take action with as many people as possible to create plastic-free waters,” says co-founder Hans Marly. “The goal is to remove litter while raising public awareness of the problem.”\n\nThe plight of plastic in our environment can be depressing. For me, going canoeing with DOKano was a means of exploring the beautiful waterways while doing something proactive. “Projects like this are positive for both tourists and locals and reflect the city’s goals,” says Deputy Mayor Bram Van Braeckevelt. “We aim to keep tourism in Ghent sustainable — to find a balance with the city’s livability, to invest in projects that provide a return to the local community, to take measures to avoid overtourism in the future.”\n\nThe rebellious noose bearers\n\nGhent’s vibrant spirit and political engagement stem from its history. The story is told with flair at STAM, the Ghent City Museum, whose very architecture — an amalgam of restored medieval cloisters and contemporary glass — reflects the modern city itself. Back around 630, a wandering French missionary named Amandus arrived to proselytize the local population, building a church that later became St. Bavo’s Abbey. Ghent grew into a medieval powerhouse thanks to the cloth trade. In the oldest written description of Ghent (1154), geographer al-Sharif al-Idrisi waxed poetic in Arabic: “It is a beautiful, flourishing city with many stately homes and grand vistas. It possesses gardens, orchards and fields that provide a continual harvest.”\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Ghent was the second-largest city in northern Europe after Paris. This prosperous trade hub even boasted its own army, with which it challenged the Counts of Flanders and Dukes of Burgundy. Over time, the creation of craft guilds — each demanding political participation — encouraged diplomacy and the exchange of ideas.\n\n“Ghent has always had a rebellious streak,” says Luk Darras, a former Belgian ambassador who has lived here for 17 years, referring to an infamous 16th-century episode. Charles V, the future Holy Roman Emperor, was born in Ghent but later squashed a revolt, forcing the locals to parade through the streets wearing hangman’s nooses around their necks in punishment. To this day, Ghentians are called “stroppendragers” (or noose bearers), and you can find a noose proudly depicted on a local beer label.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the population numbers more than 265,000 people of about 160 nationalities, with approximately an additional 85,000 university students arriving each autumn. “It brings an injection of youthful energy,” says Mieke Thienpont, a professional guide and president of the Ghent Guides association.\n\n“The city is very much alive,” Darras says. “It’s friendly and dynamic — open to industry and change — and also socially engaged.”\n\nGhent’s heritage is reason enough to travel here. There’s the formidable Castle of the Counts, the 15th-century Great Butchers’ Hall, the UNESCO-listed belfry lording over it all. Founded in 1235, the Beguinage of Our Lady at Hoyen — also a UNESCO site — once housed religious women in a unique, self-sustaining community. Guildhalls with ornately sculpted facades flank the quays of Graslei and Korenlei. The Museum of Fine Arts (MSK), considered Belgium’s oldest museum, is celebrating its 225th anniversary with a rich program. And back to the aforementioned Ghent Altarpiece, of which Darras says is “the one painting you have to see in your life,” a visitor center inside St. Bavo’s Cathedral brings the newly restored work to life through an augmented-reality experience that’s an immersion in the Van Eyck brothers’ world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut besides all this cultural wealth, it’s the energy and ambiance that keep luring me back. As I walked Ghent’s cobblestoned streets, I fed off the laughter from the busy cafes, the rush of commuting bikes, a flamenco concert at ENTR, where I nursed a local Lousberg beer. Admiring the city’s prolific street art, I met local legend Klaas Van der Linden as he painted a wall on Graffiti Street. His works are all over Ghent; for example, the astonishing “Lost at Sea” is an enormous self-portrait in exuberant color. He has a master’s degree in arts, though he learned spray-paint techniques on the streets, and his paintings are exhibited in shows across Europe. A crowd had gathered to snap photos, and Van der Linden was gregarious, inviting some passersby to check out his studio: a medieval cellar with vaulted ceilings that’s quintessentially Ghent.\n\nIt’s this authenticity that the city champions (and promotes through measures such as the “Walk Local” campaign, showing where famous residents hang out to entice visitors away from the city’s Instagrammable historical center). “Ghent is so much more than just a selfie,” Van Braeckevelt says. “We invite people to bring their pajamas and stay overnight — to feel the city’s vibe like Ghentians.”\n\nWhen I checked into the Yalo Urban Boutique Hotel, opened in 2021, I found a buzzing hangout with great energy. It draws locals for coffee and co-working in the morning (the coffee is by a neighborhood roastery called Vandekerckhove), after-work cocktails in the bar (try “Lucifer’s Kiss,” with jalapeño-infused Pisco), and dinner in the glass-roofed atrium (served by friendly waiters wearing white Puma sneakers). A soon-to-open rooftop will no doubt attract the cool crowd for DJ sets with a panoramic view. There’s a real focus on design here, along with sustainability. As Belgium’s second hotel with Green Globe certification, its eco-friendly measures include solar-heated water, upcycled glasses by Belgian company IWAS and kitchen ingredients sourced from local farms.\n\nRevolutionary creativity\n\nA playground for artists, Ghent is fertile ground for experimental ideas, particularly in sustainability. Most recently, the city’s tourism recovery plan, launched in 2021 with a green focus, was the result of diplomacy and compromise. To determine the future of tourism, local residents were engaged alongside business managers in citywide debates.\n\nOther examples abound. The Ghent Light Plan was launched in 2007 as a means of illuminating the city’s monuments and buildings at night in a dazzling yet energy-efficient way. Cycling culture is pervasive, boosted by infrastructure (such as bike parking garages) and city incentives. A low-emission zone was established in January 2020 to keep polluting cars out of the city center. In fact, many locals have ditched their cars in exchange for bikes or community car-sharing services. Ghent was the first Belgian city to launch Fairbnb, the sustainable vacation rental platform that reinvests 50 percent of its revenue in local communities. But perhaps the biggest example of pioneering initiatives: In 2009, Ghent witnessed the launch of “Thursday Veggie Day,” now a global phenomenon that encourages people to skip meat for a day to help fight climate change. Ghent is today a vegetarian capital with a variety of restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We couldn’t have launched anywhere else but Ghent,” says Paul Florizoone, who founded the trendsetting Greenway brand 26 years ago. Before vegetarianism went mainstream, Greenway innovated with meat alternatives, and today, alongside its three restaurants in Belgium, it offers a range of retail products, such as sausage made from locally grown cauliflower and cordon bleu from celeriac. Newer to the scene is Epiphany’s Kitchen, a lively spot named Belgium’s best vegan restaurant by BE Vegan in 2021. You won’t find avocado toast on the menu. The dishes are the result of creative kitchen experimentation — such as the pizza crust made from crushed yuca root — which you can taste among flickering candles and a riot of flowers. Everything is made in-house. “It was a success since the beginning, and I didn’t initially market it as vegan,” explains owner Epiphany Vanderhaeghen. “I wanted to invite people into my world to experience it.”\n\nOn my last night, I sat at the bar at Publiek, a Michelin-starred restaurant with a real cool factor. Chef Olly Ceulenaere is a champion of the Flemish terroir, reputed for exalting local products (whether that be endives, Bintje potatoes or North Sea fish) in refined cuisine that’s also accessible. Appetizing smells wafted from the open kitchen while I slurped an oyster topped with berry-infused granitas, washed down with a rhubarb and raspberry beer. The ambiance is fun and relaxed — the non-harried waiters open to chatting — and it struck me that, with its laid-back style, the restaurant captures the spirit of Ghent. Tipped off by the waiter, I tried the Dame Blanche, a dessert that’s not on the menu. It’s a seemingly simple classic: vanilla ice cream made fresh when you order, accompanied by warm choux pastry and cups of melted chocolate and whipped cream. But it’s sublime because of the quality of the ingredients.\n\n“I want people to have a good time,” Ceulenaere says. “I run the restaurant to be a place where I would want to eat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was late when I left the restaurant. But the buildings were aglow, the streets humming with cyclists on their way home from a night out. I resolved to return for one of the city’s epic festivals; during the Ghent Light Festival, the gilded dragon that’s perched atop the belfry even spits fire — a fitting mascot for such a spirited place. A light rain began to fall as I followed De Reep, the same waterway I had earlier traversed by canoe. Then the skies above Ghent crackled with the electricity of a thunderstorm.\n\nWinston Nicklin is a writer based in Paris. Her website is marywinstonnicklin.com.

    "Netherlands vs. Belgium": "Captain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat neighbours Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to clinch top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year's finals tournament.\n\nVan Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nThey finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so.\n\nAny hopes of a goal feast were quickly stymied, however, as the two sides effectively cancelled each other out in a tight tactical battle.\n\nThe Dutch pressing game frustrated Belgian efforts at building up attacks, while a five-man defence for the visitors meant there was little room for the home strikers.\n\nIt meant the winner came from a simple set piece with Van Dijk leaping over his marker, the 18-year-old Zeno Debast, to give Louis van Gaal his 37th victory in his three spells in charge of the national side, equalling the record for a Dutch coach held by Dick Advocaat.\n\nBelgium, whose own coach Roberto Martinez had to sit in the stands after being given a red card at the end of last week's win over Wales, had a chance for a perfect start after only four minutes, with Eden Hazard set up by Amadou Onana only to blast his shot wide.\n\nThere were other first-half chances for Michy Batshauyi, Axel Witsel, Timothy Castagne and Onana as Belgium had the better of the half's opportunities while their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was largely untroubled.\n\nThe Dutch improved after a pair of half-time changes and Denzel Dumfries, Steven Bergwijn and Davy Klaassen were all thwarted as the home side began to find more room and Belgium lived dangerously at the back in the last stages of the game.\n\nBelgium might well have forced a draw as a spectacular effort from substitute Dodi Lukebakio came within inches of a last gasp equaliser with the final kick of the game.\n\n\"We wanted to win but it wasn't a great game. We could have done better but we also had to work hard against a team with a lot of quality players. But winning was the most important,\" Van Dijk said after the match.",

    "Belgium Business Confidence Plunged in September": "By Maria Martinez\n\nBusiness confidence in Belgium fell sharply in September, declining for the fifth consecutive month amid higher energy prices and weaker demand.\n\nThe business confidence index fell to minus 11.8 in September from minus 5.8 in August, data from the National Bank of Belgium showed Monday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the indicator to come in at minus 8.8.\n\nThe acute deterioration in the business climate is affecting all sectors of activity covered by the survey, with the exception of the building industry, with the indicator remaining virtually stable, the Bank of Belgium said.\n\nThe loss of confidence was particularly abrupt in the retail sector, with its indicator falling to minus 24.1 in September from minus 11.9 in August. Demand forecasts collapsed and those for orders placed with suppliers fell again.\n\nDemand forecasts in the manufacturing industry were considerably weaker as well. The indicator for this sector declined to minus 13.9 from minus 7.2 in the previous month.\n\nThe economic climate in the services sector is also suffering from much more unfavorable forecasts concerning both firms' own activity and general market demand. The indicator for the sector deteriorated to minus 4.5 in September from 2.1 in August.\n\nIn the building industry, the indicator remained more or less stable, falling to minus 6.0 from minus 5.6, with demand forecasts even improving.

    "Russia Arrests More Than 1,300 Anti-Mobilization Protesters": "Russia’s security forces arrested on Wednesday more than 1,300 people who gathered in various cities to protest against the partial mobilization ordered by Vladimir Putin, who upped the ante in the war in Ukraine with the most serious escalation since the invasion in February.\n\nIndependent Russian protest monitoring group OVD-Info says on its front page that 1,314 people were detained on Wednesday during protests against the mobilization of 300,000 reservists which Putin ordered yesterday.\n\nHundreds were arrested at protests – illegal under Russian law – in the capital Moscow and the second-largest city St Petersburg, according to the group.\n\nOn Wednesday, Putin announced in a televised speech an immediate “partial mobilization” of Russia’s military and claims to be ready to defend \"our people\" in the Donbas. Four eastern Ukrainian regions under Russian occupation are set to hold rushed referendums to join the Russian Federation amid continued fighting.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the immediate partial mobilization, one-way flights out of Russia to visa-free destinations for Russians, such as Istanbul in Turkey and Yerevan in Armenia, were sold out in hours.\n\nThe first Russian troop mobilization since World War II sent oil prices surging early on Wednesday on fears that escalation of the war could lead to further isolation and more Western sanctions against Russia, including on its energy exports. Security of energy supply, including of gas, is also a concern with the most recent moves from the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Wednesday, oil prirces pared gains and dropped after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 1.1 million barrels for the week to September 16, as well as inventory increases in gasoline and middle distillates. Hours later, oil extended losses after the Fed announced another rate hike by 75 basis points - the third such large increase in rates in a row. The 75-bp hike was largely expected, but it dragged prices down anyway, due to concerns about the economy and oil demand.\n\nOil opened higher on Thursday amid concerns that an escalation of the war in Ukraine would endanger supply.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Belgium’s Catholic Church: shrinking but still influential": "The Catholic Church in Belgium is dominating headlines this week, after bishops issued a text for the blessing of same-sex couples.\n\nBut it’s not only this week that the country has garnered attention in Catholic circles — Belgian Catholicism has long enjoyed considerable influence within the worldwide Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAnd yet Belgium only ranks in 28th place on the list of countries with the largest Catholic populations, behind the Dominican Republic and Kenya.\n\nSo why does the country continue to drive Catholic news? The Pillar takes a look.\n\nCardinal Suenens. Polla ta deina via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nA cardinal, the Council, and co-responsibility\n\nBelgium is not an easy country to understand. For centuries, this strategic strip of land was the “battlefield of Europe.” The nation, which declared its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, is composed of two major ethnic groups: the majority Flemish people, who speak a Dutch dialect, and the minority French-speaking Walloons.\n\nBelgium has a population of 11.5 million and borders the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France. Its capital, Brussels, is the center of the European Union, a political and economic alliance of 27 member states. The country is relatively prosperous, but outsiders often regard it as deeply culturally divided and its government as dysfunctional, dubbing it “the world’s most successful failed state.”\n\nBelgium also has a bleak colonial legacy: King Leopold II had a reign of terror in the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908 (inspiring Joseph Conrad’s novel “Heart of Darkness.”) As late as 1958, Belgium hosted a “human zoo,” featuring Congolese men, women and children.\n\nIt is often said there are no famous Belgians, but in fact the country has produced storied saints such as St. John Berchmans and St. Damien of Molokai.\n\nShortly after Belgium gained independence, an important center of Catholic scholarship was established in the city of Leuven/Louvain. (The city’s Catholic university split in the 1960s along linguistic lines, leading to the collapse of the Belgian government.)\n\nThe Belgian Church’s academic prowess proved influential when Pope John XXIII summoned the world’s bishops to Rome for an Ecumenical Council in 1962. Belgian theologians and bishops contributed vigorously to Vatican II’s sessions, none more so than Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens.\n\nAccording to his New York Times obituary, Suenens helped to influence the Council’s direction when he sent a critique of its preparatory documents to the pope. With John XXIII’s support, the cardinal presented an alternative vision at the Council’s first session. The pope then appointed Suenens to a commission that streamlined the Council’s agenda. Paul VI later named him one of the Council’s four moderators.\n\nThe New York Times described Suenens as a champion of the “modernization of the garb and life style of Catholic nuns, expansion of the laity’s responsibilities, ordination of married men to serve as deacons, mandatory retirement for bishops and renewed ties with other branches of Christianity and with Judaism.”\n\nA few years after Vatican II, Suenens published a widely discussed book arguing that the Vatican was backsliding on the Council’s commitment to “co-responsibility of the laity.”\n\nA funeral Mass in Transinne, Belgium. Lucyin via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nGood works, small congregations\n\nThe annual report produced by the Belgian Church is a colorful, glossy publication running to 100 pages. With its quirky pictures of young people and pages highlighting charitable works, the report suggests that Belgian Catholicism is alive and well.\n\nBut midway through, there is a statistical section. And there, the picture begins to darken. The report notes that 1,261 people asked to be removed from baptismal registers in 2020. That year, 33 parishes were closed and 17 churches fell into disuse (with two given to other Christian communities.)\n\nThere were just four priestly ordinations in the country, while three diocesan priests left the ministry. More than half of Belgium’s remaining diocesan priests are over 75 years of age.\n\nUnderstandably, the report does not give Mass attendance figures, as churches were closed for much of the pandemic year. But the previous year’s report recorded that a total of 241,029 people attended Mass on the third Sunday of October in 2019.\n\nSo around 3.6% of Belgium’s baptized Catholics attended Mass on an average Sunday. Compare that to 1967 — at the height of Suenens’ influence — when 42.9% of the country’s Catholics were present at Sunday Mass.\n\nIn short, the statistics suggest that, despite its good works, the Church in Belgium is suffering severe attrition.\n\nArchbishop André-Joseph Léonard in February 2012. Marek Blahuš via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0).\n\nThe battle for Brussels\n\nCardinal Suenens was the first churchman to lead the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels (which was known as the Archdiocese of Mechelen until 1961). He was succeeded in 1979 by another influential prelate, Cardinal Godfried Danneels.\n\nA leader of the European Church’s liberal wing, Danneels took part in meetings of the St. Gallen Group, an informal circle of prelates who believed that the reforming spirit of the Second Vatican Council had been stifled.\n\nDanneels’ reputation was tarnished in 2010 by a leaked audio recording, in which he urged a young man not to publicly accuse his uncle, Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges, of sexually abusing him.\n\nThe disclosure was followed by an independent report which recorded 475 abuse complaints against clergy and church workers from the 1950s to the 1980s. The abuse crisis severely dented Belgian Catholicism’s reputation and strained relations between Belgian authorities and the Vatican.\n\nDanneels took part in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, appearing alongside the new pope on the loggia overlooking St. Peter’s Square. The pope named him a participant in the 2015 family synod in Rome.\n\nDanneels had retired as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels in 2010. He was succeeded by the conservative Archbishop André-Joseph Léonard, marking a clear break in the see’s progressivist tradition.\n\nLéonard’s appointment was so controversial that Archbishop Karl-Josef Rauber, the former apostolic nuncio to Belgium, took the rare step of denouncing it. The Vatican diplomat said publicly that he would have preferred Danneels’ successor be an auxiliary bishop of Mechelen-Brussels.\n\nPope Francis accepted Léonard’s resignation, after a turbulent tenure, shortly after his 75th birthday in 2015. The pope chose Bishop Jozef De Kesel — a former auxiliary bishop under Danneels — as Léonard’s successor and soon made him a cardinal. In 2015, he also gave Rauber the red hat.\n\nThis year, Pope Francis named another Belgian to the College of Cardinals: Bishop Lucas Van Looy. But the 80-year-old emeritus bishop of Ghent asked to be withdrawn from consideration following criticism that he had failed to provide sufficient support for abuse victims.\n\nCardinal Jozef De Kesel. Philcotof via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nContinuity or change?\n\nPope Francis’ intervention in 2015 helped to restore progressivist continuity in the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels, Belgium’s primatial see. It is not surprising that its current incumbent, Cardinal De Kesel, was the driving force behind the Flemish bishops’ document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples.\n\nThe pope has not yet responded to the text, which appears to challenge last year’s declaration by the Vatican’s doctrinal department that the Church has no power to bless same-sex unions. He may never comment publicly on the document. But he will soon face a choice that will indicate his thoughts.\n\nDe Kesel, the Primate of Belgium and president of the Belgian bishops’ conference, submitted his resignation as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels on his 75th birthday in June.\n\nThe weekly newspaper Katholiek Nieuwsblad reported that it was “an open secret” that De Kesel was not “pushing for further extension of his episcopate in Mechelen-Brussels.”\n\n“He was diagnosed with colon cancer in spring 2020 and the treatment and an operation in summer 2020 have taken their toll. The cardinal has recovered but remains weakened,” it said.\n\nThe paper speculated that De Kesel would remain in post “at least until the ad limina visit of the Belgian bishops,” scheduled for Nov. 21-26.\n\nIt seems that the pope must decide imminently whether to select De Kesel’s successor from among the Flemish bishops who collectively endorsed the new document or to go outside their circle.\n\nHis choice will send an important signal about the future of Belgian Catholicism.",

    "Report: England MU18s 2-1 Belgium": "A well-worked move saw Belgium create their best chance of breaking the deadlock ten minutes before the interval when Manchester City stopper True Grant, son of former Derby, Burnley, and Manchester United goalkeeper Lee, had to make a fine save to keep the scores level.\n\nBut the Young Lions responded well after the break and came out of the blocks refreshed in the second half – having two efforts in two minutes.\n\nThe first chance in particular showed England’s ability to move the ball incisively and with purpose. Ndala, who switched to the left flank to get at the Belgium defence, picked out Arsenal’s Amario Cozier-Duberry on the right but he could only shoot straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nA fast-paced beginning to the second half continued when Belgium had a huge chance to take the lead, but Fofana was unable to stretch enough to make clean contact from six yards after the ball was flashed in low from the left by Idumbo Muzambo.\n\nA frantic five minutes then ensued, with Grant having to make a crucial double save – first low to his right and then high to his left as England were put on the backfoot.\n\nAnd after 68 minutes, an unfortunate breakdown in communication between Grant and captain Josh Feeney (pictured above) led to the defender heading backwards over his oncoming goalkeeper and into an empty net to give Belgium the lead.\n\nBut England didn’t let their heads drop and were back level three minutes later as Cozier-Duberry linked up cleverly with Jamie Donley to break into the box and smash the ball home from a tight angle.\n\nGrant, quickly becoming the standout performer on the day, again had to be on his toes to produce another superb stop, this time from point blank range, and again from a low ball across the face of goal from the Belgian left which was stabbed goalward.\n\nIt was to prove crucual, as ten minutes from time substitute Dominic Ballard, scorer of both goals on Friday, got the winner for England as he poked home past Belgium ‘keeper Tom Poitoux.\n\nThe Little Red Devils’ second-half showing was chalk and cheese from their first, but they had two final opportunities to snatch a draw. Firstly, a good run by Enock Agyei saw the ball cut back to Roméo Monticelli on the edge of box but the substitute couldn’t find the net.\n\n\n\nA series of hopeful long balls forward were largely dealt with by the Young Lions, as Belgium looked for one last chance to salvage something.\n\nThat chance came with the final action of the match on 94 minutes, as a Belgian cross from the right was headed on target and destined for the bottom corner, only for Grant to ‘save’ his best until last, as he got down to his left once more and ensured the hard-fought win was England’s.\n\nEngland: 1 True Grant (Manchester City), 2 Jacob Wright (Manchester City), 3 Lino Sousa (Arsenal), 4 Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), 5 Tyler Fredricson (Manchester United), 6 Josh Feeney (Aston Villa) (c), 7 Joel Ndala (Manchester City), 8 Jobe Bellingham (Birmingham City), 9 Jamie Donley (Tottenham Hotspur), 10 Nico O’Reilly (Manchester City), 11 Amario Cozier-Duberry (Arsenal).\n\nSubstitutions: 14 Bobby Clark (Liverpool) on for O’Reilly (45’), 21 Kane Taylor (Manchester City) on for Sousa (45’), William Alves (Leicester City) on for Ndala (60’), 23 Sai Sachdev (Sheffield United) on for Wright (60’), 20 Dominic Ballard (Southampton) on for Donley (74’), 16 Leo Castledine (Chelsea) on for Bellingham (77’), 12 Alfie Dorrington (Tottenham Hotspur) on for Fredricson (77’), 15 Harry Whitwell (West Bromwich Albion) on for Mainoo (89’), 18 Samuel Rak-Sakyi (Chelsea) on for Cozier-Duberry (89’), 19 Max Alleyne (Manchester City) on for Feeney (89’).\n\nSubstitutes not used: 13.

    "Bishops in Belgium authorize prayer for committed gay couples": "BRUSSELS (CNS) — The Flemish-speaking bishops of Belgium have appointed a contact person for ministry to and with gay Catholics and have authorized prayer for committed gay couples on the condition it is clear that it is not equivalent to a wedding blessing.\n\nThe document, “Being pastorally close to homosexual persons: For a welcoming church that excludes no one,” was dated Sept. 20 and posted on the website of the Belgian bishops.\n\nThe Flemish bishops include Cardinal Josef De Kesel of Mechelen-Brussels, Bishop Johan Bonny of Antwerp, Bishop Lodewijk Aerts of Bruges, Bishop Lode Van Hecke of Ghent and Bishop Patrick Hoogmartens of Hasselt.\n\nThe document concludes with a sample “Prayer for love and faithfulness.”\n\n“During pastoral meetings,” the bishops said, “the request is often made for a moment of prayer to ask that God bless and make endure their commitment of love and fidelity.”\n\nThe “concrete content and form” of the prayer “is best discussed by those involved and a pastoral leader,” the bishops said. The prayer should take place “in all simplicity” and “the difference should remain clear between that and what the church understands by a sacramental marriage.”\n\nThe sample “moment of prayer” in the document included a Scripture reading and words by the couple expressing their desire for God to strengthen their union and help them be always faithful to each other.\n\nIt also included the possibility of a “prayer of the community” that “God’s grace may work in them to care for each another and for the broader community in which they live” and would end with a blessing, although the document did not specify whether it was a general blessing for everyone present or a blessing of the couple.\n\nThe then-Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in a March 2021 response to questions, said the Catholic Church “does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless” same-sex unions.\n\n“It is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage” between a man and a woman “as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex,” the congregation said, adding that Pope Francis approved the response.\n\nTo bless same-sex unions would serve “to approve and encourage a choice and a way of life that cannot be recognized as objectively ordered to the revealed plans of God,” the doctrinal office said.\n\nThe Vatican press office had no comment when asked about the Belgian bishops’ statement Sept. 20.\n\nThe Flemish bishops said their pastoral approach in ministry to and with gay Catholics is one of “encounter and conversation.”\n\n“Believers who are in a stable homosexual relationship desire respect and appreciation,” they said. “It hurts when they feel that they do not belong or are excluded.”\n\nThe church in Belgian, the bishops said, has been trying for years “to create a climate of respect, recognition and integration” and to welcome the participation in church life of LGBTQ Catholics. To give that commitment a more formal pastoral structure, they said, they have appointed Willy Bombeek to lead a special office within the Interdiocesan Family Pastoral Service and have asked each diocese to make a similar appointment.\n\n“Let’s be clear: We are not talking about marriage. It’s not a marriage. In the Catholic tradition, marriage is between a man and a woman,” Bombeek told Catholic News Service in Rome Sept. 21. “But the Flemish bishops sensed that there was a need, that in the community — from the Catholic LGBT community and their families — that there was a need for a recognition of their union.”\n\nGay and lesbian couples can marry civilly in Belgium, he said, but many Catholic couples also wanted a moment of prayer with their families in a Catholic church or chapel to pray for God’s grace.\n\n“The bishops listened,” he said.\n\nThe sample text of a prayer for “love and fidelity,” Bombeek said, asks that God “may bless and confirm their commitment” to each other.\n\n“It is explicitly not a marriage,” he said. “We are not in conflict with the Vatican. We are loyal.”\n\n“I have received so many notes from gay people,” he said. They welcome the document as “a message of hope” and an affirmation that they are children of God and members of the Catholic community.\n\nGeert De Kerpel, spokesperson for the Flemish bishops, also told CNS Sept. 21 that the document was not issued “in defiance” of the Vatican’s doctrinal office. “I have told that to the many journalists who contacted me again and again, but apparently in vain with most of them.”\n\n***\n\nContributing to this story was Cindy Wooden in Rome.",

    "Wout van Aert relishes ‘perfect’ day for Belgium as Remco Evenepoel dominates road world championships": "Wout van Aert and Remco Evenepoel rewrote the ending of last year’s script of the 2021 derailed rainbow jersey bid to score big Sunday at the Wollongong road world championships.\n\nLike the disaster day that saw the Belgian team implode in front of thousands of fans in Leuven, Evenepoel escaped into an unlikely early move Sunday.\n\nBut unlike in 2021, the pocket rocket long-range specialist rode everyone off his wheel and dived straight into the rainbow jersey in a move that was straight out of the team bus briefing.\n\nAlso read: Evenepoel goes solo for sensational UCI Road World Championship victory\n\nCo-captain Van Aert missed the medals with a fourth-place finish but was more than consoled by a redemptive day for his blue-clad crew.\n\n“Of course, I am very happy with this title,” Van Aert said. “It was a fantastic race. You can determine tactics in advance, but if it also works out that way, awesome. When Remco moved with that group, I knew it was dangerous, but it was also a good situation for the team.”\n\n‘It will be a big party tonight’\n\nAll eyes were on Van Aert and Evenepoel this weekend. Last year, the two dissolved into dispute and accusation when Evenepoel rode clear in the chaotic streets of Flanders and didn’t look back when the team tactic was to ride for Van Aert as the sole leader.\n\nThe Belgian beef simmered some time before the two towed the party line, and insisted they would race Sunday with two clear leaders.\n\nBut with Evenepoel hot off Vuelta a España victory and Van Aert the terminator of the Tour de France, would the two Belgian ballers ride for national pride or personal ambition?\n\n“I think how we raced today really like a team. Like I said before, we wanted to become a world champion as a team, it didn’t matter how,” Evenepoel said.\n\n“It was Wout’s chance or my chance, it was my chance to go from early and Wout was to follow along and sprint. I guess the early attack made it today. But I just think we deserve it. We really deserve it.”\n\nAlso read: Can Evenepoel, Van Aert right the wrongs of 2021 at UCI Road World Championships?\n\nAs one of the leading nations in pro cycling, it seemed off-key that Belgium hadn’t worn elite rainbow bands for 10 years.\n\nPhilippe Gilbert was last into rainbows when he won the Valkenburg race in 2012, and home fans expected big things from a Van Aert-Evenepoel twin assault.\n\nVan Aert buried any personal pride at missing his own chance Sunday, and was among the first to congratulate Evenepoel at the finish.\n\n“It was our tactic that Remco would join attacks early with Quinten [Hermans] and when they did, it was a perfect situation also for me,” Van Aert said.\n\n“It took really long before countries realized it was dangerous when normally you should expect the chase would be full-on. But instead, it was a comfortable situation. It was our tactic, and when you see how Remco finished it with a long solo, he was just the strongest.”\n\nEvenepoel profited from the confusion and chaos of championship racing Sunday. Top favorites like Julian Alaphilippe, Michael Matthews and Tadej Pogačar missed the decisive split that let Evenepoel off the leash and only caught back in time to sprint for consolation places.\n\nVan Aert didn’t fully realize the situation on the road, and missed out on scoring a Belgian one-three when he was beaten to the line by Matthews and Christophe Laporte.\n\nBut for him, the race was already won.\n\n“We knew going into the last lap Evenepoel was alone, but without radio it’s really hard to have proper information and it’s already a strange race with nations, and without radio it makes it even more complicated,” Van Aert said.\n\n“That’s why I didn’t sprint for podium places. That’s a bit disappointing but I cannot complain. We won the race and I’m super happy with that.”\n\nThe sound of beers in the Belgian team bus will ripple across the world to the beerhalls of their bike-mad homeland Sunday.\n\n“It will be a big party tonight,” Evenepoel said. “I’m not going to see my bed I guess.”",

    "Migrant smugglers using private aircrafts grounded in Belgium and Italy": "Supported by Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the United States dismantled a criminal network involved in migrant smuggling, document fraud and money laundering.\n\n© Belgian authorities\n\nUp to EUR 20 000 for a place in private aircraft\n\nThe migrants, mainly Iraqi and Iranian of Kurdish origin, boarded private aircrafts in Türkiye carrying false diplomatic passports. However, the official destinations of the trips (usually the Caribbean) were never reached. During the stopovers at different European airports, including in Austria, France and Germany, the migrants left the plane, disposed of their false passports and systematically applied for asylum. The suspects charged up to EUR 20 000 per smuggled person.\n\nIt is believed that, between October and December 2020, at least five smuggling operations took place in five different European countries. In addition, several plans were made to carry out other smuggling operations. In addition to migrant smuggling and forging identity documents, the organised crime group is also suspected of issuing false checks and scamming airlines in an attempt to build its own fleet. The suspects also allegedly defrauded hotels by not paying the invoices.\n\nThe action day on 13 September led to:\n\n5 arrests (2 in Belgium and 3 in Italy)\n\n7 house searches (1 in Belgium and 6 in Italy)\n\nSeizures of 2 aircrafts, EUR 80 000 EUR cash, 1 high–end car, electronic equipment and equipment to forge ID documents (card printers, stamps, holograms and white plastic cards)\n\nEUR 173 000 EUR frozen in Italy\n\nEurojust supported the authorities involved with the setting up and funding of a joint investigation team (JIT) in June 2021. The Agency also hosted four coordination meetings to facilitate judicial cooperation and provide support for the coordinated investigative efforts.\n\nEuropol prioritised the case at an early stage, assigning a dedicated analyst and specialist to support the national investigations to identify the members of the criminal network and to dismantle it. Europol facilitated the operational information exchange and provided analytical and financial support. On the action day, Europol activated a Virtual Command Post to facilitate the information exchange in real time. Europol also deployed three analysts – one to Belgium and two to Italy – to cross-check operational information against Europol’s databases and thus provided further investigative leads to the participating national law enforcement authorities.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities involved:\n\nAustria : Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat)\n\n: Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat) Belgium : Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem\n\n: Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem France : French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières)\n\n: French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières) Germany : German Federal Police Munich Airport\n\n: German Federal Police Munich Airport Italy : National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari)\n\n: National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari) United States: U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Diplomatic Security Service.\n\nJudicial authorities involved:",

    "Copy Cats Belgium make the Quarter-Finals again after best ever run": "SYDNEY (Australia) - After making the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup Semi-Finals on their 2018 debut, the Belgian Cats are eyeing up a repeat after making the Quarter-Finals in Sydney.\n\n\"It feels good because sometimes I think that we forget that we're small Belgium and that is only our second Women's World Cup. I think it's something we can be proud of.\"\n\nThey booked their spot with a commanding 85-55 success against Bosnia and Herzegovina as they also won three games in a row in the competition for the first time in their short history.\n\nHaving lost their opener against USA, they followed up victories against Korea and Puerto Rico by brushing aside their European rivals thanks mainly to Hind Ben Abdelkader and Kyara Linskens. The former fired 18 points and Linskens returned 13 points and 7 rebounds. Meanwhile Julie Allemand also handed out 9 assists.\n\nThis is the second Quarter-Finals appearance in as many Women's World Cup appearances for Belgium an impressive accomplishment that is not lost upon one of the team's leader Julie Allemand.\n\n\"It feels good because sometimes I think that we forget that we're small Belgium and that is only our second Women's World Cup.

    "Analysing Belgium's 2022 UCI Road World Championships teams": "Ahead of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships, Cyclingnews is taking a deep dive into the key teams for the elite road races. Here, we put Belgium under the microscope.\n\nHistory\n\nBelgium is the most successful nation in men's road race history at the UCI Road World Championships. They've amassed 26 rainbow jerseys, while on the women's side they are the fourth-most successful nation with six wins.\n\nHowever, the past two decades have been relatively barren for the Belgian teams, with only two gold medals and a total of five since the turn of the Millennium. Long gone are the dominant years of Rik Van Steenbergen, Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx, and Freddy Maertens.\n\nOn the women's side, meanwhile, the cupboard is barer still. They haven't collected a medal since 1982 and there hasn't been a rainbow jersey since Nicole Van den Broeck's triumphant ride in Barcelona nine years before that. Two-thirds of their rainbow jerseys came via Nicole Reynders between 1959 and 1966.\n\nThe Belgian men's last three medals have been spread out across 16 years, which is some achievement given the depth of talent the country has turned out in that time. Philippe Gilbert's win in Valkenburg a decade ago counts as their most recent victory.\n\nLine-up\n\nMen elite\n\nWout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nStan Dewulf (AG2R Citroën)\n\nRemco Evenepoel (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nQuinten Hermans (Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert)\n\nYves Lampaert (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nPieter Serry (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nJasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo)\n\nNathan Van Hooydonck (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nWomen elite\n\nLotte Kopecky (SD Worx)\n\nValerie Demey (Liv Racing Xstra)\n\nJulie De Wilde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJustine Ghekiere (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJesse Vandenbulcke (Le Col-Wahoo)\n\nJulie Van de Velde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nKey riders\n\nVan Aert and Evenepoel will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2021 road race fall-out (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nMen\n\nFew other nations in the peloton can boast a squad of left-behind riders which could feasibly compete as a standalone team in Wollongong, but Belgium have seen fit to leave a plethora of notable names back home.\n\nClassics men Greg Van Avermaet, Dylan Teuns, Tim Wellens, Oliver Naesen and Victor Campenaerts join climbers Mauri Vansevenant and Ilan Van Wilder – plus sprinters Tim Merlier, Jasper Philipsen and Arnaud De Lie – in all missing the cut for the final eight-man selection.\n\nHeading up that group in Australia, though, is one of the top favourites for the rainbow jersey in Wout van Aert. The 28-year-old has once again been one of the best riders in the world this season and will be racing to plug a rare gap in his palmarès on Sunday.\n\nHe can win from large groups, reduced sprints, solo moves, and can last over the hills as well – a perfect combination of strengths for the tough hilly finishing circuit. He's in great form, too – the past month has seen him win the Bretagne Classic, take second at the Bemer Cyclassics and GP de Montréal, and finish fourth in the GP de Quebéc. It will take some doing to get the better of Van Aert.\n\nFresh Vuelta a España champion Remco Evenepoel is his main lieutenant, with the pair hopefully avoiding a fall-out that tarnished their home Worlds last time out. The 22-year-old has stepped up several levels this season with Liège-Bastogne-Liège another new addition to his palmarès. If he races for the team and avoids getting caught up in media spats, he'll be a key cog in the potential victory machine.\n\nNext in line is Jasper Stuyven, a man who was inches away from a medal in his hometown of Leuven last year – yep, such is Belgium's strength in depth. The 30-year-old is a top calibre Classics man but with the harsh hills on the menu throughout the day he's likely to serve firmly in a team helper role.\n\nQuickStep-AlphaVinyl strongman Yves Lampaert is another Classics specialist who will be flogging himself at the service of his leaders, while Quinten Hermans – who last month said he wasn't expecting a call-up – is a dangerous option to have in reserve on the hilly course.\n\nKopecky won in Belgian colours on home ground at the Tour of Flanders – can she do it in Australia? (Image credit: Bas CzerwinskiGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men's team have an overall favourite and a couple of other options should things go south for Van Aert, for the women it's all about Lotte Kopecky if they're to take the rainbow jersey for the first time in almost half a century.\n\nIn recent seasons, the 26-year-old has done little but improve, to the point where she's enjoyed the best campaign of her career in 2022. She may not have won since her June national time trial title, but spring saw Kopecky take glory at Strade Bianche and the Tour of Flanders in addition to a second place at Paris-Roubaix.\n\nAs evidenced by her victory over fellow Worlds favourite Annemiek van Vleuten in Siena back in March, she has evolved far beyond the rider she was in seasons past and represents Belgium's best chance at victory in the women's race in years, even if her participation had initially looked in doubt following a hard Tour de France Femmes.\n\nOf Kopecky's five helpers in Australia, none are serious threats to win or medal as Evenepoel or Stuyven could be. The team will be dedicated to helping her break their country's lean spell in the race. Teen talent Julie De Wilde is the next-strongest woman in the squad, the 19-year-old having put in several impressive rides throughout 2022.\n\nShe recently headed up a Plantur-Pura podium sweep at the women's GP de Wallonie and was second at Dwars door Vlaanderen back in March. It won't be her year this time around but she's certainly a rider to take note of for the future.\n\nStrengths\n\nMen\n\nThe strength of the men's squad comes through their depth, with perhaps only the French squad their equal in that regard. Year after year, others look to the Belgians to take control of the race, and that is unlikely to change on Sunday.\n\nFew other nations can boast a series of helpers like Stuyven, Hermans, Lampaert and Van Hooydonck, and fewer still have a one-two punch like Van Aert and Evenepoel.\n\nIt looks like it will take some doing to derail the light blue train in Wollongong, with repeated attacks likely to be the order of the day to disrupt Van Aert's best-laid plans.\n\nKey option Jasper Stuyven took fourth last year in his hometown of Leuven (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the Netherlands come to the start of almost every major championship with the strongest squad in the race, it doesn't always translate to the expected glory at the finish. Last year in Leuven and at the Tokyo Olympics things didn't turn out their way despite boasting a plethora of favourites.\n\nAgain, they take the start in Australia in a similar situation, the potential for a muddled tactical race lurking below the surface of the powerhouse squad. For Belgium there will be no such dilemmas or recriminations as Kopecky enjoys sole leadership.\n\nIn a race such as the Worlds, which can be chaotic and unpredictable, there is value in having a defined team structure with a clear leader. Every woman in the Belgian squad will take the start in Helensburgh with a clear role and strategy in their head.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMen\n\nOne worry among very few for the men's squad is Van Aert's sprint at the end of a long, hard race – assuming he's in the lead group at the finish, of course. While the superstar has shown time and again that he can do it all, there have been several pertinent examples of him just falling short at the final hurdle when he might, on paper, be expected to clean up.\n\nAt the recent GP de Montréal, Van Aert gave a glimpse of how he might be beaten in Wollongong, missing out in the sprint to Tadej Pogačar at the end of a 221km race with over 4,000 metres of elevation – a parcours similar to Sunday's road race.\n\nDespite being one of the best finishers in the world, a worn-down Van Aert won't be a dead-cert to triumph in a finishing sprint even against non-sprinters. It's something to keep in mind if his rivals can't get away from him before the finale.\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men have a plan B in Evenepoel and even something approaching a plan C or D in Stuyven and Hermans, it's hard to say the same about the women's squad. It's going to be all-in for Kopecky on Saturday, barring a miraculous overperformance from one of her domestiques.\n\nThat's not to do down the squad, though, but not every nation can be like the Netherlands or Italy, those squads blessed with various leadership options. It's worth remembering, though, that in Kopecky they have a real option for victory, which has been a rarity for some time.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt's astounding to look at the list of top riders Belgium have enjoyed in their colours over the years and remember that they haven't taken home an elite road race rainbow jersey in a decade – far longer in the women's case.\n\nNothing is certain at the Worlds, some of the longest days in the saddle all season. That's true for Belgium as it is for any other nation in the race. The country does have legitimate hopes, rather than far-fetched dreams, of taking a rainbow jersey at the weekend, though.\n\nIn Van Aert, Evenepoel, and Kopecky, they have a trio of leaders that most nations would envy, and it would take a brave onlooker to bet against them taking home one medal, whatever colour.",

A bio-rotor functions as a water purification plant. A bicycle path has also been built. These facilities are intended to help the company reach its target to emit approximately 30% less CO2 by 2030; by 2040, it wants to have reduced its climate gas emissions by 90%.\n\nDPD BeLux now has two international hubs – one in Oirschot in the Netherlands, which serves Northern Europe and the UK, and the new hub in Vilvoorde, which supports Belgium. In Belgium and Luxembourg, DPD BeLux now has one hub and eight depots from which a fleet of over 1,000 vehicles operates. The company provides work for around 1,500 families.\n\nRichard de Haas, CEO of DPD BeLux, said, “Our ambition is to become the international reference for sustainable parcel delivery. We will put even more emphasis on international growth, innovation and the transformation required by the current market. The figures show that e-commerce continues to grow and that the potential of the Belgian and Luxembourg market is significant. During the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to our strengths in the B2C [business-to-consumer] segment, we had additional opportunities and made our mark on the market. With the new depots and our new hub, we are absolutely ready for the future.”\n\nHans Bonte, the Mayor of Vilvoorde, added, “As a city, we are extremely pleased with the arrival of DPD BeLux. As an important player in the ‘new economy’, the company is fully committed to sustainability and climate-friendly entrepreneurship. Without exaggeration, the new hub can be considered a leader for many other companies in our region. Moreover, the company is a boon to our labor market. On the one hand, Vilvoorde has an exceptionally high number of hard-to-fill vacancies. On the other hand, the city has a high level of structural unemployment among relatively unskilled people. This opportunity makes the situation a win-win situation. In any case, the city council is ready to determine, together with the VDAB [the Flemish Service for Employment and Vocational Training]and DPD, how we can mutually combine our efforts.”",

I am a freelance writer, content creator, digital marketing educator, and strategist, and I am currently in the process of setting up my business in Belgium.\n\nAll that said, our life is much more affordable here for a few reasons.\n\nHousing\n\nIn the US, we lived in Brookland, a quiet residential neighborhood in Northeast Washington, DC, a 15-minute drive to downtown DC and on the metro line. We paid almost $3,000 a month in mortgage costs on our 1,500-square foot attached rowhome.\n\nIn Brussels, we found an apartment similar in size, and we currently pay 2,000 euros (around $2,000). Our apartment is located in a neighborhood similar to DC's Logan Circle, with shops, restaurants, and easy access via public transportation to the city center of Brussels and the European institutions. A similar apartment in Washington, DC, costs almost $5,000 monthly. We're currently looking to purchase a similar-sized apartment, and the mortgage costs look similar to our current rent.\n\nChildcare\n\nWe were fortunate that our daughter started kindergarten in Brussels, thus saving the cost of full-time childcare that used to cost us $2,000 a month in Washington, DC. Aftercare was also pricey in DC, with an average cost of around $1,000 a month.\n\nOur daughter attends a Dutch-language public elementary school, and we pay the equivalent of $60 a month in aftercare. In addition, we receive around $150 equivalent stipend from the Belgian government to help with the cost of having a child. So technically, our childcare is free.\n\nDuring the summers, private and public institutions offer camps, averaging 100-150 euros a month. This summer, my daughter attended swim camp for 150 euros a week, and we were eligible to receive a small refund of 20% from our health insurance.\n\nHealthcare\n\nAnother factor influencing our move to Europe was access to affordable healthcare. My husband's benefits package includes a health insurance supplement covering hospitalization and dental for around $55 a month for our whole family.\n\nGeneral practice doctors charge around $30 for a consultation, but we get 95% of that cost reimbursed almost immediately.\n\nIn Washington, DC, I had Tricare (military insurance provider) through the Marine Corps Reserve and paid $250 monthly for a family plan, considered affordable in the United States. When I worked for the federal government as a civilian, we paid $425 for my family plan.\n\nFood and drink\n\nWhether eating at home or eating out, food costs are still more affordable in Brussels despite inflation on both continents.\n\nI travel back and forth to the United States often and have the opportunity to compare prices. I find fruits and vegetables especially affordable in Brussels versus the United States. Seasonality is key, and given that Belgium shares a border with four countries (France, Germany, Netherlands, and Luxemburg), we get quality products from a 200-mile radius.\n\nFor example, a 10-pound bag of potatoes grown in the south of Belgium goes for 4 euros (around $4.50) at the supermarket. In DC, the same bag costs $10. Farmer's markets can be found throughout the city and, unlike in the United States, prices at the farmer's markets are more affordable than the supermarkets most of the time.\n\nFree trade through the European Union makes the wine extremely affordable. You can get a fabulous bottle from Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and beyond for less than $8.\n\nI also find dining out more affordable, given the lower costs of wine and beer. A dinner for two at an upscale restaurant in Brussels averages $60 per person. A comparable restaurant in Washington, DC, will cost almost double, especially when you factor in a 20% tip. Tipping is not common in Belgium as the service charge is already included in the cost of the meal. You can round up your check or give 5-10% to the server if you get exceptional service.\n\nTransportation\n\nI don't have a car in Brussels and don't plan to have one. I have three supermarkets and two farmer's markets within a half-mile radius, and plenty of restaurants, cafes, and shops.\n\nI walk our daughter to school (10 minutes away), and I either walk to the city center (30 minutes) or take the tram or bus. Public transportation for children under 12 is free, and I buy my public transport passes in bulk to save 25%, making it less than $2 per ride.\n\nMy husband has a company car, a common perk for people in Belgium who work in middle/upper management, consulting, and sales roles. He only pays a tax fee (as the car can be used for unlimited private mileage) of $350 a month. In Washington, DC, we shared a car, and between car payments, insurance, and gas, we spent $600 a month.\n\nTravel\n\nOne of the perks of living in Brussels is the proximity to many European destinations by rail, car, or plane. I keep my eye out for sales on the Thalys rail system, which takes you from Brussels to Paris in 75 minutes. We can get them as cheap as $65 roundtrip if we book in advance.\n\nI've flown from Brussels to Madrid this year for $80 and to Oslo, Norway, for $100 via Brussels Airlines. I also skip chain hotels and stay at locally-owned boutique hotels and guesthouses, which usually include free breakfast, averaging 80-120 euros depending on the destination. Domestic flights within the US on a regular carrier can range from $250-500 per person for the same distance.\n\nHow we feel about our move\n\nDo we get homesick for Washington, DC? Absolutely! Brussels is not perfect (anyone who has dealt with the Belgian administration can attest), but we're happy with our choice as we're gaining so much for our family.\n\nWe're a short drive/train ride away from my in-laws, we're saving money, and our daughter is growing up in a multilingual environment. When we get tired of Brussels, we can hop on a train to Paris, London, or Amsterdam, or drive to the Grand Est region of France or the Mosel Valley in Germany. For a family who loves to travel and eat good food, Brussels is the perfect place for us.",
    "Iran-Belgium prisoner swap: Belgian court to decide on controversial exchange treaty": "\"It's been more than 203 days since I last saw my best friend,\" said Olivier Van Steirtegem as he runs his fingers swiftly across his piano in his home in Brussels, playing a mesmerizing jazz tune. It's a tribute to his friend, Olivier Vandecasteele, who was arrested on February 24 by Iranian authorities on charges of spying.\n\n\"This song I'm playing is 'John Boy' by Brad Mehldau. It was the last one Olivier and I listened to together, before he was arrested by Iran,\" Van Steirtegem, 42, who is the owner of an office furniture store, told DW. \"He is now in complete isolation in a cell and in a poor psychological state. He isn't eating well, has an infection and has lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nVandecasteele, a 41-year-old humanitarian aid worker, had been living and working in Iran since 2015. He had been exploring options to move out of the country and eventually start a new project.\n\n\"But the Iranian authorities had different plans for him,\" said Van Steirtegem.\n\nOlivier Van Steirtegem, right, has started a petition asking the Belgian government to take action to free his friend\n\nFlipping through an album of pictures together, he remembered the fateful day in February when he got the phone call about Vandecasteele's arrest.\n\n\"The neighbors said he was in his apartment in Tehran and was waiting for a pizza delivery. But when his doorbell rang, instead of the pizza delivery person, Iranian authorities forced themselves into his flat and arrested him,\" Van Steirtegem said.\n\n'We are sending a message that we are weak'\n\nIn order to get him released, on July 21, the Belgian government ratified a prisoner exchange treaty with Iran. According to the treaty, Iranians imprisoned in Belgium, would be allowed to serve their sentence in Iran and vice versa.\n\nBut the treaty has been slammed by some members of the Belgian parliament, including some Iranian dissidents, critics of the regime in Teheran, as well as human rights groups who fear that this would lead to the release of Assadollah Assadi — an Iranian diplomat who has been serving a 20-year prison sentence in Belgium for trying to plot a bomb attack on a rally organized by rivals of the Iranian regime, in France in 2018.\n\nThey also say that the accord will give Iran a free pass to continue engaging in terrorism and taking people hostage in Iran and around the world.\n\nBelgian court to decide on prisoner swap deal with Iran\n\n\"If Belgium appeases the regime in Iran in this manner, we are sending across a message that we are weak and are ready to give them what they want,\" Darya Safai an Iranian-Belgian Member of the Belgian Parliament, from the Flemish nationalists party, told DW.\n\n\"I have been imprisoned in Iran myself for fighting for women's rights. I completely understand what Olivier's family is going through. But this is not the only isolated case. There are other European hostages in Iran and we need a better solution to ensure they're all released,\" she said.\n\n'Not fair to keep an innocent man in jail'\n\nVandecasteele was arrested and imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges which the Belgian government says are baseless\n\nBesides Vandecasteele, Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Dijalali and French tourist Benjamin Briere are some of the other Western nationals being held hostage in Iran.\n\nOut of 131 Belgian parliamentatians, 79 voted in favor of the prisoner-exchange treaty, while 41 rejected it and 11 abstained from voting.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo acknowledged that it was a tough decision, but said it was not \"blackmail\" and Belgium had to consider the pleas of Vandecasteele's family.\n\n\"What do you say to his family, that we will let him rot in his cell?\" he said in response to criticisms of the treaty.\n\nAccording to AFP, a lawyer representing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an Iranian opposition group in exile, said the Brussels appeal court had agreed to cross-examine the case before allowing the swap.\n\nThe court is legally challenging the Belgian government's decision at a hearing that began on September 19.\n\n'Negotiate with force'\n\nPrisoner swaps often takes place between autocracies and democracies where the latter is keen to bring their citizens back home, and the former is keen to use this tactic to achieve their political goals.\n\nExchanges can take place by either exchanging people held captive, or by exchanging money as in the case of British Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, where the UK transferred money to Iran in order to guarantee her release.\n\nBut Belgian parliamentarian Safai believes that prisoner swaps don't work with Iran, and the only true way to negotiate with the country is with force.\n\n\"That is the only language that the Ayatollahs understand. So solutions in the form of sanctions could work better. It is important for the West to take a united stance in confronting Iran. That's the only way that you can ensure security in Europe and stop the process of Iran taking people hostage,\" she told DW.\n\nA man protests outside the Antwerp Criminal Court, during the trial of Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi, who was sentenced to prison in Belgium last year for his role in a bomb plot.\n\nAt a press conference in Brussels last week organized by the NCRI, John Bercow, a former British politician who was speaker of the House of Commons, shared a similar view and highlighted that such a prison swap would not prove fruitful in the long run.\n\n\"If you give the beast what the beast wants, then the beast will repeatedly follow the same tactics. We have to look at the wider picture and not just focus on isolated cases,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem understands the complexity of this case since it involves swapping an innocent person in exchange for a terrorist. But he believes it is the only way to get his friend released.\n\n\"I might be biased but I think right now, Olivier needs all the support from the Belgian government. This will also give Belgians the impression that their government cares for innocent people like Olivier,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem has also started a petition asking the Belgian government to enable the prompt release of his friend. More than 25,000 people have signed it so far.\n\nCould the Iranian nuclear deal provide an opportunity?\n\nWhile a final decision is still pending from the court, Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a British lecturer in international politics at the University of Cambridge specializing in Iran, told DW that the Iran nuclear talks could also provide an opportunity for the West to negotiate with the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans have advised Belgium not to proceed with this prison swap since they wish to add on to the nuclear negotiations a larger swap of prisoners, which would involve prisoners from a number of European countries as well as Americans,” she told DW.\n\nThree members of US Congress — Randy K.Weber, Louie Gohmert and Brian Fitzpatrick — have sent a letter to the Belgian prime minister asking him to oppose the treaty.\n\n\"I think Belgium feels as though the time is right and there is no guarantee that the negotiations with the nuclear deal will go through. So they don't want to wait and make their citizens in Tehran wait until something on a larger international scale takes place,\" Farmanfarmaian added.\n\nIrrespective of how the law and politics shape the future of the treaty, Van Steirtegem has not lost hope.\n\n\"I know it is going to be a long fight, but I hope to get a call from the government telling me, okay, listen, everything has been cleared and Olivier will be back before Christmas,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what his family and I are looking forward to right now,\" he added.\n\nEdited by: Sonia Phalnikar",
    "Secretary Blinken Travels to Ukraine and Belgium": "Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken traveled to Ukraine today and will travel to Brussels September 9. On September 8, the Secretary arrived in Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and reaffirm our strong commitment to Ukraine. Secretary Blinken announced his intent to notify Congress of over $2.2 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to bolster the security of Ukraine and its neighbors.\n\nThis amount includes $1 billion for Ukraine, an integral part of our sustained commitment to Ukraine to ensure it has the capability to defend against Russia’s continued assault and assist in developing the capabilities Ukraine needs in the future.

These funds will also help replace security assistance that our Allies and partners have provided to Ukraine. The Secretary also announced another $675 million in systems and supplies for the Ukrainian military via the 20th Presidential Drawdown Authority package.\n\nWhile in Kyiv, the Secretary also visited the youngest victims of Russia’s brutal war at the Children’s National Hospital and met with those rebuilding the devastated city of Irpin after Russia’s failed surge towards the capital in February and March of this year.\n\nTomorrow, the Secretary will travel to Brussels to meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the North Atlantic Council.

    "Lalengmawia Ralte after Belgium stint: We have to start early, need better academies": "Starting early and upgrading academies are crucial to lifting the standard of Indian football, feels Lalengmawia Ralte, who has returned from a two-week training camp with Mumbai City FC's sister club in Belgium, Lommel SK.\n\nThe prodigious midfielder, Apuia scored his first goal for the Islanders in the 2022 Durand Cup final against Bengaluru FC.\n\nAlthough Mumbai City FC ended the final on the wrong side of a 2-1 scoreline, the 21-year-old midfielder put in a stellar display in Asia's oldest football tournament and in the AFC Champions League earlier this year.\n\nHe suggested how Indian footballers can compete with foreign players.\n\n\"I think Indian players will be able to compete with or against them, but we need to have better academies.

At 12 they have lunch and then if there is a gym session, we have gym after lunch and later, they go back to their own homes.\" The training stint in Belgium at Lommel SK was an intense experience for the young midfielder as Apuia expressed how fast-paced and gruelling the training was at the Islanders' fellow club from City Football Group.\n\nThe midfielder talked about the main difference between the training at Mumbai City FC and Lommel SK.\n\nAlso Read | AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey: Have to weigh pros and cons regarding promotion-relegation in ISL\n\n\"Training in Belgium was quite difficult since the intensity was high compared to other countries. The main difference was the intensity but the training style was not so different.\" \"...the intensity was so high that you don't have much time on the ball and making quick decisions is a must. I had to adapt to the speed of the game as I was playing one or two touches and making quick decisions.\n\n\"My training at Lommel SK has helped me refine my decision making on the field.\" Apuia also recalled how he fit into the squad. \"It was not too difficult fitting in the squad, but you need some time to fit in on and off the field.

    "Why has Belgium got so cold recently?": "Credit: Belga.\n\nThe sudden dip in temperatures felt in Belgium and France is due to chilly winds descending from the British Isles onto our shores, French meteorologists explain.\n\nEven if 21 September marks the first day of Autumn, most Belgians heading into work last week will still have been surprised by just how cold it is all of a sudden.\n\nIn the capital, those already having to contend with public transport being disrupted due to Wednesday's strike also had to choose between a scarf and a beanie when heading out, as temperatures had dropped to 7°C. Thursday morning wasn't much warmer.\n\nThis week's temperatures are a stark contrast to the fairly mild conditions last week, leaving many pondering if the cold has come round earlier this year.\n\n'Contrasting temperatures from week to week'\n\nThe sudden cold was also felt in France these past days. A regional paper in the southwestern of the country, La Dépêche, investigated the matter.\n\nThey spoke to Tristan Amm, a meteorologist at Météo France, asking him to explain whether this was going to be the new norm, and what the sudden drop in temperature was due to.\n\nAmm explained that this is not abnormal and that at this time of year \"masses of cold, dry air from the British Isles is something that we often see in all seasons.\"\n\nRelated News\n\nAll the same, the meteorologist did say that the contrast in temperatures is remarkable although \"no (minimum or maximum) records will be broken.\"\n\nAmm stated that Autumn can often bring \"marked weekly contrasts in temperatures.\"\n\nForecast for the end of the week\n\nWill the cold weather continue? Belgium's Royal Meteorological Institute forecasts a slight rise in temperature. While Thursday morning started off cold, the day has become increasingly sunny, reaching a maximum of 20°C in the centre of the country.\n\nOn Friday, Belgium will remain dry but clouds will become thicker. In the south, temperatures will reach a maximum of 15°C, and 19°C to 20°C in the west of the country.\n\nOn Saturday however, there will be a chance of rain in the north of the country, with strong winds. The maximum temperature will vary between 15°C and 19°C.",
    "Critical Mass Belgium: Around 1,200 cyclists join anniversary ride in Brussels": "Critical Mass movement, urging for better bicycle infrastructure. Credit: Belga / Nicolas Maeterlinck\n\nAround 1,200 cyclists took part in the Critical Mass Belgium protest ride on Sunday afternoon from the Parc du Cinquantenaire in Brussels to Tour & Taxis, according to police estimates.\n\nCritical Mass Belgium demands better visibility for cyclists in the city and more developed infrastructure for road users.

This is a visible way for them to campaign for future-oriented mobility and to demand a public space “on a human scale.”\n\nWhile some take part simply to seize an opportunity to ride a bike with friends and show that cyclists also matter in urban traffic, others come with more ambitious demands, such as asking for greater consideration by political leaders of the air quality in the Brussels region, and therefore climate issues.",

    "Experience Brussels, Belgium, Like Andi Dorfman on ‘The Bachelorette’": "Get excited, because we’re heading to Belgium!\n\nBrussels, Belgium, is rich in history, architecture, gastronomy, culture, and so much more! The warm, welcoming, and quirky Brussels is a bustling city where there’s always something to do. If you visit, you will discover so many hidden gems and meet people with hearts as big as the vibrant city. All of this makes Brussels the perfect place to fall in love and take your romance to new heights.\n\nAndi Dorfman traveled to Brussels on Season 10 of “The Bachelorette,” and here’s how you can experience the city just like her.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nSteigenberger Wiltcher’s Hotel\n\nBoth Andi and her suitors stayed at the Steigenberger Wiltcher’s Hotel. The hotel is located on the exclusive shopping promenade Avenue Louise in the heart of Brussels and is minutes from some of Brussels’ must-see destinations. The European Union government district, the city center with the Manneken Pis and Grand Place, and multiple train stops are just a short walk away. The hotel always makes luxury and comfort a priority with stylish interiors, premium air conditioning, flatscreen TVs, tea-making facilities, and more.\n\nOne-on-One Date: Get a Taste of Brussels\n\nFor her first one-on-one date in Brussels, Belgium, Andi invited Marcus to explore the city with her. Andi and Marcus walked through the city and spent the day eating lots of local treats. They went into a store and tried local chocolates. The two bought Brussels-themed souvenirs and stopped at a restaurant to try mussels. After lunch, they split a traditional Belgian treat — a Belgian waffle, of course! For the nighttime portion of their date, Andi and Marcus went to Palais des Académies and enjoyed a private dinner.\n\nGroup Date: Get in Touch with Your Peaceful Side\n\nAndi had a special group date for her men while in Belgium! Andi met her guys at Les Ruines de Montaigle in Onhaye, Belgium, where they explored the ruins of an old castle. The group then got on rail bikes (two bikes with a cart between them that you pedal along a track) to continue exploring. They got off and arrived at the Maredsous Abbey monastery, a real working monastery where monks live, work, and study. It’s important to note that if you are traveling with your significant other, no kissing is allowed within the walls of the abbey.",
    "Air Belgium to connect Brussels with South Africa and other countries": "LONDON – Air Belgium will be connecting Belgium with countries in southern Africa, such as South Africa, Madagascar, Lesotho, and others.\n\nRoutes\n\nAir Belgium will be flying to South Africa as a seasonal route. Starting September 14th, the airline will be flying every Wednesday and Sunday to Johannesburg, with a continuation flight to Cape Town.\n\nThis route will fly under the 8th freedom of the air, stating that a foreign airline is allowed to fly cabotage flights while starting in its own country.\n\n“This is an exciting and important chapter for Air Belgium“, says Niky Terzakis, CEO of Air Belgium.\n\n“For Brussels Airport, the launch of the South Africa route by Air Belgium marks an important step in the extension of our network of destinations with Cape Town and Johannesburg,” explains Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport.\n\n“After no less than 20 years, we are particularly proud that this route is open again. This confirms that Brussels Airport is the right choice for Air Belgium’s long-haul services.”\n\n“We both have a diverse clientele, including Belgian and foreign residents, as well as transfer passengers. We also share a passion for exceptional passenger experience and tailored services.”\n\n“This new destination will be operated with Airbus A330-900neo aircraft, which combine environmental and economic performance with excellent comfort. This aircraft fits perfectly with our commitment to developing a sustainable future for aviation.”\n\nThis route is one of the most important for many Belgians. Belgium and South Africa have a deep economic tie, with a yearly amount of 60,000 passengers flying between South Africa and Belgium, and it is expected to rise up to 80,000 at the end of 2024, according to aviation24.be.\n\nAir Belgium will not only be flying directly to South Africa, but they will also open up a partnership with South Africa’s largest airline, Air Link. Together, they will be offering an incredible amount of destinations to the passengers.\n\nDestinations\n\nThe routes that are flown by Air Belgium and Air Link will be to the following destinations:\n\nSouth Africa: Durban, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, George, Skukuza, Upington, Hoedspruit, Nelspruit, Port Elizabeth, Pietermaritzburg, Mthatha, Sishen, Polokwane, Richards Bay, Cape Town, East London\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: Lubumbashi\n\nTanzania: Dar Es Salaam\n\nAngola: Luanda\n\nZimbabwe: Harare, Victoria Falls\n\nNamibia: Windhoek, Walvis Bay\n\nZambia: Lusaka, Ndola, Livingstone\n\nUganda: Entebbe\n\nBotswana: Gabarone, Maun, Kasane\n\nMozambique: Maputo, Vilanculos, Nampula, Pemba, Beira, Tete\n\nLesotho: Moshoeshoe\n\nMadagascar: Antananarivo, Nosy Be\n\n“The social and economic ties between Belgium and South Africa are historic and well established. The historical link between South Africa and Belgium is important, especially considering the importance of Brussels to the European Union.”\n\n“Air access and connectivity in South Africa have seen a watershed moment caused by the COVID pandemic. Airlink is privileged to have survived this change and capitalized on the opportunities that presented themselves.”\n\n“Our reputation is built on our ability to provide exceptional service, unparalleled reliability, on-time flights, and genuine service.”\n\n“Air transport markets are rapidly returning to pre-crisis levels, and there is currently an imbalance between demand and supply, so the timing could not be better for Air Belgium to enter the market with Brussels Airport as a central gateway to Europe, and Johannesburg and Cape Town ensuring reciprocity.”\n\n“It is therefore with great pleasure that we enter into this commercial partnership and welcome Air Belgium to South Africa and Airlink’s comprehensive network of destinations in Southern Africa”, said Rodger Foster, CEO of Airlink.\n\n“We often talk about ‘Belgitude’ and our motto is ‘Fly Belgian Class’, which consists in giving pleasure and comfort to passengers in all travel classes“, says Niky Terzakis.\n\n“And while our travelers appreciate our fun and engaging approach to travel, we also offer them what really matters: a safe and seamless trip, all-inclusive prices including a generous baggage allowance.”\n\n“We also offer travelers an eco-friendly travel option as the Airbus A330neo consumes on average 25% less fuel compared to previous generation aircraft.”\n\n“In terms of comfort, our aircraft offer the best: quieter cabins, adjustable lighting, a state-of-the-art in-flight entertainment system, and Wi-Fi internet connection throughout the flight”.\n\nOverall, this is a big step forward for Air Belgium, especially as the carrier continues its growth strategy overseas.",
    "Projects in Walloon, Belgium point to a future of biomass as an energy source": "The cost of energy is historically high in Belgium and, to add to the problem, fossil fuels are becoming scarcer as we consume them. To adapt, farmers in Wallonia are developing more sustainable and local alternatives, reported Brussels Times One alternative to fossil fuels is biomethanation which consists of the degradation of biomass, such as manure from a livestock farm or organic waste from an agri-food plant. The biomass is heated in a tank to become biogas, which is composed of 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide. This biogas is then purified in order to isolate methane as energy.Simply put, organic matter is recycled to transform it into a source of energy, such as heating systems and compressed natural gas (or CNG, fuel for motor vehicles.)Farmers are able to use the organic matter produced by their livestock to transform it into biomethane (renewable natural gas) to heat farm buildings or sell CNG.The first Walloon biomethanation site was inaugurated in 2020 in Fleurus, Hainaut, and already produces 100,000 tons of output each year.This idea of \"energy community\" also appeals to those on the side of public authorities, such as the municipality of Dour in the province of Hainaut, which hopes to use the biomass from their citizens to produce gas by 2024.The equivalent of one ton of organic waste from households in the municipality would be converted into a product that will either be gas for the network or made into CNG for vehicles.Wallonia has a high potential of 8.7 Tw/h in terms of biomethane and other studies even suggest the figure could go up to 15 Tw/h. This would represent 10% of the annual gas consumption in Belgium.Many believe this alternative energy source has a future in Belgium, even if the costs of installing the equipment necessary for the process are high and will require investors, private or public.",
