    "Gold sourcing and Switzerland in focus at the Human Rights Council": "Melting point: four of the world's biggest gold refineries call Switzerland home. Keystone / Pat Roque\n\nAs the latest session of the Human Rights Council got underway at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva, illegally-mined gold came up in multiple discussions, with the role of importers, including Switzerland, being cited in UN findings.\n\nThis content was published on September 26, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPaula Dupraz-Dobias Paula Dupraz-Dobias is an award-winning Geneva-based journalist covering environment, business, international organizations, humanitarian crises and Latin America.\n\nLast week, a special rapporteur investigating the use of mercury in small-scale gold mining and a UN fact-finding mission on Venezuela presented separate reports to the council on the impact of gold mining on many communities and the environment, particularly in the Amazon basin.\n\nUN investigators cited human rights abuses such as sexual exploitation of women and children, mercury poisoning and child labour affecting communities where illegal gold production occurs, and pointed the finger at the responsibility of countries buying the metal.\n\nThe reports said global buyers such as Switzerland – through which roughly two-thirds of global trade transits – need to ensure that human rights are respected throughout supply chains.\n\nInsatiable demand and a lack of due diligence\n\n“This is a serious issue,” Marcos Orellana, the UN’s special rapporteur on toxic substances, who investigated human rights abuses in small-scale mining, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “In the coming months and years, we can expect further scrutiny by human rights mechanisms of the gold sector and of countries where refiners are located, including Switzerland.”\n\nSwitzerland is the top global importer of gold, having purchased CHF90 billion ($92.3 billion) of the metal in 2021. Four of the biggest refineries globally are located in Switzerland, two of which are foreign-owned.\n\nIn 2020, the Reuters news agency estimated that three of the top refiners – Valcambi, Argor-Heraeus and PAMP – refined roughly 1,500 tonnes of gold annually.\n\nOrellana described to the Human Rights Council last Tuesday how pregnant women in Indigenous communities living downstream from gold mining in the Bolivian jungle had high mercury blood levels due to consumption of contaminated fish, while sexual abuse and violence was prevalent in mining areas. The reportExternal link describes how even on Pacific islands, thousands of kilometres from gold mines, elevated levels of mercury were found in residents, due to global contamination in oceans.\n\nAccording to the UN, some 10 to 15 million people were directly employed in small-scale gold mining globally in 2017, including roughly a million children and 4.5 million women.\n\nMercury, which is used to separate the gold from other substances, is a highly toxic heavy metal, that bio-accumulates in living beings and can cause permanent damage in humans including neurological disorders, reproductive disorders and death.\n\n“The use of mercury is propelled by the insatiable demand for gold by financial markets and jewelers in the wealthiest countries,” Orellana told the Human Rights Council assembly. “Refineries in industrial countries which buy the gold lack adequate mechanisms for due diligence to address the human rights abuses associated with mercury and small-scale gold mining.” The report singled out by name Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which in 2020 topped the Alpine nation in terms of gold imports.\n\nSpeaking to SWI by phone after his exposé, he said that Switzerland needed to do more.\n\n“Switzerland… does not have an adequate traceability system that would require refineries to know where the gold came from and how it was mined,” Orellana said. “The traceability system that Switzerland has ends with the intermediary country. This gap is exploited by criminal syndicates and drug cartels that traffic in mercury and gold.”\n\n“While the gold industry profits, human rights suffer,” he added.\n\nIn Peru’s southeastern Madre de Dios region, SWI previously reportedExternal link how nearly 1,000 square kilometres of rainforest had been lost, as illegal miners sold their gold to buyers, including allegedly in Switzerland, willing to turn a blind eye.\n\nFollowing Orellana’s presentation to the council, more than 40 countries participated in an interactive dialogue on measures needed to reduce human rights abuses in small-scale mining. The Swiss mission was not one of them.\n\nPaola Ceresetti, a spokesperson for the mission, later responded to SWI’s request to comment following the publication of the report. “In Switzerland, the gold trade is controlled by one of the strictest legislations in the world. The law on the regulation of precious metals and money laundering in particular aim to ensure that gold handled by refiners does not originate from fraudulent sources,” she wrote in an email.\n\nVenezuela’s gold abyss\n\nAccording to another related report to the Human Rights Council, armed violence between sindicatos – criminal groups controlling mines – as well as labour and sexual exploitation, and horrific punishments through arbitrary justice, are rife in Venezuela’s gold mining region. The area known as the Arco Minero was created specifically to mine resources as the country’s economy slid, with the hope that it would attract foreign investment. Residents as well as miners were often “caught in a crossfire of violence in the struggle to control gold,” Francisco Cox, a member of the fact-finding mission told journalists.\n\nThe report will be presented in session today to the Human Rights Council.\n\nCox said non-state actors, such as the sindicatos, as well as authorities, including military and civilian leaders, which hold financial interests in mining operations, were responsible for killings, extorsion, corporal punishment and gender-based violence.\n\nWhile official data is sparse and lacking in transparency, various reports estimate that between 70-90% of gold sourced from the mining region is illegally produced, Cox said.\n\nThe Venezuela report recommended that countries importing gold adopt measures to prevent gold laundering as well as money laundering from the gold sourced in Venezuela’s mining regions.\n\nOfficial Swiss data shows that the country stopped importing gold directly from Venezuela in 2016. But since then, there has been concern that gold could wind up in Switzerland after transiting through other countries.\n\nVenezuela’s mission to the UN in Geneva did not respond to a request by SWI to comment on allegations of collusion and involvement of authorities in the gold trade.\n\nTransparency on trial\n\nAs pressure mounts on importers of gold to ensure cleaner sourcing, Swiss refiners recently responded by pledging to remove all gold originating in Indigenous lands from their supply chains. In 2020, Japanese-owned Neuchâtel-based Metalor said it was halting purchases from artisanal mines.\n\nSwiss data nonetheless show that large volumes of gold are imported from non-producing countries, including in the Middle East and Europe, begging the question of where the gold originates.\n\nMany are pushing for answers.\n\nThe Society for Threatened Peoples, a Bern-based NGO, is awaiting a decision in the coming months from the Supreme Court, following its request submitted in 2018 to the federal customs authority to publish files relating to the exact origin of gold imported into the country, arguing that was is in the public interest to know. STP has long investigated illegal gold production in the Amazon and its links to Swiss refiners.\n\nEdited by Virginie Mangin\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",
    "Switzerland: women must work longer": "The Neue Zürcher Zeitung is already calling for further reforms of the pension fund:\n\n“September 25, 2022, will go down in the history of Swiss pension provisions - as a good day. Seventy-five years after the founding of the AHV [Old Age and Survivors' Insurance], the majority is proving that it is willing to adapt the social welfare system to the demands of the present and to accept disadvantages in order to do so. ... There is still a lot of work to do. Despite the reform that has now been passed, new deficits in the pay-as-you-go financing of the AHV still loom from 2029 on.”",
    "Best things to do in Switzerland": "No country has it all, but the Swiss are justified in feeling pretty smug about their lot. Here you’ll find that almost every drive, train journey, boat trip or cable car ride has an element of the epic, taking you to thundering falls, gorges, valleys hidden deep in the mountains and World Heritage vineyards.\n\nCities with medieval old towns, big-hitter galleries and extraordinary cultural cachet are often just a whisper away from vivid turquoise lakes and the glacier-capped Alps. The stride between urban and outdoors is effortless.\n\nWhether you’re floating down the Rhine in Basel, admiring Paul Klee’s punchy art in Bern, hiking below the mighty Matterhorn, feeling the thrill of ice at the Aletsch Glacier, or sipping Chasselas wines in the terraced vineyards of the Lavaux as the last sun touches Lake Geneva like a caress, here’s our rundown of the best 12 things to do in Switzerland.\n\nIt's popular in Basel to go for a leisurely summertime swim in the Rhine © encrier / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nFloat down the Rhine in Basel\n\nAt the point where Switzerland, Germany and France converge in the north, Basel dives into creative waters when it comes to avant-garde art and architecture, with a raft of galleries right up there with Europe’s best. But this city also likes to let its mind drift.\n\nCue the Rhine, where office workers ditch suits and families gather for a city swim on weekends. A novel way to see Basel is to grab a Wickelfisch (a fish-shaped waterproof bag to keep your stuff dry) and then make for the river banks in Kleinbasel, strip to your bathers and float past city landmarks as the current of the river carries you gently downstream. If you prefer to keep your head above water, rent a stand-up paddleboard or join a tour with Birs73. Basler like to end their dip socially, with drinks and a sunbathe at a buvette (riverside bar), especially on hot summer days.\n\nPlanning tip: Hop into the river just below Museum Tinguely to float 3km down the Rhine, or plot your own route by taking a look at the map. You can buy a Wickelfisch at the tourist office on central Barfüsserplatz.\n\nImmerse yourself in the best experiences the world has to offer with our email newsletter delivered weekly into your inbox.\n\nSleep under a Million Stars\n\nIt’s a night silent enough to hear your own heartbeat. Up in the Alps, darkness falls, and the only sound is the gentle chime of cowbells. Constellations and distant planets sprinkle the night sky like handfuls of glitter. Sound beautiful? It is. Harnessing the wild, Million Stars is a huge collection of open-air, one-of-a-kind sleeps across the country, where you can slip back to nature and enjoy a little pre-bedtime stargazing.\n\nBut we’re not just talking canvas here. These imaginative sleeps are ones that you’ll be raving about for years to come – from beautifully made-up beds plonked on top of remote mountains to a stylishly converted gondola on the edge of a crag, a bed under an apple tree and a ‘beehive’ pod with views of Eiger’s mile-high North Face. And with this being Switzerland, they are not just clever but comfortable.\n\nPlanning tip: As each place only sleeps two, advance booking is highly advisable. Most open from July to October.\n\nRide the Glacier Express\n\nNo country nails rail travel like the Swiss, where little red trains (polished and perfectly on time) chug from valley to peak with ease, leaving you to swoon over the Alpine scenery from the comfort of your panoramic carriage. Evoking a golden age of travel, Switzerland’s train journeys are hands-down some of the world’s finest.\n\nThe big one everyone is eager to do once (and with good reason) is the Glacier Express, which crosses over the Furka, Oberalp and Bernina passes on the eight-hour ride between Zermatt and St Moritz in Graubünden’s Upper Engadin. Riveting views of meadows, forests, fast-flowing turquoise rivers, canyons, castles, big-shouldered mountains and glaciers keep you glued to the window. The entire journey is a remarkable feat of 1930s engineering, but special mention goes to the Landwasser viaduct – the gravity-defying six-arched bridge that leaps between Tiefencastel and Filisur, and the Oberalp Pass (2033m), harnessing the true wilderness of the Swiss Alps.\n\nPlanning tip: If you want to save a few francs, regularly scheduled services plying the same route can be just as enjoyable and significantly less expensive. Break up the journey by using cheaper SBB trains and overnighting along the way\n\nHike in the Swiss National Park\n\nFor a taste of the Alps before the tourists rock up, head southeast to the Swiss National Park in Graubünden’s Lower Engadin valley, where the mountains nudge their way over into Italy. Easily accessed from the quaint villages of Scuol, Zernez and S-chanf, Switzerland’s only national park is a 172-sq-km visual feast of rushing streams, high moors, pastures, glaciers, larch, pine woods and lakes. Here, nature has been left totally to its own devices: no trees are felled, no meadows are cut, and no animals have been hunted since the park was founded in 1914.\n\nThe only way to properly see the park is by chucking on boots and heading for its trail-laced heart. If you only have time for one walk, make it Lakes of Macun, a 21km (13-mile) day hike from Zernez, leading to a high Alpine plateau splashed with 23 lakes that shimmer topaz and sapphire. If you prefer, you can join a guided walk with one of the park rangers (you can book these at the visitor center in Zernez). With an expert in tow, you stand better chances of spotting rarities like wild edelweiss, ibex, chamois, golden eagles and bearded vultures.\n\nPlanning tip: Camping is off limits, but you can stay the night at the gloriously remote Chamanna Cluozza. At 1882m above sea level, this is quite possibly the off-grid log cabin of your wildest Alpine dreams. The hut is reached on a moderately challenging 3½-hour uphill hike from Zernez. Bring your own sleeping bag.\n\nA boat ride on Lake Lucerne is brimming with historical sights © Keitma / Shutterstock\n\nBoat across Lake Lucerne\n\nThere are higher mountains in Switzerland than those rimming the fjord-like shores of Lake Lucerne, but none are more enshrined in flag-waving Swiss myth. Boat across the emerald waters of Lake Uri, and you’ll glimpse Rütli Meadow, the hallowed birthplace of the Swiss Confederation in 1291. You can also experience the Tellskapelle, a tiny frescoed chapel where, lore has it, apple-shooting hero and beloved Swiss rebel William Tell escaped from the boat of his Hapsburg captor, Gessler.\n\nLegends swirl like storm clouds over the mountains on the doorstep of Lucerne. Since 1889, the world’s steepest cogwheel railway has been rattling up to 2128m (6981ft) Mt Pilatus, where the restless ghost of Roman prefect Pontius Pilate is said to still roam. Never mind the spook stories; you’ll be captivated by the views reaching as far as Germany’s Black Forest on cloudless days. Its beauty rival is 1797m (5895ft) Mt Rigi, famous for its painterly sunrises and sunsets and once a source of fascination to JMW Turner, who painted it in three different moods.\n\nPlanning tip: Lucerne makes an appealing base for exploring the lake, with its Old Town, medieval wooden bridge and promenade strung along the lakeshore.\n\nTake the Eiger Express to Jungfraujoch\n\nYou’ve got to hand it to the Swiss – they are always ahead of the game. Since 1912, a little red train, fueled by hydro-power from the outset, has curled up to Jungfraujoch, Europe’s highest train station at 3454m (11,332ft), blasting through the icy heart of Eiger. Just recently, the journey has become even more eco-friendly with Grindelwald’s Eiger Express, a fancy, super-speedy new tri-cable gondola that covers the first leg of the journey using its wheels to generate green power. The ride will make you gasp out loud as you float above the landscape, with spruce forests and log chalets giving way to a realm of rock and ice. You’ll get so close to Eiger’s beastly, mile-high North Face that you’ll feel as though you’ll slam right into it.\n\nAt the top of World Heritage Jungfraujoch, temperatures drop, and the world is always white. You’ll be wowed by the view from the Sphinx observation deck, reaching across a sea of snow-capped, 4000m peaks and the 23km swirl of the Aletsch Glacier while Germany and France hover in the distance. The frosty Ice Palace is a wonderland of ice tunnels and sculptures – they are impressive today but must have been even more so back when mountaineers first hacked them out by pickaxe in the 1930s.\n\nDetour: Bring warm layers and boots, particularly if you fancy the 45-minute stomp to Mönchsjochhütte, Switzerland’s highest-serviced mountain hut.\n\nDrive the Furka Pass\n\nYou won’t be able to tell if it’s the stomach-flipping hairpin bends or the gobsmacking views that make your heart beat so wildly on this high, twisty, up-and-over-the-Alps drive from the isolated valley of the Goms in Valais to mountain-encrusted Andermatt in Uri – the gateway to southeast Switzerland.\n\nDrive the 31km (19-mile) Furka Pass from west to east to maximize the drama as dark, craggy peaks and glaciers fill your rear-view mirror. If you have a bit of a Bond moment behind the wheel, it’s no coincidence; this road starred in the car chase scene in the 1964 movie Goldfinger. As you swing dizzily around switchbacks, the road tops out at the 2429m (7969ft) Furka Pass, where you can peer across the lunar rockscape of a wind-battered plateau to the deeply-crevassed Rhône Glacier and its ice grotto before the long, sweeping descent to Andermatt.\n\nPlanning tip: The road is open roughly from June to October (depending on snow conditions) but check conditions before heading out.\n\nGo offbeat in Ticino’s valleys\n\nIn the sultry, parle Italiano canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland, it’s the lakes that get all the love. But dip into Ticino’s hidden valleys, and you’ll lose the crowds and find the region’s true pulse. Here glassy, jewel-colored rivers float past chestnut woods and insanely pretty granite hamlets cresting hilltops (including Switzerland’s smallest, Corippo, with a population of just 15).\n\nAnd after a day’s hike or bike ride, you can kick back on the vine-swathed terrace of a rustic grotti (tavern) for polenta and brasato (beef braised in red wine) with a glass of the beefy local Merlot red wine.\n\nThe wild, woody Valle Maggia is a magnet to mountain bikers and hikers, laced with 700km (435 miles) of trails, including the challenging 52km (32-mile), six-day Via Alta, spotlighting the region’s best. For more adventure, head over to the rugged Val Verzasca, bisected by its namesake emerald river and crisscrossed by the Sentiero Verzasca trail. Every Alpine activity imaginable is offered in this valley, from hiking and cycling to rafting, bouldering, paragliding and bungee jumping from the 220m Verzasca Dam, which starred in the opening scene of Golden Eye. Swissraft makes it happen.\n\nHit up Switzerland's capital city of Bern for superb museums, medieval landmarks and lovely river and Alps views © Marcus Lindstrom / iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nGet a culture fix in Bern\n\nYou might have an I-can’t-believe-it’s-the-capital moment roaming the streets of Bern, with its refreshingly easygoing vibe, parks and alfresco cafes, resident bears and lush backdrop of hills. The city is certainly a looker, situated on a sharp bend in the startlingly turquoise Aare River, rimmed by gentle hills and with views of the snow-frosted Alps on crisp, clear days. And you can get your cultural kicks here too.\n\nBegin with a romp around the Altstadt, Bern’s medieval, cobbled, arcaded, flag-bedecked Unesco World Heritage heart. Here you’ll spy the ornate Zytglogge clock (come at four minutes before the hour for the glockenspiel parade), the 15th-century Gothic Münster (hike up its lofty spire, Switzerland’s tallest, far-reaching views over the rooftops) and many folkloric fountains, including the Kindlifresserbrunnen, depicting a giant snacking on children.\n\nMuseum-wise, Bern is a treat. Tour the apartment where Einstein lived and the magnificent Kunstmuseum, showing fine arts from Renaissance masterpieces to Monets and Picassos. Make the short hop out to Renzo Piano’s architecturally bold, wave-like Zentrum Paul Klee, presenting the color-charged works of Swiss-born German artist Paul Klee.\n\nDetour: Break up sightseeing with a wild swim in the Aare River. When the weather warms, join the Berner for a cooling downstream float.\n\nAdmire the Aletsch Glacier\n\nAs you journey into the remote Goms valley in Valais, the Alps take a turn for the wilder, and the hamlets are pure Heidi stuff, with sun-blackened chalets and flower-freckled meadows sweeping up to whopping mountains. The Matterhorn gets all the fuss, but just as arresting is the Aletsch Glacier, the jewel in the crown of the Unesco World Heritage Jungfrau-Aletsch region. Powering past wispy waterfalls, rock spires and the dagger-shaped summit of Aletschhorn (4193m) like a six-lane glacial superhighway, this 23km swirl of deeply crevassed ice is the longest and most voluminous glacier in the Alps.\n\nObserve the glacier from the viewpoint, or – for close-ups – hit the trail on the 17km (10.5-mile), five- to six-hour hike from Fiescheralp to Bettmeralp, where every bend in the ice reveals phenomenal views and the odd Valais Blacknose sheep. If you prefer instant thrills, wobble across the Aletschji–Grünsee Suspension Bridge, which straddles the 80m-deep Massa Gorge.\n\nPlanning tip: Reaching the glacier is part of the fun. From Fiesch, take the cable car up to Fiescheralp, then beyond to Eggishorn for your first glimpse of the mighty Aletsch.\n\nSki or hike below the Matterhorn\n\nNothing is more thoroughly Swiss than the Matterhorn, the peak that sums up Switzerland’s outdoor-loving spirit, which has broken many a rock climber’s rope (and soul) and has a chocolate bar (Toblerone) shaped in its honor. Arrive in Zermatt on the train that chugs from Täsch. Like those who have come before you, you won’t be able to stop yourself from obsessively gawping at that mountain.\n\nAnd who could blame you? Razoring up above the Italian border in southern Valais, this 4478m fang of rock and ice is utterly mesmerizing, especially when seen from above. You can ski, hike or climb in its pyramid-shaped shadow by riding the world's highest-altitude 3S cable car to 3883m (12,739ft): Matterhorn Glacier Paradise, Europe’s highest cable-car station on the Klein Matterhorn (3883m), with views reaching deep into the Swiss, French and Italian Alps.\n\nFor close-ups of the melting ice, hook onto the two-hour, 6.5km (4-mile), moderately challenging Matterhorn Glacier Trail. When the flakes fall in winter, you can pound the powder on 360km of ski runs, some of which dip over the border into Italy and nearly all with distractingly lovely views of the Matterhorn.\n\nPlanning tip: If you have some climbing experience under your belt, you can climb your way to the top with an Alpine guide.\n\nThe vineyards of Lavaux have been around for centuries © Puripatl / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nWalk among vines in Lavaux\n\nIn the country’s western crook, the World Heritage-listed Lavaux vineyards are heaven on earth to oenophiles. The world’s steepest vineyards stagger up the terraced hills above Lake Geneva. If you’ve never heard of them, it’s because the hand-picked wines are so select and small-batch that the Swiss keep most of them to themselves, and few bottles ever reach export.\n\nBefore hitting the caveaux (wine cellars) for a petite dégustation (tasting), brush up your wine knowledge. It’s said that these grapes are blessed by three suns: the one in the sky, the one on the lake and the one radiating heat from the dry-stone walls. The main grape is Chasselas, a very old variety producing crisp, flinty white wines with a fresh, citrusy nose. The fruity reds (Gamay, Pinot noir and Salvagnin) make up just 20% of production.\n\nYou can drive the meandering roads that loop around 40km of shore or take the Lavaux Panoramic Train, but you’ll get a better feel for the Lavaux by heading out on foot. Little trails dip into the vines everywhere, but top billing goes to the 11km (6.8-mile) trail from St-Saphorin to Lutry, where you’ll take in stirring views, pretty villages and welcoming cellars.\n\nPlanning tip: For a great primer on Lavaux wines, stop off at Vinorama in Rivaz. Housed in a strikingly revamped bunker, the lakefront center speeds you through the wine-growing process, and you can sample dozens of different wines in the Espace Dégustation.",

    "Near the Swiss border with Italy, vestiges of the past are set in stone": "Listen 12 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBleary-eyed, I left French-speaking Geneva at daybreak. At lunchtime, I switched trains in Zurich, stammering through my rusty grammar-school-level German. A few hours south through the Saint-Gotthard Massif — at almost 11,000 feet, a once formidable obstacle between northern and southern Europe — and, via the longest railway tunnel in the world, I stepped into a balmy summer afternoon in Ticino, the only Italian-speaking canton in Switzerland.\n\nIn just a few hours spent in the resort town of Locarno, just about six miles from the border with Italy, it was clear that Ticino’s reputation as the sunniest canton was completely warranted. Lush palm trees, dark-green camellia shrubs and pastel-colored facades give it a gentle Mediterranean feel. But that was not what I was seeking. After too much time in New York, I was aching for Alpine meadows, ancient forests and the rural landscape of my Swiss childhood. What I found were vivid traces of an ancient mountain people’s enduring struggle against the rocky backdrop of their lives.\n\nI recently stumbled upon the writings of mountaineer and author Douglas W. Freshfield, who, in 1875, published “Italian Alps: Sketches in the Mountains of Ticino, Lombardy, The Trentino, and Venetia” and wrote, “We feel disposed to cry out with delight before a figure of Michael Angelo or this view in Val Maggia.” Even though I had been to Ticino before, I had never heard of that particular valley. It was enough to send me packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA main artery for the Maggia River, the valley leads from the high summits of the Lepontine Alps to Lake Maggiore below, but it also breaks into more than 10 smaller canyons. The small town of Maggia, about 11 miles north of Locarno and off the main road, seemed to provide the perfect home-base location. Though it’s possible to use the yellow buses that offer public transportation throughout the area, I opted to rent a car and spend a few days exploring the valleys.\n\nYou don’t ease into Val Maggia. One bend in the road, and you plunge into a radically different landscape: Silvery cliffs reach down as if to restrain the flow of emerald-green water rushing about 70 feet below under Ponte Brolla, settling into deep, tranquil pools. Turns out this is the departure point for several hikes and has been the site of a cliff-diving championship.\n\nThe weather shifts fast, and as I drove, nature donned a darker, mysterious robe. Seeming to reflect the ominous clouds, the vertical rock was everywhere: in the towering promontory that frames the valley, in the traditional stone tiles that protect the roofs, in the prehistoric landslides that have marked the history of this land. So much so that its inhabitants have literally carved their lives into the many massive boulders and caves.\n\nIn the hamlet of Cevio Vecchio, I climbed through stone, moss and the odd palm tree toward more than 60 “grotti,” ancient caves carved into the rock. Thanks to a natural system of ventilation, the caves enjoy the right humidity levels to allow the population to use them to store wine, cured meats and local cheeses. Over time, people got into the habit of bringing out tables and sitting in front of the grotti to drink local wine and have a bite to eat. That habit led to the emergence of the present-day grotti, open-air eateries featuring local specialties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Life here was so harsh in those times,” said Flavio Zappa, a historian and guide, over risotto that night, “that starting in the 1850s and until World War I, waves of emigration led generations of men to Australia and California.” Some, like the Lafranchi family of Nicasio Valley Cheese in Marin County, settled there. Others came back and built the many “palazzi dei emigrati,” houses designed on the models encountered overseas. “While away, they sent money to the struggling women and children left behind,” Zappa said, “but the departures of the men created an imbalance of population that would only correct itself a century later.”\n\nThe next day, as if opening the cavern of Ali Baba, Zappa unlocked the heavy wooden door of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a seemingly simple church. Only about 20 minutes on foot from Maggia, it revealed strikingly colorful floor-to-ceiling Renaissance frescoes telling the story of Mary, as well as a whole series of ex-votos commissioned by locals to honor the Madonna.\n\nI had planned to take the cable car all the way to the Robièi area near the Basòdino glacier, but the wind picked up: A storm front was blowing in. Soon the fog hid the peaks, and a torrential downpour sent me back to seek cover at a local cafe. “An end-of-the-world kind of weather,” commented a fellow traveler as she settled into a cozy armchair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy plans did not include staying put, though. I drove back to Ponte Brolla and from there headed west within the Onsernone Valley where, centuries ago, as many as 27 water mills hummed along the river. In the tiny village of Vergeletto, I visited Ilario Garbani, a retired teacher who, in association with the Museum Onsernonese, was working to revive the ancestral tradition of farina bóna, a finely ground roasted corn flour. The storm was just above us, and the furious torrent rushed past the renovated water mill. Here, too, I noted that locals had learned to harness the power of nature to aid their daily lives. At the lovely Ristorante della Posta Russo in nearby Russo, I savored farina bóna ice cream, amaretti and shortbreads, the powder adding a unique, roasted whiff of the past.\n\nIt was time, the next day, to drive north from Maggia toward the mountains. The forest grew thicker on both sides of the road — birches, chestnuts, clusters of pines. To the sound of distant cowbells near the entrance of Val Lavizzara, I stopped in the stunning village of Brontallo, where dark wood and stone chalets — homes to the right and stables to the left — huddled together just below walls of rock.\n\nCowbells gave way to the syncopated rhythm of mallets hitting stone as I proceeded farther toward the summits, where tears of white marble emerged within the gray layers of gneiss above the School of Sculpture in Peccia. The village is also home to the International Sculpture Center, where I met artists from all over the world, selected by an international committee from a wide pool of applicants, now spending several months on an artistic retreat sponsored by the center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore lunch at nearby Grotto Pozzasc, built on the site of an ancient water mill, families bathed and relaxed on the flat stones that dot the turquoise Peccia River. I was too hungry to wait. I ordered the smooth local merlot, which one drinks directly from an individual pitcher, and which paired perfectly with polenta cooked on an open fire and a whole trout poached, then marinated in wine, a method used in the past to conserve the fish. I couldn’t resist the torta di pane, a sweet cake with dried fruits and cinnamon traditionally made with stale bread.\n\nThat afternoon, I drove to the village of Mogno, where, in 1986, an avalanche destroyed many structures, including a 1626 church. Renowned architect Mario Botta, a Ticino native, was asked to build a new San Giovanni Battista church. From the outside, the small building, made of alternate layers of Peccia marble and local granite, resembles a sort of standing cylinder cut diagonally to the sky. Designed to physically resist nature’s force and to represent the ancestral battle between humankind and the mountain, the tiny church reveals the magnitude of its own power inside. In utter silence, daylight filtered through granite arches and the skylights, seemingly bouncing from marble to glass. As decor, only the lone figure of a wooden Jesus hangs over the altar. Stunning.\n\nWalking the next day through Val Bavona and its 12 terre — ancient hamlets and dwellings, most of them still off the electrical grid — brought together the beauty of the rocky landscape and the desperate efforts of the people who attempted to survive there. With high pastures, where many spent the summers with their animals, and the mouth of the powerful waterfalls along the way, I often wondered whether what I saw was nature (a piece of the mountain) or the moss-covered roof of an antique granary.\n\nLater on, I stopped for a guided tour of the fascinating Museum of Valmaggia, itself carved within a massive boulder. Depicting the old way of life in the area, the museum offered a moving testimony to the struggles of the local population. One room was dedicated to the women who, after the departure of the men, were often left to juggle household and farm work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had come to Val Maggia in search of nature, but the discreet valleys revealed much more than beautiful Alpine landscapes. Under the rock, a society had emerged, fought its way through the elements and left us a fascinating piece of Swiss culture.\n\nBigar is a writer based in New York City. Her website is sbigar.com.

Switzerland’s central bank has carried out the biggest hike ever to its key interest rate in an effort to clamp down on inflation. The Swiss National Bank said in a statement Thursday that it could not rule out further increases beyond the increase of three-quarters of a percentage point rise “to ensure price stability over the medium term.” (Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP)\n\nThe Swiss National Bank in Zurich, Switzerland, Thursday Sept. 22, 2022. Switzerland’s central bank has carried out the biggest hike ever to its key interest rate in an effort to clamp down on inflation. The Swiss National Bank said in a statement Thursday that it could not rule out further increases beyond the increase of three-quarters of a percentage point rise “to ensure price stability over the medium term.” (Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP)\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s central bank carried out the biggest hike ever to its key interest rate Thursday, following the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world in aggressive moves to clamp down on inflation.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank could not rule out that further increases beyond the rise of three-quarters of a percentage point “will be necessary to ensure price stability over the medium term,” said Thomas Jordan, chairman of SNB governing board.\n\nIt aims to cool off inflation that came in at 3.5% in August, which is much lower than the record 9.1% in the 19 neighboring European Union countries that use the euro.\n\nThe Swiss rate increased from minus 0.25% to 0.5%, ending several years of negative interest rates — a testament to the stable growth, low-inflation environment, coupled with Switzerland’s appeal as a safe haven for assets.\n\nIn essence, that negative interest rate environment meant that people who parked assets in Switzerland paid for the privilege, a counterintuitive idea for many investors who might expect a return on their savings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome economists have said that Switzerland appeared less vulnerable to inflation pressures because the cost of living in the wealthy Alpine country is relatively high compared to its main neighbors: European Union countries.\n\nA recent surge in the value of the Swiss franc compared to the euro, for example, has caused many Swiss consumers to cross the border into neighboring countries like France or Germany to buy gasoline and other consumer goods that suddenly are relatively less expensive there.\n\nJordan said the bank would “intervene in foreign exchange markets to steer monetary conditions” if “exchange rate movements are excessive so that you have a massive appreciation” in the franc.\n\nThe Swiss currency dropped more than 1% against the euro after the bank’s announcement, with economists saying some investors may have expected an even bigger hike.\n\nThe move comes a day after the Fed raised its key rate by three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time and signaled that more increases were ahead.\n\nThe European Central Bank also hiked by that much earlier this month, and the Bank of England is under pressure to move aggressively at its meeting Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSwitzerland is not an EU member, but most of its economic activity is done with the giant 27-nation bloc.\n\nSwiss-EU ties have been strained in recent years over issues including more than 100 bilateral agreements that the two sides have struggled to renew and demands of some populist politicians in Switzerland to limit the number of EU citizens who can live and work in the country. That concept greatly unsettles Brussels, because one of the EU’s central principles is free circulation of people within its member states’ territories and with other partners in the so-called Schengen zone.",
    "OPCW Director-General visits Switzerland": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands—16 September 2022—The Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ambassador Fernando Arias, travelled to Switzerland from 11 to 13 September to visit the Spiez Laboratory and meet with Swiss senior officials.\n\nAt the Spiez Laboratory, the OPCW Director-General delivered a keynote speech at the opening of the Spiez CONVERGENCE Conference. This annual workshop, which builds upon the work of the OPCW’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), engages scientists and industry and arms control professionals to discuss emerging scientific and technological developments related to the convergence between chemistry and biology.\n\nIn his remarks, the Director-General stated that: “Scientific collaboration of this kind is an integral part to the OPCW’s success in its core mission to oversee the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). New methods of chemical warfare represent a persistent challenge that requires all our collective attention. The scientific perspective is the only way to ensure that the international community remains equipped to face such challenges.”\n\nThe Director of the Federal Office for Civil Protection, Dr Michaela Schärer stated: “Our Spiez CONVERGENCE 2022 is part of the strategy of the Swiss Federal Council for arms control and disarmament; and as such, a contribution of Switzerland to an active science and technology review.”",
    "Becoming a Black woman in Switzerland": "For Rachel M’Bon, being Swiss has meant almost daily finding a way to prove belonging.\n\nWhen she was a teenager, M’Bon once had three police officers overpower her and arrest her when she entered the building that she was working in all because they were convinced she had broken in, all because she is Black.\n\n“I was born in Switzerland,” the filmmaker said. “Many times I have found myself at the police station because I did not have my papers with me, while my friends just went home. Because they were not Black.”\n\nDespite being born and raised in Switzerland, as a woman of African descent, M’Bon said she has never really been able to fit in. And because of the country’s legacy of neutrality, many Swiss people, and indeed others around the globe, deny the possibility of Swiss racism or discrimination, she added.\n\n“The image of perfection of Switzerland must be deconstructed because it excludes the possibility of speaking about the people who are discriminated against and also denies the possibility of fighting against this history,” M’Bon said. “It is very hard to fight against racism when there is a generalised denial about the phenomenon.”\n\nM’Bon wanted to show this discrimination and how it affected not just her life but other Black women across the country. The filmmaker created Becoming a Black Woman, a documentary that shows the micro aggressions and larger discriminations that Black women living in Switzerland have faced.\n\n“I wanted to find a subtle way so [Black women’s] voices were heard and to reveal to Swiss citizens and those abroad what is going on here, because more often than not there, is the perception that the issues of racism only pertain to other countries,” she said.\n\n“Switzerland, miraculously, has avoided this issue to the extent that it does not have a colonial past,” M’Bon continued. “[This movie] has also the objective of showing that Switzerland is no stranger to racism, quite the opposite.”\n\nThe film shows stories of Black women who suffer and fight against racism and discrimination. It also shows how their struggle to find themselves and come to terms with their identity in a society that makes them very aware of their “otherness”.\n\n“[It’s women] who are always at the end of the chain, [depicting only women] was a way of redressing a general neglect of women’s voices”, explained M’Bon.\n\nUN Human Rights report on racial justice and equality, released on July 2021, establishes a four-point agenda to end systemic racism and human rights violations against Africans and people of African descent. It calls on States to stop denying racism and start dismantling it; end impunity and build trust; listen to people of African descent, their concerns and also the solutions they bring to the table; and confront past legacies, taking special measures, and delivering reparatory justice.\n\nM’Bon said the film has started to make a difference. Various screenings of Becoming a Black Woman have attracted diverse audiences, including white young men who after having watched the film later told M’Bon that now they perceived Black women differently and they wanted to learn how they could become allies and fight against their own biases.\n\n“Some of them have become aware of the absurdity of their behaviour. That’s what I wanted to depict through the film, that in the end, what is important is that we are all human beings,” M’Bon said.\n\nThe Learn, Speak Up, and Act! Campaign, launched by UN Human Rights on July 2022 is a global call for concrete action against racism, discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. The challenges posed by these problems are not new, and neither are the solutions. What is needed is action – by governments, institutions, groups, and individuals, particularly young people.\n\n“We cannot have a George Floyd every week so that people react,” M’Bon said. “So it is important to have these campaigns. For me, it is key to reach young people and raise awareness amongst them, because they are the adults of tomorrow. It is also important that politicians take a clear stance. One must be able to infiltrate power and daily life with messages and information, and little by little develop strategies that will help people realise that everybody would win if we find solutions that allow a whole society to live in equality.”\n\nA special screening of Becoming a Black Woman by Rachel M’Bon and Juliana Fanjul, will take place on September 20 at 18:30 at Cinerama Empire, Rue de Carouge 71, in Geneva, as part of Ciné ONU.\n\nAfter the screening, there will be a discussion on “Dismantling systemic racism – Learn, Speak Up and Act!” with Rachel M’Bon, Mona Rishmawi, Chief of Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch at UN Human Rights, and Yvonne Apiyo Brändle-Amolo, Swiss Parliamentarian, intercultural mediator, film producer, and feminist artist-activist.

    "Why Switzerland Hates You (and Why She Should) ~ The Imaginative Conservative": "Switzerland remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age for a collapsing civilization that should be looking to its example. For those weaned on the open-borders, Leftist humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe.\n\n“When all the world is socialist, Switzerland will have to remain capitalist, so that it can tell us the price of everything.”– Nikita Khrushchev\n\nDuring the great days of my salon monarchism and alpine anarchism while living in street clean Wien, I traveled with the beloved Graf so-and-so by car from the Salzkammergutl to Zurich past many a forlorn castle and mighty monastery to check in on family Schwarzgeld held here and there in attractive old banks run by the same Catholic families two hundred years on. In those days I roomed with an astute German princess whose sister had been part of the July 20 plot against Hitler and I wrote various stories for the Herald Tribune and Wall Street Journal Europe about the post-war confiscation of art and lands of the Austro-Hungarian ancien regime under scurrilous pretexts of EU legal cloak-and-daggerism. Thus, among these friends there prevailed a mentality of seeing oneself orphaned from history and, as a result, ‘The State’ could in no way be trusted—what with socialists, communists and Freimauer types leering at you from behind every foggy Jugendstil street lamp. This attitude included a rather sacrosanct insistence upon guarding one’s wealth, or what remained of it, within ye olde financial secrecy rules of the proud Confederation next door, despite the general trend internationally that the party was truly over by the mid 2000s. I was fascinated by what seemed to be a permanent fin-de-siècle, Stefan Zweig-esque melodrama that anxiously wound its way through the psyche of these characters, all of whom suffered from that very Central European trauma known as Erbsunde. This roughly translates as the inherited psychological state of one’s ancestors; a secular brand of original sin that comes with being at war with the world every sixty years or so and an outlook that regards History, capital-’H’, as a prison through which one entered by many doors, not one of them offering an exit.\n\nIt was this combination of Spenglerian dread mixed with Dr. Mabuse’s prophetic evil grin mixed with the rough splinters of noble pride still stabbing at the Habsburgian heart that compelled these members of a collapsed civilization to cast a hopeful gaze to the arrogant democracy next door—to its love of privacy, its respect for meritocracy, its love of order and cultural continuity. A country that was and remains solid, stable and secretive; a safe haven of I-told-you-so European high standards. That doesn’t need you, want you or care what you think. Today, members of another collapsing civilization should be looking to its example as well.\n\nI now live in northern Italy and my Lugano-born, Milan-raised husband stresses his Lombardian affinities to Switzerland with a rapture as intense as his contempt for gracious and degraded Rome. Many memories of one’s clean, beautiful public hospital room like a private club with gourmet food and tranquil views. Wistful respect for the cultural ministry that will long-lease to you an unclaimed castle if you give it an art collection. Paying for your sandwich with a 500 note and no one blinking an eye. The competing cantons whose modern battles consist of offering businesses lower taxes and better educated workers. The half-dozen private bankers (a special status beyond “bank”) that adhere to the 1934 laws requiring the total personal liability of its partners, high cash reserves and that do not permit speculative investment. The stately national newspaper that is still an objective, high-brow print newspaper. The Sunday laws against noise and work. The thrill of disbelief in being fined for J-walking or cited for using a non-approved color of garbage bag at your apartment building, or of police stopping at someone’s home when the wash is not hung out tidily. Of course, one does not simply “move to Switzerland”: a visa and passport generally take fifteen years, with some notable exceptions, and even then the inhabitants of your county district must vote to approve of your staying there. Ach, Du lieber Himmel!\n\nAnd for those weaned on the open-borders, gauchiste humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe:\n\nIf you enter Switzerland illegally, you are thrown back out, no exceptions. If you manage to slip through illegally and you commit a crime, you must pay for your jail time—the shelter, the food that consumes tax money. How is this paid? Forced labor, dear.\n\nSwitzerland has a zero-tolerance approach to homelessness. There are ‘homeless’, who tend to be of the minority-formerly-called gypsy variety, but they are fined and warned and forced to leave. Last year, Basel announced a program whereby homeless individuals would be given a one way ticket to any other European city and twenty Swiss francs if they promised never to return–at least for four years (This proved very popular). Violators are deported.\n\nBegging on the streets is illegal, for which one is fined hundreds of francs. In Geneva in 2015, a Roma woman, not able to pay several fines for begging that amounted to around 500 CHF, received a sentence of five days in prison in that city. The globalist cabal of the soi-disant European Court of Human Rights demanded that Geneva overturn its decision, maintaining with its brand of looney logic that begging is an expression of ‘human dignity’. The city was told to pay her close to 1000 CHF in ‘damages’. Nonetheless, Swiss law enforcement throughout all the cantons continues to fine begging\n\nIf you are employed and then become unemployed in Switzerland, your name is put in a central database with your qualifications and background in your canton. That canton will then start to send you notifications of job offers commensurate with your work history and education. You are allowed to reject two of these offers. If you reject the third you must leave the country, unless you can prove at once enough wealth to sustain your livelihood for a specified amount of time.\n\nIf you become unemployed in Switzerland, the state will give you, for a short while, welfare benefits. Once you are employed, you must pay the welfare back. No living off of the public trough. If you refuse this you must leave the country.\n\nCorporate taxes are the competitive open-field between the twenty-six cantons. These are federal, cantonal and communal. The federal (national) corporate tax rate is a flat 8%; the cantons determine the rest individually. For all federal, cantonal and communal corporate taxes combined, you are looking at a range of 11.9% to 21.6%. The VAT is one of the lowest in Europe although import and customs duties are high.\n\nThere are very strict Sunday laws. Sunday is considered sacred–not just in religious terms but as a matter of civic respect. You aren’t allowed to mow the grass, you can’t hang laundry, and you cannot recycle your trash. If you are caught sending out the trash on Sunday to one of the centers close to you, you will be fined. If you cannot pay the fine, you can choose the option of a few days in jail.\n\nGood Samaritan laws are still in place. If you see something happen or someone in trouble, the least you are required to do is to call the police. The failure to do so can get you in hot water.\n\nMemo to San Francisco: In an attempt to liberalize the drug laws, the Platzspitz or “Needle Park” in Zurich was an open drugs scene in the 1980s and early 90s when heroin users could inject the drug without being arrested and volunteer doctors supplied the needles. The scene spun horribly out of control with the number of drug-related deaths in Switzerland increasing twelvefold between 1975 and 1992. Authorities shut it down that year, with a heavy gate built across the park.\n\nThat famous healthcare system is expensive and you pay mostly out of pocket, reimbursed later. Even though Switzerland’s healthcare system is universal, there is no free public healthcare. Instead, all residents of Switzerland must pay for their own private health insurance. There is no Medicare. Subsidies are provided in extreme cases (poverty, the infirm) with strict conditions, including the recipient having to pay back those subsidies eventually. Once voluntary, insurance coverage has been compulsory since 1996.\n\nAnd yes–Switzerland still has National Service in the armed forces, where each able-bodied Swiss man has to spend time each year in a training camp that forms part of the military. Soldiers must keep a gun in their home, which is a part of the military framework in readiness for potential conflict\n\nNaturally, things are not perfect. The repeal of its famous neutrality to denounce Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, the climate-change politics, “Davos”, the perennial Socialist politician wanting more central government etc. disappoint. But the country remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age. Since winning their independence in a series of bloody battles against Habsburg Austria in the 14th century and then Burgundy in the 15th century using that famed phalanx fighting style, the Swiss aren’t to be messed with. Machiavelli regarded them as the epitome of efficient soldiers. Rich in brains, poor in natural resources, and with a reputation for discipline, the Swiss were chosen in 1506 to be the protectors of the spiritual leader of the Western world, a role lasting through to this day. And how.\n\nThe Imaginative Conservative applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics—we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.

    "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful": "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful\n\nWinter view of Les Bains de Lavey, Switzerland (source: Les Bains de Lavey)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 26 Sep 2022\n\nFlowrate of the drilled well at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland will not enough to support the planned geothermal power plant. The rig will now move to the next planned site at Vinzel.\n\nIn a blow to geothermal development ambitions in the Canton of Vaud, the developer of the geothermal project in Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland reports flow rates of the well drilled are insufficient for a successful implementation of a planned geothermal power plant. The project has been temporarily suspended as the rig moves to the next drilling site in Vinzel, another prospective site identified by a previous seismic survey campaign.\n\nWe had previously reported on the progress of the drilling for the Lavey-les-Bains project by the Alpine Geothermal Power Production (AGEPP). Drilling through the hard gneiss was a challenge that the team was able to overcome, and some planned logging measurements had to be cancelled. The temperatures that were measured at the bottom of the well exceeded expectations, but there was not enough flow to sustain geothermal power production.\n\n“We would clearly have liked better efficiency, but that is part of the random nature of geothermal energy. At least this experience taught us quite a few things about our basement. Moreover, we have other geothermal projects to come, notably in Vinzel and Montagny-près-Yverdon.” said Vaud State Councilor Vassilis Venizelos.\n\n“Ultimately, the goal is to produce a fifth of the canton’s heating needs with geothermal energy. To achieve this, however, we must increase the means allocated to our knowledge of the soil. In the canton of Vaud, we know that we have interesting geothermal potential. It remains to develop it. In a general way, ” said Venizelos.\n\nData collected from the well will prove to be valuable in characterizing the subsurface of the region. The securing of the well has been completed and the site will soon be restored.\n\nFor Geothermie Suisse, the umbrella organization for the geothermal industry in Switzerland, the outcome of the Lavey-les-Bains project proves that the risk association with exploration of the subsurface must not be carried by the business or individual developers. As Switzerland has no oil, gas, or mining tradition, there is very little information on its subsurface. Thus, the risk of failure in geothermal is higher than other renewable energies. To obtain equal treatment, the geological risk must be fully borne by the Conferederation.\n\nBenoît Valley, full professor at the Institute of Hydrogeology and Geothermal Energy at the University of Neuchâtel, advises that the geothermal industry must persevere despite the failure at Lavey-les-Bains. “Ideally, we should persevere, since we know that in Lavey, there is water.

    "On environmental issues, the city-country divide in Switzerland is smaller than often assumed": "Switzerland. Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nWe like to perpetuate the idea of a divide in the attitudes of city dwellers and country people as part of debates on the environment, but it's simply not the reality, explains Thomas Bernauer. In fact, there is little evidence of a fundamental urban-rural disconnect in Swiss environmental policy.\n\nOn one side, we have the conservative country people. They go full throttle in their car, but when comes to the climate and biodiversity, they step on the brake. On the other side, we have the left-green city dwellers; preachers of climate action while remaining the biggest fans of flying. People often take advantage of these city-countryside clichés as a way of explaining the debate surrounding environmental policy and polling. They promote the image of a deep societal divide between rural objectors (who would rather protect their own interests than the environment) and the sanctimonious urbanites (who demand a green revolution, but do little to contribute towards it).\n\nThis environmental policy gap recently became extremely prominent with the introduction of the CO 2 law and the drinking water and pesticide initiative. Opinion polls and the media have also identified a divide in the forthcoming initiative against factory farming, with the rural population against and the urban population in favor of the proposed action.\n\nWhat truth is there to this (supposed) city-countryside eco-divide? The issue is complex and I will start by saying that I find such rhetoric misleading since there is very little empirical evidence for this contradiction. But first things first.\n\nNot so different after all\n\nMy research group as part of the Swiss Environment Panel used surveys and voting results to investigate whether there is an environmental policy divide between rural and urban populations.\n\nSwiss Environmental Panel\n\nWorking with the Federal Office for the Environment, researchers from ETH Zurich have surveyed several thousands randomly selected people in Switzerland about their attitudes to various environmental policy issues and their behavior twice a year since 2018. More on the Swiss Environmental Panel and a report on city-countryside differences is available here.\n\nOur survey data shows that almost no relevant differences exist between settlement areas in terms of environment-related attitudes and behavior. Of course, attitudes towards environmental issues are much less pronounced in extremely rural places than in larger cities. People surveyed in the countryside also tend to own and drive cars more and eat more meat, while those in the city tend to fly more. Overall, however, environment-related attitudes and behavior patterns are very similar—there is practically no evidence of a city-countryside divide.\n\nIsolated differences at the ballot box\n\nBy contrast, we have seen a slight differentiation in voting behavior in national votes on environmental issues since 2010—but only between extremely rural regions and highly urbanized areas. However, with an average deviation of no more than eight percent till 2020 (12% from 2020 to 2021) between both settlement area types at the extreme ends of the spectrum, it is a stretch to claim a fundamental chasm between city and countryside.\n\nIf we consider the last 20 years and include all nine area types, the difference between city and countryside is small and, rather surprisingly, even slightly smaller than is the case for all national votes together.\n\nThat said, recently there have been certain initiatives relating directly to agriculture or fossil fuels that have resulted in wildly different voting behavior between city and countryside. These include the Swiss hunting law, which saw a difference of 18.9%, the CO 2 law (17.8%), the drinking water initiative (15.4%) and the pesticide initiative (14.5%).\n\nHowever, to conclude from this that urban and rural populations are polarized on environmental issues in Switzerland is, in my opinion, based on the voting behavior of the past 20 years and the survey data collected by the Swiss Environmental Panel since 2018, speculative and largely false.\n\nExplore further In cities, a higher income means more protection against noise pollution",
    "Switzerland Publishes Adequacy List of Countries Receiving Personal Data Transfers": "LawFlash Switzerland Publishes Adequacy List of Countries Receiving Personal Data Transfers September 23, 2022\n\nThe Swiss government has drafted a proposed list of countries that are approved to receive personal data transfers out of Switzerland. Japan and South Korea are excluded from the current and proposed lists, requiring businesses from those countries to abide by specific legal safeguards for such data transfers.\n\nIt is crucial that international data transfers always comply with the data transfer rules of the sending and receiving countries.\n\nThe European Union has issued a list of countries that it deems “adequate” for international data transfers, meaning that personal data transfers out of the EU member states to recipients in the listed countries are allowed without legal privacy restrictions. The legal situation for data transfers out of Switzerland is similar, but not identical.\n\nThe current EU list includes Argentina, Canada (commercial organizations), Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay, together with a few small territories/countries. For a recipient country not on the list, data transfers out of the European Union need specific legal safeguards, such as the 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, plus their annexes. Read our separate analysis on the SCCs.\n\nTransfers from Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss government (Bundesrat) has published its own list of adequate countries for international data transfers under Article 16 of the new Swiss Data Protection Act, which will enter into force in 2023. The list is annexed to a new ordinance of the Bundesrat, the Ordinance to the Federal Data Protection Act. It still requires the approval of the Swiss Federal Parliament.\n\nThe Ordinance to the Federal Data Protection Act lists the following countries/territories as “adequate” to receive personal data transfers out of Switzerland:\n\nAndorra Argentina Austria Belgium Bulgaria Canada (commercial organizations) Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Faroe Islands Finland France Germany Gibraltar Greece Guernsey Hungary Iceland Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Jersey Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Monaco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Romania Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden United Kingdom Uruguay\n\nSignificant Differences from EU Adequacy List\n\nMost notably, Japan and South Korea are missing on the Swiss list. Japan and South Korea are also not on Switzerland’s current (2021) list. As a result, EU-based, but not Swiss, companies benefit from the unrestricted data flow with Japan and South Korea. Businesses with data transfers from Switzerland to Japan or South Korea will need Swiss SCCs.\n\nThe Swiss Data Protection Authority has Australia listed as a state where \"adequate protection may be provided under certain conditions.\"\n\nThe latest Bundesrat list takes effect September 1, 2023, but could be adjusted before then, particularly if the US-European Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework comes into being and Switzerland joins it.",

    "How are RVs and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?": "Webinar: How are residual values and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?\n\nRead next More collaboration needed across automotive industry to hit climate goals\n\nPaired with supply-chain disruptions and ongoing component shortages, the energy crisis and rising costs of living are impacting automotive markets across Europe. Even Switzerland – one of the world’s most stable vehicle markets – cannot escape these latest developments. So, how are the country’s used and new-car markets holding up and how are residual values (RVs) developing?\n\nThis and other questions were addressed by Eurotax Switzerland (part of the Autovista Group) in its latest webinar, Automotive Trends in Switzerland. Robert Madas (regional head of valuations, Austria, Poland, Switzerland) was joined by Hans-Peter Annen (head of valuations, Switzerland) and Patrick Schneider (deputy valuations and quality manager, Switzerland) to analyse recent market traits.\n\nOne key development is the rising prices of new passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. As Annen explained, list prices are going up for a number of reasons; there are real price increases and also a change in the model mix. New vehicles are also becoming more connected and carry the latest technology, including advanced-driver assistance systems. Additionally, electrification is having an impact on list prices as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) tend to be more expensive than their fossil fuel-based counterparts.\n\nDevelopment of list prices for passenger cars, Switzerland, 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nAs is well known, 2019 was the last ‘normal’ year for the automotive industry. New-car registrations have seen steep declines since COVID-19 disrupted markets in 2020 and 2021. While some had hoped for a recovery in 2022, the war in Ukraine is fuelling further uncertainty. Switzerland is less reliant on Russian gas than neighbouring Germany, with inflation being significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe, but a sense of disillusion remains.\n\nThere are ongoing concerns that the current energy crisis could negatively impact the further development of electromobility. The Swiss automotive industry association Auto-Schweiz said this month that in the short term, the country’s power supply for the coming winter must be secured ‘through effective measures on the production side and through sensible savings on the consumption side.’\n\nThe body emphasised that in the medium to long term, the nation should push ahead with the expansion of low-CO 2 domestic electricity production to become as independent as possible, and also to power EVs. The association monitors new-car registrations in Switzerland, which have seen further declines this year.\n\nImprovement not in sight\n\n‘Since 2020, we have recorded historically low new-car registrations. In 2022, too, new-car registrations have so far lagged behind the unsatisfactory levels of the two previous years. An improvement is not in sight under these conditions,’ said Annen.\n\nNew-car registrations have dropped by 30% from January to August this year, compared to the same period in 2019. The share of new petrol and diesel passenger cars continues to shrink while BEVs, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have grown significantly in the past three years. Their combined market share has reached almost 49% so far this year. Meanwhile, LCV registrations are significantly down in 2022 – the second time since the pandemic hit, Annen cautioned.\n\nMaking up ground\n\nFewer vehicles on the new-car market mean fewer cars on the used-car market, which started to recover in 2021, nudging up 1.1% year on year. However, things are different in 2022. During the first half of the year, 390,649 cars changed ownership compared to 426,971 during the same period in the prior year, marking a notable decline.\n\nChanges of ownership for passenger cars, Switzerland, January-June 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\n‘This confirms that the low number of new-car registrations since 2020 has had a negative impact on changes of ownership, as there is simply no new supply,’ said Schneider. But is it all doom and gloom?\n\n‘Hybrids, battery-electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrids are continuing to make up ground and can gain market share. In the passenger-car segment, offers have recovered somewhat and offer days have increased again,’ added Schneider.\n\nUsed LCVs have not quite reached the same level during the first half of 2022 compared to 2021 but are still above levels seen in 2020. Motorhomes in particular have gained market share, with Schneider saying that the supply of second-hand LCVs has been stable for months, albeit at a low level.\n\nHigher RVs expected in 2022\n\nMadas highlighted some residual-values trends. ‘By the end of 2022, we expect higher residual values for all fuel types,’ he said.\n\nFor 36-month-old vehicles, Madas is anticipating a year-on-year rise of 11%. He noted that RVs of young BEVs, ranging from 12-36 months, have seen a particular increase. Among 12-month-old cars, BEVs even take first place in terms of RV retention, with a retail value of 82.3% on average. Apart from BEVs, RVs of older cars, those exceeding four to five years of age, as well as diesel cars, have seen the steepest rise.\n\nRV trends in Switzerland since January 2020\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nDemand has remained relatively stable so far and supply is inching up, too, despite long delivery times and fewer new cars entering the market. However, as the demand side starts to weaken already, pressure on RVs is to be expected.\n\nOffer prices continued to rise during the first six months of 2022 but are now stabilising. On average, prices are up 16% compared to February 2020. Looking further ahead, however, RVs are projected to decline slightly in 2023.\n\nFind the full slide deck for the presentation (in German) below.

    "Explainer: how Switzerland is dealing with rising prices": "Inflation disproportionately affects the lowest income households © Keystone / Gaetan Bally\n\nAlthough inflation remains relatively low in Switzerland (3.5%), rising prices for energy and certain basic consumer goods risk exerting a major impact on Swiss households. A look at how inflation is affecting Switzerland.\n\nThis content was published on September 22, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPauline Turuban My specialty is telling stories, and decoding what happens in Switzerland and the world from accumulated data and statistics. An expatriate in Switzerland for several years, I have also worked as a multimedia journalist for the Swiss national broadcaster.\n\nWhy is Switzerland less affected by inflation than other countries?\n\nSupply problems linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and the strong recovery in global demand following the health crisis have caused energy and commodity prices to soar globally. The war in Ukraine has made the situation worse. The upward trend is clearly a global phenomenon and therefore that also affects Switzerland.\n\nThe Alpine country nonetheless managed to contain inflation compared to other countries. The overall consumer price index rose by 3.5% over one year in Switzerland, versus 10% in the European Union and over 8% in the United States.\n\nExternal Content\n\nEnergy prices increased in Switzerland by 28% and food prices by 2%, against 38% and 10.6% in the eurozone.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe current strength of the Swiss franc acts as a buffer.\n\n“The euro has lost almost 10 cents against the franc since the start of the year, which means that imported goods are a lot cheaper,” explains Mathieu GrobétyExternal link, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Around one-quarter of all products consumed in Switzerland are affected.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe economics expert adds that energy prices in Switzerland are slightly less concerned by international fluctuations than for other countries, due to a regulated market where part of the pricing is fixed in advance and to a larger share of renewable energy produced by Alpine dams.\n\nMathieu Grobéty, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Fabrice Ducrest / UNIL\n\nThe location of non-EU member Switzerland, in the heart of Europe surrounded by eurozone countries, and concerns about large numbers of Swiss regularly crossing the border to neighbouring countries for cheaper offers, have also played a role, according to Grobéty. Swiss food distributors have not immediately passed on higher global costs to dissuade Swiss consumers from making their purchases abroad. But Mathieu Grobéty still expects inflation to “catch up [to other countries] by the end of the year and then to slow down from the start of 2023”.\n\nHow is inflation visible in Switzerland ?\n\nThe prices of many basic goods and supplies, such as energy, have risen over the past 12 months. For example, the price of heating oil, used by around 40% of Swiss households, has almost doubled, and gas has jumped by nearly 60%.\n\nElectricity prices are usually announced every year at the end of August. An average rise of 27% is expected for 2023, with large differences depending on where you live ‒ in Switzerland the electricity network is managed locally with around 600 suppliers. Some municipalities will receive record increases, such as Saint-Prex in canton Vaud, where the commune’s electricity bill is set to rise by 1,600% from CHF70,000 to CHF1.3 million.\n\nBasic food items, such as cooking oil or pasta, are about 10% more expensive in Switzerland. And price increases for such things are starting to have an impact on household budgets. According to the Federal Statistical OfficeExternal link (OFS), each Swiss household spent an average of CHF535 on food every month during the first quarter of 2020, compared to CHF586 during the second quarter of 2022. During this period, the average share of income spent on food rose from 5.5% to 6%.\n\nExternal Content\n\nAnother major expense for Swiss residents that is not included in the consumer price index is compulsory health insurance. Experts say health insurance premiums should rise by 5-10% in 2023 ‒ while they fell by 0.2% in 2022 and increased by 0.5% in 2021.\n\nWages have so far not followed the upward trend. In 2021, a slight decline in salaries on top of inflation caused employees to lose 0.8% of their purchasing power, according to OFSExternal link. Figures for 2022 are not yet available.\n\nCan the Swiss endure price increases?\n\nSwiss salaries are, on average, higher than in most other countries. The share of monthly income spent on food and energy is lower in Switzerland than elsewhere, explains Mathieu Grobéty. “In Switzerland, they represent 20% of the average monthly basket, versus 30% in the eurozone,” he says.\n\nBut inflation has a disproportionate impact on low-income households and on people who spend much of their monthly budget on energy.\n\n“Inflation acts like a tax,” Grobéty says. “Overnight, some households see their income cut by over 3.5%, as they consume a greater share of products whose prices have increased the most.”\n\nWhat measures exist to safeguard purchasing power, and are they effective?\n\nAs prices have soared, several countries have adopted emergency measures. These include discounts on fuel and rent and energy price caps. In France pensions and the salaries of civil servants and certain social benefits have been re-evaluated, while in Germany officials have introduced vouchers to spend on energy or transport subsidies.\n\n“All non-targeted measures taken by governments to maintain purchasing power, such as fuel discounts, can be counterproductive,” says Grobéty. “They will stimulate demand. But central banks are trying to reduce demand to contain inflationary pressures.”\n\nGrobéty believes energy vouchers can also have a perverse effect.\n\n“Higher prices are a very effective way of bringing about changes in behaviour to achieve climate goals,” he comments.\n\nHe says the ideal way would be to target the small groups of people who need help via tax deductions, subsidies or vouchers - provided they can be spent on things other than energy.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Switzerland?\n\nThe ball is now in the Swiss parliament’s court. A special parliamentary session is planned for September 21 and 26 to debate various proposals, mainly from left-wing and centre-right parties.\n\nParliamentarians will be examining whether to urgently adapt pensions to compensate for rising prices and to increase the federal subsidies towards health insurance premiums for low-income households. A temporary “energy allowance” for the most-vulnerable households, and a “federal voucher” for middle-classes will also be discussed.\n\nParliamentarians from the conservative-right Swiss People’s Party oppose such measures, which they say are too expensive. Instead, they advocate tax relief as well as the abolition of taxes on heating oil and ending the rental value tax for pensioners.\n\nSo far, the Federal Council has refused to intervene and opposes all proposals made. The majority of the seven cabinet ministers believes that inflation is bearable, as economic growth continues and unemployment is historically low [at 2%]. It also believes that some of the proposed measures are too broad and could be counterproductive and costly for federal finances.\n\n(Translated from French by Simon Bradley)\n\nArticles in this story A global stress test for freedom of expression\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

The selection of priorities for the second phase will take place in 2024.\n\nThe Swiss migration funds, which amount to CHF200 million ($203 million) in total, are intended to support specific EU member states most affected by migration flows. Switzerland will pay Greece CHF40 million and Cyprus CHF10 million. An additional CHF20 million is planned for Italy, although the agreement is still under discussion.\n\nThe funds can be used for various activities including strengthening asylum procedures, infrastructure, voluntary returns, and integration measures. The credit also includes a rapid response fund of CHF25 million for use in crisis situations resulting from a sudden and large-scale influx of migrants. This fund was used for the first time in the context of the Ukraine war.\n\nThe agreements are expected to be signed by the end of 2022.

    "With A ‘Done Deal’ In Switzerland, The F-35 Is Pushing Europe’s Fighter Makers Off Their Own Territory": "A U.S. Air Force F-35A soars over the Swiss Alps during the Air2030 fighter replacement evaluation. Armasuisse\n\nThe Swiss government’s signature on a final purchase contract for the F-35 and the withdrawal of a public referendum on the purchase of 36 of the jets this week signal a William Tell-esque bullseye for Lockheed Martin LMT and a real blow to Europe’s fighter aircraft manufacturers.\n\nOn Monday the Swiss Federal Armaments Office (Armasuisse) confirmed the final agreement for its $6.2 billion acquisition of 36 F-35A Lightning IIs in spite of an ongoing initiative to force a referendum on the specific choice of F-35. The initiative had gathered enough signatures to trigger a public vote but was withdrawn Tuesday in a surprise move by its organizers.\n\nExplaining the withdrawal, supporters of the ‘Stop F-35A’ initiative said a nationwide vote would be meaningless as it could not change the course of the deal. Co-president of the Social Democrat party for the Canton of Zurich, Priska Seiler Graf, told Swiss public broadcaster SRF, “We are withdrawing the initiative with a heavy heart. We do not want to offer a pseudo vote where voters can’t have a real say in the actual purchase decision.”\n\nBarring possible long-shot legal challenges it appears the Swiss F-35 buy is a fait accompli and a galvanizing win for the F-35 in one of the European countries once viewed as least likely to consider it. But the reality is that most all significant Continental powers from Poland in the east to Norway in the northwest have bought F-35s. Pending purchases by Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic further fill in the map. Add in the nearby U.K. and it’s fair to say that Europe is “F-35 country.”\n\nThe latest news is obviously further fuel to Lockheed Martin, which has said it expects that more than 550 F-35s will be stationed in Europe by 2030. That may not be all.\n\nIn August, Spanish newspaper El País, reported that Spain’s Air Force leadership has recommended buying up to 80 F-35s as a near-term option to replace its aging F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers alongside an existing purchase of additional Eurofighter Typhoons.\n\nWith the retirement of Spanish Hornets and Harriers this decade rapidly approaching and delays and political infighting within the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Aircraft System (FCAS), Spain’s military leadership acknowledges the obvious; Lockheed’s Lightning II has become NATO’s “de facto” fighter, the only 5th-generation aircraft currently available.\n\nSpain’s government was quick to brush aside El Pais’ report, asserting that it has no budget to enter into any other aircraft project in addition to FCAS. “We ruled out entering into the F-35 project. Our investment commitment is in the FCAS,” a Spanish Defense Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nBut recent reports of conflict over the workshare, direction and development of the 5th-gen fighter that FCAS is supposed to produce, do not bode well for its realization in anything short of 15 years in the future, if that. During that span the F-35 should be available and, despite its cost and shortcomings, improving.\n\nThe Swiss government’s selection of the F-35 hinged on its lower projected lifetime cost than the 4th and 4.5-generation competitors it was up against, including Dassault’s Rafale and Eurofighter’s Typhoon. The F-35’s interoperability with other NATO air and ground forces has been a strong selling point that on the surface would apply only peripherally to theoretically neutral, non-NATO member Switzerland.\n\nThe Swiss Left-wing coalition that successfully gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum ... [+] on the choice of the F-35 as the Swiss Air Force' next fighter ultimately dropped its effort after Armasuisse formally committed Switzerland to a final contract. (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut a history of Swiss Air Force tactical training in the U.S. has been bolstered by recent history - the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even with its strong financial ties to Russia and decades of cordial welcome to Russian oligarchs, Switzerland was as rattled by Putin’s drive for Kyiv as its EU neighbors.\n\n“Putin is unquestionably the best salesman for Western defense equipment of all time. He’s also been amazing at getting neutral countries to either join NATO or just buy NATO standard equipment,” says Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nOthers have pointed out that Russia’s cruel adventurism merely gave an additional boost to the re-capitalization of European fighter fleets already underway from 3rd and 4th to 5th generation aircraft. With Europe’s indigenous efforts late to the party, including the U.K.-Italy Tempest program, the F-35 has been able to fill the void.\n\n“For European defense producers, this [Swiss] development accelerates what they’ve known for some time – their [fighter sales] hopes depend on the Mideast and India and other Indian Ocean clients,” Aboulafia affirms. “With big sales to the UAE UAE and Egypt and India, that’s been fine for Dassault. Can Britain and its partners rise to the challenge with Typhoon and/or Tempest? Will Saudi Arabia come through with a second [Eurofighter] tranche? All of this matters more now, with Europe (aside from Greece) out of reach.”\n\nGreece’s well known financial constraints may preclude an F-35 buy but the country nonetheless made a formal request to procure 20 F-35As by 2028, and Lockheed Martin acknowledged that conversations are ongoing between the company and Greek officials. Athens has also ordered 24 Rafales from Dassault but if its financial picture improves and America-Turkey relations remain strained, it may well turn to Lockheed for further aircraft.\n\nPortugal, a current F-16 operator, may be a minor target for Dassault or Eurofighter given its economy and lackadaisical approach to re-investing in its air force. But Switzerland’s example has shown that Lockheed’s stealth fighter is able to effectively show up and sell itself in unexpected places. It has, for all intents and purposes pushed European fighter makers out of their own territory for at least the next couple decades.\n\nCommander of the Swiss Air Force Major General Peter Merz gestures in front of a F-35 A Lightning II ... [+] fighter jet during a media presentation at Emmen Air Base, central Switzerland, on March 24, 2022. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nWith America’s NGAD (Next Generation Air Dominance) fighter program waiting in the wings - and possibly further along than publicly acknowledged - the only salve for European projects may be limits on Lockheed’s own capacity.\n\n“Now, the big question,” Aboulafia says. “With F-35 demand justifying 180-200 jets per year, how long does it take Lockheed Martin and its suppliers to get past the current 150 or so per year that they’ve been able to reach?”",

    "KILLINGTON, VERMONT TO CRANS-MONTANA, SWITZERLAND": "Nik Nesteroff in Switzerland. Photo by Kike Abelleira\n\nWow, where to begin— the whole team was literally racing all over the world from Killington, Vermont to Crans-Montana, Switzerland. All the way over the Atlantic Ocean would be Nik Nestoroff holding it down for the world Enduro series for the second to last EWS of the season. A brief quick summary: he would continue a success on the world tour with Saturday and Sunday firing off with racing stages. The first day would entail the pro stage, which was over six minutes of racing in snow-capped conditions. Yes, you heard that right, the Switzerland Alps are already getting snow and it would be tough conditions for Nik Nestoroff who would end up 41st in his pro stage and moving onto the next day Sunday for his next final stages. Nik would fight through the day and end up top 50 overall in the Swiss Alps. He would overcome some mechanicals and have an overall steady finish.\n\nBack on USA soil in Killington, Vermont it would be Kailey Skelton, Nathan Kitchen, and Steven Walton holding it down for the U.S. Open mountain bike event which was the final event on USA soil. This event was mega and would bring athletes all across the world! With a massive prize purse for each event showcasing $15,000 for the winner, people would gather to try their best to claim the big prize money! To fire off into the event it would be our junior pro Nate Kitchen holding down first place in dual slalom! Nathan Kitchen was fresh off his collarbone injury from the U.S. National Championships and would make everyone proud for finishing on the top step of the podium after continuously rehabbing his collarbone and starting from ground zero to get back on the wood.\n\nNik Nesteroff, Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Photo by Kike Abelleira\n\nNik Nesteroff. It was still summer, but there was already snow in the Swiss Alps.\n\nFrom there Nate, Steven and Kailey would be holding it down full-time in the Downhill professional and junior professional categories. Also our superstar free-ride athlete Luke Whitlock was also attending the U.S. Open for the whip-off contest. Luke would have full attention Saturday night under the lights with a mega freestyle jump throwing down backflips, Superman‘s and obviously the best weapon. Luke is definitely an asset when it comes to our free-ride side and it’s great to see him showing off his skill sets among the thousand fans scattered across the mountainside watching the whip-off contests.\n\nBack at it with the racing events held in Downhill, Kailey Skelton was on a long journey overcoming some health issues on the way out. Traveling over 3500 miles from California, she was dedicated and showing great passion towards her career. She would have a long five days ahead of her with two practice days, a qualifying day and a finals held Sunday. She had a lot to overcome in the least to say, the team was very proud of her. For the two boys, Steven Walton holding it down in the professional pro men’s downhill field and Nathan Kitchen holding it down in the junior pros field, they were showing great speed and great qualifying times but just couldn’t put it together when it came down to the finals. Both of them would unfortunately crash out and end up top 25 in both of their categories. It was all up to Kailey Skelton to hold it down for the team in the racing categories, Kailey would push very hard and cross the line in fourth place against some of the best racesr in the world. Those racers would be Nina Hoffman, Jill Kitner and the list goes on. Kailey did an excellent job finishing on the podium against the best international racers in the world. We are all very proud of her for throwing it all down for her final race of the season!!\n\nSome scenes from the U.S. Open.\n\nKailey Skelton at the U.S. Open.\n\nNik Nesteroff will continue his Enduro campaign in European territory, heading off to the world Enduro series final which will be hosted in France; from there he is heading to the trophy donations. Some detail on that event is that he has qualified in the top three positions for all American racers to represent team USA at the highest level of Enduro racing. We are very excited to see what Nik can do on these last two events overseas and wish him the best of luck.\n\nAs always the team is very dedicated, passionate and grateful to be racing mountain bikes across the world and showcasing each individual‘s talents. We want to thank all of our continuous sponsors, family, friends, and all our fans that support us throughout the season who make all of our dreams come true. Till next time I’ll see you between the tape!\n\nCheers,\n\nLogan Binggeli / Team Management",
    "7 Things I Wish I Knew Before Visiting The Swiss Alps": "The beauty of the high peaks of the Swiss and Bernese Alps is undeniable, but the weather and altitude sickness can take away from the beauty.\n\nAt Jungfraujoch – Top of Europe, a blizzard raged and the wind was so bitingly cold that my poor gloveless hands were turning into ice. I had packed a thick jacket for this trip to the Jungfrau region of Switzerland, but I didn’t pack anything else suited for winter, like a hat or gloves.\n\nIt was summer after all.\n\nI was on a hosted adventure to experience summer in the Swiss Alps near the town of Grindelwald in central Switzerland, so I didn’t think I would need anything beyond a coat for the cold nights.\n\nYet, even as the sun shone warmly in the valley, I was shivering and freezing in the summer, but winter, storm that raged on top of Jungfrau, one of two major 4,000-footers of the Bernese Alp. The furious snow blocked out most of the Aletsch Glacier view at 11,332 feet above sea level.\n\nNot being prepared for a variety of weather conditions was one of a few mistakes I made when I visited the Jungfrau region for the first time. I am usually adept at researching places before I visit, but I still missed out on some tips that would have made my life a little easier while visiting Switzerland.\n\nHere are 7 things I wish I knew before visiting the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe weather in Switzerland can be flighty, so pack layers and all-season gear. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n1. Bring Layers\n\nThe weather in the bucolic valleys of Switzerland vary dramatically from the weather at the top of the mountains and peaks in this region. Because the Swiss Alps straddle the northern European climate and the warmer southern European climate, the weather can be both cool and warm at the same time. In fact, you could experience sunshine in one valley while rain pours down on the other side of the mountain.\n\nWhen in doubt, it’s better to have that extra jacket and pair of gloves and not need it, rather than to need it and not have it. Bringing heavy winter gear along with shorts and tank tops may mean extra luggage, but don’t underestimate how diverse the weather in Switzerland can be at any time of the year.\n\nPro Tip: For every 328-foot gain in elevation, the temperature can drop approximately 1.8 degrees. So, if you get on top of the Jungfraujoch, for instance, you’re at 2.14 miles above sea level where the mountain tops are chilly in summer and sometimes covered in thick layers of snow.\n\nSwitzerland sits at one of the highest elevations in the world, so altitude sickness could become a problem if you aren’t prepared. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n2. Be Prepared For Altitude Sickness\n\nElevation, again, can cause a bit of misery for visitors to Switzerland if they aren’t prepared for the altitude. Switzerland lies at an average elevation of 4,429 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest countries in the world. Switzerland’s highest mountain peak — Dufourspitze — is 15,203 feet.\n\nIf you’re not used to high elevations, then altitude sickness can be pretty miserable. According to a study titled “Prevalence of acute mountain sickness in the Swiss Alps,” acute mountain sickness is “not an uncommon disease at moderately high altitude.” It can cause “severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales.”\n\nOne of the ways to combat this sickness is to ask your physician for a prescription called Acetazolamide, or Diamox. This is the common prescription for preventing acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema.\n\nYou can also get over-the-counter medications to combat altitude sickness, but in my personal experience, they don’t work as well.\n\nPro Tip: If you are at high altitudes, treat all headaches, dizziness, or vomiting as altitude sickness. Immediately descend to a lower altitude and make sure you are always properly hydrated. If you do plan to climb or summit these high peaks, spend a day or two in one of the nearby towns to slowly acclimate.\n\nThe Swiss love rich food, and you will too. Just be prepared with stomach medications to combat all that over indulgence. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n3. Tummy Issues Are Common\n\nOne of the best things about Switzerland is the food and drink. The Swiss are masters in the arts of chocolate, cheese making, and wine, so be prepared to be tempted by plenty of delicious, rich, and dairy-heavy foods.\n\nWhile traveling in planes, trains, and automobiles generally causes me to “slow down” in the digestive process — if you know what I mean — the rich and tempting foods made me even more constipated than usual. Other people may have the opposite problem, depending on their body types.\n\nSo, if you plan to indulge in all the rich cheese dishes and fondues, the mouthwatering chocolate and hearty sausages, be sure to pack your over-the-counter tummy medications for either issue.\n\n4. Switzerland Is Expensive\n\nYou might have heard already that Switzerland is expensive. In fact, Zurich and Geneva are often included in lists touting the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nYes, certain things are much more expensive in Switzerland, like groceries, clothing, shoe shopping, and going out to dinner or for drinks. In fact, unless you eat fast food, finding a meal for less than 20 CHF ($20.51) is difficult.\n\nPublic transportation, tourism excursions, and medical costs are also much higher in cost than other destinations.\n\nThat being said, if you have the ability to stock up on light groceries to cover breakfast and lunch, you’ll be able to indulge in the cost-worthy food that restaurants serve here. Just, be aware of the expenses you may face and budget accordingly.\n\nIf you’re traveling a lot in Switzerland, a Swiss Travel Pass will save you a ton of money. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n5. Invest In A Rail Pass\n\nSwitzerland is home to some of the best public transit in the world, and if you want to see all that this beautiful country has to offer, traveling by train, gondola, and funicular is the way to go. As stated above, Switzerland can be a bit expensive, so buying individual train and gondola tickets can really add up after a while and a rail pass can save you a ton of money.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Rail pass from Rail Europe gives you access to the panoramic trains like the Glacier Express, Bernina Express, Luzern–Interlaken Express, GoldenPass Panoramic as well as the Gotthard Panorama Express. Although this is a much better option than buying individual tickets, you can expect to pay a lot for the Swiss Travel Pass, so be prepared for sticker shock.\n\nThs rail pass also has public transport in more than 90 Swiss towns and cities. It even offers senior passes. The Swiss Travel Pass is sold for 3, 4, 8, and 15 days and allows free entrance to over 480 museums and exhibitions.\n\n6. Buy Your Alcohol In The Stores\n\nLike many other things in Switzerland, going out to drink and buying wine at restaurants is a pricey affair. Skip drinking at the bars and restaurants and just buy your wine and beer at the grocery store to drink at your hotel or rental.\n\nKeep in mind that alcohol hits the body a lot faster and harder in higher elevation, making you a cheap drunk in the mountains.\n\n7. Get A Universal Adapter\n\nIf you are traveling around Europe and Switzerland, get the right adapter to charge your electronics. While most of Europe uses the Schuko plug (type F), Switzerland is different and uses type J outlets, which are smaller.\n\nInstead of buying both, you can buy a universal travel adaptor. Just make sure it has a type J outlet included.\n\nCheck out our most recent Swiss Alps coverage, including:",

    "This Charming Lakeside Town Is Switzerland's Unexpected Mediterranean-like Escape": "The train had been extremely punctual and the pasta currently heaped onto my fork — perfection. If I didn't know the actual border was a mere 15 minutes away, it would be nearly impossible to draw the line between Switzerland and Italy. Villages and vineyards scaled steep hillsides, waterside cafes stood sandwiched between a rocky shoreline and the storybook town promenade, and old world architecture complemented narrow cobblestone streets demanding to be mindlessly wandered. The temperature was unmistakably hot; endless summer vibes hung in the air, and the sun shone so aggressively that the water sparkled in between bobbing sailboats.\n\nProsecco in hand, I took a break from my carb-fest and dipped my toes in the blue water. At first glance, it would be easy to assume that I was cooling off in the Mediterranean Sea — but I wasn't even close. I was on the north shore of Lago Maggiore, which stretches so long that the portion I was wading in was actually part of landlocked Switzerland.\n\nLauren Breedlove\n\nI was spending three days in the Swiss Riviera, a treasure of the Italian-speaking Ticino region, nestled on the southern side of the Swiss Alps and known for its mild climate — a contrast to the rest of the country. The natural trio of mountains, valleys, and the lake are straight out of postcard, offering a fulfilling outdoor playground with plenty of Italian food and drink to fuel any adventure. The tiny village of Ascona had captured my heart in a matter of minutes; it was big on charm and proof that you don't have to travel to the Mediterranean to feel like you're in the Mediterranean.\n\nLauren Breedlove\n\nYou know you're in a special place when you can see Italy from your balcony. My home base was the Hotel Eden Roc, one of Swiss Deluxe Hotels' luxurious and sustainable properties, as well as the only true beach resort in all of Switzerland. Inside, vibrant colors reflect Ticino's character, and outside, you'll be hard-pressed to find a bad view. By day, sounds of delight can be heard from boats on the lake, and by evening, live piano music wafts from the lounge while the property's restaurants are filled to the brim with patrons indulging in delicious meals as the sun tucks itself behind the mountains.\n\nIt's a true holiday escape; not a day passed without seeing guests in fluffy white robes cross the well-manicured lawns toward the pool or lake for their ritual morning swim, as I sipped my morning ritual: a perfectly executed cappuccino.\n\nWith two cultures blending seamlessly, visiting Ticino is like hitting the culinary jackpot. Some of the world's most coveted cheese, chocolate, wine, and pasta can be found in Ascona and the surrounding areas. Local ingredients are celebrated on tables in restaurants and authentic, family-run grottos.\n\nEat melt-in-your-mouth Swiss risotto; Ticino is the northernmost point to grow the traditionally Italian grain and it graces almost every menu in some form. Twirl fresh pasta that has no business being that delicious and wash it down with Swiss wines like the crisp Il Bianco di Chiara, a white merlot that became a personal favorite. Stuff your face with perfectly cooked polenta, brasato (stick-to-your-ribs stew), local meats and cheeses such as the addictive formaggio d'alpe (mountain cheese), and sweet torta di pane (bread cake). It's a pinch-yourself situation for a foodie.\n\nLauren Breedlove\n\nThe typical Ticinese grotto experience is one that shouldn't be missed. These small establishments are scattered throughout Ticino, serving regional dishes from their family cookbooks to stone tables situated under the shade of a pergola or canopy of trees. Way back when, the setting was a cool cave where farmers kept their harvest in a dry place. A table would be perched on the edge, turning the outdoor space into a no-frills dining experience. They are the definition of a social gathering place, one to enjoy a leisurely meal with friends or family.\n\nIn addition to having four on-site restaurants, including the Michelin-starred La Brezza, Hotel Eden Roc hosts its own version of a grotto meal — a beachside Serata Ticinese under a leafy pergola once a week during the summer months. To experience some of the other grottos in the area, consider Grotto America in nearby Tegna, or Grotto Ticinese.\n\nLauren Breedlove\n\nAscona has long since been a haven for writers, painters, and other artists. With such beauty, it's obvious why so many, like Swiss expressionist Ignaz Epper, drew their inspiration from the Ticinese landscape. His old workshop and home, Casa Epper, sits at the forefront of the Eden Roc property, having been transformed into a gallery exhibition space for local artists and a museum. It also hosts weekly art courses in things like linoleum printing. I spent an afternoon absorbing the artsy culture doing just that, where I delighted myself with a make your own Ascona postcard project, taught by the resident artist Maddalena Mora.\n\nSpeaking of the arts, Ascona is big on festivals. Everything from flowers to street art, film, and music are celebrated throughout the year. In fact, its sister city is New Orleans, and it hosts a very popular jazz festival every June, something worth planning a vacation around. Or, come in the autumn for the Chestnut Festival and soak up the fall colors.\n\nLauren Breedlove\n\nTicino as a whole is just begging to be explored. From indulgently slow strolls along the village promenade and live orchestra performances in the Piazza G. Motta to solo sunrise missions at Chiesa San Michele, a hillside church with an unbelievable view, and bike rides to the quiet neighboring village of Ronco, there's something for every interest. Take a picnic lunch to the Brissago Islands, where you can wander the botanical garden in between bites, or grab the ferry to other lakeside villages, one more picturesque than the other. Don't miss venturing into one of the unspoiled valleys Ticino is known for; a visit to Verzasca Valley's cliffside Corippo, a stone village frozen in time, will leave you dazzled.\n\nOr, take advantage of Hotel Eden Roc's Moving Mountains program, designed to add value to every guest's stay. It's curated and led by the property's outdoor butler (yes, this is a real job), who will take you on an adrenaline-pumping tandem paragliding adventure, a guided lake paddle in the marina's kayaks, a trek at sunrise, or to mingle with other guests over a game of bocce in a place that the world champion of the game calls home (and sometimes even makes a surprise appearance).\n\nAscona offers the best of Italy and Switzerland with Mediterranean-like weather — it's the stuff of dreams. The tiny village has, without a doubt, gained a permanent place in my daydreams. Monday through Friday afternoons, for the foreseeable future, I'll have my \"Ascona moment,\" as I've deemed it — one where my mind drifts from everyday life to sipping an Aperol on the pier, people-watching on the promenade or drooling over a cotton-candy sunset in Switzerland's unexpected Mediterranean escape.",
    "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation": "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation Henrique Schneider\n\nWhile the prosperous nation of 9 million people has seemingly low inflation, monetary policy mistakes have eroded purchasing power and clouded its economic future.\n\nA cafe terrace surrounded by residential apartment buildings in the old town district of Geneva, Switzerland on August 3, 2022. The overvalued Swiss residential real estate market is at risk of a large and abrupt price correction if interest rates rise quickly, according to Switzerland’s central bank. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Lax monetary policy failed to weaken the currency or prevent deflation\n\nNegative interest rates reduced the value of pension fund assets\n\nBest-case scenario: A short recession that corrects inflated prices\n\nSwitzerland has a reputation for responsible fiscal and monetary policies. The reported inflation rate of 3.4 percent in June 2022 seems to corroborate this image, especially when compared with 8.6 percent in the eurozone and 9.1 percent in the United States. The problem with this picture is: It is wrong.\n\nThe Swiss reality is, instead, marked by an ultra-lax monetary policy and a decrease in purchasing power since 2015. The Swiss situation serves as a case study for the many faces of inflation, a multifaceted phenomenon barely captured by inflation rates.\n\nInflation denotes an increase in the money supply not supported by an increase in the production of goods and services. Increasing money supply without real collateral just makes the bank’s balance sheets unjustifiably larger. This leads to a loss of purchasing power.\n\nThis loss, however, does not occur uniformly throughout the economy. Prices of some goods may increase faster than others, leading to a greater disparity in the relative prices of goods. Also, the increase of prices is just one manifestation of the loss of purchasing power, alongside skyrocketing valuations of real estate or exchange-traded securities and negative interest rates.\n\nIn other words, looking at the consumer price index as a proxy for inflation does not convey the entire picture. Inflation, the bloating of the money supply, shows itself in different ways in different sectors of the economy.\n\nSwitzerland’s bubble\n\nIn a bid to consciously weaken the Swiss franc, the Swiss Central Bank engaged in a prolonged phase of easy monetary policy. In January 2010, the Swiss Monetary Base Aggregate was about 87,000 million francs. By January 2020, it was around 589,000 million, peaking at approximately 757,000 in April 2022, with only a slight decline since then. In 12 years, the monetary base expanded 8.7 times.\n\nThis unprecedented bloat was initially championed on so-called technical grounds. The central bank, seen as committed to price stability, wanted to fight impending deflation. (One might ask, why? Deflation, the gain in purchasing power, can be economically viable. But this is a question for a different paper.) Increasingly, the bank’s true aims became clearer. Weakening the Swiss franc was a political move by a politically motivated central bank aiming at helping exporters through devaluation. Since the onset of this policy in 2010, its balance sheet expanded at unprecedented rates. As it proved unsustainable, the central bank decided to change its modus operandi by introducing a negative policy short-term interest rate. In the beginning of 2015, this rate went from 0.25 percent to -0.75 percent. Since then, it has stayed negative. Even after a very modest hike in June 2022, it still is -0.25 percent.\n\n× Facts & figures Swiss becoming less optimistic about the economy In Switzerland, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute economic barometer measures the level of optimism that people who run companies have about the performance of the economy. It fell to 90.1 in July 2022, part of a steady decline from its peak of 143.6 but far higher than its low of 49.6.\n\nFailed goals\n\nNeither of the intended goals was realized. The Swiss franc appreciated against the euro, breaking parity in 2022, and since then becoming slightly more valuable than the European currency. The central bankers wanted to keep the Swiss currency at what they called the “fair” exchange rate of 1.20 franc per euro. Central bankers also failed regarding their other goal. Between 2010 and 2020, the yearly inflation rate measured by the consumer price index was six times negative – in other words, deflationary. In the other six years, it remained below 1 percent, and therefore below the policy band of 1-2 percent.\n\nHousing prices climbed in real terms, making life less affordable.\n\nCentral bankers enlarging the currency supply neither maintained the Swiss franc in its “fair” exchange rate vis-a-vis the euro nor achieved their goal of fighting deflation. But this is only half the story of the Swiss failure. The other half is marked by the sectors in which a tremendous loss of purchasing power occurred – due to the machinations of the central bank.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nAlongside the inflation of the Swiss money supply, the country’s residential house price index went from about 130 points in 2010 to 190 in 2021. This represents an increase of over 46 percent or about 4 percent per year. This is much more than the development of wages, which are, on average, corrected by the consumer price index. The result is that housing prices climbed in real terms. With them, rents and other real estate-related prices made life less affordable, especially for the middle class.\n\nThen, the Swiss Market Index went from around 6,500 points at the beginning of 2010 to about 12,900 at the end of 2021; even after all the turmoil of this year, it is still over 11,100 points. At its highest point, the market for exchange-traded shares almost doubled. It still trades about 70 percent higher than in 2010. In the same period, the Swiss economy grew by some 20 percent. Again, this difference is a sign that the increased monetary base did not enter the real economy, as was hoped for, but remained in financial markets, causing asset price inflation.\n\nThe reason for the seemingly low inflation rate in Switzerland is the failure of central bankers to devaluate the Swiss franc.\n\nA third way in which the central bank’s inflationary policy diffused was via the pension system. One of the main reasons for the Swiss being relatively well-off is the mandatory but defined-contribution system of retirement provision. Currently, the whole system has around 1.3 trillion francs under management. The negative interest rate cut away some of these assets. First, the negative rates were applied to the pension scheme’s liquidity. Second, it lowered the bond market into negative territory as well as reduced the returns of the pension funds. Third, it led many funds to seek risks that were not appropriately remunerated by premiums. Negative interest rates chipped away at least 50 billion francs of the plan contributions.",
    "How A Trek Through Switzerland Inspired J.R.R. Tolkien To Create A Magical Middle-Earth": "Staubbach waterfall, Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland getty\n\nI made a plan to journey into Middle Earth to follow in the footsteps of a young J.R.R. Tolkien. “From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains,” he once wrote, “the journey... including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911.”\n\nMy goal was to head southwest, past the sharp snowy peaks glimpsed through misty mountains that overlook Lucerne and the lake town of Interlaken. I would venture into the dark green valley from Lake Thun into the Bernese Oberland area. I would be searching for Elfs and hobbits in hopes that Rivendell would be a place I could rest.\n\nExperts believe that the inspiration for Tolkien’s legendary Middle Earth tomes, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, were all taken from this spectacular region in Switzerland. The Alpine villages are all protected by the famed Jungfrau peak. For years hikers have been visiting these valleys in hopes of recreating the Lord of the Rings experience.\n\nJungfrau peak, at Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland getty\n\nBefore visiting the area I wanted to educate myself more to the background of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973), the former english professor at the University of Oxford, who wrote The Hobbit in 1936, and The Lord of the Rings in 1954. Both of the legendary books were located in the invented world of Middle Earth. But the inspiration for the pre-historic location was inspired from a hiking trip in 1911, when Tolkien was only 19. He trekked through the area as part of a group taking a walking tour in the Swiss Alps. This was the only time he ever visited the majestic area surrounded by its towering mountains and deep valleys, and it stayed with him throughout his life.\n\nTightrope walk between Augstmatthorn and Harder near Interlaken, Bernese Oberland, Switzerland getty\n\nI envisioned wandering through Interlaken at the northern end of the Lauterbrunnen, a gorgeous, deep valley beyond with views of three famous peaks, the Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau. The views of the mountains and Alpine villages were actually mentioned by Tolkien, “I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue.” Lauterbrunnen in fact is mentioned by numerous historians as Tolkien’s inspiration for Rivendell.\n\nHobbit village getty\n\nAlas, the pandemic idled my planned journey to Middle-Earth, but I continued to examine how Rivendell and the Misty Mountains would inspire countless adventurers to trek along to recreate the journey of a young Tolkien.\n\nI spoke with Greg Witt who operates the popular Alpine Wild walking tour company: “For a 19-year-old orphan living in England who had never seen Alpine peaks, towering waterfalls, tumbling glaciers, and deep-cut glacial valleys, Tolkien’s 1911 summer hiking through the Swiss Alps left an indelible impression. Not only the iconic scenery, but the place names, like Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, and Grimsel Pass have a Tolkienesque ring to them.”\n\nHe adds, “The best account of Tolkien’s journey and how it inspired his Middle Earth is Martin Monsch’s book: Switzerland in Tolkien's Middle-Earth: In the footsteps of his adventurous summer journey in 1911-with hiking suggestions. He’s thoroughly documented Tolkien’s route and has uncovered and documented many details I wasn’t aware of.”\n\n“We offer the In the Footsteps of Tolkien tour on demand or for a private group—not as one of our regularly scheduled tours,” he says. “I live in the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Alps, which features many of the settings which inspired Tolkien. I live at the mouth of Lauterbrunnen Valley, a classic glacial valley ringed by 72 waterfalls plunging over thousand-foot cliffs. I drive up the valley at least once a week and every time consider how that scenery shaped Tolkien’s Rivendell. Tolkien also passed by Trümmelbach Falls, a ten-tiered underground waterfall that would have left a powerful impression on any 19-year-old. His journey took him high into the remote upper Lauterbrunnen Valley where he would have been surrounded by dozens of immense glaciers—something he would have never seen in England.”\n\nAuthor William Bundy shared with me the inspiration of the region, “Tolkien’s Middle Earth is drawn from a variety of influences — the green landscapes of England, the homely beauty of Sarehole Mill, and the bleakness of industry, to name a few. Chiefly though, I think, is the incomparable beauty of nature itself, which was on full display as his party made their way through the Swiss Alps, one of the greatest mountain ranges on Earth.”\n\nThe Dingles Near Sarehole near the village of Sarehole. Heritage Images via Getty Images\n\n“The Misty Mountains form the backbone of his own fictional Middle Earth, and it’s little surprise perhaps that such majestic mountains on his own doorstep would form the inspiration for his own Alps,” he continues. “These mountains often test the characters in his most famous novels, traversing them as a kind of test almost; battling dark forces that threaten to overthrow the entire adventure, and often take them down into deeper places where no lights — or hope (seemingly), are to be found.”\n\n“Back then, in 1911, Tolkien was still embarking on a journey of study and language, and his formative experiences in the trenches of World War I would be several years away. These experiences (in my belief) informed much of the darkness in his Middle Earth creation and led to perhaps other aspects of his legendarium being shaped by environmental factors (the coastline of Holderness for instance).”\n\n“The Hobbit’s (Bilbo’s) journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains…is based on my adventures in 1911…” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien Getty Images\n\n“Starting in Interlaken, Tolkien’s group traversed through the landscape to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, a deep valley that many scholars now believe was the direct inspiration for the valley of Rivendell, a place instrumental to events both in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, home of Elrond, and his council, amongst other things. This interest is manifested in the company Alpenwild, which now runs walking tours following in Tolkien’s footsteps, formed by Greg Witt, and informed by the knowledge of Tolkien expert Alex Lewis.”\n\n“I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nAccording to the acclaimed writer John Howe, in his preface for the Martin S. Monsch book on Tolkien, “Some alpine landmarks are cited by Tolkien as inspiration, the most explicit being the Silberhorn, a side peak of the Jungfrau.\n\n“It is a reminder – and a bit of a word of warning – that inspiration does not always follow logic,” says Howe, “It was not the obvious and famous mountain trio of Jungfrau, Eiger and Mönch that inspired Tolkien, but rather a side peak of one of these.”\n\nHobbit entrance to the Greisinger Museum Greisinger Museum\n\nHe adds, “Tolkien did not directly lift sections of landscape from the Swiss Alps and sprinkle them across his far vaster Middle-earth, but took back with him a series of vivid and sublime impressions that may well have resurfaced naturally as he wrote.”\n\nIf you get a chance and want to dig really deep into the land of Hobbits, there is the largest collection of Middle-Earth objects at Greisinger Middle Earth Museum in the village of Jenins. The museum houses Bernd Greisinger's private collection focused on Middle-Earth, the world's largest of its kind consisting mostly of art and literature as well as collectors' items. All of the rooms are designed to make you feel like you are a visitor in Middle-Earth. Through the door of the hobbit hole you get into the museum, with rooms that are mostly most underground.\n\n\"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. Go in peace!” J.R.R. Tolkien",

    "Roger Federer opened the world's eyes to the real Switzerland - The Washington Post": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nPhilipp Loser is a columnist for the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. When the moment arrived, when the inevitable occurred and Roger Federer announced his retirement, it felt to us Swiss almost as though he had died. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight On the front pages of the nation’s major newspapers, his face was printed in shades of gray, much like Queen Elizabeth II’s a week earlier. There were eulogies about “King Roger,” reflecting on the elegance of his game and his character. The news channels ran special reports; on the radio, there was talk of little else. Journalists wrote about their personal encounters with the “Maestro.” Politicians posted selfies they had taken with him at some point over the last 20 years, and everyone who had even remotely come into contact with possibly the greatest tennis player of all time — as a physical therapist, or a ball kid or a racquet stringer — was given time and space to tell their own personal anecdote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Swiss standards, the excitement was at a fever pitch.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way. In 2005, Federer won 11 tournaments on the ATP Tour, including the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. His match record was 81-4. He was playing more successfully than almost any player before him. He was at peak dominance. Yet, when the people of Switzerland voted for the national broadcasters’ annual Sports Personality of the Year award at the end of the year, Federer came in second. He was beaten by a motorcycle racer who, though he hadn’t even performed exceptionally well that year, seemed somewhat more likable.\n\nIt took the tennis champ a while to recover from that sting. But even as his home country was denying him the recognition he so rightly deserved, he was beginning to get it everywhere else. Shortly after the disappointing Swiss award ceremony, Federer was voted World Sportsman of the Year for the first of five times, and by the time David Foster Wallace had turned him into a literary figure in a 2006 New York Times magazine article, it was clear to every last person in Switzerland: Roger Federer is a global presence, a world star, an icon. And hey — he’s one of ours!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reluctance with which we Swiss embraced our greatest sportsman has a lot to do with the Swiss nature. The world has long viewed us exclusively through a lens of cliches: chocolate, Nazi gold, cuckoo clocks (which have nothing to do with Switzerland). In movies and books, Swiss characters appear as sinister bankers — uptight, greedy and basically evil.\n\nBut in our own minds, we are not merely different from other nationalities — we are special. We even have a word for it: “Sonderfall,” a kind of Alpine exceptionalism. We are a nation of hard-working ordinary people, ever polite and in control. Not too full of ourselves, not too loud, not too ostentatious. We function in an egalitarian, democratic way. We’ve never had a king, and we do not tolerate grandiosity.\n\nAnyone who achieves something extraordinary in this system is subject to critical scrutiny. That’s why the motorcycle racer was voted Sports Personality of the Year. The message to Federer was not very subtle: Don’t get any big ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederer just continued to do what he had done before. He dominated the tennis world. And he did it like a good Swiss: politely. Severin Lüthi, Federer’s longtime coach, told my newspaper that on the day Federer announced his retirement, he called Lüthi three times to ask how he was coping. “I think many will remember him primarily as a nice person,” said Lüthi. “That’s more important than one title more or less.”\n\nHow very Swiss!\n\nThe longer Federer’s career lasted, the more the people of Switzerland came to realize that he was finally bringing the world’s view of us into alignment with our view of ourselves. Suddenly, we were no longer just money-grubbing gnomes from Zurich’s Bahnhofstrasse; we were Federer’s countrymen. On tennis’s world stage, people who couldn’t have found our country on a map were waving Swiss flags. Roger Federer was shining, and we were shining with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor that, we forgave him a lot: His second home in Dubai. His deliberately evasive way of not commenting on anything unrelated to tennis (ah, neutrality, another cliché). Or his excessive promotional activities (including for watches and chocolate. Of course).\n\nIn return, we Swiss were given a front row seat to sporting history. It was our Roger who played arguably the best tennis match ever against Rafael Nadal in 2008 (and unfortunately lost); it was our Roger who produced one of the greatest comebacks nine years later at the Australian Open; it was our Roger who raised an entire sport to a new level.\n\nNow, he is calling it quits, leaving us as we were before. In the days after his departure, one newspaper published a rather fitting cartoon. It showed two Swiss watching a giant in tennis clothes stomping away. “And we are small again,” the caption read.\n\nYes, we are. But it was great while it lasted. And for that, we’ll forever be grateful to Roger Federer.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Switzerland picks site near German border for nuclear waste storage": "Swiss authorities have selected a site in northern Switzerland not far from the German border to host a deep geological storage repository for radioactive waste.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of searching for the best way to store its radioactive waste, Switzerland is gearing up for its “project of the century”, entailing burying spent nuclear fuel deep underground in clay.\n\nThe organisation in charge of handling the country’s radioactive waste said on Saturday it had decided that the Nördlich Lägern region was the best of three sites it had been considering for the underground storage facility.\n\nOfficials “chose Nördlich Lägern as the safest site for a deep geological repository,” Felix Glauser, a spokesperson for the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Nagra), told AFP in an email, confirming a report by the Swiss news agency Keystone-ATS.\n\n“Extensive investigations have shown that Nördlich Lägern is the most suitable site and has the largest safety reserves,” he added.\n\nNagra has informed the local population directly and is expected to present its proposal to the Swiss government on Monday, Keystone-ATS reported.\n\nThe Swiss government is not due to make the final decision until 2029, but that is unlikely to be the last word as the issue would probably go to a referendum under Switzerland’s direct democracy system.\n\nSwiss nuclear power plants have been pumping out radioactive waste for more than half a century. After the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station in Japan, Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power gradually: its reactors can continue for as long as they remain safe.\n\nFor now, the waste is being stored in an intermediary depot in Würenlingen, 9.3 miles (15km) from the German border.\n\nWith the new facility, Switzerland hopes to join an elite club of countries closing in on deep geological storage. So far only Finland has built a site, in granite. Sweden gave the green light in January to build its own site for burying spent nuclear fuel in granite. France also has plans to store radioactive waste underground in clay.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This volume corresponds to a 60-year operating life of the Beznau, Gosgen and Leibstadt nuclear power plants, and the 47 years that Muhleberg was in operation before closing in 2019.\n\nFilling in the underground nuclear waste tombs should begin by 2060, followed by several decades of close monitoring. The site would be sealed some time in the 22nd century.",
    "Switzerland implements further EU sanctions to align itself with the EU": "On 31 August 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided on the implementation of further EU sanctions (namely the remaining measures of the seventh sanctions package), revising the Ordinance on Measures connected with the Situation in Ukraine (the “Ordinance“) accordingly. These amendments render the Swiss sanctions again in line with the EU sanctions, including on already previously adopted but not yet implemented measures. The amended Ordinance entered into force on 31 August 2022 at 18:00 CET.\n\nIn summary, these latest amendments, the most relevant of which are summarized below, include:\n\nAdjustments to various exemptions;\n\nClarifications of various provisions;\n\nSignificant changes to the deposit restrictions; and\n\nNew public procurement related bans.\n\nDual-use Goods and Goods for Military and Technological Enforcement\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of dual-use goods (Article 4 of the Ordinance) and of goods for military and technological enforcement (Article 5 of the Ordinance), and the provision of related services, for goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security was removed.\n\nInstead, goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security may henceforth merely be exceptionally licensed by SECO, and for civilian purposes or civilian end-users only.\n\nGoods for Industrial Strengthening\n\nUnder the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of goods for industrial strengthening and the provision of related services (Article 11a of the Ordinance), an exceptional license may be granted by SECO only if necessary for:\n\nmedical or pharmaceutical purposes with a non-military end use; humanitarian or evacuation purposes; or the exclusive use by Switzerland to meet its maintenance obligations in areas subject to a long-term lease agreement between Switzerland and the Russian Federation.\n\nLuxury Goods\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of luxury goods listed in Annex 18 (Article 14b of the Ordinance) was extended to jewellery and gold owned and carried by individuals leaving Switzerland destined for private use and not for sale.\n\nThere were also minor amendments to the Annex on luxury goods (Annex 18).\n\nAsset Freeze\n\nAt last, Article 15 of the Ordinance was amended to reflect standard Swiss sanctions language for asset freezes (e.g. as under the Belarus sanctions ordinance) and thus now expressly requires the freezing of funds and economic resources owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by:\n\nindividuals, entities and organizations listed in Annex 8; individuals, entities and organizations acting on behalf of or on the instructions of the individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraph a.; entities and organizations owned or controlled by individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraphs a. or b.\n\nDeposits and Crypto-Assets\n\nAfter months of back and forth between the EU and Switzerland on whether or not to apply a “look-through” approach under the deposit restrictions in their respective FAQs, the EU had caught Switzerland by surprise when introducing a “look-through” concept in its Regulation. Switzerland now aligned and amended not only Article 20 of the Ordinance but also its FAQ accordingly. Therefore, the deposit restrictions have been extended to banks, companies or organizations established outside Switzerland or the EEA in which more than fifty percent of the shares are held directly or indirectly by Russian nationals or individuals resident in Russia.\n\nThe amendment also removed the exemption to the restrictions for deposits and crypto-assets used for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between Switzerland, the EEA and Russia. Instead, individual exceptional licenses may be granted by SECO henceforth.\n\nPublic Procurement\n\nLast, but not least, Switzerland implemented the public procurement bans previously introduced by the EU, but delayed for reasons of clearing competences between the Swiss Confederation and its Cantons. According to the new Article 29c of the Ordinance, it is prohibited to award public contracts to (i) Russian nationals or individuals resident in Russia, (ii) legal persons, entities or organizations domiciled in Russia, (iii) legal persons, entities or organizations in which natural or legal persons, entities or organizations under (i) or (ii) hold more than fifty percent, directly or indirectly, or (iv) legal persons, entities or organizations acting on behalf of or on the instructions of natural or legal persons, entities or organizations under (i), (ii) or (iii). The conclusion of procurement contracts with any of the above parties is also prohibited.\n\nAll procurement contracts whose performance has not yet been completed must be terminated by 28 February 2023.\n\nThe prohibition also applies to awards and procurement contracts in which subcontractors or suppliers that qualify as any of the above parties participate with more than ten percent of the tender value. The prohibition does not apply to Russian nationals residing in Switzerland and majority held legal persons, entities or organizations already domiciled in Switzerland. There are also several grounds for exceptional licenses by SECO.\n\nThe latest version of the Ordinance is available here.",

    "4 Charming Small Towns in Switzerland Every Traveler Should Visit": "Riding on Switzerland’s efficient and comprehensive Swiss Rail system, you can’t help but marvel as one absurdly photogenic village after another whizzes by the window. Chalets with scalloped eves and painted shutters, half-timbered houses plastered in bright pastels, medieval-era mazes of cobblestone streets, and lively, café-strewn plazas bedecked with flower boxes —all these heritages and many more are perfectly preserved in this small country unmarred by the scars of war.\n\nHere are four Swiss towns that stand out for their charm, history, and sheer breath-catching beauty.\n\nStein am Rhein\n\nWalk through medieval splendor\n\nA history of more than a thousand years comes to life in Stein am Rhein , today a quiet town on Switzerland’s northern border but once a wealthy trading hub and the seat of the powerful St. George Abbey. The riches accumulated by ambitious merchants and Benedictine monks created a place that dazzles with color and artistic detail. Here, the half-timbered houses popular throughout northern Switzerland are covered in jewel-toned frescoes that depict the rhythms of medieval village life in fascinating detail, from grape harvests to formal banquets. Take a seat at one of the cheerful cafés that surround the Rathausplatz, or main square, and you’ll feel like you’re dining in an open air museum. The metalwork in Stein am Rhein is equally captivating, with whimsical birds, dragons, griffons, and other mythical creatures adorning doorways, chimneys, and hanging signs.\n\nMore history is on offer in the Gothic 15th-century St. George Abbey itself and at Hohenklingen Castle , perched atop a mountain and housing a restaurant with views over the town. Cross the river from the old town and climb the hill to a small village church on the hill for the best view of the abbey and riverfront promenade.\n\nMost visitors to Stein am Rhein make the mistake of treating it as a day excursion from Zurich, 35 miles away, often combined with a trip to Rheinfall , Europe’s largest waterfall. But doing this means missing out on the chance to see the frescoes’ brilliant colors glow in the late afternoon light and to stroll with residents along the riverfront promenade. Add an extra day and take the Untersee-Rhine river excursion in the direction of Konstanz, passing a string of 13th-century villages and stopping at the island of Reichenau on the German side of the lake, the entirety of which is a UNESCO World Heritage site .\n\nWhere to stay: Hotel Garni Adler\n\nBook Now\n\nCheck out Hotel Garni Adler , which offers Old-World elegance just off the Rathausplatz in the heart of the medieval town.\n\nThere are plenty of cows, but no cars, in Grimmelwald. Photo by Andrii Shepeliev/Shutterstock\n\nGimmelwald\n\nSleep on an Alpine plateau\n\nPerched on the edge of a cliff overhanging the Lauterbrunnen Valley, Gimmelwald holds itself magically in the past like a Swiss Brigadoon. Part of this comes from the fact that Gimmelwald is entirely car-free. You can’t drive there because there is no road, distinct from many other car-free Swiss villages where you park at the edge of town. Here the only vehicles you’re likely to see are miniature hay trucks loaded so high it’s hard to fathom how the bales don’t cascade to the ground. Cable cars rise up from the valley floor—the only transport in or out of Gimmelwald—then continue up the mountain to the Schilthorn , one of the highest peaks in Europe at 9,744 feet. At its top, viewing platforms offer 360-degree views of the entire Jungfrau range, and the revolving Piz Gloria restaurant is one of the highest dining destinations in Europe.\n\nWhat Gimmelwald lacks in size it makes up for in friendliness, with the residents who run the village’s handful of guesthouses, hostels, and pensions eager to pass the time of day. Visit the town’s website or use the QR code provided on local signage and take a guided walking tour of the village, listening to tales of the town’s colorful history, which dates back to the Middle Ages. And the cheese—you can’t miss the cheese, given that a rustic storehouse occupies pride of place in the center of the village, filled with slabs of the fresh summer season Bernese Alp cheese . A walking path connects Gimmelwald with the only slightly larger village of Murren above, providing multi-tiered views of the village and the Lauterbrunnen valley below as it switchbacks up the hillside. It’s also a chance to commune with the local belled cows.\n\nWhere to stay: Pension Gimmelwald\n\nBook Now\n\nSpend a night or two at Pension Gimmelwald , a classic chalet-style mountain hotel with a sunny patio restaurant and biergarten.\n\nSpiez is home to an historic castle, an ancient church, and some great swimming opportunities. Photo by Stephen H/Unsplash\n\nSpiez\n\nTour a lakeside castle\n\nA visit to Spiez in the Bernese Oberland starts and ends with stately Spiez Castle , which rises above the town from a promontory jutting into Lake Thun. Beneath it, a promenade lines the quiet, horseshoe-shaped harbor with a protected swimming beach and restaurants serving traditional fare on terraces. Touring the castle quickly becomes an interactive experience, with exhibits including a costume room featuring garb fit for a Renaissance fair and a jousting setup that will teach anyone who mounts the practice steed that riding while holding an unbelievably heavy lance is harder than it looks.\n\nNext to the castle, the spare Romanesque castle church remains much as it was a thousand years ago and features frescoes dating from the 13th century. The Museum of Local History and Viticulture just outside town demonstrates the history and traditional techniques of local winemaking in a barn and farmhouse. If possible, arrive or depart via the Lake Thun ferry , which connects Spiez with Thun at the west end of the lake and Interlaken at the east end. The train also stops at Spiez.\n\nWhere to stay: Hotel Eden Spiez\n\nHotel Eden Spiez\n\nHotel Eden Spiez , a circa-1903 lakeside resort with a waterfront restaurant.\n\nChur\n\nEnjoy plazas, churches, and trains\n\nThe fountain-bedecked plazas, skyscraping church towers, and cobblestone streets of Chur’s Old Town attest to the 500-year-old town’s stature as the oldest in Switzerland as well as its later importance as a rail hub.\n\nAmong Chur’s remarkably well-preserved buildings, don’t miss the Episcopal St. Mary of the Assumption Church on the hill above town, and 15th-century St. Martin’s Church with its spare Gothic tower and pretty sheltered plaza. The church also houses stained windows by Augusto Giacometti, added in 1919, which feature the artist’s characteristic elongated forms and forbidding expressions to give an overall affect of gloom. Chur honors its history as a market town with plenty of regular events, including a Saturday farmers’ market with produce, cheeses, meats, and more from the surrounding Graubunden region, a monthly flea market, and a traditional Christmas market with colorful crafts.\n\nVisitors also come to Chur to board the narrow-gauge Glacier Express , which has been making the epic journey across the Alps from Zermatt to St. Moritz since 1930. The trip’s profile was raised with the launch of a new Excellence Class that guarantees window seating in a luxe dining car with a seven-course meal served in stages throughout the ride.\n\nWhere to stay: Hotel Stern Chur\n\nBook Now",

    "Switzerland set to burn more trees to reach its climate and energy goals (commentary)": "Switzerland has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, with forest-derived biomass slated to play a growing role in the country’s energy mix, following a motion submitted to parliament in 2019 to fully “exploit the potential of energy wood.”\n\nThat decision came despite warnings from the Federal Office for the Environment noting: “strategies that only increase the use of wood as biofuel are not efficient from a CO2 balance perspective.”\n\nWood chips and pellets burned to make energy are one of the few profitable forestry products in an industry that has been losing money since the 1990s to the tune of 40 million francs ($41 million) annually for the past three years alone. Government subsidies also incentivize biomass logging and the downgrading of timber to “waste” wood.\n\nThe autonomy granted to the 26 Swiss cantons means logging rates and practices vary widely across the nation, as do energy policies promoted and adopted. The canton of Bern, where all photos were taken, produces the lion’s share, around one-fifth of all Swiss wood. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily of Mongabay.\n\nSwitzerland had embarked on an energy transition even before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but rocketing energy prices have hastened the need to decrease reliance on imported dirty fossil fuels and strengthen self-sufficiency. Policymakers, backed by a triumvirate of larger environmental NGOs, believe forest-derived biomass should be used to offset fossil fuel use.\n\nWoody biomass in the form of logs, pellets, wood chips and waste wood already accounts for 85% of all Swiss biomass, currently the second-most important renewable in the country after hydro. But an eye-opening report co-authored by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) estimates the additional sustainable energy potential of domestic forest wood to be anywhere from 40% to 89% of today’s use. The reasoning is underpinned by the claims that Swiss forests are growing and that harvesting is “near natural.”\n\nYet logging on the Central Plain, the country’s smallest but most productive forestry region, is already unsustainable, with annual yield (3.283 million cubic meters per year) outstripping growth (2.973 million m3/year). Forests here have shrunk by 3.6% and thinned by 11% in the past 20 years, but the latest 2021 Swiss Statistical Yearbook of Forestry says Switzerland’s overall “wooded area” decreased by some 2,742 hectares (6,776 acres) in 2020 compared to 2019. A further loss of 3,450 hectares (8,525 acres) was recorded by Global Forest Watch in 2021.\n\nThe “Alice in Wonderland Syndrome” is a very real affliction characterized by a distortion of perception: Here are five more impossible things which, like Alice, biomass proponents expect the Swiss public to believe, before breakfast, or after. We need not split hares:\n\nImpossibility #1: Only logging “waste” and timber “residues” are used\n\nPellets and wood chips derive largely from “residues” and “waste” from the timber and logging industries. Or so we are told, but a 2007 report co-authored by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH Zürich) and the federal offices of energy, agriculture and environment concluded such forestry byproducts were already being used for energy production and in the wood industry, thus limiting any market surplus.\n\nThe truth is that whole trees and roundwood are increasingly used. But it is not unusual for half the extracted timber to be considered “waste.” Sometimes virtually all of it is.\n\nImpossibility #2: Biomass is clean\n\nWood smoke is as hazardous to health as tobacco smoke and even so-called eco stoves have been shown to emit 650 times more fine particles, some of them within the home, than a modern HGV truck. Although Swiss laws governing fine particle emissions are more stringent than those of the European Union, they are still twice the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended limit of 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Filters are not yet mandatory for 13-to-20-kilowatt (kW) installations found in private Swiss homes.\n\nThe country’s 600,000 wood-burning systems also produce 75,000 metric tons of ash annually, which are dumped in landfills where they can cause structural instability, water table and soil contamination, and bioaccumulation of heavy metal(oid)s in food chains.\n\nLarge waste-burning plants, which are fed with up to one-third wood in addition to household and industrial waste, churn out an additional 4,000 metric tons of highly noxious ash, which is currently exported to neighboring countries because a law enacted to remove heavy metals has been delayed until 2026.\n\nImpossibility #3: Where there’s smoke, there’s no fire … or CO 2\n\nThe SFOE classifies “energy from biomass” as “CO 2 neutral.” Yet the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC), which includes Switzerland, deems it “simplistic” to call forest biomass carbon neutral and renewable because most trees regrow too slowly to offset emissions, and anyway forest carbon stocks should be preserved and increased.\n\nMore than 500 international scientists have gone further, warning that the switch from burning fossil fuels to burning wood is a “false solution” that, per unit of heat or electricity produced, adds up to three times more CO 2 to the atmosphere.\n\nImpossibility #4: Robust laws protect Swiss trees and forests\n\nThe Federal Act on Forest (ForA) whose aim is to “conserve the forest in its area and spatial distribution,” has failed the tattered Central Plain forests. Moreover, Switzerland is one of only two European countries to ban clear-cutting under both the ForA and the Ordinance on Forest (ForO), yet “areas cleared of all trees,” or “gaps” as they are called, are multiplying.\n\nConveniently, stands razed of all trees aren’t considered clear-cuts if the trees regrow (Article 20.2 in ForO), as they tend to do in a country with a high rate of natural regeneration. They also still count as forest. So do forestry roads and installations despite being clear cases of deforestation, also prohibited (Article 5.1 in ForA), at least on paper…\n\nLewis Carroll couldn’t have put it better.\n\nImpossibility #5: Money grows on trees\n\nThe high investment and operating costs associated with wood-burning systems needed subsidizing, to the tune of some 9.1 million francs ($9.3 million) in 2019. Such generous financial aid combined with aggressive lobbying have helped boost the numbers of domestic wood burners and larger biomass-fueled district heating and industrial power plants. But up too is the price of energy wood, which increased by 8% from 2016 to 2020, while that of wood pellets has rocketed by 67.7% (from 329 to 551.6 francs, or $336 to $562.6, per metric ton) since last July.\n\nThere are other hidden costs that the Swiss biomass industry remains tight-lipped about, including the fee for ash disposal, which has almost tripled for some power plants in recent years. But it is the tightening of the Ordinance on Air Pollution Control (OAPC) in line with WHO recommendations that could potentially result in even greater costs to consumers and building owners, and which should serve as a warning to potential investors.\n\nThe biomass industry claims it is protecting the planet, not its own interests and profits. This is the deepest rabbit hole of them all.\n\nLet the chips fall\n\nA 2021 study concluded that the best way for Switzerland to become both carbon neutral and energy self-sufficient would be to install combined solar panels and wind turbines high in the Alps, above the winter fog layer. Another option being pursued is heat pumps, which biomass proponents admit “have a much greater potential than energy wood.” Yet those proponents continue to foist their “false solution” on an unsuspecting and well-intentioned public using all the tricks in the Mad Hatter’s hat.\n\nBack in the 1990s, diesel cars were touted as ecological, taxes and incentives were introduced, and sales soared … as did black carbon, nitrogen oxides and particulates. We now know better and diesel vehicles are being phased out, but the same mistake and emissions are being made with woody biomass.\n\nWe must stop wasting time and cut carbon, not forests, which are so much more than just a collection of trees.\n\nBanner image: A mobile chipper making short shrift of freshly felled centenary beech trunks to produce wood chips that are burned “green,” with up to 50% moisture, in a local district heating system in February 2022. Image by Lucie Wuethrich.\n\nLucie Wuethrich began her activism in 2019 when a local beech forest, officially designated as a protection forest to mitigate landslides, was logged and she learned that 95% of the extracted wood was burned as energy wood. Since then she has researched logging and the Swiss forestry industry. She is the sole Swiss-based member of Biofuelwatch and of the Environmental Paper Network’s Biomass Working Group, and has worked closely with environmental NGOs across Europe to raise awareness of the growing pressure on forests.\n\nSee related:\n\nFEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the author of this post.
