    "Ready to die for Latvia?": "Editor’s note: Our world is complex. The Global Watchdawg fetches events from across the globe, aims to build relevance to the UW community, and strives for action through the lens of geopolitical pragmatism.\n\nThrough the window of a bus, while staring at old Soviet mid-rise apartments, I reminisced about the last six weeks I spent speaking Russian with my host family, discussing furniture choices over tea, playing “Durak,” and watching the entire dubbed version of “Shutter Island” without English subtitles.\n\nWhile all of this was occurring, Ukrainian civilians in Izium were being killed, tortured, and buried in mass graves by Russian soldiers about 850 miles southwest of me.\n\nUpon my arrival to the United States, the news worsened — Putin had ordered a partial mobilization of those in Russia’s military reserve.\n\nNot to mention, renewed conflicts between Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to take lives, and border conflicts between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are reaching a death toll of 100.\n\nOver which, Russia has, ironically, urged a peaceful and diplomatic de-escalation.\n\nPoorly drawn Soviet borders, internal politics in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and a weakening Russian influence over the area have all contributed to this Balkan powder keg-esque situation in a post-colonial space.\n\nMy experience abroad was not in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, or Tajikistan — nor was it in Russia.\n\nMy home base was in Latvia’s second largest city, Daugavpils, located just 75 miles from the Latvia-Russian border. Well within the bounds of NATO protection, the city houses an approximately 80% native Russian-speaking population.\n\nFrom there, I traveled through Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, studying the Baltic countries and their long, dark history with Soviet occupation.\n\nUnfortunately, my excursion doesn’t even begin to capture the full extent of Soviet imperialization. In fact, every single country mentioned thus far has been a Soviet republic.\n\nThe aforementioned Daugavpils sits in an interesting cultural and political environment, due to the fact that it’s ethnically Russian, but also Latvian, by nationality.\n\nIn the city center, I could see Ukrainian flags being flown outside homes, but when talking to older citizens, there was a clear hesitation about discussing the war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of the folks I conversed with declared that the war is “bad for both sides” and remained lukewarm. While not factually incorrect, there is a clear aggressor in this war.\n\nIt would be unfair to characterize Daugavpils as pro-Russia, as it actually leans pro-Ukraine. However, during my time abroad, I’ve learned that leaning pro-Ukraine doesn’t cut it anymore.\n\nThis “Daugavpils effect” is something I worry about on our own campus.\n\n“It’s better to be on the map with positive views,” Māris Selga, ambassador of Latvia to the United States, said. “But in many ways, the war in Ukraine has put us on the map for completely different reasons.”\n\nHow many more countries need to first appear on the news in bloody conflicts before UW students can place them on a map? How many more “unpredictable” wars need to start before there is more proactive action rather than vapid performative reaction?\n\nCarl Larson, a soldier from Seattle who fought in the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine and organizer of Friends of Ukraine’s Military, expressed his anger.\n\n“This pisses me off … Most of my fellow Amercians seem to not care,” Larson said. “This was an opportunity to show my fellow Americans, with my own body, my own life, how important it is for us. It’s still our fight.”\n\nLarson is, arguably, absolutely right. While Larson’s choice is one potential avenue for activism, at an absolute, bare minimum we should be getting educated on this topic.\n\nThe next step for UW students who live in Seattle is to send a letter to Rep. Jayapal and encourage her to be more firm on her support of Ukraine with President Biden.\n\nIf you don’t live in Jayapal’s district, this site can help you identify your representative.\n\nDiplomacy is always the best first option. But as it stands right now, Ukraine needs continued military, humanitarian, and political support from the United States.\n\n“When dealing with a great power, the one thing you don’t do is appease,” George Beebe, former director of the CIA’s Russian analysis and staff advisor to former Vice President Dick Cheney, said. “Show that easy conquest will not be achieved.”\n\nIn this regard, Ukraine has been successful. Many thought that Kyiv would be taken in a matter of days. But fortunately, massive international support has shown leaders in the Kremlin that war is, and always will be, costly.\n\nAs we pass the 200 day mark, political fatigue and apathy become culprits of inaction. I urge UW students to possess the same level of energy and grit they had earlier this year on Feb. 22.\n\n“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, his success there will embolden China, North Korea, and every malevolent dictator in the world,” Larson said.\n\nZelensky has consistently outlined his demands, which include the reunification of Crimea, which had been annexed by Russia in 2014, into Ukrainian borders and reparations before peace talks.\n\nCrimea is considered by Russia to be Russian soil. If Zelensky isn’t bluffing with these demands and pushes forth with military action, this will mean a perceived invasion from Ukraine by Russia.\n\nIt is quite likely that there will be a quick and explosive response. Regardless, enabling unbridled aggression of a sovereign nation like Ukraine isn’t the M.O., we should be pursuing it.\n\nDespite Ukrainian counter-offensive success in Kharkiv and Kherson, Putin seems willing to bind his legacy to a brutal war of attrition.\n\n“If the freedoms and liberties deteriorate or are taken away from the more remote corners of the world … this is certainly something that will harm and affect the other guys,” Kristjan Prikk, ambassador of Estonia to the United States, said.\n\nThe longer this war goes on, the worse it gets, the more likely a full-blown world war will break out, and it’s not too extreme to say that it may include the United States.\n\n“Most NATO members are not ready for war with Russia,” Steven Pifer, former ambassador of the United States to Ukraine, said.\n\nThis is the unfortunate truth. Many NATO countries that border Russia like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Norway, and Finland will rely heavily on U.S. support if push comes to shove.\n\nThe United States, of course, has already been leagues ahead in its support of Ukraine.\n\nThough a world war is unlikely, it is worth noting that the countries we owe a defensive obligation to are much more connected to us than we think — and that includes Daugavpils.\n\nAfter the bus took off on our last day of formal study, the words of a young, patriotic Latvian echoed in my head.\n\n“I am ready to die for Latvia,” she said.\n\nAre you?\n\nReach writer Raj Kumar at opinion@dailyuw.com.

    "Latvia Registered 2 Asylum Requests From Russians Fleeing Mobilisation as of Saturday": "The Latvian authorities have revealed that two citizens of Russia requested asylum in the country as of Saturday, September 24.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ministry of Interior of Latvia explained that the requests for asylum were received following Russia’s mobilisation, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nNonetheless, despite receiving these two applications, the authorities have made clear that they will not grant asylum to those fleeing mobilisation.\n\nAccording to the Public Broadcasting of Latvia (LSM), the Minister of Interior of Latvia, Kristaps Eklons, said that mobilisation in Russia does not constitute sufficient grounds for being granted asylum in the country.\n\nIn addition, the Minister noted that each case would be assessed individually and, at the same time, pointed out that asylum en masse has never been granted in Latvia, and it will not do so in the future.\n\nLSM explains that the State Border Guard has already stepped up controls at the border in order to prevent the border from being crossed by citizens of Russia who are trying to avoid mobilisation.\n\nApart from receiving two asylum requests, the Ministry of Interior revealed that the country refused entry to a total of 23 Russians since September 19, when the entry ban officially entered into force.\n\nLatvia, together with the other Baltic States and Poland, introduced an entry ban for Russian on September 19 and stopped issuing Schengen visas for them.\n\nIn line with the current rules that Latvia has, citizens of Russia holding a visitor Schengen visa issued by the Latvian authorities or any other country are not permitted entry. However, the authorities have not that certain exemptions apply.\n\nAs soon as such strict measures entered into force, the authorities reported that the number of Russians attempting to cross the border significantly decreased. The government said earlier this week that the number of citizens of Russia who tried to enter Latvia was around 1,000 since September 19.\n\nAdditionally, the same revealed that 27 of the Russians attempting to cross the border had C visas, seven per cent of them had D visas, 53 per cent of them had residence permits that are issued to family members of Latvian nationals, and another 13 per cent of them were seafarers who cannot leave the ship.\n\nSimilar to Latvia, the other two Baltic countries, Lithuania and Estonia, have also said that they will not grant asylum o citizens of Russia fleeing mobilisation. The foreign ministers of the three Baltic States said that Russians fleeing their country to avoid mobilisation will not enjoy special treatment.",
    "Sewage monitoring indicates a surge of Covid-19 spread in Latvia": "Sewage monitoring data for some of Latvia’s cities indicates an increase of coronavirus concentration, which indicates a surge of the spread of Covid-19, as reported on Twitter by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre representative Dita Gudra.\n\nSeptember’s monitoring data indicates increased concentration of the virus in sewer water in Riga, Jurmala, Liepaja and Jelgava. Measurements in Liepaja, however, show signs of stabilisation and reduced concentration of the virus.\n\nA sharp surge is reported in Ventspils, which contradicts data reported by the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\nIn Valmiera and Jekabpils there is an increase of coronavirus concentration reported, which indicates increased spread of the infection.\n\nA sharp increase of concentration of the virus is observed in Tukums as well, where measurements are on a sharp rise. The situation in Salaspils also indicates increased concentration of Covid-19.\n\nIn all Latvian municipalities surveyed the dominant Covid-19 variant is Omicron sub-variant BA4/5, which is found in more than 95% of cases.\n\nAs previously reported, Latvia has adopted a system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 particles in sewer water in order to predict outbreaks of the virus in populated areas.\n\nThe research included BIOR, Riga Technical University’s Water Research and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre.\n\nAccording to information published on BIOR website, sewer monitoring plays an important role in viral epidemiology. Analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples taken from sewage systems provides additional information to SPKC and other health institutions in order to predict and observe dynamics of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe advantage of this monitoring approach is that it is possible to determine the presence of infected people who have and don’t have symptoms in a municipality.\n\nCollection of sewage samples from centralised systems is done twice a week. These samples are then delivered to BIOR and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, which analyse those samples for presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles and viral RNA. Samples are tested for other public health related particles.",

This is a joint Baltic states' project and the Defense Ministry expects the US to support it with co-funding.\n\nOn Monday, two HIMARS systems were delivered to the Spilve Aifield and Liepaja Airport in Latvia by US military transport aircraft for a training exercise. A US plane with a HIMARS on board landed at Spilve also last October.\n\nAs he welcomed the HIMARS systems at the Spilve Airfield, Pabriks indicated that in accordance with the decisions taken at the NATO Summit in Madrid and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's recent visit to Latvia, the US' military presence in Latvia will become more visible and stronger.\n\nAlthough Pabriks did not elaborate on the schedule or price of the purchase, he said that Latvia will likely buy the high precision artillery rocket systems in less than five years. He also said that Latvia will buy slightly fewer than ten systems.",
    "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short": "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nTEREHOVA, Latvia — The road carrying a mile-long stream of semi-trucks waiting to enter Russia from Latvia is lined with port-a-potties and dumpsters full of junk-food wrappers and empty caffeinated soda bottles. The wait to get through this border crossing takes around two days.\n\n\"You should have seen this line two months ago,\" recalls Belarusian trucker Dmitri, who sits in the cab of his truck passing the time watching Russian television. \"There were more than a thousand trucks and it took at least seven days to cross into Russia.\"\n\nDmitri, who doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted for his opinions, has been idling here for two days, inching toward the front of the line. The mustachioed man in his 50s says he's transporting a trailer full of beer from Germany to Moscow, and he says because his country has aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has impacted his work and reputation.\n\n\"I've lost work from this and people treat me worse than before,\" he says. \"I was in Lithuania a few days ago trying to eat at a Ukrainian restaurant there, and they wouldn't let me. They kicked me out and told me to get my food from Putin instead.\"\n\nDmitri says he ate at a restaurant across the street, but the incident stuck with him. \"The leaders behind this war aren't suffering from it,\" he says. \"It's us, the regular people, who have to suffer.\"\n\nLatvia, a member of NATO and the European Union, has pushed for a strong global response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's 180-mile border with Russia has become tense as a result. Long lines of trucks at border crossings illustrate the toll economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus have taken, and anxieties among those living along the border are also on the rise.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nSome of those in Latvia are stateless\n\nFarther back in line is Anatoly Chibaterevsky, who's driving 1,000 miles from his home in western Latvia to his brother's funeral in Volgograd, a city in southwest Russia. The 75-year-old has lived in Latvia most of his life. He doesn't say what country he was born in, but explains that his family moved here as part of the Soviet occupation of the country shortly after World War II, and returned after being deported to Siberia for a decade's worth of hard labor in 1949.\n\nWhen Latvia gained independence in 1991, Chibaterevsky was one of tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who were never given Latvian citizenship. He is essentially stateless. He rifles through his suitcase and emerges with his passport, which says \"Latvian noncitizen\" on its burgundy cover.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nHe says he hopes the Russians let him enter. \"They usually let me cross with no problems,\" he says, \"but last time they told me, 'You ran away from Russia, so you're staying in Latvia.'\"\n\nEthnic Russians are a large minority in Latvia\n\nEthnic Russians like Chibaterevsky only make up a quarter of Latvia's population of 2 million, but they're the norm in the towns along the eastern border, where many of them speak Russian and identify with Russia. And up until recently, they got much of their information about the world from Russian TV.\n\n\"Russian channels are now blocked and since Russia has been declared the aggressor, we just follow orders and watch what we're being ordered to watch,\" says Nadezhda Kravchenko, who lives in the Latvian border town of Zilupe.\n\nWhen asked how Russia's war in Ukraine is affecting her, she says Latvia has no power over the situation, that it's none of her business, and then walks away without saying another word.\n\nNearly everyone NPR approached in Zilupe was hesitant to talk about the war.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid to tell you what they really think, but I'm not,\" says Jurijs, a 65-year-old pensioner who says he's not scared to talk about the war, but doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nHe says he watches both Russian and Latvian news and he's decided the Latvian side is propaganda. \"Ukrainians are fascists and the U.S. gives them weapons,\" he complains, repeating talking points from Russian state TV. \"Russia has liberated them, but they continue to plant land mines and bomb kindergartens and hospitals. Why is Ukraine doing this?\"\n\nLatvian authorities are cracking down on public support of Russia, and that's why Jurijs says nobody here wants to openly talk about the war. \"They can put you in jail for that,\" he says. \"But I'm old. Let them put me in jail for supporting Russia. When Russia invades, they'll come and liberate me.\"\n\nSome Russian-speakers seem to be changing their views on the war\n\nA poll taken earlier this year by Latvian research firm SKDS showed only 25% of Latvians who spoke Russian at home sympathize with the Ukrainian side in the war, while 83% of Latvian speakers supported Ukraine. In another poll conducted by the same firm, 36% of Russian-speakers in Latvia believed that Russia was fighting \"Naziism\" in Ukraine, a narrative pushed by Russian state television, while just 6% of Latvian speakers believed the same to be true.\n\n\"What we know from surveys done before the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that a majority of Russian speakers in Latvia actually had favorable views regarding Russia and Putin,\" says SKDS Executive Director Arnis Kaktins. \"The reason for that is quite a large part of this population lived in the Russian information field, and we know it is very specific, distorted propaganda, and inevitably you are going to believe it and start to think the same way.\"\n\nKaktins says the polls his firm have taken since the war began show an increasing number of Russian-speaking Latvians changing their views to a more nuanced and critical stance on Russian state narratives. Kaktins says young Russian-speaking Latvians tend to be the most critical of Russia's government.\n\nA Ukrainian seeks a roundabout route to the Donbas\n\nBack at Latvia's Terehova border crossing, cars inch forward toward Russia. Among them is the Toyota SUV of Natalia Kononenko, who never thought she'd be here. She's Ukrainian, and she's driven nearly 1,000 miles from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, where she's been staying, as her home region of Donetsk in the eastern part of her country is being fought over by Russian and Ukrainian troops. Her son, a young student, is stuck there.\n\n\"There's talk that the Russians will take over the rest of our region and then we'll have to make a decision to be on one or other side,\" she says. \"But until now, no one is forcibly taking us anywhere.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnd that's why Kononenko is on a rescue mission to pull her son out of the Donetsk region. Instead of driving a few hundred miles through the fighting on the front line and risking getting killed, she's driving thousands of miles, circumnavigating Ukraine, so that she can approach Donetsk from Russia, a journey that'll take several days.\n\nShe's praying that the Russian border guards will allow her into the country. \"There shouldn't be a problem, but we don't know,\" she says with a nervous grin. \"We'll just keep on driving and hope for the best.\"\n\nBehind her in the line is Anatoly Chibatersvsky, the Latvian noncitizen who's also hoping to get to the other side. \"There are benefits to being a noncitizen,\" he concedes. \"With my passport I don't have to buy visas for the EU nor for Russia.\"\n\nHe says even his children who are eligible for Latvian citizenship have opted to be like him and remain stateless. In today's world of national allegiance and the wars fought over it, he says being stateless is, in some ways, a relief.",
    "Moscow Losing Another Nation’s Orthodox Church—This Time Latvia’s": "Since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Orthodox faithful and leaders in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries began to press for independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, the Russian Orthodox Church and equally the Russian government have been worried about these efforts and worked hard to oppose them. This anxiety was further exacerbated in January 2019 when the Ecumenical Patriarch granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which cost Moscow its largest presence abroad (Novayagazeta.ru, March 27). Indeed, the Moscow Patriarchate is clearly in retreat almost everywhere in the former Soviet space, a retreat that has increased in speed given the Kremlin’s all-out aggression in Ukraine (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Now, Moscow is in the process of losing control over yet another national Orthodox church—this time in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nOn September 5, Latvian President Egils Levits called for the Seimas (Latvia’s parliament) to give the Latvian Orthodox Church autocephaly and thus formalize its complete independence from Moscow. Three days later, the country’s parliament passed a law that requires the Latvian Orthodox Church to bring its statute into conformity with the new law by October 31 and thus become independent from Moscow (Eng.lsm.lv, September 5; Meduza, September 5). The parliament acted so quickly because, according to Levits, such a change was required for Latvia’s national security given the long history of Moscow using Orthodox churches abroad for political purposes (Orthodoxtimes.com, September 10).\n\nNot surprisingly, the Moscow Patriarchate and Kremlin media have reacted with fury. Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, an adviser to Moscow Patriarch Kirill, said this was a most unhappy development because Latvia’s constitution proclaims the separation of church and state. Balashov also characterized the move as totally unnecessary because the Latvian Orthodox Church has been self-administrating since 1992. He said it was a return to the medieval principle of cujus regio, ejus religio, which held that the ruler of a country determines its religion. Moreover, he made clear that, since the state has no right to grant autocephaly, Moscow has no intention of recognizing Riga’s action and that no other Orthodox church should either (Interfax-religion.ru, September 8; Stoletie.ru, September 9).\n\nMeanwhile, commentaries in pro-Kremlin media were even more emotional. One in Vzglyad, for example, labeled Latvia’s move as “completely fantastic and unprecedented in world practice” (Vzglyad, September 5). More independent Russian outlets were more cautious and apparently more accepting of something they consider inevitable in the current environment (Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 9).\n\nThe proximate cause of what Latvia has done lies in Ukraine, both in Russia’s war there and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate’s declaration of independence from Moscow because of the war and the earlier grant of autocephaly to the competing Orthodox Church of Ukraine. All this has echoed throughout Orthodox churches in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries, which, in Soviet times, and in some earlier cases, were subordinate to Moscow. But Riga’s latest move is also the product of uniquely Latvian concerns about ending arrangements that its people and government see as surviving from the time of Soviet occupation, and they have good reason to believe Moscow has and will again use these arrangements to compromise Latvia’s independence.\n\nLike most things connected with the Russian Orthodox Church, its situation in Latvia has been both complex and murky. In 1921, after Latvia gained independence, the Russian Orthodox Church recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as autonomous, but the Riga church remained nominally subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1936, following the Soviet assassination of the head of the Orthodox Church in Latvia, the Ecumenical Patriarchate recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as part of its dominion. The Soviets suppressed that arrangement when they occupied Latvia during World War II; but in December 1992, after Latvia regained independence, the Latvian Orthodox Church again became autonomous but did not depart from the canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate. That was not a program many Latvians welcomed because Moscow retained the right to appoint the church’s head and the Latvian church was required to follow Moscow’s decisions (Apn.ru, September 7).\n\nTensions regarding this have only increased over the past decade and have exploded since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, an action Latvia has vehemently opposed. First of all, the Latvian government has published records from Soviet times showing that the metropolitan of the Latvian Orthodox Church was a KGB agent. Second, the Seimas passed a law requiring that the heads of all churches in Latvia must be Latvian citizens, something the Orthodox ones had not been but eventually conceded to despite fears in Moscow that it was giving up too much (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1, 2019). And third, the hitherto microscopic Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church has begun to attract more followers and has become at least potentially a genuine competitor to the Latvian Orthodox Church, which has just over 100 parishes and a claimed membership of 350,000 (see EDM, October 17, 2019).\n\nGiven the small size of Latvia and the Latvian Orthodox Church, some may be inclined to dismiss this latest development as little more than a tempest in a teapot. But three primary reasons point to why that would be a mistake. First, Moscow has shown its willingness to use its church in Latvia to mobilize ethnic Russians against the regime and can be expected to do so in the coming weeks, thus creating another problem for Riga. Second, the Latvian action, one by the state regarding religion, may provide a model for other governments in the post-Soviet space to take similar actions, thus accelerating the departure of Orthodox churches from Moscow’s supervision—or at a minimum raising the battle of this possibility to government levels. And third, this Latvian action, coming as it does during the course of Putin’s war in Ukraine, will only intensify fissiparousness (cleavages) within the Orthodox world generally and indeed within Christianity as a whole regarding relations with Moscow by highlighting the unfortunate history of the Kremlin using the church for anything but religious ends.",

HIMARS has high-precision rocket artillery systems with an operating radius of about 300 kilometers.\n\nThe practice with HIMARS at the Spilve airfield will be observed by Defense Minister Artis Pabriks, Commander General of the National Armed Forces Leonīds Kalniņš, and the USA Ambassador in Latvia John Carwile.\n\nAfter landing at Liepāja airport, the HIMARS systems will be transported to the Šķēde military base to practice target shots in the Baltic sea in the Latvian exclusive economic area.\n\nIt's not the first time HIMARS had made an appearance in Latvia. A year ago, a similar demonstration was made, as we reported at the time.\n\nIn addition to \"Namejs 2022\", more exercises under the moniker \"Silver Arrow\" are taking place.",
    "Latvia exposes NATO’s sham victory against Russia": "The Zelensky regime seems to be overjoyed by their recent supposed counteroffensive against the Russians. To tell you the truth, Moscow’s recent retreat on the battleground in some areas of Ukraine has been misunderstood to be Putin’s weakness.\n\nStill, it looks like NATO was indeed overjoyed by the development until Putin cleared his motive behind the war and now the baltic state Latvia has solidified the Russian’s position of strength.\n\nLatvia Knows Moscow better than the west\n\nThe Latvian cabinet recently approved suggestions from the Defense Ministry concerning the creation of the State Defense Service which will be responsible to oversee the annual military service.\n\nYou see, the Latvian’s proximity to the Russian megastate has enabled them to gather better intelligence than any of the western states. And the Latvians know that Moscow is far too big of a power to just back out of the war. The Latvian leaders knew that the whole development must be nothing but a part of a larger strategy inculcated by the Russians.\n\nWell, the doubts were soon enough cleared by Putin. In a rare address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the decree concerning partial mobilization of its 2 million-strong military reserves has been signed as the war in Ukraine reaches its seventh month.\n\nThe decision, which Putin said was taken “to defend the motherland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being viewed as an escalatory move by the West.\n\nPutin had initiated the military operation with the aim of liberating the oppressed people of Donbass. And now when the region is under complete Russian control, Putin plans to pull back the regular army and replace it with conscripts to maintain peace in the liberated regions and continue defending the territory if Ukraine launches a ‘counter-offensive’ against the ethnic Russian populace.\n\nThe Baltics Know that NATO is unreliable\n\nYou see, other NATO members like Poland and Hungary are just now coming to consensus with the realities of NATO. The alliance’s leaders have not been instrumental in protecting the interests of its members and have instead used them to carry out their own personal agendas.\n\nThe USA and Germany have extended unparalleled pressure on Poland to support Ukraine militarily. Although, Poland was not reimbursed for the support it was offered by Germany after Warsaw sent its essential military equipment to support Kyiv. The unapologetic refusal by Germany triggered the leaders of Poland who soon started taking anti-EU stands.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, has long taken an opposing stand and also refused to condemn Russia for its military operation and has continued with its energy deals with Russia.\n\nAlthough the Baltic nations know the capacities of the Russian defense system and had previously come to a consensus the west will not come to aid in the event of an escalation by Moscow.\n\nLatvia has so far been the only Baltic state where conscription has not been undertaken since 2007, it resumed in 2015 in Lithuania, and has continued uninterrupted since the 1990s in Estonia.\n\nThe current defense budget of Latvia is €758 million (2% of GDP). The establishment of the State Defense Service will be financed from the growing funds for defense, which would now reach 2.5% of GDP over the next three years.",

    "Destination: Latvia": "BY EKATERINA KRONGAUZ\n\nIldar, 35; Zhenya, 28\n\nIldar greeted the New Year of 2022 with his partner, Zhenya, a dog, and two cats in their apartment in Moscow. Two years earlier they had moved to Moscow from Noyabrsk (a city of 100,000 people 3,000 kilometers from Moscow), and in the fall of 2021 they took out a fifteen-year mortgage for 7 million rubles (U.S. $100,000) with a $1,200 monthly payment, and bought their first apartment. They made some repairs and celebrated the New Year in their new home.\n\n\n\nIldar (left) and Zhenya on a walk Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nThe move to Moscow happened spontaneously. Ildar had studied as a sound engineer at the Moscow Institute in absentia, working remotely for a podcast studio. Zhenya had her own business in Noyabrsk, a plus-size women's fashion clothing store, which she ran jointly with her mother.\n\n“I never wanted to leave. I have always resisted it at all stages of our life. I don't like stepping out of my comfort zone. And I didn’t want to leave because I don’t know a single foreign language,” says Ildar.\n\nWhen the war began, Zhenya became very ill.\n\nZhenya was born in Ukraine. Her family is from Ukraine, and her grandmother was still living in the city of Dobropolye, Donetsk oblast—currently a Russian-occupied territory.\n\n“Every day we talked with my grandmother,” she says. “We packed a bag for her in case of emergency. The neighbors cleared out the basement, and we rehearsed with her over the phone going to the basement. But in the end, we managed to persuade my grandmother to go west.”\n\nThe idea to leave Russia came to Zhenya first in 2014, the year the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia. Zhenya told Ildar, “All your doubts are garbage! Let’s go to Holland,” but Ildar didn’t want to leave then.\n\n“I began to look up information on Georgia on Google—everyone was talking about Georgia,” Ildar recounts. “Visas were not needed. Living was cheap. I could not discuss this with Zhenya; she was in some kind of coma. I now understand that we generally had very little contact then. She sat and read the news on Telegram all day long.” At that moment, Ildar was afraid of a new iron curtain and the mobilization of all men; this was what scared posters on the Telegram channel. And Ildar began to discuss with Zhenya leaving Russia.\n\nIldar did not discuss the war or leaving Russia with his parents. “They live in a village in Bashkiria. And we didn't talk much. When I visited them, Solovyov”—a popular propagandist state TV host—“was on all the time. At the beginning of the war, my mother sent me some playful poems about poor Mother Russia, how the West kept pecking at her. I tried to explain my position to her, and she hung up. Several times I tried to talk to her, but she abruptly turned off her phone. I hadn’t seen this before—we don’t hang up on each other in our family.”\n\nThrough work acquaintances, Ildar and Zhenya learned that they could get a humanitarian visa to stay in Lithuania (Ildar is working on several sociopolitical podcasts). And Zhenya and Ildar decided to go. Ildar changed all their money at an insane rate (he managed to get a little more than €6,000), and agreed with a friend that he could rent their apartment for $250. Ildar also lined up more work for himself. “When I'm worried, I always load up on work. First, it helps not to think. Second, in this way I can calm my fears about money.”\n\nWhile the visas and all the documents for two cats and a dog were being processed, Zhenya went to Noyabrsk to say good-bye to everyone. A week before leaving, Zhenya asked Ildar if he was going to say good-bye to his parents and if he understood that he might not see them for a very long time. So Ildar went: five hours one way and five hours return.\n\n“I called them and said I would come. When I arrived, they were horrified. They thought something terrible had happened, that perhaps I was getting divorced. I said, “But what I told you doesn’t scare you?!”\n\n\n\nIldar, pictured with his cat Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nAs they started talking, Ildar realized that his assumptions had been wrong: “They understand everything. They understand that something bad is happening. They just think that you shouldn‘t raise your head or open your mouth.” His mother told Ildar that she was getting rid of the phones because she was afraid that they would be tapped and that Ildar would talk too much on the phone and would be arrested.\n\nThe family had never talked much about their past, but Ildar remembers some conversations: a great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been dispossessed, possibly even killed. Whether someone in the family was imprisoned Ildar does not know either, but his mother was afraid this might happen, and afraid for Ildar. “I re-posted a lot in the early days [of the war] on my social media. I remember now that I was a little afraid then. I edit various podcasts, and there were audio diaries of people in Ukraine during the bombings. It was already forbidden to say the word “war,” but all these criminal articles about discrediting the army did not yet exist. Of course, my mother was also afraid for me. But we had a good good-bye. We went to the banya with Dad,” says Ildar.\n\nOn April 29, Ildar’s father-in-law came down to Moscow and loaded into the car one suitcase each for Ildar and Zhenya, two electric guitars, two cats and a dog, and a friend who was also going to Riga, and together they made their way to the Russian-Estonian border. He dropped them off at 8 a.m., and with their suitcases, guitars and pets, Ildar and Zhenya tried to cross the border.\n\nThey were turned back. “It turned out that a humanitarian visa was not enough for us. We needed an additional letter saying that we were entering by invitation, an entry permit.” It was Easter Sunday, but Ildar managed to get such a letter, print it out, and cross the border at 8 p.m.\n\nIn Latvia\n\nIldar and Zhenya have been living in Latvia for four months on a Lithuanian humanitarian visa. Ildar works for a podcast studio. Zhenya volunteers at the NGO Helping to Leave and helps Ukrainian families from Mariupol who ended up in Russia get to Europe.\n\nIldar and Zhenya had hoped they could stay in Riga, but recently Latvian officials have begun to say that they would neither provide documents to Russian citizens nor renew existing visas.\n\n“I don’t think about anything and I don’t plan anything. We have until April 2023. I know that Zhenya Googles at night about study visas, about Portugal. And there is even an option in Bulgaria,” says Ildar.\n\nThere is another option that Ildar does not want to think about right now. Zhenya can get a Ukrainian passport because her whole family is from Ukraine. And this means that Ildar can also get a Ukrainian passport. But then they would both have to give up their Russian passports, and they would no longer be able to visit their parents in Russia.\n\nBut with a Ukrainian passport it is easier to get European documents. It would also be possible for Zhenya alone to acquire a Ukrainian passport, and then either Zhenya's documents or Ildar’s could be used, but Ildar does not want this. Nor does Ildar want to return to Russia, or even visit.\n\n“I don't know, I don't understand. It seems to me that no one needs me, and no one is looking for me. But I don't want to check. And I don’t want to think about all this.”\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",

    "48 road deaths in eight months of this year in Latvia": "The results of a survey conducted this year show that nearly a quarter or 24% of drivers say they have undergone risky overtaking maneuvers. The data also show that risky maneuvers are more frequently carried out by young drivers aged 18 to 24. More than half, or 59% of respondents, say they have experienced risky overtaking maneuvers: 43% as car passengers, 4% on an intercity bus, and 12% both in a car and an intercity bus.\n\nWhile 85% of drivers assess their overall level of knowledge in road traffic management as generally good, 61% of drivers say they have violated road traffic rules over the last year.\n\nOf the 48 deaths on state roads this year, 20 were killed in collisions, eight as a result of the car tipping over, one killed in a collision with an animal, four were pedestrians, ten killed in driving into an obstacle, and three into a vehicle standing on the road. One person lost his life driving into a pond, and another died under 'other circumstances'.\n\nPhoto: LVC\n\nThis year, the number of cyclist deathss has fallen: ten cyclists lost their lives on the state roads in 2021, but this year there has been one incident, where a cyclist died after crashing into a parked vehicle.\n\nFirefighters rescued 88 people from cars and removed 28 dead. Last year, 149 people were rescued and 45 dead were removed.\n\nThe State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD) asks residents to stop if they see a road accident, to assess the situation and, if necessary, to call the emergency call number 112 immediately.\n\nThe VUGD has observed that, unfortunately, the tendency to film and photograph accidents is not diminishing. “The sight of spectators gathering at the scene of the accident makes it seem like someone must have called 112. Unfortunately, we occasionally face the situation of eyewitnesses filming, photographing, and commenting on the crash, but no one has thought about informing the rescue services. If there are victims of an accident, the timely lack of assistance may end up tragically. Therefore, it is always important to call 112 immediately. Then it is better to give victims emotional support, not to film and photograph,” said the VUGD representative Jānis Grīnbergs.\n\nLatvia's road are consistently ranked as among the most dangerous in Europe.",
    "Religion in Latvia: the Lutherans of Lestene": "The Reformation arrived in Latvia in 1522, bringing with it fanatical vandalism of ornate church interiors deemed as idolatrous. But within a few generations, beauty was once again seen as pleasing to the Almighty.\n\nAnd in this spirit, in 1700, Baron Karl Friedrich von Fircks decided to add a lavish Baroque interior to a modest country church in Lestene, 70 kilometers west of Rīga. To this end, he hired Ventspils woodcarver Nikolass Sefrenss the Younger who spent the next decade creating a timber masterpiece that has no equal in Latvia.\n\nPulpit of Lestene Lutheran church Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nAn elaborate pulpit and a towering 10.5 meter high altar retable were alive with Biblical saints and symbols from nature. The organ decking included moving angels, a three-dimensional show which so impressed worshipping peasants that they are said to have cried out “Ak, svētā Lestene!” (Oh, holy Lestene!) upon seeing it.\n\nSefrenss perished from the plague in 1710, and the job of painting and gilding the objects wasn’t completed for several more decades. Then the church enjoyed two centuries of peaceful splendor.\n\nHowever, in the final months of the Second World War, as western Latvia was ravaged by the battles of the Courland Pocket, the church steeple burned down. The building’s structural integrity was preserved, but the interior faced a mortal threat in the post-war years. Ordered by local communist officials to destroy the priceless artworks, some of the pieces being hidden by the local school principal at her workplace. When she was threatened, they were spirited to the attic of the Academy of Art in Riga, where once again communist functionaries raised their ugly heads.\n\nAnother group of sculptures was taken to another Kurzeme church for safekeeping. But as bad luck would have it, right at that time that refuge was used as a movie set, and the film crew inadvertently destroyed many of the items.\n\nEventually, the administrators of Rundāle Palace had the courage to pick up the pieces which could be saved and deposit them in their vast basement. Which was fortunate, as in the 1960s a granary was installed in the church, erasing what was left of the old grandeur.\n\n“Many cultural monuments in Latvia were being destroyed at the time, and Rundāle was like a lifeboat,” says Inguna Kokina, the lay head of church’s parish council.\n\nIn a sense, she muses, it was good that the local collective farm decided to use the building, as other churches had simply been razed to the ground in officially sanctioned campaigns of atheistic violence.\n\nIndeed, there had been plans to dynamite Lestene’s church, but there weren’t enough explosives to deal with its two-meter-thick walls.\n\nLestene Lutheran church interior Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nInguna’s grandmother worked for the barons before the war, and she herself recalls playing inside the church as a child. And for several decades she has been in the midst of efforts to bring it back to life.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a war cemetery was installed next door to bring together the many scattered graves of Latvian soldiers who died fighting in the Courland Pocket as part of the German-uniformed Latvian Legion. And after that weighty task was completed, Inguna says that a group of activists decided it was a shame to have the church in such a sorry state next to this place of remembrance.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the surviving parts of the pulpit and altar retable were returned to Lestene. Surviving figures from the ensembles have been rejuvenated and missing pieces have been created anew by skilled artisans, based on photographs from the 1930s.\n\nThe craftsmen often work for very modest fees out of their passion for the project. But the cost of materials means it doesn’t come cheap. State culture funds are elusive, Inguna sighs, as the officials in charge have repeatedly said that other sites have priority.\n\nBut the work continues as private donations trickle in. Once the elements now in place have been finished, the mighty organ setting will be brought back from Rundāle, completing the resurrection of this unique monument.\n\nSunday services are held fortnightly by a clergyman who covers a number of rural parishes around Tukums County. On average only about ten worshippers turn up each time (although pre-Covid Christmas events attracted a full house).\n\nAccording to Inguna, this is partly due to the shifting demographics of Lestene. Due to wartime devastation, many locals moved away, and they were replaced by immigrants from Latgale and other parts of the former USSR. Fourteen nationalities reside in the area, and although most are well integrated, there is a lack of historical continuity.\n\nStill, Inguna says that the regular parishioners are a tight-knit group. And the community of supporters of the church stretches around the world.\n\nNeed to know\n\nThe best time to see inside the church is during Sunday services. Services are held every second and fourth Sunday of the month at 12:00.\n\nThere is no direct public transport to Lestene from Riga. It’s a one-hour drive.\n\nThe church welcomes donations for the ongoing restorations.",

    "All to fight for with one week until Saeima elections in Latvia": "Asked which way they would vote if Saeima elections were held tomorrow, 1,825 Latvian citizens of voting age gave Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš' New Unity (JV) top spot with 13.3%, almost double the opposition Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) with 7.8 %. They take second place despite having as their Prime Ministerial candidate Aivars Lembergs – a man sent to prison for five years and sanctioned by the United States.\n\nThird place is held by the right-of-center National Alliance (NA) on 7.3%, followed by the relatively new United List (AS) on 5.4%, which is made up of various smaller parties in an alliance that gives them more critical mass. Harmony (S), which describes itself as a social democrat party, is next with 5.1%.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nIn sixth and seventh place are two liberal-oriented parties the Progressives (P) on 4.9% and For Development/For! (A/P!) on 3.6%.\n\nNo other parties make it across the 5%-of-the-vote threshold required to win seats in the Saeima, though several parties are hovering just below that level.

    "Who’s a Latvian and why? A complex question just got harder.": "“To have a strong society ... you should have a common history,” says pollster Arnis Kaktins. “We don’t have that.”\n\nOne focus of discord was the Victory Memorial in the capital, Riga, commemorating the Soviet soldiers who died freeing Latvia from the Nazis. But most Latvians remember better the Soviets’ own 50-year occupation of their land. Last week the authorities toppled the monument, calling it a catalyst for polarization.\n\nRussian Latvians may not be numerous, but they wield potential influence. Most of them are neutral on the Ukraine war, or support Kyiv, but others could cause trouble, officials fear.\n\nThe government is cracking down on the small minority of ethnic Russians who support President Vladimir Putin, and just when dialogue would seem more important than ever, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion of the identity issue, says Deniss Hanovs, a professor of cultural history.\n\nLatvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nAs they distanced themselves from memories of Soviet occupation, the puzzle seemed to be growing less fraught. But Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has brought old divisions to the surface.\n\nSince Latvia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, its citizens – a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians – have been wrestling to define their identities.\n\nThe nature of Alice Zvezda’s identity is as challenging to juggle as the infant she’s pushing around a Riga park.\n\n“My husband is Latvian and I am Russian. So I am like, both. I feel myself both,” says Ms. Zvezda as she rocks her baby stroller cradling a next-generation Russian Latvian.\n\nThat kind of dual identity had been growing easier to navigate as Latvians distanced themselves from memories of their country’s 50-year occupation by the Soviet Union that ended in the early 1990s.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Transformation Latvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nBut it suddenly got harder last February, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the Latvian government began arming itself with words and weapons: It is reinstituting the military draft, excising Russian language from public schools, banning Russian state media from the airwaves, and dismantling Soviet-era memorials.\n\nThe vast majority of Latvians — including a quarter of the country’s Russian speakers —are solidly against the war in Ukraine, but a small and significant segment of the Russian diaspora sympathizes with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Once tolerant of such citizens, the Latvian government is now trying to crack down on their way of thinking, just when Latvian society was making some progress toward inclusion of its multitude of ethnic identities.\n\nIt would seem that dialogue over Latvian identity, a complex construct of language, culture, and nationality, is needed more than ever. But since the war began, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion, says Deniss Hanovs, a Russian Latvian cultural history professor at Riga Stradiņš University.\n\n“The history of Latvia has been so very bloody and full of conflict and tragedy that most people stick to ethnic identity” when they define themselves, says Dr. Hanovs. “But we need to go beyond ethnic identity. One needs to be a citizen. The notion of [a] political nation is the only future for a multiethnic culture in Europe.”\n\nKaren Norris/Staff\n\nA complicated dance\n\nBut that’s a complicated dance today for a society that’s roughly a quarter ethnic Russian. “The younger generation [of ethnic Russians and Latvians] is making families together and we do not have conflict,” explains Ms. Zvezda. “We were hoping when the generations change and the politicians are our age, it will be totally fine – love and understanding. But no, now war came. And it’s splitting the community.”\n\nAbout 150,000 Russian-speaking Latvians sympathize with Russia on the war, polls have found. “That’s a lot for small Latvia,” says Ieva Bērziņa, a researcher on Russian strategy at the National Defense Academy of Latvia.\n\nAnd it leaves open the possibility that the Kremlin might destabilize Latvia using the Russian diaspora. Reaching out to this population through a common language, religion, and historical memory offers Russia an “unparalleled soft power influence to further foreign policies abroad,” in the words of a 2021 report by researchers at the London School of Economics.\n\nDr. Bērziņa found in a 2016 study that Russian influence in Latvia could be “quite huge ... when it comes to war and real-life situations that can catalyze differences within society,” she says. “When it goes out onto the street it’s a huge problem.”\n\nOne of those potential catalysts was the Victory Memorial in Riga, where ethnic Russians congregated every May 9 to celebrate the Soviet Army’s victory over Nazi Germany. (The Soviets liberated Latvia from the Germans but ushered in their own five-decade-long occupation of the country.)\n\nThe authorities last week toppled the main obelisk, saying it risked “polarizing society,” and removed other structures from the memorial complex, in line with the wishes of roughly 75% of Latvian speakers, but against those of the same proportion of Russian speakers, according to a poll by the Latvian polling firm SKDS. It’s a stark divide.\n\n“The monument means different things for Latvians and Russians,” explains Dr. Bērziņa. “For Latvians it’s a symbol of [Soviet] occupation and pain, and for Russian speakers it’s primarily a commemoration of their ancestors who fought against Nazi Germany.”\n\nThis lack of a shared understanding of history hinders progress toward a harmonious Latvian society, says pollster Arnis Kaktins, SKDS’s executive director.\n\n“To have a strong society, one of the pillars is that you should have a common history, and we don’t have that,” he says. “We have two different histories regarding the Second World War – with different beliefs around whether Russia occupied us, or whether they liberated us from the evil fascists.”\n\nLenora Chu Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks poses in his office building in Riga Aug. 2, 2022. Mr. Pabriks says that ethnic Russians who long for the Soviet era's glory days must \"change their way of thinking.\"\n\nUsing Pushkin as a weapon\n\nBut minds are changing, nonetheless. Half of Russian speakers tell pollsters they sympathize with neither Russia nor Ukraine in the war. This group appears to be in transition away from traditional loyalties, says Mr. Kaktins.\n\n“They are confused; they are shocked; they need more time to talk, to understand, and to process what’s actually happening,” he says. “If suddenly something happens which contradicts your worldview of Russia as beautiful and good, you don’t automatically change it in two hours. It is a very slow, gradual process. It takes a long time.”\n\nUntil the Ukraine war began, adds Dr. Hanovs, the Russian Latvian cultural history professor, ethnic Russians had seen their former homeland’s history in a heroic light, symbolized by musicians and poets such as Peter Tchaikovsky and Aleksandr Pushkin. They never associated their culture with evil.\n\n“Now, starting from February, this is part of my own [Russian] identity,” Dr. Hanovs says, explaining that President Putin invaded Ukraine in the name of Russia’s glorious past. “It’s not only Tchaikovsky and Pushkin, but also ‘Pushkin can be used to kill people in Ukraine,’” he says.\n\nLatvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, is losing patience. He is in charge of reinstituting military conscription by 2023, and he insists that Putin supporters must understand that the glory days of the Soviet Union are over.\n\n“How can you tolerate in your country people who are saying, ‘We’re against Parliament and against democracy and against freedom’?” asks Mr. Pabriks during an interview in Riga. “We cannot simply say, ‘Oh yes, you are against an independent Latvia but you’re welcome to walk around.’”\n\nThat hardening attitude indicates how difficult it could be to integrate Latvia without alienating those on the fringes, and without suppressing Russian culture and language.\n\nThe sizable group of Russian speakers who declare themselves patriotic citizens of Latvia might show the way, if the government takes a nuanced approach.\n\n“I hope the Latvian political elite will manage to differentiate between those who are part of Latvia and those who still exist in the past,” Dr. Hanovs says. And some observers believe that the war might actually speed up convergence on a national Latvian identity, as Russians are forced to confront hard facts about their former motherland.\n\nMs. Zvezda, the young Russian Latvian mother living in Riga, harbors more modest hopes – that the growing difficulties of everyday life will push larger questions of war and peace and ethnic identity aside.\n\nGet stories that\n\nempower and uplift daily.

    "Police in Latvia dismantle major money laundering group": "Latvian State Police has dismantled a criminal group that provided professional money laundering services in the country using a network of more than 90 «money mules».\n\nIn February 2022 Latvian State Police Department of Cyber Crimes commenced criminal proceedings after receiving information from a Latvia-based credit institution that noticed systematic fraudulent payment activity on accounts of some of its clients.\n\nInformation acquired in the investigation indicates that there was a wide network of «money mules» in Riga, which consisted of youngsters aged 16 to 20 years, who received flash payments on their accounts. These payments mostly came from German citizens. Money from those accounts were then rapidly withdrawn in cash. In most cases this was done around midnight.\n\nVictims say that upon finding their accounts emptied usually tried to call off the transactions made during the night on the next day. However, considering that organisers of this criminal group ensured money was immediately taken from the «money mule’s» account, only a small number of victims were able to intercept and recover the stolen money.\n\nData analysis reveals that around 30 such crimes were committed in a single month. According to authorities, this criminal group may have been active in Latvia since September 2019.\n\nLatvian police performed numerous investigation-related activities to put a stop to the criminal group and identify the suspects. In to months efforts resulted with success.\n\nThe investigation revealed the criminal group consisted of 14 members. One of them was a citizen of Germany. This person coordinated the group from Germany. The organiser had recruiters look for «money mules» with bank accounts in Latvia. The group used these people to receive and move illegally acquired money.\n\nMoney withdrawn from «money mules» was then given away in the form of virtual currency.\n\nFollowing directions from organisers, members of the group also distributed acquired money among themselves. Money mules were paid 50 to 250 euros for their services if they participated in activities multiple times. This way the criminal group was able to launder more than EUR 555 600.\n\nIn April 2020 police detained 13 members of this group.\n\nAmong those detained individuals were also the leaders of the criminal group. Both were put under arrest.\n\nThe leader of the group was detained in Germany in May 2022 thanks to a European arrest warrant, which was issued as a result of long international cooperation between law enforcers of different countries. The German citizen was detained and later arrested after a number of several searchers, interrogations and special investigative activities. Germany extradited him to Latvia for criminal prosecution in summer 2022.\n\nIn August 2022 Latvian police handed criminal proceedings to the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organised Crime and Other Branches to commence criminal prosecution.\n\nConsidering the large number of youngsters that agreed to assist the criminal group by becoming «money mules», State Police stresses to society that such actions carry criminal liability.\n\nPeople who agree to become a «money mule» have to keep in mind that they will not only face criminal liability, but will also experience difficulties for the remainder of their lives because banks close down such people’s access to their bank accounts and access to internet banking services.",
    "Ashes of people who donated their bodies to science to be given special burial in Latvia": "On Wednesday, 28 September, Riga Stradins University will organise a special burial ceremony for people who donated their bodies to science and medicine. The burial event will continue the whole day. Service will be held at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, followed by a burial at the nearby Martin Cemetery and opening of a monument at RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute.\n\nA total of 14 urns containing ashes will be buried.\n\n«The anatomy institute currently has 28 remains. They are used for educational and scientific purposes. However, 2 154 people’s remains have been dissected in 100 years of the institute’s history,» says the author of this event and director of RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute, Prof. Māra Pilmane.\n\nShe stresses that dissecting is an important part of medical training: «Every person is unique and individual. Although plastic or digital 3D models are already part of medical education, they cannot convey a full picture of each person’s uniqueness! The word’s leading universities openly admitted at the Congress of International Federation of Associations of Anatomists in 2004 that it is necessary to return to dissecting real bodies during medical students’ training. The number of people who donate their bodies to medicine and science after death is unknown – this information is protected by the law. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest the number is not small,» says Prof. Pilmane.\n\nMemorial event will start off at 10:00 a.m. with a service at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Riga, Slokas Street 34. The service will be attended by priests representing Catholic, Lutheran, Orthodox and Baptist confessions. At 11:00 a.m. a burial procession to the nearby Martin Cemetery will commence.

    "Gathering in Latvia, European Baptists Focus on War": "During the roll call of nations each year at the opening session of the meeting of the European Baptist Federation, attendees from across Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East stand up for applause as their nation is announced. Sometimes a delegation will add their own cheer or wave excitedly, but the applause is pretty much the same for each country. However, as EBF opened its 2022 general council in Riga, Latvia, on Wednesday (Sept. 21), one nation received a long and loud applause that stood out beyond the rest.\n\nUkraine.\n\nThat applause for the two Ukrainian Baptists who quietly stood — and then sat down before rising again to thank the crowd for the continuing applause — set the tone for the three-day meeting that occurred only about 150 miles from Latvia’s border with Russia. If there’s one word on the lips of attendees at EBF’s first meeting since Russia launched a massive attack on another western neighbor in February, it’s Ukraine.\n\n“I was deeply touched by your welcoming yesterday; it was special,” Igor Bandura, vice president of the All-Ukrainian Union of Associations of Evangelical Christians-Baptists, later told those at the EBF meeting as he referred back to the applause and prayer in the opening session. “I would like to thank you and all your churches and all the people for your faithful commitment to stand with Ukraine.”\n\nAnd that tone clearly resonates in Riga. Throughout the city, Ukrainian flags appear to outnumber Latvian ones. The flag of the besieged nation dots the streets, hanging from apartment balconies, greeting people entering shops or restaurants, and showing up on billboards and street art. Government buildings alternate national flags with Ukrainian ones. Churches also set up blue-and-yellow flags and donation boxes to support Ukrainian refugees. Memorials and museums dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust or the Soviet occupation of Latvia also fly the Ukrainian flag alongside posters of Russian war crimes.\n\nThe scene repeats across the Baltic region, as people in Estonia and Lithuania also express solidarity with Ukraine as they recall their own past under the oppression of Soviet domination. For those in the region, the invasion of Ukraine isn’t a distant tragedy but a vivid threat from an imperialistic neighbor.\n\nAnd for Baptists there and across Europe, they pledged to support their fellow Christians facing literal warfare. The opening session concluded with a prayer for Baptists in Ukraine as the first of several times for such prayer during the gathering.\n\n“This is what family does,” said Helle Liht, an Estonian who is EBF’s assistant general secretary, as she introduced Bandura during a session on the second day to share about the war’s impact on Ukrainian Baptists. “If one member suffers, everybody suffers.”\n\nAlthough the meeting included reports from other nations, discussions of other ministry efforts, and times for fellowship and worship, the crisis in Ukraine dominated the agenda. Ukrainian Baptists shared their experiences, as did Baptists in other countries — like Belarus, Lebanon, Hungary, Moldova, and Poland — who quickly mobilized to serve the millions of refugees fleeing Ukraine this year amid the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II.\n\nIn light of those ministries, Bandura referred to an incident in Exodus 17 where Aaron and Hur stood on either side of Moses during a battle and held up his arms as he grew tired. Similarly, Bandura said, Baptists in other countries had held up the Ukrainian Baptists as they grew tired.\n\n“We are appreciative to God for you, and to you for letting us experience God’s unbelievable love,” he added as he noted the support of Baptists in other countries both for ministries in Ukraine and toward refugees who left the nation.\n\nBut many challenges remain, including the fact that about 400 Baptist churches are in territory occupied by Russia (though he added that statistic hadn’t been updated since Ukraine regained some land during the previous week). Bandura said that about 200 churches have stopped meeting and he’s not sure if they will exist in the future “because we do not know if people will come back.” Bandura added that 46 church buildings have been damaged in the war.\n\nAdditionally, he reported that about 120 pastors and deacons have been called into military service, leaving their churches without leaders. Others have been forced to flee.\n\n“We are talking about 250 pastors that had to leave their churches,” Bandura said. “All these pastors are going through a very tough time when they are questioning their pastoral identity as a calling and a future.”\n\nAnd those who stay in places occupied by Russian forces can face religious persecution — as has occurred for years against Baptists in Russia and in parts of eastern Ukraine occupied since 2014 by Russian-backed separatists.\n\n“We feel a lot of pain, and it goes to our life, our minds, and our hearts every day,” Bandura said. “This is existential for us.”\n\nBut Bandura urged Baptists not to merely pray for peace, adding, “I would like to ask you to pray for just peace for Ukraine.” Just peace, he explained, means more than an end to conflict. It would also include the withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations paid by Russia to Ukraine for war damage, and a restoration of all Ukrainian lands that Russia has occupied since 2014.\n\nLike the flags across the city waving in support of Ukraine, others at the gathering echoed his call not only for peace but also for justice.",

    "Latvia’s president calls for setting up special tribunal to probe Russian crimes in Ukraine": "Latvian President Egils Levits, who addressed the United Nations General Assembly on September 21, has called for establishing a special tribunal “to investigate the responsibility of the Russian state in the crime of aggression” and creating a mechanism of reparation payments to Ukraine.\n\nThat’s according to Ukrinform’s own correspondent in New York.\n\n“Impunity means an invitation to further crimes, therefore, the aggressor must be held accountable,” Levits said, adding that the ICC and ICJ have already started considering cases regarding the separate aspects of Russia’s war on Ukraine, and so has the ECHR.\n\nAt the same time, the president of Latvia noted that a legal loophole remained as no international court has jurisdiction as to the main question, which is the unleashing of a war of aggression, a serious violation of the UN Charter and international law.\n\nRead also: Czech Republic calls for immediate special tribunal for Russian war criminals\n\n“Special tribunal could be established on the basis of a resolution of the General Assembly by another international organization or a group of like-minded states,” he suggested.\n\nThe president added that after the war, Russia “will have to pay reparations to Ukraine for damages. The special tribunal could be part of an international reparations mechanism.”",
    "Latvia wants its Orthodox Church fully independent from Moscow": "President Egils Levits of Latvia has urged parliament to amend the law on the status of the Latvian Orthodox Church and recognize it as autocephalous – that is, fully independent from the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nThe Orthodox Church in Latvia has been semi-autonomous since the fall of the Soviet bloc, but has remained under the Moscow Patriarchate's canonical jurisdiction.\n\nPresident Levits submitted an amendment to the Latvian Saeima (Diet) on Monday that would sever that.\n\nThe weight of the Russian-Ukrainian context\n\nThe status had been established in 1921 by a tomos (decree) of the Patriarchate of Moscow, and confirmed on the state side by a regulation of the Latvian government in 1926.\n\nIn December 1992, the Orthodox Church was granted broad autonomy by its big Russian sister.\n\nBut 30 years later, Russia's military aggression in Ukraine and the war-mongering positions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia have prompted Latvian authorities to cut all ties.\n\n\"The rejection of any link with the patriarch of Moscow is a crucial issue for our Orthodox community, for Latvian society as a whole and for national security,\" Levits said in a statement published on the website of Latvian presidency.\n\nThree major churches\n\nThe head of state has therefore transmitted to the Diet amendments that provide \"full recognition of the autonomous and independent status (autocephalous) of the Latvian Orthodox Church\".\n\nHe said he hopes that this \"will exclude any influence or power of the patriarch of Moscow on our Orthodox Church\", not only de facto, but also de jure.\n\nOrthodox Christians are predominantly found among the Russian-speaking minority in the eastern part of Latvia. They are part of the three major Christian denominations in the country, along with Lutherans and Roman Catholics.\n\nPresident Levits obviously informed the ecclesiastical authorities concerned of his initiative, in particular Bishop Alexander, \"Metropolitan of Riga and all of Latvia\", who has been Primate of the Latvian Orthodox Church since 1989.\n\nLevits, who has been president since 2019, said the Orthodox \"can count on the full support of the Latvian state as being an autocephalous Church that is now also recognized by law\".\n\nBut canonically speaking, it is still up to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which holds honorary primacy over Orthodoxy, to recognize the full independence of a Church, by presenting it with a \"tomos of autocephaly\".\n\nThe procedure took several months between 2018-2019 to recognize the autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and caused a schism between Constantinople and Moscow, on the one hand, and Moscow and Kyiv on the other.",

    "Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania to restrict entry of Russians": "The Baltic countries will almost completely restrict border crossings for Russians who have Schengen visas, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs announced Wednesday.\n\nFollowing a meeting between the eight Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers, Rinkēvičs announced a joint agreement was reached \"in principle\" to restrict entry through Russian and Belarusian borders to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania for Russian citizens with EU Schengen visas.\n\n\"What we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months, is that the number of border crossings by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,\" he said.\n\nThere will be exceptions for Russian citizens crossing the border for humanitarian and family reasons, lorry drivers and diplomats. Details will be announced in the coming days.\n\nFinal decisions will be made at the national level and will come into force at the same time, the foreign minister said. Rinkēvičs added that he expects the measures to apply within the next 10 days.\n\nFinland, which has cut the issuance of tourist visas to Russians to 10 percent of applications, won't restrict all Russians who are traveling on Schengen visas until a decision is made at the EU level.\n\n\"We are also expecting that the Commission ... might make a recommendation on the European level, because unfortunately, Finland and Helsinki airport has become one of the transit routes for people who are then flying to Greece or Spain or Italy,\" Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's very important that on the EU level, we tackle this problem,\" he added.\n\nThe move from the Baltic countries comes a day after the European Commission officially backed a proposal to suspend the EU's 2007 visa agreement with Moscow in retaliation for Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe issue of a ban on Russian visas has caused friction between European capitals.

    "Leftist sections in Latvia denounce demolition of Soviet era monument : Peoples Dispatch": "The Monument to the Liberators at the Victory Park in Latvian capital Riga was demolished under the orders of the right-wing government on August 25\n\nLeft-wing sections in Latvia have condemned the government’s drive to demolish Soviet era monuments in the country. Under the order of the right-wing government, the Monument to the Liberators of Riga at the Victory Park in the national capital was demolished on August 25, despite opposition from leftist and anti-fascist sections. The Latvian Socialist Party (LSP) and the Social Democratic Party – Harmony denounced the demolition and warned that such actions by the government will lead to polarization and destruction of the civil society.\n\nSeveral right-wing governments in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet Republics, including in Poland and Ukraine, have been carrying out decommunization drives with bans on communist symbols and demolition of Soviet era and Red Army memorials. The European Parliament itself passed a controversial resolution in 2019 equating communism to Nazism and calling for the erasure of its memory from the public sphere.\n\nEven as progressive and left-wing sections in Europe denounced the resolution, right-wing governments took it as an opportunity to intensify their decommunization drives, while allowing a free run to neo-Nazi groups to consolidate and carry out brazen acts of violence. With the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, Russophobia reached its peak across Europe. Right-wing governments started imposing more sanctions on Russia, banned Soviet symbols, and called for the destruction of Soviet era monuments. Neo-Nazi-led vandalization of partisan memorials and Red Army monuments are also under way in many parts of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe right-wing dominated parliament in Latvia voted in favor of the demolition of Soviet monuments in May this year, in the backdrop of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. According to reports, the government has ordered the demolition of all Soviet monuments (69 buildings) throughout the country by the end of this year. Latvia is a post-Soviet Republic in the Baltic region with a sizable Russian minority, amounting to 25% of the population. Political observers have expressed concern that the Russophobic anti-Soviet campaign by the right-wing government is likely to polarize Latvian society.\n\nPerspective Communiste reported that neo-Nazi groups in Latvia have long been calling for the destruction of communist monuments across the county. The Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga was erected in 1985 to commemorate the liberation of Riga and Latvia from Nazi Germany by the Red Army in 1944 during World War II.\n\nJānis Urbanovičs, president of the Social Democrat Party – Harmony, denounced the actions of the government and stated that “the government has lost track of its priorities, which no longer addresses the people and deals only with the destruction of monuments.”\n\n“You can demolish monuments, but you can’t erase memories. Generations of people will remember what is dear to them. And now they will have in them anger and bitterness, perhaps even hatred. It won’t help us build and defend our Latvia,” he said.\n\nThe Socialist Party of Latvia stated on August 25 that “the Latvian government has chosen the path of surrendering the country’s sovereignty in favor of blind submission to external interests, the politicians in power have literally stripped, weakened and depopulated our country for thirty years.”\n\nThe statement continued: “The time of common joys, achievements has been replaced by the will to cause trouble. The desire for cooperation and mutual aid has been supplanted by mutual indifference and fierce competition within society, between social groups and workers in different industries. For the masters, a cleverly divided society can be tightly controlled to avoid mass protests.”",

Applications from soloists, duets and groups (up to six participants) are welcome. Foreign citizens may participate in the competition as authors of song lyrics, music authors or producers of phonograms. The submitted song must not have been published or played publicly before September 1, 2022.”\n\nA special jury will determine which songs and entries make it to the Supernova broadcasts. This jury will consist of professionals within the Latvian music, events and TV industry, as well as foreign professionals. LTV also reserves the right to invite performers and authors to participate in the competition.\n\nInterestingly, the broadcaster says it will not reveal the names of these jury members until after Eurovision in May “for security reasons.” This is likely to avoid any attempts to influence said jury members before the show and to reduce hostilities and hurt feelings within the industry after the reveal.\n\n“The participants and songs selected for the competition will be available for public evaluation in January 2023. The television shows are expected on the LTV in February 2023.”\n\nAgnese Strause-Kubliņa, Head of Children, Youth and Entertainment Broadcasting at LTV, sang the praises of the country’s most recent entry.\n\n“Supernova is the biggest competition organized by the Television of Latvia (LTV), the winners of which get a ticket to the Eurovision, which is not only a fantastic opportunity and an unforgettable experience for artists, but also a very responsible task of representing Latvia. We are proud of the audience’s recognition this year – the ratings of the Supernova were the best in recent years! The winners – Citi Zeni – allowed everyone to notice Latvia in the Eurovision, but who will be next?! Although there is no specific formula for creating a Eurovision winning song, we wish musicians creative flight and courage in submitting songs to the Supernova contest!”\n\nIn the run-up to Eurovision 2022, Citi Zeni established themselves as darlings of the promo tour, appearing at concert after concert while slaying social media with their unique sense of humour. Their song, which promoted the virtues of the vegan lifestyle, opened with that vulgar line about stimulating the female genitals using the tongue or lips.\n\nWiwiblogger Robyn was able to look past it. As she wrote in our Wiwi Jury review post:\n\n“The unavoidable opening line grabs a lot of attention, but if you look beyond it, Eat Your Salad is a funky bop. It’s reminiscent of Bruno Mars or even the feel-good tunes of Daði Freyr. The song has an environmental message, but it’s not delivered in a heavy-handed way, instead giving listeners something to groove to while they eat their salad and think about their cat.”\n\nAre there any artists you hope to see submit this year?

We must step up our support to Ukraine until it wins!\" Karins said on Twitter.\n\nAs reported, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) has urged the international community to supply more weapons to Ukraine so it can liberate its territories occupied by Russia.\n\n\"Apparently #Russia is moving ahead with organising fake referenda in the occupied territories of #Ukraine, international community must reject this move, more sanctions must follow and Ukraine must get more weapons to liberate its territory, we must say no to Russian blackmail,\" the Latvian minister tweeted.\n\nMoscow-held regions of Ukraine will vote September 23-27 on annexation by Russia, separatist officials said Tuesday, as Kyiv's troops wrest back territory captured by Moscow's forces.\n\nSeparatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, said they would hold the vote over five days beginning Friday this week and ending on Tuesday.\n\nKyiv said the \"sham\" votes were meaningless and vowed to \"eliminate\" threats posed by Russia, saying its forces would keep retaking territory regardless of what Moscow or its proxies announced.",
    "Latvian government to develop more support measures for residents during energy crisis": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima asked the government to develop additional measures to support residents during upcoming heating season and reduce the impact from growing energy prices.\n\nThe Saeima gave the Cabinet of Ministers a month to develop and present appropriate proposals for measures to take in order to overcome the crisis caused by growing energy resource prices.\n\nAdditional support is necessary due to the rapid increase of energy resource prices, especially for natural gas, and the negative effect this has on manufacturing costs across all segments, competitiveness of the national economy and household expenses, as reported by Saeima’s press-service.\n\nThe parliament’s decision also mentions that in order to secure at least partial energy resource price compensation it is necessary to immediately increase state support.\n\nUntil now the planned support to compensate rising heating costs was EUR 350 million, which is now considered insufficient. On top of that, it will reach a small portion of residents, as previously outlined by deputies during a meeting of the government and municipal committees. Representatives of multiple municipal councils also expressed concerns about the upcoming heating season.\n\nThe government has allocated funding from the budget programme for emergencies in order to provide residents of pension age, disabled residents and survivors between 1 November and 31 December.\n\nBenefits will be paid in the following amounts:\n\nEUR 30 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total does not exceed EUR 300 a month;\n\nEUR 20 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 301 to EUR 509 a month;\n\nEUR 10 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 510 to EUR 603.\n\nIf a person receives too much than what is allowed, digits after the comma are left out.\n\nFor example, if the old age pension amount is EUR 300.94, the cents after the comma us left out and the person is paid a benefit of EUR 30 a month.\n\nThe total state benefit payment period is set between 1 November 2022 and 31 May 2023. The funding necessary to afford the payment of state benefits will be clarified in the State Budget Project for 2023 and the Medium-term Budget for 2023, 2024 and 2025 legislative drafts.\n\nThis state benefit will be paid to people living in Latvia who are paid old age, disability or survivor pension, as well as early and advance pension.\n\nThe benefit will be paid to recipients of loss of capacity for work or survivors’ compensation and recipients of state social security benefits.\n\nThe state benefit of EUR 30 will be paid to persons who are recipients of the supplement to the state family allowance for a child with disabilities; persons of legal age who are granted refugee or alternative status in the Republic of Latvia and who are legally residing in the Republic of Latvia with a valid residence permit or temporary residence permit issued by the Republic of Latvia, and who have reached the age specified in the Law on State Pensions.\n\nPayment of state benefits will start in November, as reported by Ministry of Welfare.",

Reports of four deaths were received as well, according to data from the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\n5 405 Covid-19 laboratory tests were performed. 25.3% of them turned out positive.\n\nThe 14-day cumulative Covid-19 infection index in Latvia increased from 643.2 to 678 per 100 000 residents.

    "U-Ming Bulker Caught in Latvia for Six Months due to Russian Sanctions": "U-Ming Bulker Caught in Latvia for Six Months due to Russian Sanctions\n\nAsian Majesty seen in Venezuela in 2018 (INEA photo)\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, there has been extensive attention to the numerous bulkers that were caught in the Black Sea ports, but now comes a report from Latvian State TV of a bulker caught in a legal trap due to the sanctions against Russian interests. The 62,500 dwt Asian Majesty, registered in Singapore and operated U-Ming Marine of Taiwan, has been anchored in the Gulf of Riga, Latvia since March 2022 caught in limbo with even the Latvia authorities unable to find a path to release the ship.\n\nThe bulker arrived in Riga in March after having partially loaded a cargo of potassium chloride fertilizer in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The vessel continued loading at the Riga fertilizer terminal. With a full load of approximately 55,000 tons of fertilizer loaded the vessel moved to the anchorage waiting for the final export permits. While other ships came and went, the Asian Majesty found herself caught.\n\nThe Latvian customs office explains the issue is not the cargo but the ownership of the cargo. They believe it to be owned by a company controlled by Russian oligarch Dmitry Mazepin, who was among the individuals and businesses sanctioned by the European Union after the invasion. Latvia believes the cargo is owned by a Mauritius-based company, United Fertilizers Company Limited, which in turn is controlled by Mazepin. Latvia’s State Environment Service (VVD) is refusing the export permit based on its belief that it is not permitted to release cargo that would financially benefit the sanctioned oligarch.\n\nIn August, Latvian TV reports the crew of the vessel issued an appeal for assistance. They reported that they were running low on fuel, and drinking water and had accumulated waste to remove from the ship. While the authorities assisted the crew, and highlight the crew and the ship is not sanctioned, the problem remains on how to release the ship. Latvia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, State Environment Service, Finance and Capital Market Commission, VDD, and Freeport of Riga authority are all cooperating trying to assist the ship.\n\nOfficials report while Latvia seeks to assist the ship they have no direct contact with either the owners of the vessel or the owner of the cargo. There is no local ownership or involvement of Latvia companies, which is also complicating the situation.\n\nThe solution that was proposed was to offload the cargo into a bonded EU warehouse where it could be held. The Riga fertilizer terminal however reports it can not assist because it was only built to handle the loading of ships. It has no equipment to offload the fertilizer. It is possible that the cargo could be offloaded at an alternative port but then comes the question of the financial cost and who would be responsible.\n\nThey are estimating the value of the cargo aboard the Asian Majesty at $17 million. Latvian officials told the local outlet that they are continuing to search for a potential solution and in the meantime, the Asian Majesty and her crew remain at anchor caught in limbo.",
    "Latvia": "Not every 6th grader is ready to study Mandarin.\n\nZachary Rybchin was.\n\nA new student at Bedford Middle School, already interested in the world around him, he took on the challenging of learning a difficult language.\n\nAt Staples High, Zachary fed his passions for history and international relations. He joined the Model UN, Debate, Mock Trial and Junior State clubs. He took Advanced Placement courses: European History with Carol Kaye, US History with Eric Mongirdis, Economics with Drew Coyne.\n\nAnd he continued to study Mandarin.\n\nHis teacher, Chris Fray, also speaks Russian. He learned the language while working on a fishing trawler there.\n\nDuring Zachary’s sophomore year, Fray told the class about a US State Department program. The National Security Language Initiative for Youth began in 2006, as a way to encourage teenagers to learn Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Mandarin, Persian, Russian and Turkish — languages critical to our security, The government covers all costs.\n\nZachary went through the rigorous application for the Russian program. He wrote essays, and sat for interviews. Finally, out of thousands of applicants, he was one of 400 accepted.\n\nBut COVID struck that spring. The summer program was scratched.\n\nHe applied again in 2021. Again he was accepted. Again, the pandemic forced its cancelation.\n\nThe third time was the charm — almost. Because of the invasion of Ukraine, the State Department did not send students to Russia.\n\nInstead, they went to Latvia. The Baltic nation shook off decades of Russian rule in 1991. But many Russian speakers remain.\n\nZachary lived with two of them. They spoke no English. When he arrived, he spoke no Russian.\n\nIt was not easy. But through intensive daily classes — including work with an individual university partner — Zachary and his 19 fellow participants learned.\n\nThey also learned about Latvian history and culture. They explored the beautiful city of Riga, and beyond (including a trip to “secret” Soviet-era bunkers).\n\nIt was a great, educational and important 7 weeks — one absolutely worth waiting 3 years for.\n\nNow how will he retain the language skills he’s learned?\n\nZachary is young for his grade. So instead of heading directly to college, he’s taking a gap year in Israel. There are more Russian speakers there than in the US, he notes.\n\nNext year, he’ll begin classes at historic St. Andrews University in Scotland. He’ll continue his Russian studies there.\n\nAnd then?\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know,” Zachary says. “There are so many career paths. Give me a few years. I’ll let you know.”\n\nудачи!",

    "Medics: Latvia needs 30 million euros to satisfy strike demands": "Preparations of Latvian Health and Social Care Workers’ Trade Union (LVSADA) for the full-scale strike on 27th and 28th September are almost complete. There are also plans to hold a protest outside the Cabinet of Ministers building together with the strike.\n\n«Despite the warning strike scheduled for 27 September, neither the government nor the Saeima have moved a finger to try to prevent the strike,» the trade union reports.\n\nLVSADA softened demands multiple times. The current demands require the government to provide for a partial completion of the government’s written promise of 7 August 2017 in relation to guaranteed pay for healthcare workers this year.\n\n«One of the main problems for Latvia’s healthcare sector is the shortage of workers, and the main cause of this problem is the abnormally low remuneration.\n\nThe European Commission pointed this out to the Latvian government the Saeima on multiple occasions, as did OECD and the World Bank. When they approved the National Development plan 2021-2027, the Saeima stressed the importance of significantly increasing wages of healthcare workers. However, the government led by Krišjānis Kariņš now pretend they know nothing about that or LVSADA’s strike demands. Completion of demands presented by the trade union will require funding of approximately EUR 30 million. When compared to the government’s emergency expenditures, this is a relatively small amount. This time there is no talk about the money. But what then?» the trade union noted in the statement to the press.\n\nLVSADA chairman Valdis Keris concluded: «Although every year Latvia loses thousands of lives that could have been saved if the country had proper funding of its healthcare sector if it had a sufficient number of workers, the government continues spitefully ignoring the issue. Like it or not, we have to conclude the government seems to want to make Latvia into a well-managed cemetery. The trade union does not share this vision. We will fight for Latvian residents’ right to live!»\n\nThe head of LVSADA strike committee, vice-chairperson Līga Bāriņa adds: «The demands of our strike are clear. The objective of our strike is protecting lives – yours and mine! Without doctors there won’t be a Latvia!»\n\nThe final decision regarding the strike will be made by LVSADA at a meeting of the council on 20 September."
