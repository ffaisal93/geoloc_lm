    "Lithuania has already sent 50 M113 armored vehicles to Ukraine – minister": "VILNIUS – A total of fifty M113 armored personnel carriers donated by Lithuania have already reached Ukraine, but further military support will have to be discussed with NATO allies, Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said on Monday.\n\n\"As to military assistance to Ukraine, Lithuania has supported and will continue to support it,\" Anusauskas told reporters after the State Defense Council's meeting.\n\n\"Our armored vehicles arrived in Ukraine (...) just three days ago, and now 50 M113s have already been handed over to Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe president-chaired State Defense Council did not discuss military support to Ukraine, the minister said, adding that the meeting focused on the situation in the region, including Russia's military mobilization and possible asylum requests from Russian citizens.\n\nAccording to Anusauskas, Lithuania will consider further possible support to Ukraine in consultation with its NATO partners, because the country has to meet its commitments to the Alliance and ensure the security of the troops it is hosting.\n\n\"Our armed forces are NATO's armed forces and our capability is also important for our allies who are here,\" the minister said. \"This is why every time we consider a reduction of our capability (...), we have to discuss with our allies how we are going to compensate for this.\"\n\n\"There are many issues that cannot be resolved very quickly,\" he added.\n\nTo make up for the lost capability, Lithuania expects an earlier arrival of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs) under its contract with the United States, according to Anusauskas.\n\n\"Another 50 (JLTVs) will apparently arrive in November, in addition to the 50 that came last year,\" he said. \"We'd like this to happen faster; not everything always goes according to our wishes, but there are always those conversations.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, the 15min news website reported, citing three sources, that Kyiv has asked Vilnius to hand over to Ukraine part of its German-made PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers, a Norwegian NASAMS air defense system and more US-made M113 armored vehicles.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the news report, Anusauskas said that Lithuania \"has not considered such things\".\n\nAccording to the minister, the PzH 2000 and NASAMS are \"systems that have a critical role for Lithuania's defense\", and the NASAMS system is the only one protecting the Siauliai air base and is \"critical in the overall NATO context\".\n\nLithuania lags well behind all neighboring countries in terms of its heavy artillery capability, he said.\n\n\"We have the only self-propelled howitzer battalion that has reached its full capacity, which is 18 units. Our neighboring countries, our northern neighbors, unfortunately, have much greater capabilities,\" Anusauskas said.\n\n\"Lithuania is lagging behind in this area, and I stress that this is not a capability that we have a lot of, somewhere in reserve,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to the M113s, Lithuania has handed over 105 mm howitzers and heavy mortars to Ukraine. Anusauskas stressed that these weapons had been part of the capabilities used by the Lithuanian Armed Forces, rather than a reserve.\n\n\"What makes us different from other countries is that we, seeing Ukraine's need, give them part of our capabilities,\" the minister said. \"We emptied the warehouses a long time ago. It is difficult to define the limit (of what we can give); it depends on the situation in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"But we are discussing all things,\" he said, reiterating, however, that sending German howitzers and NASAMS systems to Ukraine is not under consideration right now.",
    "Lithuania's InterMin proposes to terminate bilateral agreements with Belarus": "VILNIUS – Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite attended a meeting of the country's State Defense Council on Monday and proposed to terminate bilateral international agreements and inter-institutional agreements with Belarus in the areas under the Interior Ministry's control.\n\n\"The Belarusian regime continues to use migrants as a tool of political pressure, and Belarusian officials, through their active actions, contribute to the organization of the illegal migration crisis and destruction of the physical barrier. Since Belarus is violating the principles of international law and fails to comply with bilateral agreements, they are meaningless and we propose to terminate them\", the interior minister said in a statement released by her ministry.\n\nThe existing bilateral international agreements with Belarus are losing their meaningfulness, given continuous geopolitical threats in the region and the fact that Belarus, as an ally of Russia, continues its orchestrated hybrid aggression against Lithuania on the bilateral border, the minister said.\n\nThe Belarusian regime's hybrid pressure on the protection of the state border will continue unabated, and the risk of major border incidents is also possible, the ministry says. Therefore, the support of the Lithuanian army and other state institutions will continue to be necessary to protect the state border.\n\nSince the restoration of its independence, Lithuania has signed a number of bilateral agreements with Belarus on cooperation in the areas under the Interior Ministry's control, as well as several inter-institutional agreements, but their practical implementation has not been taking place for some time already, the ministry pointed out.\n\nEarlier, Lithuania suspended the implementation of European Commission-funded cross-border cooperation programs with Belarus and Russia.",

    "Telia Lietuva 5G network covered 80 percent of Lithuania’s population": "English Lithuanian\n\nTelecommunications company Telia Lietuva received the permission from the Lithuanian Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA) to provide commercial fifth-generation mobile networks services. 5G is immediately operational with 1,100 base stations in the 700 MHz band and 110 base stations in the 3.5 GHz band. Telia Lietuva 5G network reached more than half of the country's territory and 80 percent of its population.\n\nLithuania is one of the leaders in the European telecommunications market but until now the country did not have 5G diamond in its crown. However, the situation changes, as about 65 percent of Lithuania’s territory and 80 percent of the population will have Telia Lietuva 5G signal starting from today. The company activated this service immediately after receiving CRA's permission to use 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz frequencies that was acquired in two auctions for EUR 30 million for a twenty-year period.\n\n\"We were the first in Lithuania to launch all digital technologies - 2G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G. We have been preparing for this start for 4 years and have invested over EUR 100 million in the upgrade of our entire network. Although Lithuania is one of the last \"pagans\" in Europe in terms of the commercial 5G networks, we will show that we can become one of the leaders in the development of 5G roll-out. This is especially important for Lithuanian businesses, as 5G technology will provide enormous growth potential and level of competitiveness. I am convinced that more digital life is what the future’s world needs - smarter, more sustainable and I honestly believe, better,” said Dan Stomberg, CEO of Telia Lietuva.\n\nIntensive development of 5G base stations is planned throughout 2023. The focus will be on the northeastern Lithuania, where all base stations are planned to be updated with Ericsson network equipment. By mid-summer 2023, Telia Lietuva 5G connection will cover 99 percent of Lithuania's territory.\n\n5G devices and plans\n\nTelia Lietuva customers can use the 5G networks without any additional fees - all they need is a “5G payment” plan and a device that supports 5G in Lithuania. Among the 5G-enabled smartphones, the most popular are those from Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus and other smart devices. Detailed list of 5G supporting devices and 5G coverage map can be find at any time at Telia Lietuva website.\n\nFor the mobile device to connect to the 5G connection in the specified areas of its operation, it may be necessary to update the phone's operating system to the latest version. The device will then automatically connect to the network and the 5G icon will appear on the screen.\n\n5G badge is the same, features are different\n\n5G communication operating in Lithuania uses 3.5 GHz and 700 MHz frequencies. Devices in the 3.5 GHz frequency coverage area will be able to reach speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second (2 Gbps). Where 3.5 GHz can't reach, devices will automatically use the wide coverage 5G connection in the 700 MHz frequency band. Its speed will be like fast 4G, but it will have much more capacity and with much lower latency.\n\nTelia Lietuva first will enable the fastest 5G network running on 3.5 GHz frequencies in densely populated areas where huge amounts of data are moving, where there is no fiber optic cable yet, where high speed is required.\n\nTelia Lietuva was testing 5G technology in Lithuania since 2018 and has been providing commercial 5G services in Vilnius using 2100 MHz frequency band since January of 2022.",
    "One in five people in Lithuania is at risk of poverty": "In Lithuania the at–risk–of–poverty rate last year was 20% and one in five people in Lithuania was at risk of poverty, informs public broadcaster LRT, referring to the Lithuanian Statistics Department.\n\n«Compared to 2020, the at–risk–of–poverty rate has decreased by 0.9% and by 2.9% over four years,» said Inga Masiulaitytė–Šukevič, Deputy Director of the Lithuanian Statistics Department.\n\nLast year, the poverty risk threshold was 483 euros per month for a single person and 1 015 euros for a family of two adults and two children under 14. At–risk–of–poverty rate was 17.4% in urban areas and 25.4% in rural areas.\n\nThe highest rate was recorded in the 65+ age group, at almost 36%.\n\nHowever, the highest poverty risk level was found in households consisting of a single mother or a single father with children, at least one of whom was under 25 years old. Among those employed, 7.5% were below the poverty risk threshold, compared to 50% of those unemployed.\n\nAccording to Masiulaitytė–Šukevič, the absolute poverty rate in the country was almost 4%.\n\nMoreover, 36.4% of the population lived in households that would not be able to meet the 380–euro contingency from their own resources. Around 9% of households were unable to eat meat, fish, or equivalent vegetarian food at least every other day. Also, 33.5% of households could not spend at least one week of their holidays away from home.\n\n«Children at risk of poverty were not only forced to restrict their leisure needs due to lack of funds but were also undernourished, and a large proportion had to make do with second-hand clothes,» Masiulaitytė–Šukevič said.",
    "Regional Development in Finland and Lithuania: a Study Visit": "Helsinki, Finland\n\nStrengthening regional democracy is important for the overall multi-level good democratic governance.

    "Lithuania Deepens Relations With Taiwan Amid China Tensions": "Lithuania’s new representative office in Taiwan has begun operations although it has yet to physically open its doors due to delays, according to media reports.\n\nLithuania’s representative to Taiwan had only recently finished quarantine procedures and was still preparing the new trade office, local media reported on Tuesday. A similar report by Reuters cited a Taiwanese diplomat saying the new office was still being “fitted out.”\n\nTaiwanese media earlier reported that the new office would open on September 12, but the date came and went without an official announcement. Both Lithuania’s and Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to specify a date when the office would formally open its doors following inquiries from VOA.\n\n'Like-minded partners'\n\nThe Baltic state said last year it would open the office to cement its growing ties with Taiwan even as both sides risk attracting the ire of China.\n\nLithuania, a nation of around 2.7 million, has emerged as one of Taiwan’s most unlikely yet outspoken allies in Europe as it pursues a “values-first” foreign policy. The two sides, which both transitioned to democracy in the 1990s, have been pulled closed together by shared commonalities like an authoritarian past and ongoing threats from powerful neighbors Russia and China.\n\nIn a sign of their growing ties, the 28-person visiting delegation led by Vice Minister of Economy and Innovation Karolis Žemaitis is the latest in a wave of Lithuanian delegations to visit this year alone.\n\n“Lithuania and Taiwan want to build connections because we feel as like-minded partners that share the same democracy, rule of law and human rights values,” Rasa Juknevičienė, a Lithuanian representative in the European Parliament, wrote to VOA in response to written questions. “We have a right and intention to deepen cooperation.”\n\nThe European Union is one of Taiwan’s largest trading partners, and many countries have turned to Taiwan for its advanced manufacturing capability and renowned semiconductor industry. The EU and other member states, such as Germany and France, also have trade missions or offices in Taipei, although they have been quieter in their support for Taiwan, observers say.\n\nChina regards Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as its province and treats any public engagement with its government in Taipei as a political rebuke. In the past it has been swift to punish Lithuania for its open support of Taiwan, most recently sanctioning Lithuania’s deputy transport minister for visiting Taipei in August. Late last year, Beijing also downgraded its relationship with Lithuania and banned imports after Taiwan opened a de facto embassy in its capital city.\n\nMarc Cheng, executive director of the European Union Centre in Taiwan, told VOA that China may not respond immediately to the new trade office as it faces domestic concerns. Beijing needs stability ahead of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party next month, he said.\n\nZsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, a former political advisor at the European Parliament and assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, also said Beijing might be running out of options for now.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything more China can do against Lithuania with economic coercion,” Ferenczy told VOA, although she did not rule out that China could retaliate against Taiwan.\n\nEurope alarmed\n\nChina’s treatment of Lithuania has alarmed Europe at a time when many countries are viewing Beijing with more wariness, not the least because of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nXi met with Putin shortly before the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and some analysts believe he asked Putin to delay his invasion of Ukraine until after the games ended.\n\nPost-invasion, Chinese companies have helped prop up Russia’s economy by supplying it with much-needed goods and services in the face of Western sanctions and a mass exodus by multinational brands. China has also stepped in to help Russia evade Western sanctions by buying its oil, offering it a crucial economic lifeline.\n\nIn Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, an “anti-China” stance can be “synonymous with support for Ukraine,” said Una Aleksandra Bērziņa-Čerenkova head of the Asia program at the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, although some in Lithuania's business community are less enthralled by potential business opportunities in Taiwan.\n\nOther European countries are wary of China’s expansion into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, experts say, notably naval powers like France and the Netherlands. But EU heavyweight Germany has also expressed concern. Experts like Rafal Ulatowski at the University of Warsaw’s Faculty of Political Science and International Science said they must now balance their deep economic ties with long-term political fears, according to a recent interview with the U.K. think tank Chatham House.\n\nWary of China, interested in Taiwan\n\nA growing wariness of China and its intentions has been accompanied by a newfound interest in Taiwan in some parts of the Baltics, Central and Eastern Europe — like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia — where Chinese investment remains limited.\n\nTaiwan, though a much smaller market than China, can still offer its trade partners access to its advanced manufacturing capability and world-renowned semiconductor industry. It is also a major buyer of European exports like wind turbines, telecom equipment, and chemicals, according to the EU website.\n\nThe shift, however subtle, has not gone unnoticed by Beijing. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Lithuania of “colluding with Taiwan independence separatist forces” in the past. In response to emailed questions, China’s Embassy in Brussels directed VOA to a statement where Beijing urged Lithuania not “to be taken advantage of by Taiwan independence separatist forces” and damage bilateral relations.\n\nChina’s Ambassador to France Lu Shaye recently wrote in the Global Times, a Chinese state news outlet, that it has become “politically correct” for European countries to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. by adopting an “anti-China” foreign policy. He also said European politicians have “stepped up efforts in playing the Taiwan card to chase their own interests, attract public attention and gamble for votes.”\n\nIvana Karásková, a China research fellow and a project coordinator at the Czech Republic’s Association for International Affairs, said that concerns about China are trumped by war in Ukraine — for now.\n\n“Overall, on the EU level, after the human rights issues, sanctions, COVID-19 and last but not least, the forging of Sino-Russian alliance in February, there is not much of an aptitude to look for a positive agenda with China,” Karásková said by email, adding that even positive cooperation on climate change has been sidelined by Europe’s current energy crisis.\n\n“That said, the EU would prefer to deal with Russia and China separately and not fighting ‘two theatres’ at the same time,” she said.\n\nEditor's note: The story has been updated to include a response from China’s Embassy in Brussels.",
    "Week in Lithuania: Seimas approves zero VAT on heating for two seasons, a proposal on new minimum wage tabled": "Last week, President Nausėda missed Ukraine war theme in UN chief’s speech, Lithuanian, and Polish soldiers’ joint grave found.\n\nCourt rules on BKT expansion deal\n\nLithuania’s Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday, 22 September, that the legal provision the country’s government applied in 2019 and barred Birių Krovinių Terminalas (Bulk Cargo Terminal, BKT), co–owned by businessman Igor Udovickij and Belarusian fertiliser producer Belaruskalij, from acquiring shares in Nemuno Terminalas, a stevedoring company owned by the Udovickij family, and expanding BKT does not run counter to the country’s Constitution.\n\nBKT lodged an individual appeal with the Constitutional Court after the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania ruled against BKT’s request in March 2021.\n\nIn its complaint, BKT asked the Constitutional Court to rule whether the provision of the Law on the Protection of Objects of Importance to Ensuring National Security regarding an investor’s relations with foreign institutions, natural or legal persons are in line with the Article of the Constitution, stating that Lithuania’s economy shall be based on the right of private ownership, freedom of individual economic activity and initiative.\n\nOrthodox Church criticises official’s visit to Patriarch of Constantinople\n\nLithuanian Orthodox Church has criticised a recent meeting of Deputy Foreign Minister Mantas Adomėnas with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, describing it as «acting behind the back».\n\nAdomėnas attended the meeting, which took place in Istanbul on Monday, 19 September, together with Galina Vaščenkaitė, adviser to the Lithuanian prime minister, and Ambassador of Lithuania in Ankara Ričardas Degutis.\n\nAdomėnas would neither confirm nor deny that the meeting also touched upon a possible restoration of canonical subordination to Constantinople.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches of Latvia, Estonia and Moldova are the only Orthodox Churches within the canonical jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate that already have the kind of autonomy that is being sought by the Lithuanian Orthodox Church.\n\nSeimas approves zero VAT on heating for two seasons\n\nLithuanian lawmakers on Thursday, 23 September, backed government’s proposal to introduce a zero VAT rate on district heating for two more winter seasons after 111 MPs voted in favour and nine abstained. As some MPs were concerned that the rate will apply to district heating only, Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė pointed out that the state’s electricity and gas price compensation this year is higher than any VAT rate.\n\nThe difference between the gas price paid by consumers and the market price is about four times, she said.\n\nAccording to the Finance Ministry, the state budget would lose around 54 million euros in revenue in the 2022–2023 heating season because of the VAT relief and would further lose 57 million euros in the 2023–2024 season, provided that prices remain at the same level as in the first half of 2023.\n\nSeimas slaps temporary ban on Russian, Belarusian TV, radio broadcasts\n\nThe Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, on Thursday, 22 September, slapped a temporary ban on Russian and Belarusian TV and radio broadcasts in Lithuania. This was done due to the state of emergency in Lithuania now being limited to zones along the country’s borders with Russia and Belarus instead of its entire territory. A respective legislative amendment was passed in a vote of 113 to zero with four abstentions.\n\nThe amendment to the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public imposes a temporary ban on rebroadcasting and online distribution of radio, TV or individual broadcasts by entities established, directly or indirectly owned, controlled or financed by Russia and Belarus. The provision will remain in effect until 16 October, 2024.\n\nLithuania to decide case–by–case on humanitarian visas for Russians\n\nLithuania said it would assess each application individually following Riga’s announcement that it will not issue humanitarian visas to Russians avoiding mobilisation. Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said Lithuania «does not have the objective and capacity to issue humanitarian visas to all Russian citizens who apply for them». Moreover, it said, Lithuania will continue to coordinate its response with regional partners and the European Union. As the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine continues for almost eight months, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in the country on Wednesday, 21 September.\n\nProposal on new minimum wage tabled\n\nLithuania’s ministers of finance and social security and labour confirmed officially that their respective ministries propose to increase the minimum monthly wage by 15%, and the non-taxable income threshold – by almost 16% from January 1, 2003. Finance Minister Gintarė Skaistė said on Wednesday, 21 September, that her mini0stry proposed to increase the maximum applicable non-taxable income threshold by 85 euros, i.e. to 625 euros, from 540 euros, which means an increase of 15.7%. According to the proposals, the minimum monthly wage would be increased by 110 euros, to 840 euros (before tax), while the non–taxable income threshold would be raised by 85 euros, to 625 euros.\n\nLithuania reports 1 707 new COVID-19 cases, no deaths\n\nLithuania recorded 1 707 new coronavirus infections and no deaths from COVID-19 over Tuesday, September 20, official statistics showed on Wednesday, September 21.

Jonas Valanciunas shot two free throws for Lithuania for the personal foul, but no free throw for the technical was awarded.\n\nHerbert said he was told by one of the referees with 7 seconds left in regulation that there was \"a situation\" regarding the technical and what should have happened.\n\n\"That was the first time I heard about it,\" Herbert said.\n\nFIBA said the protest was \"inadmissible as the protest reasons were delivered outside the designated time of 60 minutes after the game.\" But FIBA added that the protest, even if filed in a timely manner, would have been rejected \"as the reason presented is not one of the reasons under which a protest can be filed.\"\n\nArnas Butkevicius' 3-pointer from the left wing for Lithuania -- the potential game winner -- bounced off the rim as the clock ran out in the second extra session.\n\nMaodo Lo scored 21 points for Germany (3-0), and Daniel Theis added 11.\n\nValanciunas had game highs of 34 points and 14 rebounds for Lithuania (0-3), while Marius Grigonis scored 17, Domantas Sabonis finished with 13, Ignas Brazdeikis scored 12 and Mindaugas Kuzminskas added 11.\n\nLithuania's three losses have been by seven, four and two points.\n\n\"It was a tough game,\" Valanciunas said. \"They played well. I thought we responded for most of the time. ... Congrats to them.\"\n\nValanciunas scored the final four points of regulation as Lithuania rallied from down 89-85 in the final 42 seconds. Schroder missed a step-back jumper at the buzzer of the fourth, and Wagner missed one at the end of the first overtime.\n\nBut in the second OT, the Germans scored the first five points and never trailed. Valanciunas was subbed out with 2:29 left, Lo made a 3-pointer 17 seconds later for a 106-102 lead and Germany held on.\n\n\"To come out on top, after all of that, I think it's definitely a sign of our character and togetherness as a team,\" Lo said.\n\nGROUP A\n\nGEORGIA 88, TURKEY 83, 2OT\n\nThe host nation in Group A rallied from an early 10-point deficit and handed Turkey (2-1) its first loss, though there was even more drama following the game.\n\nTurkey alleged that one of its players -- local media said it was Furkan Korkmaz -- got into an altercation in the locker room area following the game. It was unclear who else was involved in the incident.\n\nTurkey assistant coach Hakan Demir said his national federation wants to review security footage. Turkey was also upset that 22 seconds ran off the clock during a fourth-quarter on-court altercation between Korkmaz and Georgia's Duda Sanadze. In a statement Monday, FIBA deemed that the scorekeeping error did not affect the outcome of the game.\n\n\"We will watch the cameras,\" Demir said. \"This kind of thing, unfortunately, is a big disappointment. We are here to play basketball. ... On the court, Georgia won the game. We congratulate them. It's no problem. We lost in two overtimes. Does not matter.\"\n\nKorkmaz and Sanadze were both ejected.\n\nAlexander Mamukelashvili had 20 points and 12 rebounds for Georgia (1-2), while Thaddus McFadden scored 17, Rati Andronikashvili and Giorgi Shermadini each scored 15 and Sanadze added 13.\n\nAlperen Sengun led Turkey with 21 points on 10-of-14 shooting. Sertac Sanli scored 15, Cedi Osman added 14 and Melih Mahmutoglu had 11. Shane Larkin finished with nine points, eight rebounds, seven assists and five steals.\n\nTurkey's loss created a four-way tie with Montenegro, Spain and Belgium joining it atop Group A. The top four teams in each group advance to the knockout stage.\n\nBELGIUM 83, SPAIN 73\n\nAt Tbilisi, Georgia, Manu Lecomte scored 20 points and Belgium ended the game on a 12-0 run to surprise Spain.\n\nPierre-Antoine Gillet scored 14 points for Belgium (2-1), which got 11 from Retin Obasohan and 10 from Ismael Bako.\n\nWilly Hernangomez scored 18 for Spain (2-1), while Juancho Hernangomez and Lorenzo Brown each had 11.\n\nMONTENEGRO 91, BULGARIA 81\n\nVladimir Mihailovic scored 23 points and Montenegro (2-1) ended the game on an 18-6 run to rally past Bulgaria (0-3).\n\nIgor Drobnjak and Bojan Dubljevic each had 17 points for Montenegro, Nemanja Radovic added 16 and Kendrick Perry scored 12.\n\nAleksandar Vezenkov led all scorers with 26 for Bulgaria, which led 75-73 in the fourth before missing eight of its last 10 shots. Andrey Ivanov finished with 17 and Chavdar Kostov added 10 for Bulgaria, which tried 64 shots in the game -- 40 of them from 3-point range.\n\nGROUP B\n\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 97, SLOVENIA 93\n\nAlso at Cologne, Bosnia and Herzegovina (2-1) surprised Luka Doncic and defending EuroBasket winner Slovenia (2-1) behind 23 points from John Roberson and 22 from Dzanan Musa.\n\nMiralem Halilovic scored 13, while Jusuf Nurkic and Edin Atic each had 12 for the winners.\n\nDoncic had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for Slovenia but went 0--or 8 from 3-point range. Vlatko Cancar led Slovenia with 22 points, Goran Dragic added 20, Klemen Prepelic scored 12 and Mike Tobey finished with 11.\n\nFRANCE 78, HUNGARY 74\n\nGuerschon Yabusele scored 17 points and France (2-1) wasted most of a 15-point lead before hanging on late to defeat Hungary (1-2).\n\nAdam Hanga's 3-pointer with 1:04 left got Hungary within 74-72. Hungary got a stop on the next France possession and had a shot at what would have been its first lead, but David Vojvoda's 3-point try bounced off the rim with 23 seconds remaining.\n\nRudy Gobert scored 15 points, Evan Fournier added 12 and Vincent Poirier had 10 for France.\n\nHanga scored 18 for Hungary, and Mikael Hopkins added 10.\n\nMONDAY'S SCHEDULE\n\nGroup C and Group D return to the floor. Group A and Group B get a rest day.\n\nIn Group C, at Milan, Ukraine (2-0) will look to remain unbeaten when it faces host Italy (1-1). Also in Milan on Monday: Greece (2-0), which has won its two games by a combined eight points, takes on Great Britain (0-2) and Croatia (1-1) faces Estonia (0-2).\n\nIn Group D, at Prague, Serbia (2-0) plays Finland (1-1), Israel (2-0) takes on Poland (1-1) and the Czech Republic (0-2) meets the Netherlands (0-2).\n\nAll four groups are in action Tuesday, with 12 games on the schedule. Group play continues through Thursday, and the round of 16 starts in Berlin on Saturday.",
    "US Banks On Lithuania To Prove LA100 Renewable Energy Model": "In yet another sign that Russia is losing its death grip on the Baltic region in particular and the fossil energy economy in general, last week the Biden administration formally committed to help Lithuania achieve its 100% renewable energy goal for electricity and become net energy exporter, too. In a weird twist, success in Lithuania could bounce back to the US and help accelerate the renewable energy revolution at home.\n\nLithuania’s Long Road To 100% Renewable Energy\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in the US-Lithuania agreement in terms of geopolitics abroad and domestic politics here in the US. Fossil energy stakeholders are increasingly violent in their desperation to hold back the rising tide of renewable energy, as demonstrated by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s murderous rampage through Ukraine.\n\nThe energy security stakes for Baltic nations are sky-high as evidence of Russian atrocities mounts in Ukraine, and in the midst of all this Lithuania has tasked itself with setting the bar for a fossil free future.\n\nIf you’re wondering why Lithuania is so ambitious, that’s a good question. The country’s plans for energy independence suffered a setback in 2010, when its nuclear power production went offline. Lithuania is currently a net energy importer, and its renewable energy sector leans heavily on biomass. That emphasis on biomass is going to be problematic in terms of global forest conservation and carbon sequestration planning over the coming years.\n\nIn short, Lithuania is launching its renewable energy transition with one hand tied behind its back and a stone in its shoe. If the country can shoot ahead of the decarbonization pack despite the obstacles, it could provide a model for others to follow.\n\nLithuania, the IEA & Renewable Energy Geopolitics\n\nEven before Russia launched its unprovoked attack on Ukraine, global energy planners were already tapping Lithuania as a potential leader in both clean power and energy security — and by extension, as a threat to Russian energy dominance.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, for one, has emerged as a big fan of Lithuania. IEA is a consortium of 31 industrialized countries including the US, under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Alongside the member countries there are a dozen or so associates and aspiring countries. Notably, Russia is not an IEA member or associate. It is listed as an accession country, not a member, of OECD.\n\nLithuania is one of those countries seeking IEA membership, and with that in mind IEA issued a policy report on the country in April 2021. The report took note of energy-related challenges facing Lithuania, but overall the picture is one of substantial potential for success.\n\nThe IEA report also picked out some interesting geopolitical angles, including:\n\nLithuania targets 100% of electricity from renewables by 2050.\n\nLithuania has consistently emphasized energy security in its energy strategy and regional engagement.\n\nLithuania – along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia – is integrating its power system into Continental Europe’s.\n\nRegional supply security has become a top priority, as the Baltic states ceased electricity imports from Belarus in 2020 and are targeting the full synchronization of their power systems with that of Continental Europe by 2025.\n\nBaltic Sea Offshore Wind Power Is The Key\n\nDid Vladimir Putin read that IEA report? Who knows! If he did, all the more reason to flex the power of Russia’s fossil energy economy while there is still time.\n\nWith a relatively small population, Lithuania would not account for much in the way of oil and gas imports from Russia. However, as with Ukraine, Lithuania poses an outsized threat to Russian fossil energy stakeholders because of its potential for exporting renewable energy to EU nations and beyond.\n\nIf you’re thinking green hydrogen, that’s only part of the equation, but it’s an important element due to Lithuania’s access to offshore wind power in the Baltic Sea. Hydrogen is both a fuel and an energy storage medium that is transportable on multiple platforms including highway, rail, ship, and pipeline.\n\nIEA Executive Director Faith Birol emphasized the hydrogen and offshore wind angles in a press release announcing the April 2021 report, stating that “Hydrogen, offshore wind and batteries can be real game-changers in the context of Lithuania’s clean energy transition.”\n\nThe green hydrogen angle comes into play as new floating wind turbine technology enables wind developers in multiple nations to tap more areas of the Baltic Sea. Eight EU nations sit on the Baltic Sea including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Poland, and Sweden alongside Lithuania.\n\nWith water and electricity from renewable resources in hand, Baltic nations can run electrolysis systems to produce green hydrogen. That’s one giant decarbonization step up from the conventional hydrogen supply chain, which leans heavily on fossil resources.\n\nIn particular, Denmark and Germany have already formed an alliance that will enable Germany’s high-demand economy to siphon off excess green hydrogen from Denmark.\n\nRussia also has a foothold in the Baltic Sea through its free-floating Kaliningrad Oblast, but given the nation’s past and recent history, Russia is unlikely to exploit its only year-round ice-free port on the Baltic sea for renewable energy development any time in the near future.\n\nThe Los Angeles-Lithuania Renewable Energy Connection\n\nAs for LA100, that is shorthand for the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study, a breakthrough report from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory issued last year.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the new collaboration between Lithuania and the US will deploy the LA100 plan as a model for Lithuania’s energy transition.\n\nThat will put Lithuania on the map as the first nation in the world to implement the LA100 model.\n\nLA100 is a first-of-its-kind, computer-enabled multidisciplinary study that positions the City of Los Angeles as a test case for achieving a 100% carbon-free power sector on a national level.\n\n“The study’s results show that a reliable, 100% renewable electricity supply is indeed achievable for LA by 2045 or even a decade sooner,” NREL wrote in an summary of the report.\n\n“Equally exciting is how the results point to new research priorities — from R&D to advance the development of commercially available storable hydrogen fuel, to improvements in how we model and prioritize energy equity,” the lab added.\n\nThere’s that hydrogen thing again. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.\n\nAs for why Lithuania, and not the US, will be the first nation in the world to implement the LA100 model, that’s another good question. If you have any thoughts about that, you know the drill.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @TinaMCasey.\n\nImage (screenshot, page 18): Lithuania profile courtesy of IEA.org.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppreciate CleanTechnica’s originality and cleantech news coverage?

    "First German NATO brigade troops arrive in Lithuania": "Around a hundred German soldiers arrived in Lithuania on Sunday (4 September 2022), part of NATO’s increased presence on the Alliance’s eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe German troops make up the command unit of a new brigade, a force usually made up of around 3,000-5,000 soldiers. The soldiers are part of Germany’s 41st tank brigade and arrived in Klaipeda port by ferry from Kiel. The unit consists of about 100 personnel, as well as equipment for command and control, communications and logistics.\n\n\"The arrival of the first German troops as part of the NATO brigade represents an important step in strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defence at a critical time for our security, and sending a clear message that NATO will defend every inch of Allied territory,” said NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu.\n\nThe brigade’s command staff will remain permanently in the Baltic nation, while combat units will join them on rotation for exercises. At the Madrid Summit in June, NATO leaders decided to strengthen NATO’s forward defences, including by enhancing NATO’s battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance up to brigade level. Germany, which leads the NATO battlegroup in Lithuania, already has some 1,500 soldiers in the country. The four NATO multinational battlegroups were set up in the Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia in Poland after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. They were enhanced earlier this year in response to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, and four new battlegroups are being established in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.",
    "The United States of America to Cooperate With Lithuania on Developing its Clean Energy Plan": "WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm and the Minister of Energy of Lithuania Dainius Kreivys signed a historic agreement on enhanced cooperation to help achieve Lithuania’s goals of energy security and the transition to a climate-neutral energy sector. The result of a long-standing cooperation between the two countries in energy policy, this first such Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aims to better prepare Lithuania’s energy sector to meet climate change-related threats.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Energy truly values a strong and consistent partnership with Lithuania, and this MoU further solidifies our collaboration with European allies at this critically important moment in history,” said Secretary Granholm. “We are excited for Lithuania to take advantage of our National Lab expertise to chart their own course towards clean energy and energy independence. This work, like our Net Zero World initiative with a number of other countries, will provide a roadmap to growing thousands of clean energy jobs and strengthening our economies.”\n\n“This agreement, signed together with the Secretary Granholm, is not the beginning of energy cooperation between Lithuania and the United States, but the outcome consistent and intensive cooperation lasting for a several years. It represents a shared commitment by both countries to continue to work closely together to achieve the same energy policy goals, one of the most important of which is the historic and inevitable transformation of our energy sectors. Lithuania has ambitious goals for the next three decades to become not only a fully energy-independent and self-sufficient country generating energy for its own needs from renewable sources, but also a net exporting country in the region. Over the next few decades, the energy sector will become an even more complex organism that will require special protection and resilience to external factors. Therefore, we have agreed to work together to strengthen the resilience of the energy sector to cyber threats and climate change factors,” said Minister Kreivys.\n\nThe MoU provides for specific areas of cooperation related to strengthening Lithuania’s energy sector in cyber security, as well as Lithuania’s goal of transitioning to a 100% renewable energy sector by 2050.\n\nLithuania’s Ministry of Energy and other organizations will work with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a plan to modernize the country’s electricity system infrastructure modelled after the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study (LA100). Lithuania will be the first country in the world to implement this model in order to achieve a transition of the Lithuanian energy sector to 100% renewable energy by 2050. The LT-100 study will help understand and plan for issues related to feasibility, reliability, public health, and equitable local economic development, including job opportunities and local hiring programs in renewable energy.\n\nREAD the LA100 study.",

During the meeting, the Senators also offered their support to Lithuania as the nation faces economic bullying from the Chinese government for improving diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Durbin and Grassley were also joined by Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).\n\n“Time and time again, Lithuania has proved itself to be a champion of freedom and democracy,” said Durbin. “Today, in the face of Russian aggression and Chinese economic intimidation, is no different. As Co-Chair of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus and as a son of a Lithuanian immigrant, I will continue to be an outspoken ally to the Lithuanian people and the nation’s Baltic neighbors as they work to uphold these values in an increasingly tense situation. Today’s conversation reaffirmed our alliance and proved in the face of Putin’s war, the courage and resilience of the people of Eastern Europe is unparalleled.”\n\n“We will continue to stand with our friends in Lithuania. This year our countries celebrated the milestone that is one century of continuous diplomatic relations. Amid ongoing Russian aggression and Chinese bullying, we in the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus and throughout the country are steadfast in our support for our longstanding ally Lithuania. I look forward to more engagement and friendship between our nations in the years to come,” Grassley said.\n\n“We are grateful for US leadership which together with strong transatlantic alliance are essential at this critical time for the world order and especially for European security. The scenarios for our common future are being played out in Ukraine. We are also witnessing efforts by external forces to destabilise NATO and the EU. In the race for strategic patience with Russia, we must not only remain united and resolute, but step up our efforts to defend what we hold most dear - freedom, democracy, our values. That is why it is essential to continue to provide comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, to stop Russian aggression, to strengthen NATO’s Eastern flank, to increase energy independence, and to support other democracies around the world, including Taiwan. Lithuania stands ready to work together with our strategic partner the US for a better future,” said Viktorija ?milyt?-Nielsen, Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania.\n\nPhotos of the meeting are available here\n\nDurbin met with Speaker ?milyt?-Nielsen in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he received the Aleksandras Stulginskis Star Award—only the second individual and first American to receive this award. The new award honors Aleksandras Stulginskis, former President of Lithuania who served from 1920-1926 and was a strong advocate for a democratic republic. It was granted to Durbin for his decades-long support of Lithuanian independence and democracy and his promotion of parliamentary values. In February, Durbin visited introduced Baltic Defense and Det errence Act, legislation to effectively codify the Baltic Security Initiative and create a complementary initiative at the U.S. Department of State.

    "Lithuania topples last Soviet monuments": "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the revolutionary Bolshevik and founder of the Soviet Union, died in 1924 but remained omnipresent decades after his death. Carved in stone and cast in iron, he stood larger than life in the most prominent places of cities all over Lithuania.\n\nBut with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, his cult of personality was over. As elsewhere in formerly communist countries, Lenin sculptures and those of other dictators were taken down from their pedestals and removed from sight.\n\n\"After the rapid demolition of many monuments in the early 1990s and the renaming of streets and squares, the issue of monuments then fell into obscurity for a long time,\" said Arunas Bubnys, the director of the Genocide and Resistance Research Center in Vilnius.\n\nBut with the start of the Russian war in Ukraine on February 24, resentment against the former Soviet Union and current Russian policies has once again increased. People in Lithuania are afraid of being attacked by Putin's troops.\n\nIn the small town of Merkine, the statue of a Soviet soldier was removed from its pedestal in May\n\nMemories of the occupation of Lithuania, which began in 1940 — a product of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union — are newly present. Ultimately, the occupation ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. But until 1953, mass deportations took place, particularly to Siberia.\n\nThe ambivalent history of the country also includes the fact that many antisemitic Lithuanians participated in the murder of around 200,000 Jews during the German occupation from 1941 to 1944. The Genocide and Resistance Research Center, led by the historian and archivist Bubnys, covers Lithuanian antisemitism, but also focuses on resistance to the Soviet regime.\n\nLithuanian paramilitary groups prepare\n\nThis scientific center includes the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, where Soviet secret services tortured and murdered prisoners in the building in the middle of Vilnius. The Nazis also used the building for the same purpose during their temporary occupation during World War II.\n\nThe exhibitions focus on Lithuania's oppression, which lasted nearly 50 years, when the country, like all Baltic states, was a Soviet republic. During this time, hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians ended up in prisons and labor camps for political reasons, or were killed outright.\n\nSculptures removed from cemeteries\n\nWhen Lithuania won its independence in 1991, it quickly rid itself of most of its prominent Soviet propaganda heritage: statues of Lenin and monuments with tanks and soldiers. In some places, however, Soviet monuments remained. But thanks to the ongoing war in Ukraine, there are now plans to remove remaining symbols like the red star, and the hammer and sickle, said Bubnys. Sculptures in cemeteries are also being removed.\n\nThis memorial to Soviet soldiers at the Antakalnis cemetery in Vilnius is scheduled to be removed in September\n\nBut Violeta Davoliute, a professor at the Institute of International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University, thinks this could be problematic. She wants to see an unemotional debate on how to deal with symbols from the past. \"Is it just a wreath or are there other symbols? If they don't symbolize Soviet military power, then they should be left standing,\" she said.\n\nIn the small town of Merkine, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Vilnius, the decision was different — there, those in charge decided to remove a 2-meter high statue of a Russian solider from its pedestal back in May. Davoliute would have preferred to leave it in place. Such statues would be good for documentation purposes, she argues. \"You could use the statue to try to explain and present complicated history.\"\n\nGvidas Rutkauskas is also against removing all Soviet traces in Lithuania — yet he could have every reason to want their removal. He was born in Siberia, where his parents had been deported. Nevertheless, the chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees is against disposing of all communist relics.\n\nGvidas Rutkauskas doesn't agree with removing everything from the past — 'after all, it's part of our history'\n\nAccepting history\n\nRutkauskas believes it isn't necessary to remove everything from the past — \"after all, it's part of our history,\" he told DW. Future generations should know what came before them. But he left no doubt as to when a line would be crossed for him. \"If there is a Soviet tank or symbols with the Soviet star on an important square in a city, then they should be removed,\" he said.\n\nHowever, due to the threat posed to Lithuania by the war in Ukraine, the argument for removal has solidified — most are in favor of removing all evidence of communism. Liucija Verveckiene of The (Post)Soviet Memory Studies Center, TSPMI, however, noticed the shift in opinion before the war. According to her, 2014 was a turning point.\n\nAt that time, Russia annexed Crimea, and since then, pro-Russian separatists and regular Ukrainian troops have been fighting in eastern Ukraine. This changed the debate about removing Soviet relics from public space, she said.\n\nThe Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula changed Lithuanians' attitudes, said Liucija Verveckiene\n\nAnother question is how to deal with personalities from arts and culture who were said to be close to the Soviet leadership. As an example, the historian mentions Lithuanian writer Petras Cvirka, who died in 1947, and who, as a communist, supported Soviet policies. The monument erected in his honor in Vilnius was removed in November 2021.\n\nThe novellas, short stories and children's books by the controversial author have been translated into English, Chinese and many Eastern European languages. Verveckiene considers his case to be exemplary when it comes to the difficult question of what is meant by collaboration with the former Soviet regime. Cvirka did not harm anyone personally, but he did support the Soviet system.\n\nReunion with Marx and Stalin in Grutas Park\n\nIf one day all traces of communism disappear from Lithuania's streets, squares and cemeteries, those interested in the communist past could still visit Grutas Park in the country's south. Since the turn of the millennium, unwanted sculptures have been collected on the park's extensive grounds — works depicting Lenin, the dictator and mass murderer Josef Stalin, the head of the secret service Feliks Dzierzynski, German philosopher Karl Marx, and many others.\n\nThis statue of Josef Stalin stands alongside other discarded monuments in Grutas Park, southern Lithuania\n\nCurrently, 87 monuments stand among fir, pine and birch trees. Barbed wire entanglements and watchtowers can also be seen, as they were common in Siberian penal camps. For the older visitors to the park, there are photo boards with information about the origin of the sculptures and when they were removed. For the younger guests, there is a children's playground. In neighboring meadows, goats graze and ostriches strut.\n\nCritics consider the privately run open-air museum to be a mix of Disneyland and a house of horrors. Historian Davoliute from Vilnius University, on the other hand, is more positive. On her first visit to Grutas Park, she and her colleagues viewed the sculptures in a \"humorous light.\"\n\nThe researcher said this kind of presentation can seem to be trivialize, especially to foreign visitors. For the people of Lithuania, on the other hand, the Soviet monuments gathered in Grutas Park made it easier to look at their past. \"You can also laugh about it,\" she explained.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: DW editors round up what is happening in Germany and the world in regular e-mail newsletters.

    "Lithuania to Apply Stricter Verification Procedures for Russians Crossing the Border During State of Emergency": "The Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs has announced that all Russians will be subject to stricter verification procedures when crossing the border to reach Lithuania from September 19, when the state of emergency starts applying again.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis means that as soon as the measure gets extended, all citizens of Russia will be required to undergo a comprehensive examination, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nThe Ministry explained that the aim of these stricter measures at the border is to make sure that Russians meet the criteria approved by the government. In addition, the measures aim to ensure that Russian citizens do not pose a threat to Lithuania’s public order, national security, international relations, or public health, as stated in the Schengen Border Code.\n\nExplaining the country’s decision, the Minister of Internal Affairs Agnė Bilotaitė said that they are forced to take these measures as they cannot risk the safety of the residents. Additionally, she said that a large number of Russians continue to support the war in Ukraine and emphasised that it is important to protect national security.\n\n“It is likely that among the Russian citizens who support the war in Ukraine, there are individuals who can intentionally harm the security of our country, so our message is very clear – while taking care of the safety of our people, we will use all available measures to strengthen security, one of them – during the state of emergency, we will apply stricter border controls to Russian citizens verification procedures,” the statement of Bilotaitė reads.\n\nThe Ministry further pointed out that the resolution of the government confirms that only some special categories of Russian citizens are permitted entry to the country.\n\nCurrently, Lithuania permits entry only to persons performing international transport, Russian diplomats transiting through the country, persons holding a residence permit issued by an EU state, Russians holding a long-term national visa, as well as those whose purpose of entry is for special humanitarian reasons.\n\nPreviously, SchengenVisaInfo.com reported that Lithuania, as well as Estonia, Latvia, and Poland, will stop issuing visas for Russians and ban them from entering from September 19.\n\nSuch a decision was announced by the foreign ministers of all the above-mentioned countries through a joint statement.\n\n“Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have agreed on a common regional approach and hereby express their political will and firm intention to introduce temporary national measures for Russian citizens holding EU visas,” a part of the statement reads.\n\nEditor’s Pick:",

    "Video: Why Lithuania didn't join the tributes to Mikhail Gorbachev": "European leaders marked the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union who is today credited with steering Russia away from communism and towards liberalism.\n\n\"Mikhail Gorbachev was a trusted and respected leader. He played a crucial role to end the Cold War and bring down the Iron Curtain,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\"This legacy is one we will not forget.\"\n\nVon der Leyen's words were echoed across Western Europe, with tributes quickly pouring in from Berlin, Paris, London, Rome, Madrid, Brussels, Amsterdam and Vienna.\n\nBut in Vilnius, the reaction was different.\n\n\"Lithuanians will not glorify Gorbachev,\" said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's foreign affairs minister.\n\n\"We will never forget the simple fact that his army murdered civilians to prolong his regime's occupation of our country.\"\n\nLandsbergis appeared to refer to the tragic events of January 1991, which still resonate across Lithuania. That month represented a turning point in the Baltic country's history and its long quest for freedom.\n\nWatch the video above to learn what happened in January 1991.",
    "The inside guide to Kaunas, Lithuania's Capital of Culture for 2022": "As joint European Capital of Culture in 2022, Lithuania’s second city is finally getting the plaudits it deserves. Like the capital, Vilnius, it has a relaxed Old Town, a ruined riverside castle, and buzzing bars and restaurants, but Kaunas’s unique appeal lies in its concentration of interwar architecture in its New Town. Much of it was built between 1919 and 1939, when the city briefly served as Lithuania’s capital, and there are hopes its modernist district will be approved for UNESCO World Heritage status next year.\n\nBefore you take in the architecture, however, head to the farmers’ market, which sets up beside the castle every Saturday. Many of its stalls sell just one speciality, be it gherkins, dark rye bread, woodland honey, skilandis (smoked pork sausage) or sakotis, the sweet, traditional ‘tree cake’ cooked on a spit. Nearby, on Jonavos gatve street, the two-storey Wise Old Man mural, which appeared in 2013, was one of the first efforts to revitalise tired public spaces with street art. New murals are constantly being added to the city — you can pick up the Wallographer’s Notes map from the tourist office to create a personalised walking tour.\n\nTethering the Old Town to the New Town, Laisvės Alėja (Freedom Avenue) is a mile-long boulevard flanked by linden trees, terrace bars and art deco buildings. Make a beeline for Spurginė, a stuck-in-time 1960s doughnut bar with a countertop loaded with pillowy fried spurgine doughnuts. Go for one of the savoury options, stuffed with minced pork, or indulge in a sweet variety filled with apple jam or chocolate.\n\nFreedom Avenue is also home to Lithuania’s best craft brewery, Genys. Try a beer flight on the terrace, in the shadow of the neo-Byzantine dome of St Michael The Archangel Church, built in the 1890s when Kaunas was part of the Tsarist Russian empire. Or seek out Kamerinis, a cocktail bar in a greenhouse, hidden inside the Kaunas Chamber Theatre.",
    "Lithuania to Officially Extend State of Emergency at Its Borders With Belarus & Russia": "The Lithuania authorities have announced that the country has officially decided to extend the state of emergency along the entire border section with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region of Russia.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAnnouncing the news, the Ministry of Interior of Lithuania said that the proposal had been approved by the government, and the state emergency will be extended until December 16, 2022, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nUnder the current draft, the state of emergency would remain in place until September 16. However, taking into account the current situation, the Lithuanian government decided to prolong it until the end of the year.\n\nEarlier this week, when the Lithuanian Ministry of Interior proposed that the country extends the state of emergency along its border with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Agnė Bilotaitė, said that such a measure is necessary to ensure the security of Lithuanian society.\n\n“The insecure and unstable geopolitical situation creates conditions for the Russian and Belarusian authorities to carry out hybrid attacks and various kinds of provocations against Lithuania. In response to this, we must apply the necessary security measures to counter potential threats,” Bilotaitė stated.\n\nIn addition, the Minister pointed out that such a measure is needed in order to stop any other form of hybrid attacks from Belarus and Russia against Lithuania. According to the Minister, migrants have been used as a form of hybrid attack against Lithuania and emphasised that the country will not permit entry to around 6,000 of them this year.\n\n“Almost 6,000 migrants will not be allowed into Lithuania this year. Belarusian officials damage the physical barrier installed on the Lithuanian border with Belarus, organize the transport of illegal migrants to the state border and direct them to the territory of Lithuania,” the statement of the Ministry reads.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned, it was noted that the state borders would continue to be protected under an enhanced regime.\n\nMoreover, the Ministry said that a stricter regime would continue to apply for nationals of Russia and Belarus applying for visas. Lithuania already restricted the issuance of visas for nationals of these two countries earlier this year. However, certain exemptions apply in cases where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mediates.\n\nOther EU countries are also expected to soon introduce stricter rules against citizens of Russia. The Commission of the European Union just recently proposed the suspension of the visa facilitation agreement with Russia. Russians will now have to pay higher prices for Schengen visas and present more documents, among others.",

    "Repeated pushbacks cause mental and physical suffering for people crossing Lithuanian border - Lithuania": "Asylum seekers and migrants, including families with young children, are being subjected to repeated pushbacks between the borders of Lithuania and Belarus with little to no access to basic needs or fair asylum procedures.\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is appalled by the medical and humanitarian impact of Lithuania’s hostile migration policies towards people on the move, as well as the use of inhumane practices such as pushbacks in response to people seeking safety.\n\nThere have been numerous instances of Lithuanian authorities forcibly returning migrants and refugees to Belarus, resulting in the breach of their rights. The Lithuanian State Border Guard Service (SBGS) publicly claims to have carried out thousands of pushbacks at the border since the start of the year.\n\n“It is unacceptable that the Lithuanian government is trying to normalise this mistreatment and denial of rights in response to the movement of people who have fled their countries out of desperation, in search of safety and a better life,” says Georgina Brown, MSF country manager in Lithuania.\n\n“People on the move in Lithuania are entitled to dignified and humane treatment, including safety and international protection,” she says. “And yet we know that many people trying to enter Lithuania are being denied all of this and instead find themselves stranded, isolated, and abused.”\n\nSome people have told our teams that they have been repeatedly pushed back and forth across the border over days, or even weeks.\n\n“For 30 days, we didn’t settle in one place. We went back and forth around 10 times between Belarus and Lithuania during that time,” says Cassandra*, a mother who was pushed back and forth by authorities between both countries over 30 days.\n\n“The guards kept moving us in and out, in and out, and back and forth,” she says. “Once we were captured, we were given some tinned food which was expired and dry. I couldn’t even eat that, as I kept it for my children.”\n\n“Then they would put us back in cars and take us back to the border,” continues Cassandra. “It was a cat and mouse situation. I was traumatised and I just wished to go anywhere there was shelter so it would put an end to our suffering.”\n\nSuch repeat pushbacks compound the distress and trauma faced by migrants and asylum seekers at the borders of the European Union.\n\n“People who already faced several traumas such as sexual violence and torture in their country of origin are now faced with the new trauma of violent pushbacks,” says Heidi Berg, MSF psychologist in Lithuania.\n\n“They feel as though they are being hunted and chased across the border again and again,” she says. “This leaves them feeling dehumanised and with an even higher level of stress and anxiety.”\n\nFear of being detected and pushed back is also leading people on the move in Lithuania to try and cross isolated areas with no access to basic needs and medical aid.\n\nMSF teams in Lithuania have treated people for skin and lower limb conditions developed after walking long distances through forests and swamps, as well as exhausted families and individuals who have slept exposed to the elements, often without adequate clothing and footwear.\n\nOur teams are aware of people who have contracted gastrointestinal illnesses after being forced to eat berries and plants and drink swamp water out of hunger, thirst and desperation.\n\nCassandra* tells of her family’s experience being pushed back and forth by authorities between Belarus and Lithuania for over 30 days...\n\n“The Belarusian border guards forced us to enter Lithuania. We told them ‘we don’t want to go any more’, but they came with full gear and weapons, intimidating us. Their faces were covered. They put us in cars and drove us for two to three hours near to the border with Lithuania.\n\nOnce in Lithuania, we were in areas where there are CCTV cameras. We waved to the cameras as we knew the guards could see us on the screens and they turned up in less than three minutes.\n\nThey took photos of us with our passports and then confiscated them along with our mobile phones. They put us in a car and took us back to the border crossing. Then they opened the door (the official border crossing) and let us walk back to Belarus.\n\nWe managed to return to Minsk. In the second attempt, we took a route to Poland, but we were caught by the border guards and beaten up in a very violent manner. My 19-year-old son was physically attacked. Even my husband, who is in his fifties, was kicked and punched.\n\nOne time we were pushed back to Belarus. We were so shattered, it was raining heavily, we couldn’t attempt to move any further. We had no more energy, so we stayed in that spot. We lit a fire and slept there until the next morning. My husband was desperately calling out for help from everywhere to reach us, as we were in a dire condition.\n\nOur family were all together first. In our last attempt to cross, we had to split our family. Me and three of my children and our adopted adult son found a taxi and asked the driver to report us to the border guards, because my daughter needed medical help. My husband and two of my other children, a 10-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy, remained in the forest, where they were stranded for a week until they managed to get back to Belarus.\n\nThe next day two people from an NGO spoke with us and then we were sent to a camp in Lithuania. We were initially put in an area that looked like a prison with high fences and barbed wire. Then we were moved to a bigger place with more space to walk, but we still can’t go out of the camp.\n\nIt has been a very traumatic situation. We didn’t expect any of this to happen to us – we wanted protection. But we’ve been subjected to a horrible journey and now my family is split. Half of my family is in Belarus – my husband, my 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old boy. My other children are here with me.\n\nI am devastated and I cannot bear being split from my children. We Facetime every day. My daughter cries, we both cry, and we desperately want to be reunited.”\n\nAs winter approaches, we are alarmed about even more serious consequences for the physical and mental health of people subjected to such mistreatment.\n\nLithuania’s hostile migration policies are yet another example of an EU member state deliberately creating unsafe conditions for people to seek asylum at its borders.\n\nPeople will continue to make desperate journeys to where they believe they can seek international protection, safety and a better future, regardless of the risks or lack of welcome they may face, and despite the lack of safe and legal routes.\n\nThe Lithuanian government must not continue with such abusive responses to vulnerable people seeking safety at its borders.\n\n“People have fled conflict, persecution, and danger with little more than the clothes on their back in search of international protection,” says Brown.\n\n“As winter approaches and temperatures fall, Lithuanian authorities must urgently cease these cruel practices and respond to the needs of those trying to enter the country with humanity,” she says.\n\n*Name changed to protect identity",

    "New CEB grant to Lithuania to support children with disabilities fleeing Ukraine - Lithuania": "PARIS – The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania have signed a grant worth almost €419,000 from CEB’s Migrant and Refugee Fund (MRF) to improve living and educational conditions for children with disabilities fleeing the war in Ukraine. This brings the total amount of MRF grants approved in response to the Ukraine crisis to approximately €6.4 million.\n\nThe grant will finance the renovation and equipping of the Social Care Centre Vija in the city of Kaunas, including the construction of an outdoor children’s playground, purchase of a bus and the operational costs through the end of 2023.\n\n“This project is very important for us because it aims to support the most vulnerable population fleeing the war in Ukraine – children with disabilities,” said CEB Governor Carlo Monticelli. “We are pleased to continue cooperating with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania to help Ukrainian refugees as well as their hosting communities.”\n\nAround 37 per cent of all refugees from Ukraine are children. As of September 2022, Lithuania welcomed 1,094 unaccompanied minors, mostly from orphanages in Ukraine.\n\nYet, Lithuania is not fully equipped to receive unaccompanied minors with disabilities of very young age. Although the authorities have started capacity building as part of the European Union’s Resettlement and Relocation Scheme for Asylum Seekers, the country’s social care institutions lack the services and infrastructure suitable for receiving infants and preschool children.\n\n“The Council of Europe Development Bank is allocating funds to Lithuania for the second time. Thanks to these funds, we will be able to take better care of Ukrainians fleeing the war, especially children,” said Monika Navickięnė, Lithuania’s Minister of Social Affairs and Labour. “Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we have received several groups of unaccompanied minors, including children with disabilities. I hope that the funds allocated to Lithuania will increase our country’s opportunities to implement a more sustainable policy of reception and asylum.”\n\nThe minister emphasized that given the drastic change in the situation of migration flows in Lithuania and the country’s geopolitical situation, it is necessary to invest in the development of new accommodation places, adapt existing facilities and improve the quality of reception conditions for refugees.\n\nOut of 88 social care institutions for children in Lithuania, only five provide social care services for children with disabilities and accommodate about 80 children. The Vija Social Care Centre is already hosting 35 Ukrainian children with disabilities in partially adapted premises. The children are aged between nine months and four years, and they came from an orphanage in the Kharkiv region.\n\nIt is expected that with the help of CEB’s grant additional 30 to 40 places at the Vija Social Centre could be created.\n\nThe signed grant is the second one from the MRF that the CEB has approved to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania to help support refugees from Ukraine. In May 2022, the Bank approved almost €500,000 for the renovation and extension of accommodation facilities of the Refugee Reception Center in the Kaunas region. The implementation of this grant is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, creating 120 accommodation places for refugees.\n\n* * *\n\nMore on CEB’s response to Ukraine refugee crisis: CEB and Ukraine refugees | CEB (coebank.org)\n\nAbout the Migrant and Refugee Fund: Migrant and Refugee Fund (MRF) | CEB (coebank.org)",
    "Lithuania Finishes Building Wall On Belarusian Border To Stem Flow Of Illegal Migrants": "The number of people detained in Russia for protesting against the country's partial military mobilization has risen to nearly 2,500 people across the country, as prominent pro-Kremlin voices have begun questioning the way the draft is being conducted.\n\nOVD-Info, a human rights group that monitors political arrests in Russia, said that 2,353 people had been detained as of September 25, and at least 141 new detentions had been recorded on September 26.\n\nThe highest one-day number of detentions came on September 21, when protests were held in 43 cities immediately after the draft was announced.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's ongoing invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, Russian protests, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.\n\nThe rights group has said that there might be more detainees than those published by police and that it was only reporting names it could verify.\n\nIt was unclear if the latest figures included the detentions of anti-mobilization protesters in the capital of the southern Russian republic of Daghestan on September 25.\n\nCaucasus.Realities reported that police dispersed an unknown number of people who had gathered in Makhachkala to express their anger over the draft.\n\nIn one of multiple videos shared on Telegram capturing the confrontation, a police officer is shown beating a protester as two other officers hold the man down.\n\nOVD-Info said on September 26 that protesters who were detained in Makhachkala were beaten after being taken to a police department in the city's Lenin district, and that officers had refused to provide detainees with water.\n\nThe rights group also quoted a correspondent for the Caucasian Knot website as saying that he was held along with 60 other detainees at an Interior Ministry branch in Makhachkala's Soviet district.\n\nThe correspondent, Murad Muradov, said that \"some of the detainees were forced by the police to sign a protocol, threatening that otherwise they would be given a summons to the military registration and enlistment office.\" In at least one case, Muradov added, \"they carried out their threat.\"\n\nWATCH: Hundreds came out in the North Caucasus region of Daghestan on September 25 to protest against the partial mobilization announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on September 21 in an effort to step up the ongoing war against Ukraine.\n\nThe nationwide demonstrations erupted within hours of President Vladimir Putin announcing the partial military mobilization on September 21, which is intended to buttress Russian military forces fighting in Ukraine.\n\nRussian police have been mobilized in cities where protests were called for by the opposition group Vesna and supporters of opposition politician Aleksei Navalny.\n\nImages on Russian media have shown scenes of police using force against demonstrators, and many young men detained during the protests have reportedly been summoned to register for military service.\n\nIn Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, the Russian-installed leadership said on September 25 that their mobilization would be completed by the end of the day.\n\nThe call-up came as Russian forces suffered significant losses of occupied territories in Ukraine's east owing to a counteroffensive launched by the Ukrainian military. Putin followed up on his mobilization order on September 24 by imposing harsher penalties against Russians who willingly surrendered to Ukrainian forces or refused orders to mobilize.\n\nRussian officials have said that up to 300,000 reserve forces will be called up and that only those with relevant combat and service experience will be drafted to fight. However, Russian media reports have surfaced saying that men who have never been in the military or who are past draft age are being called up, and foreign media have reported that the real goal is to mobilize more than 1 million soldiers, which the Kremlin denies.\n\nWestern officials say that Russia has suffered 70,000 to 80,000 casualties, accounting for both deaths and injuries, since it launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine in February.\n\nThe mobilization to replenish those losses has seen men across Russia sent to register and to reports of Russian citizens attempting to flee the country.\n\nSeveral military enlistment centers and other administrative buildings in the country have been targeted in arson attacks in recent days, and on September 26 a military commissioner was shot by an apparent recruit at an enlistment center in Siberia.\n\nMedia reports say the 25-year-old shooter had been called to report to the office in the city of Ust-Ilimsk for mobilization that day.\n\nThe draft has also led to rare complaints by pro-Kremlin voices.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the state-backed media outlet RT, wrote on her Telegram channel on September 24 that while it had been announced that only people up to the age of 35 would be recruited, \"summonses are going to 40-year-olds.\"\n\n\"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite,\" Simonyan said of the authorities behind the draft.\n\nThe same day, the head of the Russian president's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called on Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to put a halt to the manner with which many draft boards in the country were proceeding.\n\nOn September 25, two of Russia's most senior lawmakers weighed in on the growing controversy.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of Russia's Federation Council, said that she was aware of reports that men who should be ineligible for the draft are being called up.\n\n\"Such excesses are absolutely unacceptable.

Ultimately that wasn’t the case.\n\nLithuania picked up the pace and finished the first half with an 18-6 run, cruising for the rest of the game until the final 87-70 over Bosnia. After this result, Bosnia (2-3) completed its Eurobasket participation without making it to the second round, while Lithuania (2-3) finished fourth in Group B and will play against Spain, the top team of Group A in the Round of 16 in Berlin.\n\nMaris Grigonis set the tone from the first quarter, scoring 14 points of his 16 points in the first eight minutes of the game.

    "Lithuania is turning abandoned spaces into cultural hubs, should we follow suit?": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you notice one, you start spotting them everywhere. Derelict buildings, by their very nature, don’t attract much attention. When walking, my eye tends to rest on places teeming with life: venues with pulsing neon lights, restaurants packed with expectant diners and pubs spilling over with thick-necked beer drinkers. I frequently ignore the countless disused buildings between these places, either by choice or sheer lack of attention.\n\nThousands of boarded-up buildings and abandoned spaces all over the UK serve no purpose other than to haunt passers-by. Though now nameless, these spectres were once beloved nightclubs, busy factories and, occasionally, popular seaside attractions. Living amidst so many unloved places only heightens the prevailing sense that cultural and industrial innovation is a thing of the past. Abandoned spaces are, after all, a reminder of what once was.\n\nBut before things get too doom and gloom, there is another way. Instead of leaving derelict spaces to crumble into dust, we could give them a new lease of life. Lithuania provides a good example of how to do so. Faced with regulatory limitations and discussions over sustainability, several derelict buildings across the country are now being transformed into lively cultural hubs. Empty train stations, old cafes and even a prison have been repurposed to provide the local community with spaces to meet, exchange ideas and enjoy themselves.\n\nOne of the most impressive examples is Nemuno7, located in the town of Zapyškis near Kaunas. This particular venue was once a functioning dredger to deepen the Nemunas River’s riverbed. Unused and abandoned, the environmentally harmful ship was adapted and transformed into a space that currently hosts ecologically-minded interdisciplinary events and performances inspired by the river that churns beneath it.\n\nThen there’s Lukiškės Prison in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. Constructed in 1905, the original building has cells for 421 inmates, many of whom stayed for just a short time before being sent to the gallows or deported to remote labour camps. The prison was the site of Lithuania’s last execution in 1995. It remained open until 2019, ten years after the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported several allegations from prisoners concerning violence inflicted by guards.\n\nThe transformation of this expansive complex into an arts and music venue reminds us that, as well as giving new life to previously beloved institutions, adaptive reuse can also heal past traumas. Buildings are like sponges: they soak up the experiences and memories of those who once inhabited them. These things don’t simply disappear when a building is left to fall apart. They leak out into the community. If a space with a history of incarceration, execution and abuse is left to disintegrate, that pain will continue to impact local people. However, give a space new life, and its history will quickly be absorbed by something new.\n\nBut the benefits of adaptive reuse aren’t all so abstract. As well as offering a place to drink and mingle, cultural hubs create jobs and facilitate collaborations between businesses and young creatives. If put to use effectively (with a focus on deprived areas), this would create a reliable source of revenue and give local people a better quality of life. As Preston Benson said of his organisation’s plans to return a derelict nightclub in Sutton to its former glory, repurposed sites, “bring local businesses, jobs, and lifestyle opportunities to the area, offering a place for the community to enjoy live performances, art classes, and much more”.\n\nIn the UK, we seem to have forgotten that there is a difference between life and good life. Arts venues are essential purveyors of public joy. Yet, all over the country, cultural spaces are shutting up shop at a hitherto unseen rate, their owners now simply unable to keep up with rents and licensing.\n\nRenovated spaces are 16% cheaper on average, often don’t face the same pressure from developers, and are less likely to receive noise complaints. These same factors make them ideal settings for fledgling businesses, which, though initially unstable, always herald the potential of market innovation. Without a real shake-up in how we utilise abandoned spaces, our cities could become very difficult places to live. I wonder if it’s about time we learned to live with our ghosts.\n\nFollow Far Out Magazine across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

    "Ukrainians throw huge rave in Lithuania to celebrate Independence Day": "On August 24, Ukrainians marked 31 years of independence from the Soviet Union with a huge rave in the neighbouring Lithuanian capital Vilnius.\n\nThe rave took place near the River Neris in Vilnius last week, VICE reports, with organisers fearing for the safety of attendees if it went ahead in Kyiv as Russian troops continue to occupy the surrounding areas.\n\nThe rave marked the official Ukrainian Independence Day, which also coincided last week with six months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRead this next: Ukrainian volunteers organise \"clean-up raves\" to rebuild war-torn areas\n\nSome of the country’s biggest DJs grouped together to perform the all-day rave including Ukraine’s ARTBAT, Miss Monique, and 8Kays who performed sets for thousands of revellers.\n\nThough the party was free, attendees were asked to donate to Ukrainian humanitarian support funds through Music Saves UA while the Russian-Ukrainian war is ongoing. As it stands, around 62,000 Ukrainians are currently housed in Lithuania after migrating across the border, with a further 15,000 already living in the country.\n\nThousands flocked to the all-day rave last week, which garnered support from Lithuanian officials including Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine’s Minister for Culture.\n\nRead this next: How Ukrainian clubs and collectives are aiding the war effort\n\nSpeaking to VICE, Ukrainian MP and head of the youth wing for Zalenskyy’s party, Oleksandr Sanchenko, said: “Ukrainian Independence Day is especially important and symbolic to celebrate in such difficult and challenging times.\n\n“But since organising it here in Ukraine is not an option, we started looking for an alternative location in Eastern Europe. And we’re blessed to have a lot of friends and supporters in Lithuania, who agreed to help us with this. Vilnius, as the capital of Lithuania, is the most obvious choice.”\n\n“Rave is a synonym for youth, as we see it. We want to celebrate our Independence Day in modern fashion and to make it especially exciting for the people that will attend it,” he added.\n\nGemma Ross is Mixmag's Editorial Assistant, follow her on Twitter",

    "Lithuania: Discriminatory detention practices compound people’s trauma - Lithuania": "The mental health of vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers is sharply deteriorating due to prolonged detention in Lithuania, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said today. The flawed migration practices and legal processes of the Lithuanian authorities discriminate against people of certain nationalities, who are being held in continued detention. MSF denounces prolonged detention and systemic discrimination in Lithuania, and is calling for the immediate implementation of humane alternatives that equitably meet the needs of vulnerable and traumatized people.\n\n“Many of the people detained have survived deeply traumatic experiences,” said Georgina Brown, MSF country manager in Lithuania. “But, instead of responding to their needs, the Lithuanian authorities are worsening their mental suffering by detaining them and holding them in limbo. These men, women, and children are uncertain of their future, terrified of being forcibly returned to the danger they have fled, and imprisoned without freedom, autonomy, or adequate protection. People’s resilience will diminish, and their suffering will only grow exponentially. Appallingly, we know that some nationalities are more likely to have this detention extended than others, creating a hierarchy of suffering that the Lithuanian authorities should be deeply ashamed of.”\n\nApproximately 700 people are detained in Kybartai, Pabrade, Rukla, and Naujininkai Foreigner Registration Centers (FRCs) in Lithuania, after having crossed the border from Belarus in 2021. Many of them have severe vulnerabilities and have experienced highly traumatizing events. Detention only compounds people’s suffering.\n\nMSF has seen that certain nationalities are significantly more likely to have their detention extended, remain detained after their detention order has expired, or have the limited freedom of movement they may have been granted revoked. For example, out of 184 people being held in Kybartai FRC during August 2022, Nigerians make up 16 percent of the total population, but 28 percent of the 65 people who had their detention extended. Six percent of detainees are Indian, but 15 percent of the 65 who have had their detention extension are Indian. Additionally, Russian and Belarusian asylum seekers who recently arrived in the FRC were not subject to detention at all, and have all been granted limited freedom of movement.\n\nSince January 2022, MSF has provided mental health care to people detained in Lithuania. Our teams also provided primary health care until May 2022. However, mental health support cannot address the root cause of people’s suffering. Between January and March 2022, more than 70 percent of patients highlighted detention as the main cause of their need for support.\n\n“I am so desperate, I tried to hurt myself because I want to [get] out from this prison,” a man detained in an FRC in Lithuania told MSF. “Many times, I really decided to be ready to kill myself. You are hurting, you are embarrassed, you are abused. And so, this is prison. I was desperate. I was so depressed. But I can’t because we need more courage. I am not too broken.”\n\nMSF sees this distress echoed in other FRCs across Lithuania, including some where data is almost impossible to gather. We are receiving numerous reports from some of the FRCs that some nationalities, including Nigerians and Congolese, are more likely than others to be subject to discriminatory migration practices. These include continued detention after the expiration of their detention order without a court-issued extension, and having their limited freedom of movement revoked, returning them to detention.\n\nAround the world, MSF has seen how hostile migration policies and practices—such as arbitrary and prolonged detention—deny people their rights to seek safety and compound their distress. MSF is calling for the practice of prolonged and extended detention to end immediately, and for the implementation of an equitable asylum system that respects the dignity, health, and human rights of all people seeking safety in Lithuania.",

    "Lithuanian parlt speaker pays homage to victims of Communist, Nazi regimes": "VILNIUS – Lithuanian Seimas Speaker Viktorija Cmilyte-Nielsen, currently on a visit to the United States, has paid homage to the victims of Communist and Nazi regimes.\n\nDuring a discussion that took place at the Victims of Communism Museum in Washington on Monday, she stated that this place was not just a memorial to victims of a traumatizing regime and evidence of crimes against millions of people but also “a reminder that Communism, unfortunately, still exists and its ideology is resurrecting in a new form”.\n\n“While weaning off dependence on Russian gas, oil and electricity, we should also distance ourselves from Russia’s narrative of the European 20th century history, including the causes and consequences of WWII. This narrative, which is full of unfounded accusations, a cynical and arrogant approach, is used by the Kremlin in its attempts to justify its aggression against neighboring countries,” the parliamentary speaker’s press service quoted her as saying.\n\n“It is therefore important to make the assessment of crimes committed by the totalitarian Communist regime an integral part of political agenda of the Western world as its fight against disinformation and a hybrid war,” Cmilyte-Nielsen said.\n\nWhile visiting the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Lithuanian parliamentary speaker lit a memorial candle to pay homage, inter alia, “to the tragic fate of Lithuanian Jews, which we remember each year on September 23”, the National Memorial Day for the Genocide of Lithuanian Jews.\n\n“Holocaust is not just Paneriai, the 9th Fort of the Kaunas Fortress or another site of mass massacre of Jews. Holocaust is a painful loss of Jews who lived in Lithuania, Lithuanian citizens who not just cherished their traditions and culture but also contributed to the creation of our state,” Cmilyte-Nielsen said.\n\nOn Monday, she also met with Luke Coffey, senior fellow at Hudson Institute, and took part in a discussion about Europe in the face of the war and about Lithuania’s prospects.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Lithuanian Seimas speaker is scheduled to meet with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.
