    "Sudanese head north to Egypt seeking brighter future": "Summary Young job seekers, families among those leaving\n\nEgypt a cheaper, easier option than the Gulf\n\nEconomic activity has stalled since military coup\n\nKHARTOUM, Sept 26 (Reuters) - At downtown Khartoum's al-Souq al-Arabi, travel agencies helping young Sudanese seek a brighter economic future in Egypt are replacing once-packed hardware stores in a corner of the capital's main commercial hub.\n\nThe exodus reflects growing despondence over prospects at home, where the economy has been in free fall and the U.N. says food shortages affect a third of the population. Power and water cuts are common. Anti-army protests have rocked the streets since a coup a year ago.\n\nFollowing the military takeover, which toppled a civilian-led government that had promised a new economic dawn, the number of those leaving has accelerated, travel agents and migrants say.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEgypt, already home to a Sudanese community estimated at 4 million, offers few of the lucrative jobs that Sudanese migrants have traditionally sought in the Gulf, but it is an easier and often more familiar destination.\n\nAnd while some do travel onward on treacherous Mediterranean trips to Europe, Egypt has notable advantages.\n\nYoung Sudanese can travel there cheaply and hunt for work, while families seek healthcare, education for their children and a stable life.\n\n\"All us young people want to build a future, but you can't do that here,\" said Munzir Mohamed, a 21-year-old trying to book a bus trip to Egypt at one of the travel agencies.\n\nThe owner of a Khartoum bus company said as many as 30 buses were taking around 1,500 passengers to Egypt from Sudan daily, which he said was up 50% from last year, despite sharp ticket price increases. Two travel agents estimated the number of young men seeking to make the journey had doubled in the last year.\n\nThere are no publicly available figures to show recent migration trends from Sudan to Egypt. But an Egyptian diplomat said numbers travelling had been on the rise since 2019, when an uprising led to the overthrow of former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.\n\n\"Movement of Sudanese people into Egypt has been increasing ... gradually and proportional to the deterioration of the situation in Sudan,\" he said.\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nIn al-Souq al-Arabi, labourers, electricians, and others who would typically be at building sites idle away the time drinking tea and playing board games while they wait for work.\n\n\"We used to hope for five minutes to take a seat. Now I'm sat here all day,\" said the owner of one hardware store still operating in the market.\n\nMuch of the paltry income that shopkeepers and stall-holders can still make goes to higher taxes, dues, and license fees introduced by a government that lost billions in external economic support after the coup, they say.\n\nThe finance minister, Jibril Ibrahim, said on Sunday the country would rely on its own internal resources for a second year to fund the budget, despite the government struggling to provide basic services.\n\nTaxes and fees have risen by 400% or more in some instances, business owners say.\n\n1/6 People wait for the a before leaving to Egypt in Khartoum, Sudan September 24, 2022.

Further closures are due in the city of El Obeid this week. The government, with no new prime minister appointed since the coup, is juggling strikes by electricity and sewage workers as well as trainee doctors over low wages.\n\nThe finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOfficial inflation has eased from a high of 423% last year to 117% in August, which businessmen and analysts say reflects economic stagnation. It is still one of the highest rates globally.\n\nThe Sudanese pound depreciated by 950% over the past four years, while fuel, once subsidized, has become more expensive than in many wealthier countries.\n\nBusiness owners say most people can no longer afford much beyond basic goods, causing traders and factories to slow down or close up shop.\n\nThat may push more people to leave.

But they have a community to lean on, and can earn more than at home.\n\n\"My whole family in Sudan worked and we still weren't making much, and it would all go towards food,\" said 23-year-old Malaz Abbakar, who moved to Egypt two years ago.\n\nNow, she says, she's able to send her family up to 120,000 Sudanese pounds ($208) per month working as a babysitter.\n\nStores selling Sudanese foods have cropped up in Cairo, private schools advertise Egyptian branches on billboards in Khartoum, and many travel to Egypt for healthcare that's become expensive or unavailable back home.\n\nFor some, like 23-year-old Adam from war-stricken Darfur, Egypt is a stopover before the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe.\n\n\"It's dangerous but it's better to risk it and have a good life than to suffer in poverty and hopelessness,\" he said as he queued for a visa at the Egyptian consulate in Khartoum, along with dozens of other would-be migrants.\n\n($1 = 578.00 Sudanese pounds)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nAdditional reporting by Eltayeb Siddig and Hadeer Mahmoud; writing by Nafisa Eltahir; editing by Aidan Lewis and Frank Jack Daniel\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Poverty and Inflation: Egypt's Economy Hit by Global Turmoil": "Stores are selling winter clothes from last season in the middle of summer. Repair shops lack spare parts for appliances. There's a waiting list to buy a new car.\n\nEgypt, a country of more than 103 million people, is running low on foreign currency needed to buy essentials like grain and fuel. To keep U.S. dollars in the country, the government has tightened imports, meaning fewer new cars and summer dresses.\n\nFor the nearly third of Egyptians living in poverty, and the millions more in poor conditions, the country's economic woes mean life is much harder than off-season shopping — they're finding it harder to put food on the table. A decade after deadly protests and political upheaval rocked the Middle East’s most populous nation, the economy is still staggering and has taken new hits.\n\nFatima, a 32-year-old cleaner in Cairo, says her family stopped buying red meat five months ago. Chicken also has become a luxury. She's borrowing from relatives to make ends meet.\n\nShe's worried about the impact of high prices on Egypt's social fabric. Asking to be identified only by her first name for fear of reprisal, she worries that crime and theft will increase “because people won’t have enough money to feed themselves.”\n\nFor decades, most Egyptians have depended on the government to keep basic goods affordable, but that social contract is under pressure due to the impact from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Egypt has sought loans to pay for grain imports for state-subsidized bread. It's also grappling with surging consumer prices as the currency drops in value. The threat of food insecurity in the world’s largest importer of wheat, 80% of which comes from the war-torn Black Sea region, has raised concerns.\n\n“In terms of, like, bread in exchange for freedom, that contract got violated a long time ago,” said Timothy Kaldas, an economic expert at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.\n\nAnnual inflation climbed to 15.3% in August, compared with just over 6% in the same month last year. The Egyptian pound recently hit a record low against a strengthening U.S. dollar, selling at 19.5 pounds to $1. That has widened trade and budget deficits as foreign reserves needed to buy grain and fuel plunged by nearly 10% in March, shortly after Russia's invasion sent commodity prices soaring and investors pulled billions of dollars from Egypt.\n\nEgypt has few options to deal with the hole in its finances. As with previous crises, it's turned to Gulf Arab allies and the International Monetary Fund for a bailout.\n\nA new IMF loan would buoy Egypt’s dwindling foreign reserves, which have fallen to $33 billion from $41 billion in February. A new loan, however, will add to Egypt’s ballooning foreign debt, which climbed from $37 billion in 2010 — before the Arab Spring uprisings — to $158 billion as of March, according to Egyptian central bank figures.\n\nLeaders blame the challenges on the coronavirus pandemic, which hurt the vital tourism industry, and price shocks sparked by the war in Ukraine. They've also faulted revolutionaries and those who may have backed the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\n“Why don't you want to pay the cost of what you did in 2011 and 2013?\" President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in televised remarks this month. “What you did — didn't that negatively impact the economy?\"\n\nHe was referring to protests, which toppled Egypt's longtime president, ushered in a divisive Muslim Brotherhood presidency, and resulted in a populist-backed power grab by the military and el-Sissi's ascension to the presidency.\n\nThe former military general said the fallout from those years cost Egypt $450 billion — a price, he said, everyone must bear.\n\n“We solve the matter together. I am saying this to all Egyptians ... we are going to finish this matter together and pay its price together,\" he said.\n\nCritics, however, argue the government has squandered chances to make real reforms and is overspending on superfluous mega-projects as it builds a new administrative capital. The government has touted the construction boom as a job producer and economic engine.\n\nThe state's hold over the economy and the “outsized role of military-related enterprises” have historically crowded out foreign investors and the private sector, said Hasnain Malik, who heads equity research at Tellimer, an emerging-markets investment analysis firm. The government's plans to sell off minority stakes in some state-owned enterprises “does not necessarily fix this problem,\" he said.\n\nEgypt's elite can withstand rising costs, living comfortably in Nile-view apartments and gated communities beyond the hustle of Cairo. Life for middle-class Egyptians is deteriorating, said Maha, a 38-year-old tech company employee and mother of two who asked to only be identified by her first name to speak freely.\n\n“I think we will eventually move down the social ladder and end up below the poverty line,\" she said.\n\nThe government took out a $500 million loan from the World Bank this summer and $221 million from the African Development Bank to help buy wheat. That covers around six weeks of a bread subsidy program supporting 70 million low-income Egyptians.\n\nChina assisted with a $2.8 billion currency swap. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar stepped in with pledges of $22 billion in short-term deposits and investments.\n\n“Having what they define as stability in Egypt is in their strategic interests. They really don’t want to go through a repeat of 2011 and its aftermath,” said David Butter, an associate fellow at international affairs think tank Chatham House. Gulf Arab states are also making strategic investments in Egypt for the short and long-term, he said.\n\nThe government announced an “extraordinary” social protection program to roll out this month, targeting 9 million families with extended cash transfers and food coupons. This is on top of other assistance programs, including pop-up stands selling subsidized food staples. Officials point to how they managed the supply crunch brought on by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, saying there is enough wheat and other basic food items for six months.\n\nFor some, leaving has promised more hope. Egyptians rank behind only Afghans as the top nationality of “irregular arrivals” to Europe so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration’s flow chart. Most arrive by sea.\n\nAs pressure mounts on the Egyptian pound, the government could devalue the currency again.\n\n“It’s going to hurt. It’s going to increase inflation,” said Kaldas, the Tahrir Institute economic expert. “Subsidies on bread is only one line-item in a family’s budget. So, for a lot of families, this is still going to be a lot of pain.”",

    "Egyptian cleric revered by Muslim Brotherhood dies at 96": "Youssef al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian cleric seen as the spiritual leader of the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood, has died at the age of 96\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- Youssef al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian cleric who was seen as the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and became the Islamist “voice of revolution” during the popular uprisings around the Arab world more than a decade ago, died Monday at the age of 96.\n\nAl-Qaradawi, whose death was reported on his official website, was central in shaping the Brotherhood’s ideology in the 1990s and 2000s of using democratic means to achieve their goal of Islamic rule in Egypt and other nations. His critics accused him — and the Brotherhood — of hiding extremism behind moderate rhetoric.\n\nThat ideology was tested on the ground in the Arab Spring revolts of 2011, when Egypt’s longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak was ousted — and ended disastrously.\n\nThe Brotherhood came to power in subsequent elections, the freest ever held in Egypt. But Brotherhood moves fueled opponents’ fears that the group aimed to monopolize power. After giant protests, the army ousted the Brotherhood in 2013 and crushed it in a bloody crackdown. The ensuing rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has been criticized by rights groups as more autocratic than Mubarak’s.\n\nAl-Qaradawi died in the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar, where he had been living in exile for decades and was supported by the ruling family. In 2013, he was tried and sentenced to death in absentia in Egypt.\n\nAl-Qaradawi’s high point came in February 2011, days after Mubarak’s ouster. He made a triumphant return to Egypt and gave a speech to a gigantic crowd in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the anti-Mubarak protests.\n\n“The revolution is not over until we have a new Egypt,” he said, calling for a purging of Mubarak-era corruption and urging Copts and Muslims to remain united as they had been during protests.\n\nIt was a speech that avoided strong shows of Islamist or Brotherhood rhetoric. Still, many secular pro-democracy advocates saw his appearance in the square as symbolizing Islamists’ moves to dominate the uprising and claim it in their own name.\n\nAl-Qaradawi had been in the public eye since the 1990s as a pioneer among Muslim clerics of using then-newly emerging satellite TV to project their voice regionwide.\n\nHe had a popular talk show on the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera network called “Shariah and Life,” in which he took calls from across the Muslim world and offered advice on everything from mundane aspects of daily life to controversial political issues. He presented himself as an international, independent alternative to leading Muslim clerics in Arab countries who were usually dominated by their governments — though critics accused him of being a tool of Qatar.\n\nHe supported suicide bombings and other attacks by Palestinians against Israel. He also voiced support for the Iraqi insurgency against the U.S. presence in Iraq after the 2003 invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nHe had strongly criticized the U.S.-led invasion, calling on all Muslim nations at the time to prepare to fight the Americans there “if the Iraqis fail to drive them out.”\n\n“By opening our ports, our airports and our land, we are participating in the war,” al-Qaradawi said in a pointed critique of U.S.-allied Arab governments. “We will be cursed by history because we have helped the Americans.” Notably, Qatar hosts American troops and now serves as the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command.\n\nBut al-Qaradawi described his own thought as “al-wasatiya,” meaning a middle path — conservative but not rigid or extremist, as he depicted it. That earned him many admirers across the Arab and Islamic world, even among some liberals.\n\nHe was sharply critical of Arab regimes but said he opposed violence in overthrowing them, to distinguish himself from radical organizations like al-Qaida — though he was often reluctant to outright condemn militant groups.\n\nThroughout, he was close to the Brotherhood.\n\nAl-Qaradawi was born on Sept. 9, 1926 in a small village in Egypt’s Nile Delta. He studied at Egypt’s Al-Azhar University, the leading center of Sunni Muslim scholarship, and became involved with the Brotherhood.\n\nHe fled to Qatar in the early 1960s, when then-president Gamal Abdel Nasser waged a fierce crackdown on the group. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2005 published by WikiLeaks said Qatar, a strong backer of the Brotherhood, gave al-Qaradawi “substantial properties\" and income.\n\nWhen the wave of “Arab Spring” protests began in late 2010 in Tunisia and intensified in 2011, al-Qaradawi threw his support behind them, criticizing clerics who called for obedience to rulers.\n\nHe raised controversy by calling for the killing of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and by backing NATO’s intervention in Libya in 2011 in support of rebels. Gadhafi was eventually ousted and killed.\n\nAl-Qaradawi also painted the civil war in Syria in starkly sectarian terms, despite his past call for better Sunni-Shiite relations. In a 2013 speech, he said Shiites — Iran and Hezbollah backing President Bashar Assad — were waging a “war against Islam and the Sunnah.” He urged “all those capable of Jihad and fighting” to travel to Syria — seen as encouraging young Muslims to join militant groups in Syria.\n\nIn Egypt, al-Qaradawi threw his weight fully behind the Brotherhood-led government, headed by a veteran of the group, Mohammed Morsi. He called Morsi’s election “a victory for the revolution” and said he would achieve “justice, freedom and human dignity.”\n\nAs opposition to Morsi and the Brotherhood swelled, he said protests against them were forbidden, insisting Morsi was the “legitimate” ruler and that the people should obey him. Al-Qaradawi's son, Abdel-Rahman, criticized his backing of Morsi.\n\nThe military’s ouster of the government was followed by a crackdown in which hundreds of Brotherhood members were killed and thousands arrested.\n\nEgypt banned the Brotherhood as a terrorist group. Ahmed Mussa, a prominent pro-government TV host, called al-Qaradawi “the biggest inciter of terrorism” and blamed him for attacks inside Egypt. Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates included al-Qaradawi on a list of dozens of organizations and individuals sanctioned for alleged terrorism in 2017 as part of a diplomatic dispute with Qatar.\n\n———\n\nKrauss reported from Ottawa, Ontario; Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.",
    "Egypt’s mysteries, surprises provide powerful pull": "When Richard Redding was a child, he said, he would drive his mother crazy by going out in the woods and bringing back bones he would find in the wild.\n\nIn many ways, Redding remains that young boy collecting bones, but instead of the woods, he does much of his work in the history-rich and largely mysterious land of Egypt.\n\nRedding, associate research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, has spent nearly every winter for about 30 years in Egypt, where he and colleague Mark Lehner operate the largest dig at the Great Pyramid through the nonprofit Ancient Egyptian Research Association.\n\n“Every time I go there I learn something new,” Redding said. “It’s just a constant puzzle. You’re working with one of the world’s biggest jigsaw puzzles. That’s why I keep getting drawn back there.”\n\nRichard Redding, associate research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, is shown at the Valley Temple of Menkaure in Egypt. Redding has spent nearly every winter in the country for about 30 years uncovering the mysteries of the Old Kingdom. (Photo by Sayed Salah)\n\nRedding first discovered a love for archaeology as an undergraduate chemistry major at U-M. He took an archaeology course, which he enjoyed, and his professor encouraged him to go to the Museum of Anthropology to further explore the field.\n\nThere he found a drawer full of animal bones from an archaeological site.\n\n“There weren’t that many people who were interested in these archaeological faunal remains, so I just took off from there,” he said. “Just looking at the drawer and saying, ‘Wow, this is it.’”\n\nRedding took to the field immediately. Before his senior year, he worked for nine months in Iran before coming back to U-M to complete his degree in geology, anthropology and biological sciences.\n\nHe had planned to complete his Ph.D. thesis in Iran, but the Iranian revolution of 1979 changed that.\n\n“In 1981, a colleague of mine, who was also in Iran, asked me if I wanted to go to Egypt with him,” he said. “I went there, and it was a really nice project near the Fayyum Desert.”\n\nHe basically never left, and it’s not the allure of the pyramids, tombs and monuments that brings him back. He’s primarily interested in evolutionary ecology and how animals and people interacted in the Old Kingdom, commonly referred to as the Age of the Pyramids from about 2700-2200 B.C.\n\nDigging for and examining bones to learn more about that interaction takes him back to that drawer at the anthropology museum.\n\n“We end up with big bags of fragmented and smashed-to-crap bone,” he said. “You go through it and identify what you can. Over the years you pick up the ability, and when you see it over and over again you can identify what bone it is and what animal it came from.”\n\nHis primary focus since the late 1980s has been at Kom el-Hisn, a Nile Delta site noted for being the first one excavated where people lived in the Old Kingdom. This production site provided important detail in understanding how that ancient economy functioned.\n\nNot long after first breaking ground at Kom el-Hisn, Lehner invited Redding to join him in the shadows of the pyramids of Giza to help uncover a site where people lived in the region. They discovered Heit el-Ghurab, a worker’s village about the size of 10 football fields.\n\nClick on this map of the Heit el-Ghurab site to view what Richard Redding and colleague Mark Lehner have uncovered.\n\n“It’s got barracks, bakeries, sites for preparing copper, a corral for animals,” he said. “They would have 6,000 people a year living on this site, and their total job was constructing the pyramids.”\n\nThirty years later, Redding and Lehner continue to shed light on the many mysteries surrounding ancient Egypt. One of his three ongoing projects has drawn the attention of National Geographic, which has featured Redding and his work many times over the years.\n\nIn Heit el-Ghurab, Redding and Lehner have unearthed a portion of the Royal Administrative Building, which they believe to be an old palace. They were only able to uncover it up to the boundaries of a soccer field that had been constructed atop the ancient structure. After lengthy negotiations, the Ministry of Youth and Sport turned the soccer field over to the Ministry of Antiquities, allowing Redding and Lehner to continue their work.\n\n“We haven’t excavated it all, but we’ve uncovered it to the top of the walls and mapped it,” he said. “It would be great if it were a palace.”\n\nThat type of uncertainty and mystery captivates Redding, who shares his passion for the region with U-M alumni he leads on tours each winter he’s there. Most visitors are content to stare at the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, but Redding encourages them to take in everything.\n\nNOMINATE A SPOTLIGHT The weekly Spotlight features faculty and staff members at the university. To nominate a candidate, email the Record staff at urecord@umich.edu.\n\n“I always start out at the pyramids because they’re totally awed by them,” he said. “But then I tell them, ‘Look around you.’ There are tons of tombs, and I take them down to our site usually.\n\n“There are all these big stone monuments, but it’s almost like the ocean. You see the top of it and you’re just amazed by the vastness of it, but what goes on underneath is just phenomenal.”\n\nRedding is heading back to Egypt in October for about two months to continue to unearth the Heit el-Ghurab site with National Geographic crews alongside. And it’s pretty likely he’ll make a discovery he did not expect.\n\n“There’s just so much going on there, it’s phenomenal to just walk around,” he said. “Whenever I’m there, I always take one or two days and just walk and there’s always something new and surprising.\n\n“My wife keeps saying, ‘You’re never retiring.’ I’ll just keep going until I can’t anymore.”\n\nQ&A\n\nWhat memorable moment in the workplace stands out?\n\nMy thesis defense in 1981.\n\nWhat can’t you live without?\n\nFieldwork.\n\nName your favorite spot on campus.\n\nThe collection of large rock specimens in front of 1100 North University.

    "Egypt’s Foreign Minister calls for improved climate commitments at COP27": "In his speech to the high-level segment of the UN General Assembly, Sameh Hassan Shoukry Selim said that the world is at a delicate historical moment of increased polarization, at which serious action, and a commitment to multilateralism, are needed.\n\nThe fault lies, he said, not in the UN system, but in the failure of Member States to respect the Organization. He called for States to reinvigorate and reform it, and urged them not to leave the process incomplete, so the UN can better respond to challenges and meet the goals of the people.\n\nOn the Ukrainian invasion of Russia, Mr. Selim warned that this has exacerbated the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an increased burden for developing countries, especial in terms of growing public deficits.\n\nRespect sovereignty\n\nThere is a need, he said, for developed countries to convert the debt they hold into joint investment projects, which would “create more job opportunities and contribute to positive economic growth.”\n\nThere must be an international consensus, said Mr. Selim, without threats to countries, or the undermining of sovereignty. Current challenges, he continued, threaten the very notion of nation-states, leading to a lack of respect, and the weakening of State entities, which allows non-State terrorists to control the destiny of nations.\n\nSupport for global food security\n\nThe food crisis faced by Africa, claimed Mr. Selim, is the consequences of many years in which there has been a failure to hit the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to hunger and food security.\n\nWith one in five Africans at risk of hunger, and the Continent a net importer of food, declared Mr. Selim, the crisis needs to be addressed through an international strategy that tackles its root causes.\n\nSolutions include the implementation of sustainable farming and food systems that meet the needs of people in food importing African countries whose products, he declared, must allowed to be a part of the global supply chain without hindrance.\n\nMr. Selim offered Egypt’s support in the creation of an international hub in the country, for the storing, supplying, and trading of grain, to guarantee global food security.\n\nDeveloping countries ‘most deserving of our support’\n\nTurning to the climate crisis, Mr. Selim noted that Egypt will take on the presidency of the COP27 UN Climate Conference, which will be held in the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh this November.\n\nHe appealed to all members of the international community to act on the pledges and commitments of support for developing countries, to cope with the devastation impacts of the emergency. “They are the most deserving of our support,” he said.\n\nThe Minister looked forward to the Conference reaching outcomes that will contribute to a reduction in emissions, and enhanced mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage commitments. He reminded the audience that finance for adaptation needs to be doubled, that the $100 billion promised for climate finance annually must be duly delivered, and that there must be a just transition to renewable energy.\n\nThe implementation of the 2015 Paris climate accord would demonstrate, said Mr. Selim, that climate action remains an important priority on the global scene, despite the challenges facing the world.\n\nNile ‘always part of Egypt’s history’\n\nOn water security, Mr. Selim described the issue as one of those challenges, especially for Middle East and African countries. Many of those countries, he explained, are dry and arid, but the grave human suffering resulting from water shortages, he claimed, is often due to a lack of respect for international law, with some countries monopolizing water resources, to the detriment of nations downstream.\n\nWith regards to the Nile, Mr. Selima declared that, whilst Egypt recognizes the right of the Ethiopian people to development, this will never mean that the country lets go of the right of Egyptians to the river’s water, which has, he said, always been part of Egypt’s history.\n\nA legally binding agreement regarding the functioning of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam must be reached, said the Minister, in line with an agreement reached by Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan in 2015, and a 2021 Security Council resolution. He called on all three States to respect their obligations in deeds, not word.\n\n",
    "Egypt celebrates 200 years of decoding ancient hieroglyphs": "A rubbing of Rosetta Stone Photo: VCG\n\nMarking the decoding of ancient hieroglyphs and the founding of Egyptology 200 years ago, a series of events are being organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC) in Cairo wrapped up its two-day program last weekend for teaching children about the Ancient Egyptian language via sculpture and buff paints workshops.Sama Ahmad, a 10-year-old student from Egypt, joined the interactive classes and portrayed some symbols of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the formal writing system used in ancient Egypt.\"I was happy to learn about old letters and to listen to information about the Rosetta Stone,\" she said while showing a paper carrying her name in the ancient language.The ministry also launched a social media campaign to explain hieroglyphs as well as to display artifacts that are key to understanding ancient Egyptian civilization under the titles \"Ancient Egyptian language,\" and \"Learn about treasures in your province.\"The Rosetta Stone is one of the main keys that helped to decipher the ancient Egyptian language and is the genesis of Egyptology.On display at the British Museum, the granodiorite block was discovered in 1799 in the Nile delta town of Rosetta (Rashid in Arabic) by the occupying French forces. Later it fell into the hands of British officials and was sent to London.On September 27, 1822, French scholar Jean-Francois Champollion was able to unravel the mystery of the stone and read the ancient Egyptian signs correctly after decades of attempts by scholars and researchers.The stone dates back to 196 BC, when the syndicate of Egyptian priests gave a congratulatory speech to King Ptolemy V for assuming the throne of Egypt, thanking him for exempting all Egyptian temples from taxes due to a low flood.Now the replica of the stone is fixed at the entrance lobby of the NMEC, which is inscribed in three languages: hieroglyphic, demotic and ancient Greek.\"Visitors coming from the gate of the museum can spot it from a far distance till approaching it and reading the label underneath,\" said Sayed Fadel, supervisor of scenario display of the NMEC.The 200 anniversary of the creation of Egyptology is a good occasion for displaying the block, added Fadel, as he further stressed \"thanks to decoding the stone, we managed to read texts, paintings and inscriptions on Egyptian temples that narrate the old history of Egypt.\"He explained that the stone exhibited in London is one of six others that were placed in front of main Egyptian temples, but the other five have not been discovered yet.Emili Jones, a 32-year-old tourist from Canada, was curious about the stone. She told the Xinhua News Agency that \"the stone is a treasure of knowledge for exploring and digging into the mysterious history of Ancient Egypt.\"Xinhua",
    "Egypt: Human rights crisis deepens one year after national human rights strategy launched": "Authorities in Egypt have shown no genuine will to acknowledge, let alone address, the country’s deep-rooted human rights crisis despite launching a National Human Rights Strategy one year ago. Instead, they have continued to stifle freedoms and commit crimes under international law in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), said Amnesty International today.\n\nIn a new report “Disconnected from Reality”: Egypt’s National Human Rights Strategy covers up human rights crisis, Amnesty International presents a detailed analysis of the strategy in light of the human rights situation on the ground, revealing how authorities have used it as a propaganda tool to conceal ever growing repression of any form of dissent ahead of COP27 in November 2022.\n\n“Egyptian authorities have created the National Human Rights Strategy as a shiny cover-up to their unrelenting violations of human rights, thinking they would fool the world ahead of COP27. But the grim reality of their notorious human rights record cannot be rebranded in a PR stunt,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.\n\n“The international community must not be deceived by Egypt’s attempts to conceal the magnitude of the human rights crisis in the country. It must instead put pressure on the Egyptian authorities in public and in private, to take meaningful steps to end the cycle of abuse and impunity, starting by releasing the thousands of critics and opponents arbitrarily detained in Egyptian jails, easing their grip of civil society and allowing peaceful protests.”\n\nAmnesty International’s new report is based on extensive documentation of patterns of human rights violations committed in Egypt since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power, as well as information gathered since the launch of the National Human Rights Strategy (NHRS) from multiple sources, including victims, witnesses, human rights defenders and lawyers. The organization also reviewed official documents, audio-visual evidence, and reports by UN bodies among others. Findings and recommendations were shared with the Egyptian authorities on 7 September 2022.\n\n©Andeel, licensed from the first publisher Mada Masr Illustration depicting the surrealism of Egypt’s cover-up of human rights crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nA misleading picture\n\nSince the launch of the NHRS, the Egyptian authorities have repeatedly referred to it in public and in private meetings with other governments as evidence of their commitment to human rights. The five-year strategy was drafted by the government without any consultation with independent human rights organizations or public engagement and presented a deeply misleading picture of the human rights crisis in Egypt. It absolves the authorities of any responsibility by blaming security threats, economic challenges and Egyptian citizens themselves for “failing to understand” and exercise their rights.\n\nThe strategy lauds the constitutional and legal framework, while ignoring the authorities’ introduction and application of a series of repressive laws that effectively criminalize or severely restrict the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. These laws further eroded guarantees of fair trial, and entrenched impunity for security and military forces.\n\nThe strategy also ignores the authorities’ dismal record since July 2013 of cracking down on dissent, with thousands still arbitrarily detained or unjustly prosecuted. In the past two years alone, dozens have died in prison following deliberate denial of healthcare and detention in cruel and inhuman conditions.\n\nIn recent months, in a positive but very limited step, dozens of prisoners of conscience and others held for political reasons have been released. However, the authorities continue to arbitrarily arrest scores of other critics and opponents, while many of those released are banned from travel.\n\nSince 2013, authorities have also censored hundreds of websites, raided and closed independent media outlets and detained dozens of journalists for expressing critical views or simply doing their jobs.\n\nThe NHRS praises the State’s commitment to “the principles of equality and non-discrimination” and lists some initiatives by official bodies. Amnesty International has found that authorities continue to subject men, women and children to human rights violations on the basis of their sex, gender identity, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.\n\n“No strategy will protect our right to freedom of expression or achieve peaceful coexistence of people unless it frees all the people who are imprisoned because of their opinion, because of ideas they expressed and because they had a different narrative than that imposed by the State,” said prominent human rights activist Mona Seif to Amnesty International. Her brother Alaa Abdelfattah has been arbitrarily imprisoned for the majority of Egyptian President Abel Fattah al-Sisi’s rule.\n\nThe NHRS overplays the government’s self-declared achievements on socio-economic rights that are in sharp contrast not only with the authorities’ failure to progressively realize these rights, but also with their unrelenting attacks on those expressing their socio-economic grievances, including workers, medical professionals and residents of informal settlements.\n\nOverall, the NHRS also overstates constitutional and legal guarantees but fails to explain how these are not in line with Egypt’s international obligations or how they are widely flouted in practice. It completely overlooks patterns of ongoing or past human rights violations and ignores the role of security forces, prosecutors and judges, in committing or facilitating human rights violations.\n\nAmnesty International welcomes some of the NHRS modest recommendations, presented as “target results”, including the review of crimes punishable by the death penalty and alternatives to pretrial detention as well as the introduction of comprehensive legislation to combat violence against women. However, overall its “target results” don’t begin to address the scale of the human rights and impunity crisis in the country. Meaningful advancement of human rights in Egypt must start with authorities releasing the thousands of people arbitrarily detained for peacefully exercising their human rights. All politically motivated criminal investigations against human rights defenders must be closed and all travel bans, asset freezes and other restrictions must be lifted. Criminal investigations into crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by security forces must be initiated, with the view to bringing those responsible to justice. These include unlawful killings of hundreds of protestors and extrajudicial executions, torture, and enforced disappearances.\n\n“President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi must acknowledge the depth of the human rights crisis, for which his government is responsible, and take concrete action to resolve it. Given the depth of the human rights and impunity crisis and lack of political will to reverse course, the international community must support efforts to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism on the human rights situation in Egypt at the UN Human Rights Council,” said Agnès Callamard.\n\nBackground\n\nEgypt is set to host the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh in November. Environmental and human rights groups have raised concerns about limiting protests to “designated areas” and the ability of the Egyptian civil society to meaningfully participate without fear of reprisals.",

Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of Sudan’s ruling sovereign council, at the Cairo international airport. The Sudanese leader stopped in Cairo on his way home from New York where he addressed the U.N. General Assembly on the political stalemate in his county following a military coup he led nearly a year ago.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Egyptian presidency, the two leaders held talks in the Itihadiya presidential palace. The statement offered only generalities about bilateral ties including trade, economic and military cooperation.\n\nThey also discussed regional topics including Ethiopia’s controversial, unfinished dam on the Nile River’s main tributary. Egypt and Sudan want an international agreement to govern how much water Ethiopia releases downstream, especially in a multi-year drought, fearing their critical water shares might be affected.\n\nSudan and Egypt have deepened ties since the ouster of former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 amid a public uprising against his nearly three-decade of rule. The two nations signed an agreement to strengthen military cooperation in March 2021.\n\nEgypt, however, fears ongoing political turmoil could destabilize its southern neighbor. The turmoil has worsened following the military coup in October last year. The military takeover removed a Western-backed, civilian-led government and upended Sudan’s short-lived transition to democratic rule.\n\nAfter months of deadlock and U.N.-brokered talks between the military and pro-democracy groups, Burhan announced the military’s withdrawal from the talks with civilians, to allow political parties to form a transitional government.\n\nThe pro-democracy movement, which includes dozens of political parties and protest groups, have yet to agree among themselves on a transitional government, which prompted Burhan to blame them for the gridlock.",

    "Egypt, Tanzania push ahead on Julius Nyerere dam project": "September 25, 2022\n\nCAIRO — A consortium of Egyptian companies building the Julius Nyerere dam in Tanzania has completed pouring the concrete for the main dam. Egypt’s Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities Assem el-Gazzar announced the progress Aug. 28 during his visit to Dar es Salaam.\n\nGazzar was leading an Egyptian delegation that included Egypt’s ambassador to Tanzania Mohamed Abu al-Wafa and a number of other officials. They first met with Tanzanian Minister of Energy January Makamba, who praised Egypt and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for their interest in the project.\n\nGazzar stressed that Sisi has a great deal of interest in the dam, saying he believes it will greatly contribute to Tanzania's development.\n\nThe project has faced various obstacles since it was launched in late 2018.\n\nMohammed Soliman, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, told Al-Monitor, “Egypt aspires to emerge as an alternative model for Africa. Egypt is a rising actor on the continent in sectors including infrastructure, pharma, logistics, aviation and defense.” He went on, “Owing to its success in Tanzania, Cairo is gradually becoming a reliable partner for other African nations such as Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.”\n\nIn December 2018, an Egyptian joint venture that includes Arab Contractors and El Sewedy Electric Company signed a $2.9 billion contract in Dar es Salaam to build the Julius Nyerere dam and the hydropower station attached to it to generate power and control flooding on the Rufiji River. The station is expected to generate 6,307 megawatt-hours per year.\n\nDuring his Aug. 28 visit to the dam site, Gazzar explained that construction of the dam's gates is currently underway and that the Egyptian joint venture has completed connection with the Tanzanian national electrical grid.\n\n“We have come a long way in implementing the project,” project director Ayman Attia said in televised statements on Aug. 29. “We have finished building half of the dam’s body, and work is currently underway to install the gates. Once the parts for the electric turbines supplied from abroad arrive, they will be installed,” Attia explained.\n\nHe said that the project conveys a message to other African countries that Egyptian companies are capable of implementing such huge projects. He added, “It conveys another message to Africans: that the Egyptian companies … also train African citizens. We are Africans and we work with our African brothers; this is a privilege for us.” He noted that 11,000 of the project's 12,000 workers are Tanzanian.\n\nThe dam project had been planned to be completed at the end of this year, but its opening was postponed until 2024 due to a number of challenges, including disruptions in the delivery of vital building materials due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Tanzanian government is determined to finish the project as soon as possible and begin exporting electricity to neighboring countries.\n\nOn a field tour to the dam site on Aug. 9, Makamba announced, “By July 2022 the project was 67.18% complete, compared to 37.4% between December 2018 and June 2021.”\n\nAmani al-Taweel, director of the Africa program at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, told Al-Monitor that Egypt is seeking to promptly finish the construction of the dam after postponing it so as to portray itself as a successful builder of dams and prove that it is not against development, as Ethiopia claims.\n\nSince 2011, Ethiopia has been building a massive dam on the Blue Nile, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, with the aim of producing 5,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year that could be sold to neighboring countries in the Nile Basin.\n\nMoatamer Amin, a researcher in international relations at the British University in Egypt, told Al-Monitor in reference to Ethiopia that “Egypt is helping East and Central African countries generate electricity and be self-sufficient to prevent any competitors from exporting electricity to these countries.”\n\nHe added that the Tanzanian dam project is part of a long-term Egyptian strategy of linking its interests with the Nile Basin countries in Central and East Africa through building and maintaining dams and a larger project to create a navigation lane linking Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea via the Nile River.\n\nAmin said, “Egypt is seeking to form an African group of Nile Basin countries that would serve as a unified bloc.”\n\nSince Sisi came to power in 2014, Egypt has worked to regain the influence it had lost in the Nile Basin region, bolster its image and protect its water interests in the face of the GERD project. Egypt and Sudan have been engaged in negotiations with Ethiopia for more than a decade now on the operation and filling of the GERD, which Egypt considers a threat to its water security.\n\nNegotiations between the three countries have been deadlocked since they failed to reach an agreement during the last round of talks held in Kinshasa in April 2021.\n\nIn mid-August, Ethiopia announced the completion of the third-stage filling of the GERD reservoir while ignoring Egypt and Sudan's repeated demands that the filling of the dam be halted until a legally binding agreement is reached.\n\nOn Aug. 29, Ethiopian Ambassador to Khartoum Yebeltal Amiru announced that his country was ready to resume negotiations on the GERD under the auspices of the African Union, but Taweel said, “The Ethiopian discourse lacks any real content capable of tempting Egypt and Sudan to resume negotiations.”\n\n“At a time when the Egyptian position is plagued with uncertainty, President Sisi always states that Egypt’s waters are safe and that no one can approach them. However, he always falls short of explaining the mechanisms to protect this water. This issue seems restricted to Egyptian decision-making circles,” she went on.\n\nSolima said, “Given the Ukraine war and the rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Nile dispute is not a priority for global powers. And at this point, and without international mediation, the likelihood of a water-sharing agreement is low.”",

    "US: Hold on Egypt Funding Doesn't Go Far Enough": "Click to expand Image President Joe Biden speaks about foreign policy, at the State Department in Washington, February 4, 2021. © 2021 AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\n(Washington, DC) – The Biden Administration’s decision to hold back $130 million in Fiscal Year 2021 Foreign Military Financing to Egypt based on the government’s human rights record does not sufficiently respond to its ongoing repression and rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said today. The State Department announced the decision on September 15, 2022.\n\nLast year, the administration withheld the same amount for Fiscal Year 2020, citing the Egyptian government’s failure to end the unjust detentions of or drop the charges against 16 Egyptians and completely close the decade-old Case 173 that targets civil society. The Biden Administration is the first to adhere to the Congressionally mandated human rights conditions put on a portion of the $1.3 billion in annual US security assistance to Egypt. Previous administrations used a “national security waiver,” contending that withholding funds would damage US interests.\n\nIn December 2020, the US Congress conditioned $225 million in Foreign Military Financing for Fiscal Year 2021 on the Egyptian government taking several actions. They included “sustained and effective steps” to strengthen human rights, protect freedom of expression, association, and assembly, and hold security forces accountable. Separately, the appropriations legislation mandates Congress to withhold an additional $75 million if the Egyptian government does not make strides in releasing political prisoners and providing detainees with due process. The Biden administration is releasing that $75 million for progress it says Egypt has made on the issue of political prisoners, though repression of the political opposition remains severe, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n“President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has created a human rights crisis in Egypt, and funding held by the United States last year did not go far enough to change that,” said Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s a positive sign that the United States is using its leverage to address human rights abuses, but President Biden should go further to show that he’s truly standing with human rights defenders and other victims of Egyptian repression.”\n\nThe human rights situation in Egypt has not fundamentally improved since last year, Human Rights Watch said. Case 173 – a notorious court proceeding in which Egypt is prosecuting rights organizations over allegedly receiving foreign funds – remains open, and arbitrary detention, arrests, travel bans, targeting of independent media outlets, and harassment of civil society have continued unabated. Human Rights Watch and other local and international human rights organizations wrote to President Biden on August 8 urging him withhold the military assistance and suspend arms sales due to Egypt’s failure to improve its human rights situation.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recently documented likely extrajudicial executions of suspected militants in North Sinai, moves to curtail environmental groups’ ability to carry out independent policy and advocacy, and the imposition of arbitrary travel bans on key members of civil society. Egypt has also limited the work of civil society essential to protecting the country’s environment in the run-up to COP27 – the global conference on climate change that Egypt will host in November.\n\n“Egyptian activists and civil society groups have been pummeled by wave after wave of arrests, travel bans, unfair trials, and other means of repression,” Widdersheim said. “The Biden administration should say enough is enough and consistently ratchet up the pressure until substantial human rights improvements are clear.”",
    "Egypt FM before the UN: We will not give up our rights to the Nile River": "Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Saturday that Egypt will not cede its people’s right to exist attached to the Nile River since the dawn of history.\n\nDuring his speech to the United Nations at the meetings of 77th session of the General Assembly, Shoukry added that water security is one of the most important challenges in our world, especially in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHe continued, “Whoever thinks that adhering to peaceful means to settle water disputes is a form of weakness is mistaken,” noting that “we acknowledge the Ethiopian people’s right to development and have been committed to self-restraint for a decade.”\n\nShoukry stressed the need to reach a binding agreement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.\n\nIn July, Egypt sent a letter to the President of the UN Security Council, to express objection against Ethiopia’s continued filling of GERD reservoir unilaterally without an agreement with Egypt and Sudan on the filling and operation of this dam.\n\nEgypt called on the Security Council to assume its responsibilities in this regard, including by intervening to ensure the implementation of the presidential statement issued by the Council, which obligates the three countries to negotiate in order to reach an agreement on GERD at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nEgypt and Sudan say they want a legally binding agreement on operating the dam, while Ethiopia says any pact should be advisory.\n\nEgypt and Sudan consider the dam a threat to their vital water supplies, while Ethiopia considers it essential for development and doubling its electricity production.\n\nThe downstream nations fear possible blows to water facilities, agricultural land, and overall availability of Nile water.\n\nNegotiations over the dam between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan have stalled for years, with the three parties ultimately failing to reach any agreements.\n\nThe disputed dam is the largest hydroelectric project in Africa, with a cost of more than four billion dollars.",

The Petersberg Climate Dialogue serves as a preparation for the UN Climate Change Conference, which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in 2022. © Florian Gaertner/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images\n\n(Beirut) – The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups’ ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, and field work essential to protecting the country’s natural environment, Human Rights Watch said today. These restrictions violate the rights to freedom of assembly and association and threaten Egypt’s ability to uphold its environmental and climate action commitments, as Egypt hosts the COP27 climate summit in November 2022.\n\n“The Egyptian government has imposed arbitrary funding, research, and registration obstacles that have debilitated local environmental groups, forcing some activists into exile and others to steer clear of important work,” said Richard Pearshouse, environment director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should immediately lift its onerous restrictions on independent nongovernmental organizations, including environmental groups.”\n\nIn June, Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 activists, academics, scientists, and journalists working on environmental issues in Egypt. All have been involved in promoting, advocating for, and working on climate action in some capacity. Some currently work for nongovernmental groups. Others who did stopped for safety or security reasons or left the country. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons. Six other people declined to be interviewed, variously citing security concerns or that government restrictions had forced them to stop their environmental work.\n\nThose interviewed described a sharp reduction in the space for independent environment and climate work since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government took office in 2014. They described harassment and intimidation tactics, including arrests and difficulties travelling, creating a general atmosphere of fear. These experiences mirror similar tactics pursued by Egyptian authorities against independent local and international groups more generally since 2014 as part of a relentless crackdown on civil society.\n\nAt the same time, some people described a recent expansion of official tolerance for environmental activities that are easily reconciled with government priorities and not perceived as critical of the government. An emerging cohort of these environmental groups are working mostly within technical domains such as trash collection, recycling, renewable energy, food security, and climate finance. Increasingly, “the government adopts radical discourse when it comes to the Global North and its contribution to climate change and carbon emissions, just because this intersects with their interests, like the need for more funds,” one person said.\n\nBut staff members of critical human rights and environmental groups said they are wary of publicly engaging at COP27 because of fears of reprisals. “The security apparatus will probably now more than ever before focus on environmental civil society in Egypt,” an activist outside the country said. “When COP ends, they might start looking and see who is doing what, who got funds from where, for example.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that the most sensitive environmental issues are those that point out the government’s failure to protect people’s rights against damage caused by corporate interests, including issues relating to water security, industrial pollution, and environmental harm from real estate, tourism development, and agribusiness.\n\nActivists also said that the environmental impact of Egypt’s vast and opaque military business activity, such as destructive forms of quarrying, water bottling plants, and some cement factories are particularly sensitive, as are “national” infrastructure projects such as a new administrative capital, many of which are associated with the president’s office or the military.\n\n“[These national infrastructure projects are] a red line,” one person said. “I can’t work on this.”\n\nSeveral people said their organizations, widely regarded as the leading ones in Egypt, have been weakened severely by government restrictions and a pervasive sense of fear and uncertainty. This leaves them unable to fulfill the “watchdog” role on abuses of government power.\n\n“They’re so paralyzed by the possibility of what could happen that they do nothing,” one veteran Cairo activist said.\n\nRestrictions on receiving funding has affected many environmental groups. Several laws since 2014, including a 2014 amendment to the penal code as well as the old and new law on nongovernmental groups, arbitrarily restrict grants and donations from foreign and national sources. Increasingly since 2014, the government has prosecuted dozens of independent human rights and civil society organizations, some of them doing environmental work, for receiving foreign funds, and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on leading activists. Such prosecutions have had a chilling impact on these groups.\n\nSeveral people said their groups have faced substantial difficulties registering as nongovernmental groups. All activists interviewed said they have increasingly refrained from doing essential field research, both because they fear that they or the people they interview will be arrested and because it has become almost impossible to attain research permits, which typically involve one or multiple security agencies’ approval.\n\nIn February 2020, seven United Nations experts who reviewed these repressive laws and others said that they “view the totality of these legislative enactments, and their inter-related and cumulative effects, as having collective and corrosive effects on the promotion and protection of human rights.”\n\nThe government repression has forced dozens of Egypt’s leading civil society activists and groups, including those working on environmental and human rights issues, to leave the country, or downscale or quit their activism. A number of foreign human rights and environmental organizations have closed their Egypt offices since 2014. “We haven’t even thought of protesting [these days],” said one environmental activist. Another said that: “Before 2011 the space was not so closed [as it is today]. Now it is very dangerous.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch sent questions about the situation of environmental groups to Egyptian authorities on August 23 but has received no response. Egyptian authorities should urgently halt the campaign of repression against independent civil society groups, including bringing an end to years-long prosecutions, asset freezes, and travel bans against human rights and environmental groups and their staff members. The government should drastically amend the 2019 law on nongovernmental groups in accordance with its constitution and international obligations to protect freedom of association. The government should also unblock all news and human rights websites.\n\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and other governments involved in COP27 negotiations should work with the Egyptian government to provide space for diverse civil society participation at the climate talks. This includes ensuring that premises are inclusive and accessible to all, and that observers, including groups critical of the government, have access to registration, negotiations, and are able to protest and express their positions freely. The Secretariat should also develop human rights criteria that countries hosting future COPs must commit to meeting as part of the host agreement.\n\nIt is fundamental for the Egyptian authorities to deliver visas on time for the COP27 participants and end all their unlawful surveillance and intimidation tactics.\n\n“The world needs more climate activism, not less, and there can be no such effective activism when the government treats civic groups as a threat, not an asset” Pearshouse said. “The UN Framework Convention member states and the Secretariat should press the Egyptian government to make sure environmental groups feel it is safe to engage in and beyond the COP”.\n\nFor additional details about restrictions, please see below.\n\nHarassment of Egyptian Environmental Groups\n\nMany environmental activists described a pattern of harassment by state authorities. Some have received threatening phone calls at times when they have been perceived as criticizing the government when pursuing advocacy objectives related to their environmental work. “Some of my partners in the public sector received phone calls from their bosses telling them to find someone else to work with,” said an environmental advocate who has since stopped some of their work because of such threats.\n\nOthers described being repeatedly held up for security checks and questioning at Cairo airport upon leaving or arriving, and sometimes prevented from leaving the country. One person described the harassment of their partners in the Egyptians Against Coal campaign, a popular but ultimately unsuccessful movement that emerged in response to the government’s drive to reintroduce coal to power cement factories from 2013.\n\n“We had some prominent people who showed up on TV to speak against coal, but suddenly they started to quit the campaign,” one person said. “One was harassed by security at the airport, so he quit.”\n\nAmong local environmental groups, security summonses are common which also target residents and victims of environmental pollution. Three advocates mentioned that security agencies threatened residents who interacted with them in one campaign with terrorism-related charges. Human Rights Watch is not including the details of the case to avoid identifying them.\n\nIn recent months and years, the Egyptian authorities have removed some of the last stretches of inner city green belt in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities for urban projects that apparently involved little to no consultations with residents or civil society groups. An activist said that organizing around such an important issue was difficult because of repression, even though Cairo is among the most polluted and least green cities in the world.\n\nFunding Challenges\n\nMany interviewees described government restrictions on receiving funding as their most debilitating obstacle. Egyptian and Egypt-based businesses and business-owners offer no or limited funding for any work perceived to be critical of the government to avoid reprisals targeting their investments. Egyptian civil society groups, including environmental groups, have historically had to seek foreign sources of finance, such as European and North American foundations and governments.\n\nIn 2014, President al-Sisi amended, by decree, the penal code to punish with life in prison or death sentence anyone requesting, receiving, or assisting the transfer of funds, whether from foreign sources or local organizations, with the aim of doing work that harms a “national interest” or the country’s independence or undermining public security or safety. This amendment, together with years-long prosecution of groups for receiving foreign funds, as well as new restrictions and complex processes introduced through the nongovernmental organization law of 2017 and the updated one of 2019, all have struck independent organizations, including environment groups, and their operations particularly hard.\n\nThese laws impose a range of other severe restrictions and surveillance including giving the government, led by security services, the authority to “inspect” organizations’ work at any time and without necessarily specifying the grounds. As one person described it, the government has presented nongovernmental groups “in the media and the popular culture as recipients of foreign funds and therefore agents of foreign agendas.”\n\nAn environmental advocate with a Cairo-based organization who said their organization used to cooperate in several projects with international donors and institutions stopped doing so because those international actors “allocate their resources away from Egypt because of the repression.”\n\nEven when Egyptian environmental groups do secure funding, often by working with embassies or international institutions in Cairo, they remain captive to hostile, bureaucratic, and/or arbitrary government decision-making.\n\nIn one instance, a well-known organization was cleared to receive money from abroad, but the Social Solidarity Ministry, the government body responsible for overseeing the registration and work of nongovernmental groups, held up the funds, “until three months before the end of the project,” one of the activists involved said. “[As a consequence], they did the project in a very bad way.” Other people said the ministry has sometimes given permission for foreign transfers, only for the security services to block their distribution for unexplained and impossible-to-undo reasons.\n\nRegistration Problems\n\nMany Egyptian environmental groups have been restricted by the difficulty, or, in some cases, the impossibility of securing status as nongovernmental groups. Two people said that they were unaware of any environmental organization publicly criticizing the government that have successfully registered in recent years.\n\nTo operate legally, civil society organizations must be registered with the Social Solidarity Ministry and undertake complex registration processes introduced by the 2019 nongovernmental organization law. The process sometimes requires hundreds of pages of documents, that interviewees said leaves many organizations no longer clear on how to go about it. “I spent a year and a half trying to figure out how we could register,” one interviewee said. “But this is over. I dropped it.”\n\nOthers have been unofficially warned off when sounding out personal contacts within government about the possibility of legalizing their status. The implication is often that the group stood no chance of success and its members risked greater scrutiny by even trying.\n\nIn these circumstances, organizations have often only been able to work under the radar, which naturally limits their scope, and/or by avoiding vital but overly sensitive topics. Alternately, independent Egyptian environmental groups have sometimes found that the only way to do work is to partner with organizations that frequently support and defend government policies and narratives.\n\nAs with funding, even initial green lights are no guarantee of smooth sailing. The authorities can freeze, or threaten to freeze, the registrations of organizations that they perceive to have crossed red lines, as they did to a few groups that supported Egyptians Against Coal. “The Social Solidarity Ministry harassed them by suddenly checking their documents,” an environmental activist said. “The check lasted for five months, [during which] their ability to work decreased.”\n\nResearch Obstacles\n\nEven if a group is registered, a broad array of extra permits must be secured to conduct fieldwork, collect samples, import equipment, and more. Interviewees said that multiple ministries and security agencies must all sign off on these requests, particularly those related to research in isolated or border areas, such as the Halayeb Triangle, much of the Sinai Peninsula, and almost all of the Western Desert, which is facing significant environmental issues.\n\nEgyptian laws have a very broad definition of border areas in some places encompassing hundreds of kilometers before the actual international border. The 2019 nongovernmental organization law requires governmental approval before groups publish the results of any studies or surveys and prohibits any work deemed to be of “political” nature (without explaining what is meant by political).\n\nThe 2019 law also prohibits “any activity that requires a license from a government body” without obtaining the license from the relevant body. For example, the mere act of taking photographs in a street or public area is prohibited without a license when involving even quasi-professional equipment such as lightening or reflection tools. Photography in or near any government building is prohibited without permits from “the relevant body.”\n\nGiven the laboriousness of the process, the scrutiny that these applications can invite, and their low chances of success, increasingly few bother to apply for research permits. “There is a lot of work that you don’t engage in because you simply know you won’t get permits,” said one former staff member of an environmental group who requested that his location be redacted.\n\nAs constraints have intensified, most interviewees say that they have had to rein in or abandon research altogether. One prominent Egyptian environmental group disbanded its research unit because it became impossible to work in the field. Another prominent Egyptian environmental group now only does environment-related “desk work.”’ Yet another Egyptian environmental group has shut down and a legal organization that previously worked on environmental themes has significantly downscaled its operations.\n\nAnother obstacle to independent research is the severe limitation on access to information. Egyptian authorities have since 2017 blocked access to roughly 700 websites, including the remaining few independent platforms for news media and human rights websites left in the country. Authorities also blocked thousands of websites and texting and calling apps temporarily during events that witnessed large protests such as during 2019 street protests. Such massive censorship, coupled with systematic arrests and prosecutions of journalists, have severely restricted access to information and reporting around topics deemed prohibited by the government including environmental issues.\n\nEnvironmental Activism at COP27 and Beyond\n\nIn April and May 2019, a group of African activists reported a range of abuses when Egypt hosted the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, also in Sharm el-Sheikh, where COP will be held. Scores of participants reported that the authorities delayed or prevented them from obtaining visas or delayed delivering the badges needed to attend the official summit. Many said they were physically followed and spied on and some reported being physically abused by Egyptian security agents. They also described how hotels did not allow them to rent meeting rooms, citing “security instructions.”\n\nDespite the general atmosphere of government restrictions, some activists said the COP27 conference was a positive opportunity for Egypt. They hope that it will help raise climate awareness and encourage more funding for climate action across the region.\n\nIn the lead up to COP27, some people said there appears to be an increasing acceptance of advocacy and action around climate justice, climate adaptation, and loss and damage in the context of global climate negotiations, which are mostly “safe,” and welcome territory, as they are not threatening to Egyptian authorities and in line with the state’s vision of itself as a champion of poor, climate-battered countries.\n\nSeveral informed sources said that the Egyptian authorities, through the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs, have in recent closed meetings asked several Egyptian groups to participate in the COP27 events, mostly around “welcome” topics. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat told Human Rights Watch in an email that one-off admission to attend COP27, outside the usual process to be accredited, was granted for over 30 Egyptian groups, all “endorsed” through the Egyptian government. Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the UNFCCC on August 22 asking about the process and criteria for these one-off admissions but has not received a response.\n\nActivists also report a relative ease of interaction with parts of the government. Senior officials at the Environment Ministry “are accessible and communicative,” one interviewee said. In recent months, that official-to-environmentalist contact appears to have expanded beyond the environment ministry. Egyptian authorities organizing COP27 have sounded out some activists on Egypt’s environmental priorities at the conference and even recruited a few of them to assist with preparation.\n\nSome also said that they see COP as an opportunity to bolster international awareness of the political context in which COP is taking place, not least because of its central role in hobbling Egyptian environmental activism. “There can be no improvement in the environmental situation without improvement in freedom of expression and the overall human rights situation,” one person said.",

    "These 4 Laws in Egypt Must Change: Activists": "These 4 Laws in Egypt Must Change: Activists\n\nActivism has proven to help amend laws in Egypt, from child marriage to animal rights. Other campaigns, however, are far more socially contentious – some, like atheism and sexual orientations, are considered culturally inappropriate. Nevertheless, activists continue to campaign for a change in certain controversial laws in Egypt.\n\nWith the government’s recent launch of its new National Human Rights Strategy in September 2021, and with a large number of activists being pardoned from prison, activists will be aiming to step up their efforts in the coming period.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHING UNSIGHTLY LOCATIONS AND MEDIA EQUIPMENT\n\nUp until July 2022, people were unofficially not permitted to photograph or film any public spaces in Egypt without prior approval from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.\n\nThis has now changed, following an approved draft law issued by former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Khaled El-Enany, as announced in an exclusive interview with talk show host Amr Adeeb.\n\nThe Ministry’s recent decision comes shortly after American food blogger Sonny Side, stated on his YouTube food and travel channel, ‘Best Ever Food Review Show’, that “Egypt is one of worst places for filmmakers”. He added that Egyptian security personnel mistreated him while filming Egyptian dishes, warned him to not film in unsightly locations, confiscated their cameras, and shut their filming down.\n\nSide’s last video regarding his trip to Egypt, shot after leaving the country, was an open criticism and formal request for more lenient laws towards capturing footage in Egypt. Side’s open call for change was posted prior to the amended law.\n\nEl-Enany publicly cautioned photography enthusiasts that this amendment does not protect against documenting Egypt’s unsightly locations – this includes ugly scenes, like littered areas, government buildings, informal settlements, and security officials.\n\nThese complexes include buildings and sites belonging to the Armed Forces or Egyptian Police, ministry buildings, legislative councils, other governmental facilities, and any other sovereign and security authorities.\n\nUnder the new law, permits are still required for those with professional media equipment, drones, and underwater cameras. The penalty for flying an unauthorized drone ranges from one to seven years. If deemed a terrorist tool, that sentence can extend to life imprisonment.\n\nBLASPHEMY: ATHEISM AND RELIGIOUS MANIPULATION\n\nAtheism is yet another crime not explicitly cited in the penal code—still, some Egyptians have been imprisoned after publicly declaring their atheism on the basis of proselytizing.\n\nIn the transitional presidential period between Mohamed Morsi and Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, sparked by the 2013 uprising, a group of Egyptian atheist activists attempted to normalize the existence of non-believers within Egyptian society – a matter that is often fervently opposed by a predominantly religious society.\n\nAhmed Harqan, an openly atheist Egyptian, was one of the first few atheists to feature in televised debates about atheist rights shortly after Al-Sisi’s first election victory. He later survived an alleged premeditated mob attack in 2014, was arrested on the grounds of allegedly defaming Islam on television, and permanently left the country in 2020.\n\nLegal action taken against atheism often relies on Article 98 of the penal code, informally known as the Blasphemy Law, which stipulates that any person that exploits or condemns Egypt’s religions can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nIn September 2021, in a live press event for Egypt’s new National Human Rights Strategy, Al-Sisi publicly addressed the possibility of Egypt openly accepting atheists.\n\n“I respect nonbelievers. If someone tells me [they are] neither Muslim nor Christian nor a Jew or that he or she does not believe in religion, I would tell them, you are free to choose,” Al-Sisi explained.\n\nAl-Sisi followed his statement by questioning if religious Egyptians will be willing to accept their existence, and highlighting the difference between accepting atheism and accepting religious defamation.\n\nOn the other side of the religious spectrum, that same article of law criminalizes the exploitation and distortion of religion, including by religious figures.\n\nMost recently, in June 2022, popular television cleric Mabrouk Attia was referred to investigations following remarks that blamed Nayera Ashraf, a femicide victim, for her own murder – citing her lack of veil and choice of dress as the reason behind her murder.\n\nLGBTQ+ AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\nEgypt’s legal codes do not explicitly mention members of the LGBTQ+ community, nor do they explicitly criminalize homosexuality.\n\nYet there have been a number of instances where members of the LGBTQ+ community have been arrested. In 2017, following a controversial, rainbow-flag-laden performance by Lebanese band Mashrou’ Leila, Egyptian authorities were quick to arrest those who seemed to support the LGBTQ+ community, in addition to banning the band from playing in Egypt indefinitely.\n\nThe question remains: what makes these acts criminal if not directly mentioned in Egypt’s criminal code?\n\nEgypt’s Law 10/1961, commonly known as the Debauchery Law, has been used to apply criminal action toward ‘homosexual activity’. While the law was initially intended to criminalize prostitution, its application has sometimes been extended to crack down on ‘sexual activity’.\n\n“Whoever employs, persuades or induces a person, be they male or female, with the intention of committing debauchery or prostitution and this is by means of deception, force, threats, abuse of authority or other means of coercion, the punishment is imprisonment for a period not less than one year and not more than five years,” reads Article 2, Section A of the law.\n\nThere are, however, variances in rights between different members LGBTQ+ community. Sex reassignment operations for trans Egyptians are legally available upon approval from Egypt’s Ministry of Health, a medical examination, a psychiatric examination, and, finally, final approval from Egypt’s official religious bodies, either the Dar Al-Ifta or Alexandria’s Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nHowever, gaining approval for the surgery is incredibly difficult, according to Amr Al-Najari, a professor in plastic surgery at Qasr Al-Aini hospital.\n\n‘FAKE NEWS’ AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nWith the popular rise of digital news and social media over the past decade – integrals tool in Egypt’s 2011 Revolution – the Egyptian government enacted a law in 2018 that regulates website and social media activity, making both companies and citizens subject to prosecution if there is evidence of “fake news” or posts that incite public disorder.\n\nIn 2017, Egypt blocked 21 news sites, including Qatari-based Al-Jazeera, Mada Masr, and CairoScene, for the “intentions to spread lies”, show support for terrorist groups, and for running a news site without proper licensing from the Supreme Council for Media Regulation.\n\nEgypt’s Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), a non-governmental organization that works on promoting freedom of expression and thought, launched a campaign to unblock news sites in 2020.\n\n“The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated how important access to information is […] In such circumstances, independent press sources become the primary refuge for citizens looking for the truth of what is happening, whether in terms of health policies or other social and economic impacts,” reads AFTE’s announcement.\n\nOn 8 September 2022, four Mada Masr journalists were charged with spreading false news and inciting instability in the nation – social media was referenced as a tool of destabilization against the Egyptian state by the accusers.\n\nAnother code of law stipulates that any social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers will be treated as media outlets and are obliged to avoid fake news and public disorder through social media posts.\n\nThe penalty for inciting public disorder through news sites or social media posts is up to one-year imprisonment.\n\nSubscribe to the Egyptian Streets’ weekly newsletter!

    "Egypt to approve lung transplantation": "CAIRO – 26 September 2022: Egypt would, for the first time, approve lung transplantation, said Minister of Health Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar in media comments on Monday.\n\nHe added in comments to the Salet Al Tahrir (The Newsroom) that Egypt would establish a national organ transplant network and a research center.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah El Sisi directed the government to establish a regional center for organ transplantation in Egypt, to be the largest one of its kind in the Middle East and Africa, says Presidency Spokesman Bassam Rady.\n\nThe new center will be part of a new medical city that would replace Nasser Medical Institution in Cairo in cooperation with major international specialized companies, with the aim of the establishment of an integrated system, which includes an automated database of organ transplantation, patients, and donors.\n\nRady added.\n\nPresident Sisi’s comments were given in a meeting with Prime Minister, Dr. Mostafa Madbouly; Minister of Health and Population, Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar; and Head of the Engineering Authority of the Armed Forces, Major General Hisham El Swefy, on Monday to follow up on efforts to improve the healthcare system in Egypt.\n\nThe Minister of Health offered an overview of the state’s health map. This included the number of government and private medical facilities, their medical equipment, and medical staff, as well as linking the health map to the database of the presidential initiative 100 million health and its health- and medical care programs and initiatives for citizens.\n\nThe meeting also discussed the upgrading of Nasser Institute as part of efforts to turn it into a global medical city.\n\nThe Minister of Health and Population reviewed work progress in the establishment of the medical city at Nasser Institute Hospital, which has a capacity of 1,200 intensive care beds and 45 operation rooms.\n\nAbdel Ghaffar also presented the details of the establishment of the new Umm Al-Masryein Hospital, with a capacity of 400 beds. The hospital will provide its services to about 3 million people and is considered the main hospital to receive road accident victims in Giza Governorate and its suburbs.\n\nThe President directed to speed up the implementation of the financial incentives package for medical staff, as well as evening clinics in hospitals and allocating a percentage of their return to doctors and medical staff. This would achieve additional income for the medical staff commensurate with the efforts exerted to deliver health care services.\n\nThe Minister of Health also briefed the meeting on the achievements of the presidential initiative to end waiting lists over the past 4 years since its launch. He said 466 public and private hospitals participated in the initiative, which succeeded to provide treatment for one million and 370,000 patients, at a total cost of 12 billion pounds. The President gave directives to provide additional financial resources to expand the initiative and add new surgical specialties. He underlined the need to raise citizens’ awareness on how to benefit from this initiative and to simplify the relevant administrative procedures.",
    "Monday Briefing: Amid growing Gulf investment, Egypt tries to maintain a tricky economic balancing act": "Contents:\n\nAmid growing Gulf investment, Egypt tries to maintain a tricky economic balancing act\n\nMirette F. Mabrouk\n\nSenior Fellow and Founding Director of the Egypt program\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi’s visit to Qatar last week bore almost immediate fruit; three MoUs were signed, including one between the respective sovereign wealth funds.\n\nWhile Egypt needs FDI, there are worries that outside investors may wind up controlling vital sections of the economy.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi made his first visit to Qatar during his time in office last week, following Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s visit to Cairo at the end of June. According to the Qatar News Agency, the visits heralded “a new era of relations between the two countries.”\n\nThose relations had been tense since the removal of former President Mohamed Morsi by the military, after massive demonstrations against him and the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Following one diplomatic spat after another, in 2017, Egypt joined Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain in boycotting Qatar. That boycott was lifted in early 2021, and the countries have been taking increasingly energetic steps forward since.\n\nLast week’s meeting in Qatar bore almost immediate fruit; three memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, including one between the respective sovereign wealth funds. And on Saturday, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly met with Sheikh Faisal bin Thani Al Thani, the chief of Asia-Pacific and Africa investments at Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. Egypt is particularly keen to maximize its tourism development potential and during the meeting, Madbouly presented Al Thani with a plan to develop the area west of Alamein. According to Masrawy, Al Thani indicated that Qatar was interested in exploring investment in both existing structures and developing new ones.\n\nA day later, Egypt’s transport minister, Kamel el-Wazir, and Abu Bakr Kondial of Maha Capital Partners, an investment arm of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, signed an MoU to develop and upgrade the vital Port Said Port container terminal.\n\nLast May, el-Wazir had announced a plan to merge multiple ports into one company to be offered on the Egyptian Stock Exchange, according to Mada Masr, including Ain Sokhna, Damietta, Alexandria, East Port Said, Safaga, and Adabiya.\n\nThere’s been a lot of interest in Egypt’s ports and the crucial Red Sea trade passageway. And Egypt is even keener on capitalizing on this attention. The country’s economy has been battered mercilessly; still struggling with the fallout from the pandemic, it was in poor shape to withstand the disastrous effects of the war in Ukraine. Hot money behaved the way it always does during periods of global instability, as foreign investors in the bond market fled for more stable developed markets, taking vital foreign currency with them. That global instability meant spiking prices, increasing the demand for scarcer foreign currency. To put one final boot in, much of the country’s rising debt is nearing maturity, placing even more of a squeeze on its foreign currency resources.\n\nThe influx of Gulf money — Saudi, Emirati, and now Qatari — has been seen as a lifeline for Egypt’s battered economy. That’s indisputable. However, that money is being referred to as loans and handouts, which is far from the case. Whereas in previous years the Gulf countries had placed generous deposits in Egypt’s Central Bank, helping to prop up the economy, they are now making investments; and like any investor, they will naturally require a return on their money. While Egypt needs foreign direct investment, there are worries that outside investors may wind up controlling vital sections of the economy. The Qataris have expressed interest in Port Said, and the Emirati firm Abu Dhabi Ports won a tender to manage Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea. According to Mada Masr, the security implications have now been presented to Egyptian President Sisi.\n\nAll new investment carries an opportunity cost. Having foreign firms manage ports means relinquishing a measure of control, and expanding tourist developments means keeping a close eye on the environmental strain and potential damage that development might do to natural resources. It’s a tricky balancing act.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @mmabrouk\n\nIn Iraq, expect more talks, possible new violence\n\nRobert S. Ford\n\nSenior Fellow\n\nThe standoff between Shi’a Islamist groups will resume in earnest this week, with the Sadrist Movement on one side and the Coordination Framework, which is itself split, on the other.\n\nElements of a deal are visible, but there are plenty of details that can derail everything — and there is a real risk of renewed violence.\n\nThe standoff between Shi’a Islamist groups in Baghdad over the naming of a new government continues, and political maneuvering, which had slowed last week during the Shi’a religious pilgrimage of Arba’een, will resume in earnest this week. On one side of the ongoing dispute, the movement of populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr insists that the existing parliament, elected in October 2021, be dissolved and that the current interim government oversee new elections. Confronting the Sadrists is the Coordination Framework (CF), a coalition of Shi’a parties that is itself split, as one Iraqi analyst explained on Sept. 18, between hawks and doves. The CF hawks, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, want the existing parliament to convene promptly to choose a new president and a new prime minister with a new government enjoying full authority to run the country. The doves in the CF prefer to bring along the Sadrists by cutting a deal on a new government whose key role would be overseeing new elections.\n\nMedia reports over the weekend said a delegation that includes doves from the CF as well as representatives from Sunni Arab and Kurdish parties will call on Sadr in Najaf. It is not yet clear whether he is prepared to compromise on issues such as who would head a new cabinet and what its mandate would be. There are hints in the Iraqi media that the CF doves and their Sunni Arab and Kurdish colleagues would accept a compromise prime minister. Other sweeteners can also be thrown into the negotiating mix, including seats in a new cabinet and changes to the commission that would oversee the new election. Another crucial element to resolve the standoff is an agreement between feuding Kurdish parties over the new president since the other political groupings likely would ratify a unified Kurdish choice if there is also an advance agreement on a prime minister.\n\nElements of a deal are visible, but there are plenty of details that can derail everything. Hawks in the CF have not promised to compromise. One hawk told an Iraqi news service on Sept. 18 that the upcoming visit to Najaf was the “last chance” to bring Sadr along. While they can sharply disagree, Iraqi political leaders rarely resort to violence before they first plunge into long — sometimes seemingly interminable — discussions. If the hawks lose patience and push hard to reconvene the parliament to approve a new government, the risk of new Sadrist street action and renewed violence between Sadrist militias and militias loyal to the hawks is very possible.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @fordrs58\n\nDespite recent speculation, the prospects for Turkish-Syrian rapprochement remain distant\n\nCharles Lister\n\nSenior Fellow, Director of Syria and Countering Terrorism & Extremism programs\n\nThough almost entirely unacknowledged, Syrian intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk has met several times with his counterparts from a number of regional adversarial states throughout the crisis.\n\nSpeculation about Ankara and Damascus reaching a modus vivendi may be partially driven by Russian narratives and in part by the Turkish government’s pre-election considerations.\n\nSpeculation continues to surround Turkey’s Syria policy following weeks of reporting around public comments in August by senior Turkish officials and more recent claims, citing unnamed sources, that Turkey’s intelligence chief held several meetings with his Syrian counterpart, both in Ankara and Damascus. While secret contacts between security leaders are not entirely new, the reported intensity of these meetings and the alleged facilitating role played by Russia does mark a change. Still, there remains no sign that the vast chasm between the two decade-long opponents is narrowing, suggesting a more nuanced reality may be at play.\n\nThough almost entirely unacknowledged, Syrian intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk has met several times with his counterparts from a number of regional adversarial states throughout the Syrian crisis. In all likelihood, Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) chief, Hakan Fidan, met with Mamlouk to discuss or negotiate the situation in northern and northeastern Syria, where both parties would like to see the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakened, if not ultimately crippled. It is also quite likely that Fidan has been scoping out the framework for any future rapprochement between Turkey and Syria — but in so doing, he will not be faced with any realistic path forward, for the obstacles remain insurmountable.\n\nSince the fall of Aleppo in 2016 (which Turkey directly facilitated), Ankara’s Syria policy has been guided overwhelmingly by counterterrorism and border security concerns. For now at least, there is no sign that Damascus or Moscow are willing to greenlight any further Turkish incursion (Turkey’s immediate ask), while the likelihood that Ankara will relinquish the vast stretch of territory it occupies across northern Syria (Syria’s primary demand) remains inconceivable.\n\nOn border security, Turkey is acutely aware of the more than 4.5 million Syrians currently residing within that unstable Turkish-influenced northwestern zone, all of whom refuse to even consider returning to regime-controlled areas. On top of that, Turkey continues to host at least 3.5 million Syrian refugees, who retain the same complete aversion to regime rule. And to add to that pressure against normalization, Turkey is also the central guarantor of at least 50,000 armed opposition fighters and more than 10,000 militants within the jihadist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. Any Turkish re-embrace of Bashar al-Assad’s regime would catalyze a worst-case series of threats to Turkey’s national security, the effects of which would likely kill off any chance of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s re-election next year.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Assad’s regime displays no sign whatsoever of softening its hostile stance toward Turkey — with state media and senior officials continuing to label Turkey a “war criminal” state, “occupying” Syrian territory at the behest of “terrorists.” Behind the scenes however, there is little reason not to engage delicately on intelligence levels and every motivation to allow a public narrative to continue that suggests Damascus’s most significant state challenger may be considering re-engagement.\n\nUltimately, the roots of the recent speculation are more likely to lie, in part, in Russia’s desire to create an impression of foreign policy achievement amidst a pitiful war in Ukraine. A further source may be Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which needs to assuage and align on the surface with concerns expressed by some of its domestic voting base and supporters of its rival parties’ hostility to Syrian refugees and Turkey’s spending and investments in northern Syria. Turning policy activities driven more by optics into reality will be nigh on impossible for Russia and highly dangerous for Turkey.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @Charles_Lister\n\nRomania, France, and the UAE push to expand Ukrainian food export options in the Black Sea\n\nIulia-Sabina Joja\n\nDirector, Frontier Europe Initiative; Project Director, Afghanistan Watch\n\nLast week, France and Romania signed an agreement focused on improving transit options for Ukrainian grain exports via Romania’s land, sea, and internal waters.\n\nDubai-based company DP World is building a new terminal at the Romanian port of Constanța, which has been overloaded since Russia’s full-scale re-invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which blocked maritime exports of Ukrainian grain, created a food crisis across the developing world by acutely increasing prices and heightening widespread fears of shortages. In August, Turkey and the United Nations brokered a deal that assured the safety of grain export ships leaving Ukraine’s northwestern Black Sea ports. But this arrangement only managed to partially alleviate the crisis: Much of Ukraine’s grain remained blocked and the regional infrastructure experienced heavy congestion. Under the pressure of war and thanks to Romanian leadership, however, critical developments are taking place, aimed at improving Black Sea infrastructure to aid the export of Ukrainian food products to developing countries, including in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). In particular, governmental pledges from France and private investments from the United Arab Emirates are now contributing to the brisk expansion of transport infrastructure at the border between Romania and Ukraine.\n\nLast week, France and Romania signed an agreement focused on improving transit options via land, sea, and internal waters, in the Danube River Delta and along Romania’s Black Sea coast. The bilateral deal is comprehensive and promises short-term improvements as well as medium-term investment planning — encompassing the Danube-Sulina canal, the Danube port of Galati (less than 10 miles from the Ukrainian border), the Black Sea port of Constanța, and land border points — all with an eye toward facilitating increased grain shipments. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale re-invasion of Ukraine in late February, Romanian transport facilities have been critical to enabling at least some Ukrainian grain exports; but the transport infrastructure has been overloaded. Along with Ukraine, Romania is itself one of the world’s largest exporters of agricultural products. But if Romania, in cooperation with France, can secure sufficient medium-term investments, this should help to address future food crises in MENA and the rest of the developing world.\n\nThe other recent infrastructure development aimed at facilitating grain exports from the Black Sea region involves DP World, an international logistics firm and port operator based in Dubai. In the works since June, DP World will build a new terminal for the Romanian port of Constanța, which has been overloaded since Russia invaded its neighbor earlier this year. To be finalized next summer, the new terminal will help Romania handle more exports, both of its own products as well as of Ukrainian ones, thus highlighting the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for global transport and supply chains.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @IuliJo\n\nThe US throws the Afghan financial system a lifeline\n\nMarvin G. Weinbaum\n\nDirector, Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies\n\nThe Switzerland-based Afghan Fund is designed principally as a means to aid the Afghan people without benefiting a sanctioned Taliban government.\n\nThe monetary windfall, as large as it is, cannot by itself revive the Afghan economy. But it should contribute substantially to stabilizing it.\n\nAn Afghanistan deep in humanitarian and economic crisis found some relief last week with the announcement by the Biden administration that $3.5 billion of the $7 billion in frozen Afghan central bank reserves in the U.S. would be released to a newly created fund. The Switzerland-based Afghan Fund is designed principally as a means to aid the Afghan people without benefiting a sanctioned Taliban government. This new instrument is expected, among other tasks, to manage targeted disbursements to cover debt payments, purchase critical imports, improve eligibility for international development aid, and print new currency, acting in effect much as a state’s central bank would. The direct recapitalization of the current government’s central bank was ruled out after U.S. representatives failed in negotiations with the Taliban to come to an agreement on the necessary safeguards to ensure that technocrats running the bank could be shielded from political interference.\n\nMany of the details about the Afghan Fund’s operations remain unclear or have yet to be worked out. Complicated issues include how it will relate to other financial institutions, such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund, and whether it will be able to interact with other countries’ central banks. (The Basel-based Bank for International Settlements is slated to provide the Fund with financial services and assist in implementing policies, but it will not be involved in decision making.) How smoothly the board of trustees designated to manage the Fund will function is also an open question. The board, which will consist of two Afghans, a U.S. official, and a Swiss representative (and possibly additional members), will require unanimity in making decisions. Could this seriously impede the ability of the trustees to reach agreements? Might their work be complicated by the fact that while both named Afghan trustees have distinguished careers in banking, like practically all once-prominent public figures in the previous two-decade-long republic, they also come with political baggage?\n\nThe Kabul regime has announced its objections to the creation of a Switzerland-based trust in which it will have no input. The Taliban express concern that the new funds may be used to support humanitarian programs rather than directly strengthen the country’s financial system. The government still hopes to recover the remaining $3.5 billion in U.S.-held assets as well as the $2 billion in European banks. The final disposition of the U.S.-retained funds remains uncertain. They will likely be tied up for the foreseeable future in U.S. courts as the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks pursue their claims to the frozen reserves.\n\nThe monetary windfall, as large as it is, cannot by itself revive the Afghan economy. But it should contribute substantially to stabilizing it. If the Fund succeeds in steadying the economy and in lessening the current crises, the ruling Taliban’s staying power will almost inevitably be strengthened. But this may be a necessary price to pay for averting the collapse of the economy and the resulting toll it would take on the wellbeing of the Afghan people.\n\n﻿Shizah Kashif, a research assistant to Marvin G.

The forum was organized by the Arab Water Council with support from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Environment. Senior representatives from 30 countries attended. The forum’s purpose was to discuss the impacts of climate change as well as the adaptation and mitigation measures that could be utilized to address those impacts across multiple sectors and themes, including water and food security, carbon emissions controls, alternative forms of clean and renewable energy, and environmental preservation and protection.\n\nLast week’s forum provided another opportunity to get a better sense of Egypt’s priorities for the U.N. Climate Change Conference (27th Conference of the Parties, COP27), which the country will host on Nov. 6-18. In Cairo, comments from Egyptian senior officials and experts confirmed, and in some cases elucidated, what will be the high-priority issues for Egypt at this year’s climate conference.\n\nEmphasizing adaptation, not just mitigation: While highlighting that shifting to renewable sources of energy has become a priority for the Arab world (as a means to reduce carbon emissions), Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry also recognized the urgency of adaptation as a necessary function to deal with the effects of climate change.\n\nWater scarcity is a top concern: The new minister of water resources and irrigation, Hani Sewilam, stressed how impacts to water supply due to climate change cascade into shortages of drinking water as well as volumes required for agricultural use and industrial production. In addition, he elaborated on Egypt’s particular vulnerability when it comes to water resources — with added emphasis on its extreme dependance on the Nile — while emphasizing the need for more water infrastructure (desalination and treatment plants) and inter-country cooperation.\n\nDiversifying climate financing and investments: The push for more adaptation, especially for water and food security, creates a greater urgency for more efficient climate funding mechanisms. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the United Nations’ high-level climate change champion for Egypt, advocated for broadening climate investments in adaptation and the water and energy sectors, specifically highlighting projects beyond just reducing carbon emissions. In that same vein, he also urged less reliance on carbon markets and green bonds for financing, not just on borrowing.\n\nEgypt remains committed to putting African concerns to the forefront at COP27 and to representing the continent’s interests at the conference. All of these key issues have one aspect in common: They are the most pressing challenges for almost all developing countries. As such, the biggest expectations for COP27 will be whether the high-level gathering can deliver progress in areas that can increase climate resilience for the most vulnerable nations.\n\nPhoto by AMIRI DIWAN OF THE STATE OF QATAR/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images",
    "Egypt ready to establish international center for supply and storage of grains: Shoukry": "Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry expressed Cairo’s readiness to cooperate with the international community in establishing a center for the supply and storage of grain in Egypt.\n\nIn his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Saturday, Shoukry said that “Egypt, through its unique geographical location, expresses its readiness to cooperate with the international community in order to establish a center for the supply and storage of grain in Egypt in order to contribute to solving the food crisis for all.”\n\nHe added that the food security crisis is the result of many years of failure of the international community to achieve the UN’s sustainable development goals.\n\n“I refer to the unfortunate reality that in Africa one in five people is at risk of starvation, and the continent remains a food importer at a cost of US$43 billion,” Shoukry said.\n\nThe Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Program, David Beasley on Friday warned of a food crisis that could cause chaos around the world.\n\nHe pointed out that there are 345 million people heading towards starvation in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, which sparked a war and a crisis in food, fertilizer and energy.\n\nThis year, Beasley said, the war has halted shipments of grain from Ukraine – a country that produces enough food to feed 400 million people – and sharply reduced shipments from Russia, the world’s second-largest exporter of fertilizer and a major food producer.\n\nHe added that inflation is also a serious problem, as it raises prices and hurts the poor who have no ability to adapt because “COVID-19 has destroyed them economically”.",

    "Not enough to declare intentions on two state solution, says Egypt’s foreign minister": "September 24, 2022\n\nNEW YORK — “It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s speech at the UN General Assembly calling for a two-state solution.\n\n“I recognize that Prime Minister Lapid has publicly indicated his support of a two-state solution,” said Shoukry in an exclusive interview with Al-Monitor.\n\n“This is something that we have constantly advocated in our discussions both with the Israeli government, and our partners in the European Union and the United States, and we hope that the solution will be fulfilled. We recognize of course that in Israel there are upcoming elections, and the necessity to await the electoral process and the composition of a new Israeli government. We hope that that government will endorse the two-state solution and effectively reinitiate negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and implement them,” he said.\n\n“It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions,” added Shoukry. “More than three decades after Oslo, the vision of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, living side by side in security and peace with Israel, has not been achieved. And I can understand the disappointment that was conveyed in President Abbas’ speech for exactly the same reason.”\n\nShoukry also discussed the stalled diplomacy on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, saying that Egypt has been “somewhat dismayed” by the lack of diplomatic progress.\n\n“There is an understanding of the dangers of the current situation,” he said, adding that “Egypt seeks a ‘cooperative relationship’ based on specific legal commitments to protect the rights of the downstream countries,” referring to Egypt and Sudan.\n\nEgypt will continue to monitor the situation, he added, given its impact on the livelihood of 140 million Egyptians and Sudanese.\n\n“We will do everything possible to protect our interests,” Shoukry said.\n\nShoukry spoke at length about Egypt’s role as host of this year’s Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP27, which will be held Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\n“The science has been warning us for years now about the consequences” of climate change, said Shoukry, who serves as president-designate for COP27, adding that the “existential nature” of the climate threat “can only be dealt with in collaboration and cooperation among all the parties.”\n\nShoukry also discussed Egypt’s emergence as an energy hub, including green energy and renewables, noting that Egypt has the largest wind farm in the world. Egypt has plans to connect its electricity grid with Europe, expanding on existing connectivity networks with Sudan and Jordan.\n\nAsked about Egypt’s message on the Russian war on Ukraine, the foreign minister said that “there has to be efforts exerted on both sides to encourage a political and diplomatic solution,” adding that Egypt and “a large number of countries from the south have suffered dramatically from the consequences” of COVID-19, and the food, economic and energy crises resulting from the war in Ukraine.\n\nShoukry described the US-Egyptian relationship as multifaceted, noting that it has been beneficial to both countries, and that both sides have recognized that value of the strategic partnership.\n\nWith regard to human rights, Shoukry said these issues will be addressed in the context of Egyptian law, and that the Egyptian people will be the “final judge” of the country’s progress.\n\n“We will continue to implement our national human rights strategy,” said Shoukry, “and to deal with these issues within the context of the political dialogue that has been initiated, and the general conditions in Egypt.”\n\n“We all have room to improve our application of the principles, values and standards of human rights,” said Shoukry.\n\nA transcript of the interview, lightly edited for clarity, follows:\n\nAl-Monitor: Egypt is hosting COP27 [UN Climate Change Conference], putting a spotlight on both Egypt’s climate policy and leadership role in Africa. Tell us about your meetings this week, and your expectations for COP27.\n\nShoukry: I've been having extensive meetings not only here, but in most of the venues that I've attended.\n\nAnd the bilateral discussions that I've had, and the visits to various capitals, my capacity as president designate [of COP27] have been discussing, and promoting, the importance that we build on what we have achieved in Paris and Glasgow, and must address this scope with the implementation COP in Paris and Glasgow.\n\nWe agreed on the road map, and it's time now that we fulfill the commitments that were made fully and at scale, and to move ahead with our ambitions.\n\nWe've been encouraging all to present their revised NDCs, and we are hopeful that this COP will continue to build trust between developing and developed nations, and fulfill the ambitions to effectively deal with climate change.\n\nThe science has been warning us for years now about the consequences, and I think even the current state of events, with the flooding, and temperatures, and cyclones, and the devastating effect they have had, this all really highlights the existential nature of the climate threat, and can only be dealt with in collaboration and cooperation among all the parties.\n\nAl-Monitor: A quick follow up, at a business dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, you said that Egypt is seeking to become a regional energy hub, focusing on clean and sustainable energy, shifting from fossil fuels. … How does that fit with your COP27 agenda?\n\nShoukry: Well, we have recognized early on the benefits of renewable energy, that it is one of the drivers of our economic development, and our potential because of the abundance of solar energy, wind energy to take full advantage of it, and to be able to export large amounts of it.\n\nThis also includes electricity, and green energy to produce green hydrogen, which is also considered an important source of energy for the future.\n\nWe have revised our expectations and our targets for our energy mix from 30% up to 42% by 2035, which is quite a considerable achievement that we hope to follow up with the expansion of our abilities in the solar field and wind.\n\nCurrently, we have the largest wind farm in the world, and are further expanding our wind capacities, but we are also in discussions with the European Union and with our partners in Greece for connectivity, to be able to connect Egypt and its power grid to the European power grid.\n\nWe currently already have connectivity with Sudan [and] with Jordan, and hope to expand that I think also to Saudi Arabia. Hopefully we will be able to, as we expand our capabilities, take advantage of that resource economically, but also provide our partners in the region the ability of interconnectivity and inter-reliance.\n\nAl-Monitor: In your meetings this week you have stressed the need to resume negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam [GERD] as soon as possible to reach a binding agreement on filling and operating the dam in a way that would serve the interests of all parties involved and preserve Egypt’s rights to the Nile water — that the status quo is a source of instability. Please bring us up to date on where diplomacy stands, and whether you have been getting traction in your talks this week.\n\nShoukry: I believe there's as understanding of the dangers that are associated with obstruction of the Blue Nile or managing, whether it's the Grant Ethiopian Renaissance dam, or any other construction in a manner that is not consistent with international law, and with the best practices that govern transboundary water.\n\nI think we have always been advocating a cooperative relationship, but also one where there are specific legal commitments that guarantee both the optimum operation and utilization of the dam, and at the same time takes into account the interests and rights of the downstream riparian countries.\n\nWe have been in negotiations over this last decade, we have done so bilaterally, we have done so under the auspices and help of our partners, the United States, where we agreed politically and technically to a comprehensive agreement that was equitable and fair and where both sides made the necessary compromise. But unfortunately our Ethiopian partners did not sign that agreement whereas we did initially.\n\nSubsequently, we have negotiated under the auspices of the African Union, under two chairmen — President Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Tshisekedi of the Congo — and have had exploratory discussions and contexts of an informal nature that unfortunately have not resulted in any progress.\n\nSo we are somewhat dismayed, but we, I think, have also registered our objection at the [United Nations] Security Council on two occasions.\n\nAnd on this third occasion, where Ethiopia has undertaken unilateral action to fill the dam in contravention to the 2015 Declaration of Principles that had stipulated that Ethiopia would not undertake to fill or operate the dam without an agreement, we have again indicated that the statement issued, that we would be monitoring the situation. We called upon Ethiopia to undertake the filling and operations in a responsible manner; if they do so, we will hopefully continue to monitor.\n\nIf they deal with it irresponsibly, and affect the livelihoods of 140 million Egyptians and Sudanese, then I'm sure we will do everything possible to protect our interests.\n\nAl-Monitor: Has the situation in Tigray complicated your diplomacy on the Nile Dam issue?\n\nShoukry: Well, that's a question maybe you should pose to our Ethiopian brothers. We have always isolated the negotiations from any extraneous political circumstances either in Egypt or in Ethiopia. I would hope that there would be a recognition of the importance of this issue in its own right, so that it is given the necessary attention from other Ethiopian brothers, irrespective of other issues that they might be dealing with.\n\nAl-Monitor: The Ukraine war has been top of the agenda this week in New York. Egypt’s economy has taken a hit because of the war. What is your message on Russia and Ukraine?\n\nShoukry: We are interested that this crisis be resolved diplomatically, that there will be a cessation of military activity so as to relieve the impact —whether in terms of destruction or on civilian populations — and that there have to be efforts exerted on both sides to encourage a political and diplomatic solution.\n\nWe have certainly also — along with a large number of countries of the south — suffered dramatically from the consequences after two years of COVID-19, but we were able to continue to grow.\n\nWe were again affected by the Ukrainian crisis in food security, rising costs of fuel and the pressures they have put on our budgets.\n\nBut the seriousness of the food security issue has to be recognized, and I believe is recognized at the international level. We hope that the mechanisms in place to both the food corridor that was agreed to by the United Nations should be expanded — there should be more transparency in the distribution mechanisms — and other mechanisms that can be put in place by the international community to take advantage of surpluses in food production across the globe should be implemented.\n\nThis is a serious issue for many of the developing countries, and I think it needs, again, cooperation at the international level to be able to offset what could be a source of instability that will have ramifications far beyond national borders.\n\nAl-Monitor: Just this year, Egypt again played a key role, and it's diplomacy to defuse tension between Israel, and this time it's Islamic Jihad, but the situation in the West Bank seems to be getting worse, and this week we saw the speeches first by Israeli Prime Minister Lapid calling for a two-state solution, and then President Abbas' speech today saying that not enough attention has been given to the issue, and he doesn't have an interlocutor in Israel. Where does Egypt stand on the issue? What is your reaction to both the Lapid speech and the Abbas speech today?\n\nShoukry: I recognize that Prime Minister Lapid has publicly indicated his support of a two-state solution. This is something that we have constantly advocated in our discussions both with the Israeli government and our partners in the European Union and the United States, and we hope that the solution will be fulfilled. We recognize of course that in Israel there are upcoming elections, and the necessity to await the electoral process and the composition of a new Israeli government.\n\nWe hope that that government will endorse the two-state solution and effectively reinitiate negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and implement them. It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions.\n\nMore than three decades after Oslo, the vision of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, living side by side in security and peace with Israel, has not been achieved.\n\nAnd I can understand the disappointment that was conveyed in President Abbas’ speech for exactly the same reason.\n\nAl-Monitor: Regarding US-Egypt relations, the Biden administration is again withholding $130 million of $300 million in conditioned aid for human rights concerns; $75 million was released because of the release of political prisoners recently in Egypt. But human rights remains top of mind among many members of Congress, as well as human rights and civil society organizations. Can you comment on your response to another decision to condition aid, and the overall situation regarding human rights in Egypt when you hear these charges about political prisoners, crackdown on the press and others?\n\nShoukry: First of all, I think the Egyptian-US relationship is multifaceted and has been beneficial to both sides and continues to be upheld by both sides.\n\nSo we have on many occasions indicated our belief, and the value of the strategic nature of this relationship continues to advance the various areas of cooperation that are beneficial both to our development and ability to meet the challenges within our region, and to also benefit the United States.\n\nWe are always conveying our appreciation for the amount of support we have received from the United States, support that has also benefited the United States in Egypt's ability to meet the challenges of the region, and to cooperate and synergize the United States and US forces, as was demonstrated on various occasions when the need arose that we should act together in terms of the convergence of our policies’ and objectives’ conditionality.\n\nRegarding the decision on the part of the United States Congress, we will continue to address the issues of human rights from the perspective of our commitment to enhancing and promoting the human rights of our citizens, our children and grandchildren, and we do so within the conditions that are prevalent and within the confines of the laws and regulations that have been issued through a legislative process.\n\nWe will continue to evaluate our own progress in these issues, and the Egyptian people will be the final judge of the degree of the fulfillment of their aspirations.\n\nCertainly we have made progress, and will continue to implement our national human rights strategy, and to deal with these issues within the context of the political dialogue that has been initiated, and the general conditions in Egypt, whether in terms of the political, economic, cultural conditions that govern any countries, application of rights and liberty.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is it fair to say, because the National Commission on Human Rights and the dialogue, which you began last year, are two major initiatives by the government to deal with human rights — does the government recognize that these are issues to be addressed, and that those two initiatives are taken as priorities to show progress?\n\nShoukry: Egypt is no different from any other government. I think any other government that would deny that there is room for improvement in the areas of human rights would call to doubt its sincerity in applying itself effectively in this area. I don't want to comment on others, but I believe that we all have room to improve our application of the principles, values and standards of human rights.",
    "The real reason Egypt is moving its capital": "In 2015, Egypt’s government announced it would build a new capital city, about 45 kilometers outside of Cairo, the current capital. It was a shocking announcement since Cairo, a city of more than 20 million people, has been the capital of Egypt for decades.\n\nThe government claims that Cairo has become too overcrowded and that moving the capital will give both Cairo’s residents and government workers more space. But this excuse is not new. For decades, Egypt’s rulers have been building brand new cities in the desert. None of them have solved Cairo’s density issue. And based on how construction is going, this new capital won’t be a solution either.\n\nSo, why does Egypt want a new capital? Well, it has a lot to do with the political revolution in 2011.\n\nWatch this episode of Vox Atlas to understand the real reason behind Egypt’s giant new capital city.\n\nYou can find this video and more on Vox’s YouTube Channel.",
    "Egypt condemns violations against Aqsa Mosque sanctity, says Israeli breaches undermine two-state solution": "Israeli forces take their positions on the roof of Al-Aqsa Mosque - WAFA\n\nCAIRO – 26 September 2022: Egypt’s Foreign Ministry condemned on Monday Israeli repeated and escalating violations against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque by some extremist Jewish elements while being observed by the Israeli occupation forces.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry warned against continuing such breaches, imposing restrictions on the movement of Palestinian worshippers, attempting to change the current legal and historical situation of Jerusalem.\n\nThe ministry stressed that such practices represent a “flagrant violation of the international law and a dangerous escalation that undermines the chances of achieving fair and just settlement of the Palestinian cause and reaching the two-state solution.\n\nThe ministry warned of the extreme danger of the continuation of such provocative practices in the vicinity of the Islamic holy sites, affirming that they raise the state of tension, fuel violence, and put more obstacles in the way of efforts to resume the peace process.\n\nThis morning, a large number of Israeli policemen stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City to offer protection to Jewish fanatics who broke into the compound, reported the Palestinian news agency WAFA.\n\nOfficials at the Islamic Waqf, which oversees the affairs of Al-Aqsa Mosque, said the police attacked Muslim worshippers while performing the dawn prayers and forced them to leave the area as Jewish fanatics gathered outside the Magharbe Gate while planning to enter the Muslim holy place under Israeli occupation forces’ protection.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian agency, Jewish fanatic groups have urged their followers to storm Al-Aqsa Mosque over the coming weeks as they mark Jewish holidays in an effort to change the status quo at the Mosque given that non-Muslims are banned from praying or performing any rituals within the walled compound.",
    "Egypt Is Hosting COP27. Can It Become Africa’s Climate Champion?": "With Egypt hosting this year’s UN climate summit, the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties (COP27), Cairo has positioned itself as Africa’s climate leader and aims to secure funds to help developing countries’ adaptation efforts. But as the country prepares the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh for the November summit, some critics question whether Egypt can be a leader on climate action while it continues to stifle civil society and rely on fossil fuels.\n\nWhy is COP27 important for Egypt and the rest of Africa?\n\nCOP summits have been the premier global forum for climate negotiations since 1995 and produced the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to prevent the global average temperature from rising 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels. Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi says Egypt will use its role as host to advocate for the interests of African and other developing nations. Despite contributing relatively little to global greenhouse gas emissions, developing countries are among the hardest hit as climate change exacerbates food insecurity, water scarcity, and extreme heat, among other problems, and experts warn that they lack the resources to adapt on their own.\n\nCairo appears to have organized COP27 around the goal of increasing climate finance, or investment in efforts to adapt to the consequences of climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, climate expert Karim Elgendy says. This would largely mean implementing commitments already pledged in previous talks. Of particular concern is the $100 billion in annual funding that wealthy governments agreed to provide low-income countries via the Green Climate Fund, a target they missed by more than $16 billion in 2020.\n\nWhat has Egypt done so far on climate?\n\nEgypt has undertaken some major mitigation efforts over the past two decades, such as increasing its wind energy capacity fivefold. It has also pursued adaptation initiatives, including the construction of desalination plants and flood-prevention infrastructure to cope with worsening water stress. It was the first government among Middle Eastern and North African countries to issue green bonds, directing $750 million toward clean public transport and sustainable water management. Since being named COP27 host about a year ago Egypt has announced a raft of climate-related projects, including plans to transform tourist hotspot Sharm el-Sheikh into a “green city.”\n\nAhmed Gomaa/Xinhua/Getty Images Concrete barriers used against sea-level rises are seen along the coastline in Alexandria, Egypt. Email Share Share\n\nHowever, independent climate watchdogs such as the Climate Change Performance Index and the Climate Action Tracker call the country’s overall climate policy opaque and unambitious. Part of the problem is a heavy reliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels, which accounted for about 90 percent of its power generation capacity in 2019. Cairo seeks to increase the country’s oil and natural gas production and is among lower-income countries that argue they should be able to economically develop with fossil fuels until they can afford to transition to clean energy.\n\nWhat are the concerns over Egypt hosting?\n\nAnalysts warn that Egypt’s fossil fuel dependence could undermine its climate leadership at COP27. Critics also accuse Egypt of intentionally overselling its eco-friendly attitude, a practice known as “greenwashing,” to distract from its poor human rights record. Amnesty International argues that Cairo is using the summit as a “rebranding exercise” to deflect criticism of its authoritarian crackdown, which has included blocking independent news outlets and jailing thousands of journalists, protesters, and activists since 2013. Though street protests are illegal, the government will allow demonstrations at a space adjacent to the climate conference. Still, it’s unlikely that protests at COP27 will resemble the high-profile demonstrations that have occurred at past conferences. However, some Egyptian activists hope the heightened attention on Egypt will push the government to loosen its grip on civil society.\n\nOther critics are unimpressed by Egypt’s lack of interest in lowering emissions. By the Paris Agreement timeline, Cairo was more than a year late in updating its nationally determined contribution (NDC) [PDF], a country’s voluntary plan for reducing its own emissions. Egypt’s new NDC is contingent on international support, and like many other countries, it lacks a quantifiable target for reaching net-zero emissions. Furthermore, in its 2022 National Climate Change Strategy [PDF], Cairo focuses on adaptation rather than reducing emissions.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Egypt already signed a new gas delivery deal with the European Union and Israel, and officials have said Egypt will only set a net-zero target if it gets more financial assistance. This reluctance to commit to emissions reduction suggests a continued focus on climate finance Elgendy says. Still, he says, “all climate action is welcome as a step forward.”",
    "Egypt explores production of green fuels for ships": "September 26, 2022\n\nCAIRO — Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi recently issued directives to accelerate cooperation with Danish shipping giant Maersk to produce green energy and clean fuels for ships.\n\nThe directives came during Sisi’s meeting Sept. 19 with Maersk CEO Soren Skou. The two discussed a project to produce clean fuel for ships in Egypt with investments worth $15 billion, which will provide more than 100,000 job opportunities for Egyptians.\n\nA statement published by the Egyptian presidency following the meeting said that “cooperation with Maersk to produce green and clean fuel for ships comes in line with the state's efforts to diversify energy sources and shift to a clean energy and preserve environment. It also comes in light of the modern ports Egypt has now established along the coasts of the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea, as well as the Suez Canal waterway, the main lifeline of international trade.”\n\nThe meeting comes as Egypt gears up to host the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Climate Convention (COP27), which will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh in November.\n\nLt. Gen. Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) who attended the meeting, said in a phone interview with the local channel TEN on the same day (Sept. 19), “President Sisi affirmed his full support for the project to produce clean fuel for ships with Maersk Group and his help to complete all necessary matters for the implementation of this project in the coming period.”\n\nThe project’s execution schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nRabie further pointed out that Sisi asked Maersk during the meeting to expand the implementation of the project beyond the Ain Sokhna port and establish more than one plant for clean energy at ports such as in Gargoub, Alexandria and Berenice. The company promised to consider this, he added.\n\nRabie also praised the great cooperation between the SCA and Maersk, which will be strengthened during the coming period through training of SCA guides and administrative cadres.\n\nAccording to the Sept. 19 presidency statement, Skou applauded the SCA “for undergoing development, keeping pace with the latest modern technologies, as well as modernizing the Suez Canal and its infrastructure.”\n\nHe added, “This, in turn, would make Egypt qualified to become the main and pivotal hub for supplying and refueling ships with green fuel in the region.”\n\nIn this vein, Paul Sullivan, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center, told Al-Monitor, “Having cleaner energy options for shipping is very important. CO2 emissions from shipping are estimated to be around 3% of the total global emissions. Anyone observing these ships in motion can often see darker smoke as they warm up the engines for the long voyages ahead.”\n\nSullivan added, “Any efforts that would successfully reduce emissions and pollution from giant ships are welcome. The distribution of clean fuel to ships in Egyptian ports is a great milestone for Egypt.”\n\nHe noted that finalizing the agreement on the project with Maersk before COP27 is very important for Egypt. “Through this project, Egypt can secure great opportunities for training, education and employment for Egyptians,” he said.\n\nSullivan further praised the project as a good option for Egypt, given the importance of the Suez Canal in the region. “The fuel provided through this project will be the cleanest energy available to ships and will constitute a good step forward.”\n\nWael Kaddour, former SCA vice chairman, told Al-Monitor that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of the United Nations began implementing its resolution to cut emissions from ships at the beginning of 2020, and thus ships are forced to use fuel with less emissions.\n\nIn 2018, the IMO set a goal of reducing carbon emissions from ships to 50% by 2050.\n\nKaddour said, “The whole world is keeping a watchful eye on climate change and its negative effects on peoples. Some ships began to use fuels that contain less sulfur, such as methanol, in order to reduce environmental pollution. Others are trying to use the so-called clean and green fuels but are hindered by its high cost exceeding $200 per ton compared to conventional fuels such as diesel and gasoline.”\n\nHe indicated that cooperation between the Egyptian government and Maersk is part of Egypt's efforts to preserve the environment and falls within the framework of its organization of the upcoming climate summit.\n\n“Egypt has capabilities to use liquefied gas as fuel for ships since it has good gas reserves and liquefaction stations, and all it needs are units to transport fuel from the liquefaction stations to the ports and to establish stations in the ports that supply ships with this type of fuel,” Kaddour said.\n\nHe believes that “Egypt will achieve many gains from its cooperation with Maersk for the production of clean fuel. The latter will be providing refueling services for all transiting ships, which creates an additional advantage for the Suez Canal, turning it into a source for supplying ships in the region with liquefied gas or hydrogen. This project will also create a lot of job opportunities for Egyptians.”",

    "Egypt is hosting COP27. What are the expectations?": "As the host country for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) from November 6-18, Egypt has a huge role to play during its presidency of the event, as all eyes will be geared towards how the country can lead by example. To put things in perspective, with 1.3 percent of the world’s population, Egypt accounts for only 0.6 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and ranks twenty-eighth on the global list of polluters. This number appears to be relatively small from a global perspective. Regionally, however, Egypt contributes 31 percent of the overall GHG emissions from North Africa and 13 percent of the overall GHG emissions from the entire African continent. Thus, Egypt has a great responsibility to establish a pathway towards a green energy transition.\n\nThis year, Egypt’s presidency for COP is very important as a middle-income, African, and Middle Eastern country hosting this event. Egypt may, therefore, be able to influence the agenda items and bring more focus to Africa’s increasing needs for adaptation and mitigation financing.\n\nThe agenda for COP27 includes four main items to be discussed: climate finance, adaptation, loss and damage, and increased ambition. On climate finance, there is a need to ensure that developed countries will fulfill their commitment to developing countries in regard to the $100 billion per year financing pledge, as promised in COP15 in Copenhagen. Since the establishment of the Paris Climate Accords in 2015, there hasn’t been a single year where the $100 billion per year financing target has been met. The closest registered record towards this target was in 2021, where $80 billion were raised through public and private sources.\n\nThere is a serious need to reach this goal as climate impacts are causing global suffering on a rampant scale. In addition to the $100 billion goal, there also is a need to agree on a post-2025 climate finance arrangement that is significantly larger in number, in addition to setting up adequate rules to enforce this commitment.\n\nOn adaptation, COP27 is considered to be an ‘African COP,’ as it is taking place in one of the continents most effected by climate change. Therefore, stakeholders are expecting to witness a higher political desire to increase global funding for adaptation policies. Currently, 80 percent of the overall climate finance portfolio is dedicated to mitigation, while only 20 percent goes to adaptation. This is often due to the fact that mitigation projects are bankable projects with decent return on investment potential, such as solar and wind energy projects.\n\nHowever, adaptation projects are less investible by nature, as they are geared towards assisting local communities to adapt to the consequences of the changing climate. These projects are often not bankable and less appealing to financiers. In addition, adaptation projects are often needed by the most vulnerable communities, which often lack the capacity to develop the sophisticated proposals for climate finance that can garner support from financial institutions, agencies, or governments. So, this year, there is a direct need to obtain assistance for one of the most vulnerable continents and help them adapt to climate change in a fair and just manner.\n\nThird, loss and damage has become a contentious subject that has been discussed for several years, with no consensus on any enforceable work plan. Some countries will have complete losses and irreversible damage due to climate change, whether it relates to a small island state that will be completely inundated from sea level rise; or the complete bleaching of coral reefs in some seas; or, the extinction of particular flora and fauna from ecosystems based on global warming. The topic can be divided into economic losses that include damages to resources and goods and services, such as agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, etc., and non-economic losses that include loss of family members, disappearance of culture and ways of living, or migration from one’s home.\n\nLoss and damage differ from mitigation and adaptation, in that it tackles how to help people after they have experienced climate-related impacts, while mitigation works on preventing it and adaptation on minimizing it. The Paris Agreement made only the intention to address loss and damage with technical assistance, but explicitly it did not include any liability or compensation for it by developed countries. There have been several attempts to establish a finance mechanism for loss and damage, but they have repeatedly failed.\n\nThe problem also lies in criteria setting towards who gets priority and why. Do entire populations that have to be relocated (due to their homes on an island being inundated) take precedence over crops—which feed the poor—that may go instinct? Not only is the criteria and priority setting a daunting task, but the mere request for additional financing from the international community for ‘loss and damage’ has been completely pushed back in previous negotiation rounds by both the United States and the European Union. Hence, setting up a financing facility will take center stage at COP27.\n\nFinally, the fourth agenda point is increasing ambition. This entails consolidating the concurrent political commitments by different stakeholders and the wider global community towards the climate cause. The February report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that we must stay below a 1.5 °C temperature increase mark to avoid a climate disaster, and that we only have a decade remaining until the carbon budget is used up entirely. The report also mentioned that, by 2030, emission levels should be halved to meet this target. In other words, the international community has less than ten years to act.\n\nBased on the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, if all Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets that were pledged for the Paris agreement were implemented, the international community would still head towards a 2.4°C increase, with a worst-case scenario of 2.8°C—if not all pledges are met—and a best-case scenario of 1.8 °C—if all new actions in Glasgow are implemented. This is still above the 1.5 °C mark. Therefore, the expectations in Sharm el-Sheikh is that all countries would increase their ambitions and place new pledges to reduce their emissions and stay below the 1.5 °C mark.\n\nAs a new study reveals, Egypt and the Middle East are warming up faster than the rest of the world, with a predicted 5°C increase in warming by the end of the century. There is also much at stake in Sharm el-Sheikh, as the war in Ukraine is affecting food and energy prices and availability. Egypt has a significant role to play in Sharm el-Sheikh to promote these four key agenda items highlighted above. Egypt is also expected to continue to voice the demands and expectations of the global south—especially those of its direct African neighbors.\n\nLama El Hatow is a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s empowerME Initiative.

    "Egypt on a budget": "Budget travelers are surprised at how cheap it can be to explore Egypt. You don't need to break the bank to have a truly immersive experience here, and with a little research and planning, you’ll make the most out of your time and money.\n\nIf you opt for local food and embrace the hostel life, you can explore much of Egypt on a budget while still occasionally indulging in some luxurious yet affordable treats.\n\nImmerse yourself in the best experiences the world has to offer with our email newsletter delivered weekly into your inbox.\n\n1. Who said you have to start your Egypt adventure in Cairo?\n\nSecuring a cheap flight is the gateway to a budget-friendly trip, and if you have destinations on your Egypt itinerary beyond Cairo (and you should!), you can save hundreds by booking a flight into one of the country’s other international airports.\n\nFlying into Egypt through Luxor, Aswan, Hurghada, Sharm El Sheikh, Marsa Alam or Alexandria could cost you less than half the price of a flight into the capital.\n\n2. Choose budget accommodations\n\nTo save on accommodations in Egypt, choose shared hostel dorms, camps and basic hotel rooms. You’ll find many options in every part of the country, with some beds going for less than US$20 per night. Sharing rooms with multiple single beds is a great way to save money if you’re traveling with friends.\n\nFor budget hotels, expect to pay between $25 to $50 per night for a double room depending on the city and season.\n\n3. When in Cairo, stay in the heart of the city\n\nCairo overwhelms the senses – there’s a lot to see, eat and experience. To maximize your time in Cairo without wasting your day in the capital's notorious traffic, book a room in the heart of the city, which makes all the sights are more easily accessible.\n\nDowntown Cairo offers a large selection of budget-friendly accommodations, including boutique hotels, hostels and Airbnbs that put the Egyptian Museum and the Nile within walking distance. Staying central also means easy access to public transportation and quick pickups from ride-hailing apps to get to spots like Khan Al Khalili, Islamic Cairo and the Giza Plateau.\n\n4. Eat like a local\n\nFood plays an important role in Egyptian culture, and there's no more satisfying way to learn about local life than by eating your way through Egypt's hearty street food.\n\nIn Egypt, Egyptian cuisine tends to be cheaper than international food, and you'll find an array of delicious, cheap and diverse options.\n\nThe plethora of street food vendors, especially in Cairo, offer many delicacies for you to choose from, including vegetarian and vegan options. You can get a complete meal on the go for just $2. Meals in local sit-down restaurants range from $5 to $12.\n\nIf you have a kitchen in your accommodations, pick up fresh fruits and vegetables from the many carts dotting every street to make a meal.\n\nFew markets and shops in Egypt have fixed prices, so bargain respectfully to bag a good deal © Joshua Dalsimer / Getty Images\n\n5. Practice the art of bargaining\n\nYou spot a souvenir you’d love to take home with you, but the seller just hit you with an absurdly high number. Don’t give up: this is part of the process. Street vendors usually hike up prices for foreigners, but if you respectfully haggle, you could get a great deal.\n\nConfidently hit back with a little less than half the quoted price. You’ll likely enter a tennis match of the seller slowly increasing the price and you slowly lowering it until you eventually meet somewhere in the middle.\n\nStreet sellers can be a little aggressive in Egypt, and you’ll find yourself saying \"no thank you\" often. Don’t feel obliged to buy something you don’t want – simply offer a friendly smile and move on.\n\nAsk around in other shops to gauge the average cost. Don’t commit to the first price you’re offered, be smart about your dealings and flex your negotiation muscles.\n\n6. Master public transportation\n\nIn Egypt's bigger cities, public transportation costs a fraction of the price of hiring a private driver. Using public buses, trams and Cairo's Metro can also be easier than negotiating a taxi fare. Cairo has many companies running public bus services, but Mwasalat Misr is the most reliable, the most economical and the easiest to navigate.\n\nRide-hailing apps – Uber, Careem, Swvl and Didi work in some of Egypt's cities– are much cheaper in Egypt than abroad. They also provide several ride modes that are cheaper than a car, including scooters and buses.\n\nFor domestic traveling, trains and buses are more budget-friendly than flying. You can travel from Cairo to Alexandria for $5 on a five-hour train ride. A 12-hour train ride south to Luxor and Aswan costs around $10.\n\nIf you’re planning to travel to Sinai, Siwa or other destinations not on the train network, you have plenty of bus travel companies to choose from. Go Bus is one of the more popular choices and can be booked online in advance, with the average ticket costing around $10.\n\nIf you’re traveling between Cairo, Luxor and Aswan and want to save even more, opt for the sleeping train or an overnight bus ride and save a night on accommodations.\n\nPick up a Cairo Pass to save money on your visit to the Pyramids of Giza and other sights around the capital © David Sacks / Getty Images\n\n7. Buy a Cairo Pass and a Luxor Pass\n\nIf your Egypt itinerary includes a lot of museums and archaeological sites around Cairo and Luxor, it makes financial sense to buy a Cairo Pass and a Luxor Pass.\n\nThe Cairo Pass gives access to all of the main sites and museums in Cairo and Giza for $100. It's valid for five days, with unlimited entries to sites like the Egyptian Museum, the Pyramids of Giza, Saqqara and Dahshur.\n\nYou can purchase a pass at the Egyptian Museum, the Giza Plateau or the Citadel. A ticket to the Giza Plateau alone costs around $40, so the Cairo Pass could save you a bundle.\n\nThe standard Luxor Pass ($100) gives you access to all archaeological sites on both the east bank and west bank of Luxor, except for the tombs of Seti I and Nefertari, which are included in the more expensive (but still money-saving) premium Luxor Pass ($200). You can purchase the Luxor Pass at Karnak or the Valley of the Kings.\n\nTo buy a pass, you'll need your passport, two photocopies of your passport, two passport photos and the exact cost of the pass in cash. Travelers with valid student IDs get 50% off the pass price.\n\nDaily costs",
    "Salah boost for Liverpool ahead of hectic schedule as Egypt star returns early from international duty": "Salah boost for Liverpool ahead of hectic schedule as Egypt star returns early from international duty\n\nLiverpool have been boosted by the news that Mohamed Salah has been released from the Egypt squad ahead of a hectic schedule at domestic level.\n\nStar forward heading back to Anfield\n\nWon't take part in international friendly\n\nLooking to rediscover top form for Reds\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? The Reds, who have made a slow start to the 2022-23 campaign by their own high standards, have 12 games to take in across Premier League, Carabao Cup and Champions League competition before elite club football shuts down for the World Cup.\n\nJurgen Klopp has already had to deal with a number of untimely injuries this season, but will be relieved to hear Salah will be well rested before top-flight action in England resumes at the weekend.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID: A statement from the Egyptian FA regarding the decision to send a national hero back to Anfield rather than have him line up in a meaningless friendly reads: “The technical staff of the Egyptian national team preferred to rest Mohamed Salah and Mostafa Mohamed for the Liberia friendly after both took part in the previous match against Niger.”\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: Egypt face with Liberia on Tuesday, but Salah – who netted twice in a 3-0 victory over Niger last time out – will play no part in that contest as he returns to Merseyside for a well-earned break.\n\nIN THREE PHOTOS:\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Salah has been directly involved in 11 goals in his 10 Premier League games against Brighton, scoring six and assisting five. However, the only two occasions he’s failed to register a goal involvement against the Seagulls have come in games at Anfield.\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR SALAH? Liverpool host Brighton on Saturday and have clashes with Rangers, Arsenal, Manchester City, Ajax, Napoli and Tottenham to come over the course of seven busy weeks. They will want Salah to start firing on all cylinders as he only has two Premier League goals so far this season.",
    "Demand for Egypt Travel Is Growing": "Before COVID-19, bucket list trips were something people talked about doing, saving them for milestone occasions or holding off for retirement. Post COVID-19, that’s changed. People aren’t waiting anymore. One of the destinations that’s benefitting the most from people’s desires to see the world while they can is Egypt.\n\nThough tourism numbers aren’t what they were in 2019 (which saw the second highest arrival numbers in a decade), arrivals are up dramatically over the past two years with U.S. travelers a driving force the growth. In fact, by 2024, air lift from the U.S. is expected to exceed 2019 levels.\n\nSuppliers catering to the North American market are reacting to the demand.\n\n“Our cruises on the Nile are some of our most popular cruises,” Stefanie Schmudde, vice president of product development & operations at Abercrombie & Kent told TMR recently. “We continuously add new departures for various journeys across Egypt at various price points and they sell out regardless.”\n\nAmaWaterways, which launched its first Nile River ship last year, is also seeing “extremely strong demand” for its Nile River cruises. So much so, that it’s adding a second ship in 2024.\n\n“We’ve seen such wonderful interest from both our loyal guests, as well as new guests since we launched our first ship there in September 2021,” said Kristin Karst, executive vice president and co-founder of AmaWaterways.\n\nViking is seeing much the same, according to Richard Marnell, executive vice president of marketing for the cruise line.\n\n“Our Egypt fleet is growing in response to the strong demand we have seen for our offerings in the region,” he said. The line, which last month launched a new purpose-built ship for the Nile, also has two more Nile River ships under construction.\n\nRiver cruise lines aren’t the only companies seeing strong demand for Egypt.\n\n“We are seeing a tremendous uptick in demand for Egypt relative to past years, to the point that Egypt is now the second most popular destination with our clients (behind Italy and ahead of Greece and France),” Kelly Torrens, vice president of product for Kensington Tours told TMR.\n\nIn comparison to 2019 numbers, the tour operator has seen a 50% increase in topline sales over the last 12 months, she added.\n\nShe heard the same thing from hoteliers in Cairo and Luxor during a recent trip there, who also reported very high occupancy levels throughout fall 2022.\n\n“Hotel management across both destinations report that the U.S. leisure market is driving the strongest demand,” she said.\n\nReasons for the Growing Demand\n\nKensington’s Torrens attributes the Egyptian travel demand surge to several factors.\n\n“Egypt qualifies as an ultimate bucket list destination, which is a highly appealing style of trip coming out of COVID-19,” she said.\n\nDanielle Griggs, ACC, owner of a Cruise Planners franchise, echoed Torrens.\n\n“COVID shocked everyone in the sense that it really did turn the world upside down and closed it for a while and people just realize that sometimes there is a limit on what’s available. So what are we waiting for? Let’s go out there and let’s do it… People are definitely going further, staying longer and spending more. They want to get back out into the world and really experience things and feel like they’re making up for lost time.”\n\nBucket list trips like going to Egypt are what’s scratching that itch for them, not the “same trip to the beach or three or four night Caribbean cruise” that they used to do.\n\nTorrens also said Egypt is benefitting from interest that might otherwise have been directed at longer-haul destinations, like Japan, Australia and New Zealand, which until recently have been pretty closed off to the rest of the world.\n\nSimilarly, international airlift to Egypt is currently more reliable and consistent than to other bucket list destinations across Asia Pacific, she said.\n\nA third factor Torrens cited is the country’s current political climate, which she said “is at its calmest since the Arab Spring.”\n\nGriggs also mentioned safety when talking about Egypt.\n\n“There’s definitely demand now that things are settled somewhat over there and Americans are feeling safer about it. On the supplier side, they understand out apprehension and are doing a lot of things to help tourists feel safer.”\n\nOn a recent fam trip to Egypt, Griggs said they always had one or two security guards with them wherever they went.\n\n“It wasn’t an overbearing presence at all. It sort of reminded me a little bit of secret service style, a guy in a spot coat with a little piece in his ear and wearing sunglasses… someone who was mindful of what we were doing and what was happening around us.”\n\nShe added that having security on hand helped people to enjoy the trip and immerse themselves in the experience without feeling like they had to look over their own shoulders.",
    "As Asian firms compete for Egyptian military aircraft deals, Cairo eyes local production": "BEIRUT — The recent visit of Indian defense minister Rajnath Singh to Egypt is only the latest sign of tightening defense ties between the two nations, one that could result in a joint manufacturing deal for light combat fighters.\n\nBut beyond the fighters themselves, analysts told Breaking Defense that should the deal go down, Egypt stands to gain something more valuable: advanced production knowledge.\n\n“Cairo is looking not only to diversify procurement options but also to localize production with the goal of developing domestic defense capabilities,” said Mohammed Soliman, a manager at McLarty Associates, and non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute. “It is important to think from a lens that underlines strategic resiliency and effectiveness rather than efficiency. Egypt wants to become a middle power in terms of developing resilient and indigenous military capabilities, which would allow Cairo to withstand great power competition.”\n\nPrivileged to call on the President of Egypt, H.E. Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi in Cairo today. India and Egypt continue to work on enhancing mutual trust and confidence. It was reaffirmed that both the countries are committed to expanding our multi-faceted cooperation. pic.twitter.com/dFJkMswXJi — Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) September 19, 2022\n\nDuring Singh’s visit, he signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with his Egyptian counterpart, Gen. Mohamed Zaki, that states the two countries would enhance defense cooperation. That general commitment comes months after Indian and Egyptian media reported in late June that India had offered to set up production facilities in Egypt to produce Tejas Mk1A light combat aircraft and helicopters.\n\nBut India is not the only country trying to seal a defense aircraft deal with Egypt. In August South Korea, which recently inked artillery deals with the North African nation, reportedly offered its FA-50 trainers and light attack aircraft, also with local production in Egypt.\n\nLocalization Efforts\n\nSimilar to many regional Middle East states, Egypt is keen on localizing defense production but with a different business model than the Gulf states. Whereby other countries have target reaching 50 percent local production by 2030, Egypt is entering negotiations with Far East countries, namely India and South Korea, with production lines in mind and benefiting from the existing industrial infrastructure Cairo already has.\n\n“Indeed, there are ongoing negotiations between Egypt and India regarding the joint manufacturing of the Tejas fighter in Egypt,” Ahmad Eliba, a defense expert at the Egyptian Center for Strategic Studies told Breaking Defense. “As for the advanced infrastructure, there will certainly be a kind of assessment and study between the two counterparts. But Egypt already has aircraft manufacturing infrastructure since the early fifties.”\n\nEliba told Breaking Defense that the negotiations are advanced between the two sides, but no deal was finalized yet. Neither the Egyptian nor Indian governments, nor Tejas maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited responded to Breaking Defense’s requests for comments for this report.\n\n“I expect the next Defense Exhibition in Egypt, EDEX 2023 to witness an official announcement regarding the outcome of these negotiations just like the Howitzer deal with South Korea,” he added.\n\nShould the deal be signed, Eliba expected manufacture to take place at the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI), where the facilities are equipped for such type of production.\n\nBut in the wake of the $1.6 billion howitzer deal, South Korea hasn’t given up on potentially spoiling the India deal with its own offer of FA-50 light attack aircraft. On August 3, South Korea demonstrated T-50B trainer in an aerobatics demonstration at Egypt’s Pyramids Air Show.\n\nAlthough not confirmed officially, reported discussions between South Korea and Egypt for an FA-50 light attack aircraft have been ongoing. Korea recently netted a large FA-50 sale to Poland for dozens of jets.\n\nCurrently, the Egyptian Air Force operates a number of fighter jets of different origins including the F-16, Mirage, MiG 29 and Rafale.\n\nWhy India?\n\nIf the deal does go to India, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise, as it’s not the first defense cooperation between the two countries. Egyptian pilots have been historically trained by Indian Air Force pilots and there was a joint venture to manufacture the Helwan-300 (Kahira) fighter jet since 1960.\n\nThe formal Indo-Egypt Joint Defense Committee was set up in Aug 2006 in Cairo. Five such meetings have been held so far between the two sides.\n\nAccording to Eliba, India was Egypt’s choice for defense production for three main reasons.\n\n“First, there is an increased demand for this type of aircraft. Second, Cairo always works on the diversification of Cairo’s armament sources. And third, because of the possibility of technology transfer,” he said. “I think that Egypt, which has joint manufacturing with France, Italy and Germany, in the maritime sector, and with South Korea, China and the UAE in the UAVs domain, tends to diversify partnerships in the field of joint manufacturing.”\n\nEliba added that from an Egyptian perspective India is a technologically advanced country in the aircraft industry and has advanced military industries from which Middle East countries are interested in procuring to a large extent.\n\n“This cooperation will reciprocate benefits to both, as for India, Egypt is a gateway for the Middle East and North Africa defense market, and defense exhibitions like Edex will be very important for the Tejas aircraft itself, especially if the production takes place in Egypt,” he said.",

    "Good vs. Evil: Are There Two North Coasts in Egypt?": "Good vs. Evil: Are There Two North Coasts in Egypt?\n\nTo many Egyptians, summer means sahel. But what exactly does sahel mean?\n\nScattered on Egypt’s northern coastline, the resorts and compounds that lie between the cities of Alexandria and Marsa Matrouh are referred to as sahel (Arabic for coast), and for the past three decades, they have provided the perfect seaside respite for thousands upon thousands of Egypt’s middle and high income families.\n\nUntil recently, sahel could be summed up as the following: a place to let one’s hair down, swim, play games, eat simple food, and make up for any family time lost to the pace of city life. But this definition has begun to change. Or rather, a new face of sahel has emerged, creating along with it a new definition that now coexists, perhaps a little awkwardly, with the old one.\n\nNewer, trendier developments began to appear about halfway between Marsa Matrouh and Alexandria, and they came with a different identity, aesthetic, price point, and target audience. And while both sahels are bursting at the seams during the summertime, some began to feel as though this new side was diluting the real meaning of sahel.\n\nThe subtle tension between the two worlds of sahel became more tangible in the summer of 2020, when a series of internet memes coined terms to distinguish these two worlds: ‘el sahel el tayeb’ (‘good sahel’), and ‘el sahel el sherrir’ (‘evil sahel’). Though it is difficult to trace back the origins of the joke, or identify who first made it, the terminology spread like wildfire on social media, and has by now become a common phrase understood by the majority of the people who frequent Egypt’s north coast.\n\nWhile it is clear that ‘el sahel el tayeb’ refers to the traditional sahel and ‘el sahel el sherrir’ refers to the newer, trendier side of it, we asked the readers of Egyptian Streets if they can tell us what distinguishes the two in their opinion.\n\nHere is what they said:\n\nWhere you are\n\nOne of the rough rules of thumb sahel-goers have developed to distinguish ‘good sahel’ from ‘evil sahel’ is the location. When asked, most of our readers identified Marina, a once massively popular compound about 150 kilometers west of Alexandria, as the last point of ‘good sahel’. Everything further west was more likely to be considered ‘evil’.\n\nIn the past, Marina itself was the closest thing to what is now considered ‘evil’ as it was the ultimate hotspot for parties and social gatherings. However with time, its trendiness faded, and it became a no-man’s land that neither fully belongs to ‘good sahel’ nor to ‘evil sahel’. Public policy student Zeineldin Elkhabiry tells Egyptian Streets that, in his view, Marina acts as a “buffer” between the two.\n\n“Once you finish Marina, it’s sherrir. Marina is the Black Gates,” adds PeaceCake co-Founder Marwan Imam, making a reference to The Lord of the Rings.\n\nHow you get in\n\nLocation may be an indicator, but it is not always an entirely reliable one, as there are pockets of what is considered ‘good sahel’ hidden beyond Marina, in addition to the few dozen kilometers of coastline before Marsa Matrouh that are not home to new and trendy developments.\n\nWhat several readers did identify, however, is that compounds lumped into the ‘evil sahel’ category tend to be far more gatekept – and they meant that quite literally. The gates of the resorts and compounds that are considered ‘evil’ have far tighter security and more demanding entry requirements.\n\nYomna Elshobaky, who works as an account manager at a tech company tells Egyptian Streets that to enjoy ‘evil sahel’, there is a need to “drive miles and miles to enjoy a small spot on the beach after getting codes to enter and making reservations everywhere to secure a spot.”\n\nThis does not apply in so-called ‘good sahel’, where telling the security guards at the gates the number of the chalet you’re heading to is usually more than enough to get you inside.\n\nWhat you do and how much it costs you\n\nThough Twitter and Facebook gave space for more nuanced answers, readers on Instagram gave a nearly unanimous response on the key difference between the two sahels: the cost.\n\nWhile owning or renting a chalet or apartment is only accessible to middle and high income families regardless what part of sahel you are in, the ranges vary dramatically, as does the cost of everything you do while you are there.\n\nRestaurant and coffee house chains that are popular in Cairo are present in parts of ‘evil sahel’, but to their prices, the so-called sahel-tax is added: the price of the same drink from the same chain can vary differently from Cairo to sahel. Even the simple foods and activities associated with the old-school ‘good sahel’ are more expensive if they are found in the newer sahel. For instance if it costs you EGP 30 to buy feteer (a quintessentially Egyptian filled pastry) in ‘good sahel’, it could easily cost you three or four times that amount on the other side.\n\nIn a few parts of new sahel, the beaches themselves require an entry fee, something that does not exist in any part of old-school sahel. One of the most popular compounds has even built a yacht marina lined with high end restaurants and brand name shops.\n\nUniversity administrator Heba Mohamed tells Egyptian Streets that this also applies to children’s activities. Sahel has long since been the highlight of children’s years, and while traditionally this has always been due to the simple activities made available to them by the beach, there are now far more complex and pricy activities according to Mohamed, and she says that it has become more difficult for parents to provide their children with an enjoyable experience.\n\nComparing the cost of the same good or service in the two sahels does not fully capture the difference in cost alone, as many of our readers alluded to. Even were the feteer and the round at the billiards table priced identically, spending time in ‘evil sahel’ is far more reliant on consumption.\n\nThere is simply far more to attend, eat, drink, and buy there. While in a old-school sahel compound, as reader Lina Gado tells us, you may find a feteer and zalabya vendor, a cafeteria with a few games, a bike rental spot, and a small supermarket, a compound in the trendier sahel has multiple party venues, coffee shops, eateries, and home decor shops – even high end jewelers, clothing, and cosmetics shops.\n\nNot long before the summer, the TikTok account BubbleBurst, students at the American University in Cairo asked other students how much they spend in a day in Sahel. The lowest number mentioned was EGP 1000 (50 USD), while the highest was over EGP 10000 (USD 500).\n\n“I pay in dollars,” says one student in the video. In old-school sahel, a vacationer would be hard put to find anything to spend more than EGP 100 (USD 5) on.\n\nWhat you wear\n\nA beachside vacation needs the right swimwear, and that is another point of difference readers mentioned. Alia Soliman, who works in gender and development, tells Egyptian Streets that in evil sahel, you will only very rarely find hijab-friendly swimsuits, often referred to as burkinis. Often, women wearing such swimwear will receive funny looks from their fellow vacationers.\n\nOn the other hand, Soliman says that it is also very likely for a woman in a bikini to feel uncomfortable at a pool or beach in ‘good sahel’ as she will likely not be surrounded by others wearing the same style.\n\nDress code differences are not exclusively related to swimwear either. There appeared to be a general consensus amongst readers that the degree of effort put into outfit choices is another significant differentiator. While in old-school sahel people tend to wear what is comfortable and easy, many said that they feel pressured to dress in fancier, more coordinated and thoughtfully put-together outfits in the newer sahel. And outfit repeaters are heavily discouraged.\n\n“If you’re in a place where girls have a different slipper [for every] outfit, you’ve gone too far,” jokes computer engineer Rania Tarek.\n\nWhere you stand among peers\n\nIf there are so many complaints about the so-called ‘evil sahel‘, why then is it that it is still packed with people every single weekend from June until August? One of the most common themes named by our readers was that this was the result of peer pressure.\n\nArt history student Hagar Adam noted the element of social media. In the summer, the social media accounts of thousands of Egyptians are flooded with photographs and stories of them enjoying the most extravagant activities and parties in sahel, and it has begun to be seen as a sort of rite of passage. Something to be ‘in’ on.\n\nAdditionally, the ability to get into some of these locations has come to serve as a status symbol to many, and some find themselves feeling that asserting oneself as a member of this crowd is also a tool to prove oneself socially.\n\nComputer engineer Rofayda Karam argues that the newer sahel is a symptom of a growing tendency among Egyptians to focus on appearances. Showing peers that one is able to afford a certain lifestyle, a certain car, certain clothes, is one of the reasons this version of sahel is as popular as it is today.\n\n“[You know you’re in ‘evil’ sahel when people have a twang in their Arabic and the children speak English.” says marketer Ali Khaled, alluding to a tendency among some Egyptians to communicate with their children in English to appear well-off.\n\nWhat you make of it\n\nWhile Laila Fouad, who works in finance and economics, believes that the newer developments in sahel are built with poor use of the space and land they are in, she does not really buy into the tension between the two sahels.\n\n“Does someone want to be seen drinking their avocado super-smoothie by the beach in the morning and eating sushi at night, with access to a million types of [outings] where [they] will run into people they know,” asks Fouad. “Or do [they] want to just chill and go to the beach?”\n\n“I feel like you can do either wherever you are so this poses the question of why is this ‘beef’ there to begin with, or why is it a dichotomy of evil [or good] per se.”\n\nProfessor of journalism at the American University in Cairo, Nadine El Sayed and Egyptian Streets’ own Farah Rafik agree with Fouad, and generally argue that the peer pressure does not impose itself as many seem to argue that it does.\n\n“You want to party all night and wear make up to the beach and call it el sahel el sherrir pressure, that’s on you,” El Sayed says. “I mean you can be wherever you are on the coast and have the sherir or tayeb experience; nobody is forcing anybody to sleep in or wear lipstick.”\n\nRafik echoes this by saying that while in terms of location she usually finds herself in what is considered el sahel el sherrir, but she is always living the tayeb life.\n\n“[It’s] not about the location for me, its about what I can make out of it,” Rafik says. “So long as I am able to have good feteer, a place to swim, and a house to chill in, I’m good!”\n\nThere are also other readers who were not afraid to admit that they enjoy both kinds of sahel and that it simply depends on one’s mood. While sometimes what a vacationer is looking for is a relaxed, quiet, and inexpensive getaway from the social expectations of the city, the same vacationer might occasionally enjoy a more high-end gathering with friends, only with the added element of Egypt’s incomparable Mediterranean beaches.\n\nSubscribe to the Egyptian Streets’ weekly newsletter!
