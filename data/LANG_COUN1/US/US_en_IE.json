    "British Prime Minister to seek negotiated solution over Northern Ireland": "British Prime Minister Liz Truss is seeking a negotiated solution with the European Union to resolve tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, she said in an interview with CNN Sunday.\n\nThe Northern Ireland protocol was designed to maintain peace in the region following Brexit, and as a member of parliament, Truss introduced legislation to dissolve it. U.S. President Joe Biden has warned against disrupting peace in Northern Ireland, and the two leaders discussed the issue at their first in-person meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"What's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland,\" Truss said Sunday.\n\nTruss is also facing rising tensions from Commonwealth nations around the globe following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, which has reignited debates over whether the nations should sever ties with the British monarchy.\n\nTruss said she has seen an \"outpouring of love and affection\" for the late Queen, and she is very supportive of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"I think the Commonwealth is a force for good,\" she said. \"It's a believer in freedom and democracy, and we need more of that in a world where we are facing these authoritarian regimes who want to subvert those ideas.\"",
    "Shadow minister’s border poll remarks alarm Northern Ireland’s unionists": "Northern Ireland unionists have expressed alarm after the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would be prepared to call a referendum on Irish unity if certain conditions were met.\n\nKyle would set out the criteria for calling a border poll if Labour were in power, he told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show at his party’s conference.\n\n“If the circumstances emerge as set out in the Good Friday agreement, I as secretary of state, would not play games. I would call the border poll,” he said. “I am saying I am not going to be a barrier if the circumstances emerge.”\n\nUnder the 1998 agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would want the region to leave the UK – but the agreement does not specify the criteria, a vagueness that the UK government and unionists have been keen to maintain.\n\nThe Irish government, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) have pushed for clarity on the criteria, which would lay out the steps needed for a vote that could abolish the state of Northern Ireland and unify the island.\n\nKyle said Sinn Féin’s emergence as the biggest party in Northern Ireland and last week’s census results, which showed Catholics outnumbering Protestants, did not suffice. “We’re not even in that circumstance yet, so when we move towards the point where those circumstances set out in the Good Friday agreement start to emerge and it becomes a priority for the people of Northern Ireland, I will act,” he said.\n\nOn Monday the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, criticised the comments as an “unhelpful and ill-timed” distraction from the cost of living crisis and other problems facing Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pro-union Belfast News Letter newspaper said the Labour politician had muddied the waters on a border poll and that it was essential any UK government kept wide discretion. It said: “It is unfortunate that Mr Kyle has chosen this time to give succour to those who want to shatter the UK.”\n\nThe Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard welcomed Kyle’s comments as recognition that the current position was “unsustainable”. “It’s having your head in the sand simply to deny the fact that constitutional change is coming, that people are talking about this, civic society and political parties and all around us,” the South Down MP said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Ireland: Rights experts call for redress for 50 years of systemic racism in childcare institutions": "Citing information received, 10 experts issued a joint statement saying that systemic racism in childcare institutions between the 1940s and 1990s, has “resulted in the higher institutionalization rate of children of African and Irish descent”.\n\nDuring their prolonged time there, children were exposed to heightened risk of corporal punishment, sexual, physical and verbal abuse, with lifelong consequences, including infringing their right to enjoy the highest standard of physical and mental health. Some of them were also subjected to vaccine trials.\n\n🇮🇪#Ireland: UN experts call for adequate redress for victims of racial discrimination and systemic racism in Irish childcare institutions between the 1940s and 1990s. https://t.co/tFW4g6ufEg pic.twitter.com/sUZ8Hb0C1O — UN Special Procedures (@UN_SPExperts) September 23, 2022\n\nExchanging letters\n\nDespite welcoming the Irish Government’s Action Plan to provide tangible benefits for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions, the experts sent them a letter containing their allegations of racial discrimination in April.\n\nIn it, they raised the alarm that children of African and Irish descent were “subjected to differential treatment because of their race, colour and/or descent, leading to further violations of their human rights”.\n\nIn response, the Irish Government referred to the official State apology offered on 13 January 2021 in which the country recognized the “additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage”.\n\nIt continued, acknowledging that such “discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families”.\n\nStolen childhoods\n\nAlthough the State apology is an important element of the restorative justice process, the experts said it was “not enough”.\n\nBecause of the systemic racial discrimination that prevailed in the childcare institutions at the time, the experts underscored that they had, in effect, had their “childhood stolen” from them.\n\n“We are seriously concerned over the severe and continuing effects that racial discrimination and systematic racism have had on the lives of the adults who are currently seeking redress,” the statement read.\n\nRestorative justice\n\nUnder international law, States have an obligation to ensure accountability for past human rights violations and provide full reparation to the victims, when these violations still have an impact.\n\nThe independent experts called on the Irish Government to “take further action to provide those who were subjected to differential treatment in childcare institutions with effective remedies”.\n\nA future scheme to address rights violations, “must recognize and provide redress for all the human rights violations perpetrated against children during the entire duration of their stay in Irish institutions, including mother and baby homes, industrial schools, reformatories, Magdalen Laundries and analogous institutions, as well as life-long impacts”, the statement continued.\n\nIn conclusion, they noted that a proposed “Bill Payment Scheme” provides an avenue of redress “for the harms caused due to racial discrimination and systemic racism to which children of African and Irish descent were subjected”.\n\nUN experts\n\nSpecial Rapporteurs and independent experts are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country situation.

It's time to register to vote for the US midterm elections": "Democrats Abroad Ireland is encouraging some 25,000 eligible American voters in Ireland ahead to vote in the US midterm elections, which will this year be held on Tuesday, November 8.\n\nPatti Shields, chair of Democrats Abroad Ireland, recently told BreakingNews.ie that the group is encouraging Americans in Ireland to register to vote and request their ballots before October 5.\n\nUS citizens living (or working or traveling) outside the US have the right to vote in US Federal elections, which occur every two years and include all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives along with one-third of the US Senate seats.\n\nVoters living outside of the US can register to vote on VoteFromAbroad.org, which, although is a public service provided by Democratic Party Committee, voters from any party affiliation can use.\n\nShields said: \"When we do our VoteFromAbroad.org, our general voter outreach, which is really I'd say 90 percent of what I'm doing right now, we do that in a non-partisan way. We support the act of registering to vote without partisanship.\n\n\"The website we refer people to for voting is completely non-partisan in terms of you go all the way through the process of registering to vote, then at the end of the process if you care to hear more about Democrats Abroad it will take you to a page to go there.\"\n\nThe process to register to vote via VoteFromAbroad.org \"takes about seven minutes,\" Shields said.\n\n\"You need to know your old address, if you have an old social security number you need the last four digits but if you don't have that there are other ways to do it, the process itself is quite easy. You just need to do it far enough in advance.\"\n\nShe added: \"Some of the ballots are mailed, they're sent to some voters electronically... it varies by state, but most ballots need to be mailed back, or a copy needs to be mailed back.\n\n\"You need to mail something back. You just have to do it well enough in advance that it can be received in time for the election. The mail services in our current countries and the US I still don't think have fully recovered from Covid, things take a bit longer, so we're encouraging people to get out and do it sooner rather than later.\"\n\nThe first ballots began to be delivered on September 24, which Democrats Abroad marked with an online Ballot Day Rally, which featured candidates in some of \"the most competitive and crucial races in the country,\" as well as special guests, including Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, encouraging people to voters to complete and return their ballots.\n\nShields explained: \"In most states, you can electronically submit your ballot request and your registration completely electronically, so you don't even need a printer anymore... you can digitally capture your signature.\n\n\"We do one-on-one voter assistance and help them manage steps as simple as getting the piece of paper in front of the camera, that kind of thing.\n\n\"I think the fact that in the past three years there's been a growing number of voters and population moving here [in Ireland] and also them being very aware and very participative in the US electoral process just speaks to the relationship between the US and Ireland.\"",

    "Ireland to increase state pension for those who work beyond 66": "DUBLIN, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Ireland will offer anyone over 66 a higher state pension the longer they stay in work, sidestepping a recommendation by a government-appointed commission to gradually increase the retirement age to 68 to help fund the ageing population.\n\nUnder the proposed flexible model agreed by ministers on Tuesday, people will have the option from 2024 to continue working up until the age of 70 in return for a higher pension for each additional year they work.\n\nThe state pension currently stands at 253 euros per week for those who retire at 66. That will increase to 315 euros for anyone who stays in the workforce until the age of 70.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSocial insurance rates will gradually be increased over time to pay for the measures, the government said.\n\nSimilar to other countries, Ireland raised the retirement age to 66 in 2014 but it deferred plans to raise it to 67 last year and again to 68 in 2028 after the pension age became a major issue at the 2020 election.\n\nThe coalition instead appointed a Commission on Pensions, whose recommendations included gradually increasing the pension age so it reached 67 in 2031 and 68 in 2038 to help deal with what will become a major fiscal sustainability challenge.\n\nIreland has a young demographic profile compared to its EU counterparts but the old-age dependency ratio is set to rise sharply in the next two decades so that by 2050 there will be just over two people of working age for every person over 65, compared with almost four currently.\n\nThe finance department has estimated that by 2030 age-related expenditure is expected to cost an additional 3.3% of gross national income when compared to 2019 costs.\n\nMary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein, the largest opposition party that has a huge opinion poll lead ahead of elections in 2025, called the proposals \"a Trojan horse\" to essentially raise the pension age to 70.

    "Conor McMenamin: Northern Ireland winger cleared over historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan": "Conor McMenamin has been cleared to play in Northern Ireland's Nations League match against Greece on Tuesday as he will face no further action regarding a historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while an independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nImage: McMenamin (right) has played three times for Northern Ireland\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will give him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad. It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's a historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"\n\nAhead of Tuesday's match against Greece, Baraclough said on Monday it had been the right decision to keep McMenamin out of the Kosovo game, but that he was delighted to have him available again.\n\n\"I don't think we could take any chances as an association in light of what had happened a couple of days previously with Kyle (Lafferty),\" he said. \"The decision was taken, we see where it went, the disciplinary committee looked at that and now he is free to be with us tomorrow night which is good news.\n\n\"We couldn't be sure until we looked into it and that's what's been done. I think that was right. It was hard telling the lad, hard to give him the information and to deny him being with the squad and possibly making another cap but it was the right thing to be done.\"\n\nImage: Kyle Lafferty was sent home from Northern Ireland duty amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language\n\nLafferty was sent home from the squad on Friday after a video emerged of him appearing to use an alleged sectarian slur in an altercation with fans, sparking an investigation from his club Kilmarnock. The 35-year-old remains absent with that investigation ongoing.\n\nBaraclough confirmed the incident was believed to have happened after he had taken the players out for dinner last Tuesday evening as part of a team-bonding exercise, but said he had no regrets about doing so.\n\n\"We all went out, we all went to the restaurant and we all came back,\" he said. \"The players had a day off the next day, they're adults and they know they've got a responsibility. When they're away on international duty they're representing themselves, their clubs, their families and me.\n\n\"We can't keep them cooped up in a hotel, we've got to give them a certain amount of trust and hope that's the right thing to do.\n\n\"It might be something we have to look at but it's always served Northern Ireland teams well when we've had that time together. It was something we weren't expecting, to wake up to those sorts of headlines and that sort of news. It was disappointing.\"",
    "Shifting demographics stirs debate on Northern Ireland’s future": "New census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time ever.\n\nFor the first time in Northern Ireland’s history, new census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants.\n\nThe results have been described as “a seminal moment” by leaders of Irish republican parties – who favour the reunification of Ireland and draw most of their votes from the Catholic population, and have caused disquiet in unionist camps – who want to remain in the United Kingdom and are supported mostly by Protestants.\n\nWhile most of the island of Ireland gained independence from the UK a century ago, Northern Ireland was carved out in a way which explicitly aimed to maintain a permanent majority of pro-British Protestants.\n\nFor some, the new figures are thus another sign on the pathway to a united Ireland.\n\nJohn Finucane, a prominent member of the leading republican party Sinn Fein, called for preparations for the “possibility of a unity referendum”.\n\n“The partition of Ireland has been a failure. We can build a better future together, for every person who lives on this island,” the MP said upon the announcement of the results.\n\nComplex picture\n\nHowever, caution is required when interpreting the results and their political applications, Peter McLoughlin, a senior lecturer in political history at Queens University Belfast, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPeople from a Catholic background are not a majority of the total population, and nor do they all necessarily support a united Ireland.\n\n“While we can say there is a very strong link between religion and political orientation, there are exceptions to the rule on both sides,” McLoughlin said.\n\nNonetheless, Northern Ireland’s history means that the fact that Catholics are now the larger group is clearly “symbolically and historically important” and will add to unrest among unionist political parties who have seen their position change in years.\n\nIn 2017, unionist parties lost their majority for the first time in the local legislature.\n\nEarlier this year, Sinn Fein gained the largest number of seats in the May elections, the first time a republican party has managed to do so.\n\nAnother worrying trend for unionists is that the number of people who defined their identity as “British only” dropped by 8 percent since the last poll in 2011.\n\nIt was noticeable that both main unionist parties briefed the media to downplay the significance of the results before they were even announced.\n\nWhat is clear is that unionists – or indeed, Irish republicans – will need to reach beyond those who identify as Catholic or British, Irish or British, in order to have enough support for their cause.\n\nMiddle ground\n\nAbout one in five people identify as “Northern Irish” and may well support parties like Alliance, who do not take a stance on reunification and made significant gains in elections this May.\n\nKellie Armstrong, a representative of the Alliance party in the local legislature, told Al Jazeera that the census figures demonstrate that many people like her do not want to be “pigeonholed” as British or Irish.\n\n“It just shows that we’re no longer a place of two parts, that we are actually a more pluralist and a much more diverse Northern Ireland,” she said.\n\nAny referendum on Irish unity “will be a lot more nuanced and it will be people like myself, people who are Northern Irish, the people who have not defined themselves by religious terms, that will actually decide whether there should be a border poll [referendum], and what that border poll like outcome will be”, Armstrong said.\n\nGrowing diversity\n\nThe census also shows the small but growing part of the population who are from Black or minority ethnic backgrounds or have migrated to Northern Ireland from the EU and elsewhere.\n\nThose from a minority ethnic background now make up 3.6 percent of the population – four times what it was in 2001 at the end of the 30-year armed conflict, and more than 100,000 people recorded their place of birth as outside of Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile most people speak English, more people now speak Polish or Lithuanian than the indigenous languages, Irish or Ulster Scots.\n\nHowever, a parliamentary inquiry from earlier this year found that politics is not keeping pace with this change, stating that “minority communities have often been overlooked in Northern Ireland”.\n\nThe report found that a perceived priority given to issues facing the main Catholic and Protestant communities means that this can “squeeze out” attention for minority ethnic and migrant communities, often seen as “other”.\n\nNorthern Ireland also grapples with disproportionately high levels of hate crime – where perpetrators are rarely brought to court.\n\nHate crime\n\nThe Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) was fire-bombed in a hate crime attack in May, the day before they were due to reopen after a previous fire-bomb attack in 2021.\n\n“Very often Black and ethnic minority communities are often left out of conversations”, said Coumilah Manjoo of the BCMA.\n\n“The census data is significant, it shows that the population is now more diverse than ever, the languages we speak is more diverse.”\n\n“Even with the census data, people seem to be far more interested with the ‘green and orange’ [Catholic and Protestant] side of things. We have to move beyond that rhetoric.”",

    "Irish Taoiseach rails against ‘Security Council’s failure to act’ at UN General Assembly": "Noting that 2022 is Ireland’s centenary year as a sovereign country, and Mr. Martin pointed out that one of the first acts of the Government was to join the League of Nations, the predecessor to the United Nations.\n\nA continued commitment to multilateralism\n\nThe Taoiseach outlined Ireland’s continuing commitment to multilateralism, citing initiatives undertaken by the country as an elected member of the Security Council, the contribution of hundreds of Irish UN peacekeepers, and work on resolution 2594, the Council’s first-ever resolution on Peacekeeping Transitions.\n\nIreland, said Mr. Martin, led negotiations to agree a Political Declaration on the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas earlier this year. The Declaration, he declared, “is a significant milestone,” which includes a number of ambitions actions to address impacts of these weapons.\n\nHowever, Mr. Martin also reported Ireland’s deep frustration at many aspects of the Council. He mentioned the failure to adopt a resolution on Climate and Security, after it was vetoed by Russia, and claimed that the Council has not acted decisively to deal with the situation in Tigray, northern Ethiopia.\n\nHe went on to note Ireland’s firm commitment to a two-State solution in Israel and Palestine, but said that “we are no nearer today to that aim than we were when we joined the Council 18 months ago; and, truth be told, long before that”, citing the continued building of Israeli settlements that, he said, “continue to undermine the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State, and to jeopardise the two-State solution”.\n\nOn Afghanistan, Mr. Martin pointed to Ireland’s defence of the human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and we have increased our humanitarian aid. “The mandate for the UN mission in Afghanistan, adopted in March, was directly informed by the courageous activism of Afghan women,” he said, “and we have pushed for accountability for the Taliban’s actions”.\n\nIncreased humanitarian aid\n\nTurning to the issue of global food insecurity, Mr. Martin said that Ireland has responded to the crisis by increasing humanitarian aid, contributing 78 million Euro for the Horn of Africa, and funding other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel.\n\nOther initiatives include an additional €50 million over three years specifically to tackle acute child malnutrition, increased core funding to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and funding and programming for humanitarian emergencies that is adapted to underpin the country’s climate, development and peacebuilding interventions.\n\nIreland will make a new contribution of €65 million over three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a 30 per cent increase on previous contributions, to support the Fund’s important work against these diseases, and the related strengthening of health systems, he continued.\n\nMr. Martin said that hunger and conflict are a priority for Ireland’s Security Council term: “conflict is now the main driver of hunger, reversing gains made over the last decades. We are failing in the challenge to reach zero hunger”.\n\nHe added that Ireland has committed to helping partner countries on their journey towards sustainable, resilient, and nutritious food systems, and declared that, at the COP27 UN climate conference in November, Ireland will be at the forefront of efforts to combat the climate emergency.",
    "Maersk increases its warehousing capabilities in UK and Ireland": "Press releases Maersk increases its warehousing capabilities in UK and Ireland Share LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Email Copy link WeChat\n\nLiverpool/Dublin – As part of its integrator strategy, Maersk is consistently expanding its inventory of warehouses in the UK and Ireland. In addition to a 15-year lease for a newly built warehouse in Doncaster in the North of England, Maersk has signed a lease for two new distribution centres in the Irish capital Dublin. All the facilities have a strong focus on their operations creating low CO2 emissions. The Doncaster facility is part of the G Park Doncaster Mammoth 602 development and perfectly connected via road (close to five motorways), rail (Doncaster International Railport), and air (Robin Hood Airport). With more than 600,000 sq ft total space, 60 dock levellers, 20m internal clear height as well as several hundred parking spaces and offices the warehouse is one of the largest in UK. It ranks also among the most sustainable logistics buildings in the North of England. The developer GLP has built the facility on a net zero carbon scheme for construction (within the UKGBC framework). In addition to the warehouse in Doncaster, Maersk’s portfolio comprises two other distribution centers in the UK in Tamworth and Kettering.\n\nIn Ireland, Maersk has signed a lease for renting two new warehouses in the Quantum Logistics Park in the North of Dublin. The units 3 and 4 within Quantum Logistics Park will feature a combined space of 250,000 sq ft and will be built to fulfill the sustainability standards of LEED Gold and BREEAM Excellent ratings. The Dublin based developer IPUT Real Estate will complete the two warehouses in Q4 2022 and Q2 2023, while unit 4 will also become Ireland’s first net zero logistics building using a glue-laminated timber structural frame. Quantum Logistics Park is strategically located 2 km from Dublin airport and 15 km from Dublin port with immediate access to the M2 motorway.\n\nThese three new warehouses in the UK and Ireland are a strong statement that we are ready to deliver on our integrator promise to our customers and serve them with end-to-end logistics solutions from factory to their end-consumers if they wish. The demand for integrated and thus more resilient supply chains has grown significantly over the past two years. The disruptions of Brexit and the pandemic moved the logistics from a commodity level to a C-level topic – where it actually belongs. Gary Jeffreys Area Managing Director UK & Ireland\n\nAs decarbonization of sea, air and land logistics by 2040 is an integral part of Maersk’s strategy, we are happy to partner with two very capable developers which help us to deliver on that ambitious goal in landside logistics. Following the successful acquisition of the warehousing specialist LF Logistics in Asia, Maersk today offers its customers integrated logistics solutions in more than 550 warehouses with a total global space of around 9.5 million sqm. Several additional Maersk warehouses are planned to go into operation in Europe in the coming months. As an integrator of logistics, Maersk is developing and providing solutions ranging from ocean transportation to landside and air transportation, contract logistics including warehousing & distribution (W&D) and depots, custom clearances, visibility solutions and more. When supply chains were impacted due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Maersk’s resilient end-to-end solutions ensured customers’ cargo kept moving. The integrated solutions allow Maersk to have greater control over the movement of the cargo at multiple stages of its journey and thus bring resilience to the supply chains. With the expansion of W&D facilities, Maersk is strengthening its position further by providing a larger array of services out of one hand to its customers. About A.P. Moller - Maersk A.P.

Evan Ferguson soared to glance home a deserved second-half equaliser, but Ireland are facing a massive challenge in Tel Aviv, where temperatures are expected to be around 28 degrees come kick-off time.\n\nIsrael have shown Crawford's team ample respect by calling back three players from the senior squad for the second leg.\n\nCeltic attacker Liel Abada, Olympiacos full-back Doron Leidner and Eden Kartsev of Maccabi Tel Aviv are all available having helped the seniors to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Albania on Saturday.\n\nHowever Crawford will not be doing likewise, despite Gavin Bazunu, Troy Parrott, Nathan Collins, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi being eligible. They will stick with Stephen Kenny's senior squad for the Aviva Stadium clash against Armenia.\n\nMeanwhile Crawford remains upbeat and quietly confident his charges are good enough to make history and qualify Ireland for a first ever major finals at the U-21 grade.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good performance on Friday,\" he told RTÉ Sport.\n\n\"It was disappointing to concede a goal from a set play.

Certainly Israel will look to take the game to their hosts a lot more, buoyed by the returning trio of Abada, Leidner and Kartsev, plus a partisan crowd that will expect them to play on the front foot.\n\nCrawford also admitted that the heat may dictate the Irish approach.\n\n\"You have to factor that in too, to go after a team for 90 minutes in those type of conditions can be challenging,\" he added.\n\n\"You've got to pick and choose your moments to get after teams. Our boys are clever enough. They'll be well versed on what we've got to do.\"\n\nThere's some seasoned Irish campaigners who have been with the group for a long time now. Among them is Lee O'Connor, the tigerish Tranmere Rovers caps full-back desperate to make the big breakthrough.\n\nO'Connor has been a mainstay of Ireland squads from U-15s up. This is his last campaign in underage international football, and he wants to make it count.\n\n\"I've said it many times, there's nothing like it... it's just a different kind of feeling when you play for Ireland,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"It's something I've love since my very first game. That's why I've made sure I could come to every sing camp I could go to.\n\n\"It's a big game for all of us but it's 90 minutes of football - and a chance to make history at the end.\n\n\"We're all confident. We know it's going to be a tough game. We know what needs to be done. To be be the first to do it, you'd go down in history. That's all we're thinking about.\"\n\nConfident, determined and together - it's set up to be a special night for the Republic of Ireland.\n\nListen to the RTÉ Soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nFollow Israel v Republic of Ireland in the UEFA Under-21 European Championship second-leg play-off this Tuesday (KO 6.15pm) via our liveblog on RTÉ.ie/sport and the RTÉ News app, or watch live on the RTÉ Player (Island of Ireland).",
    "Stephen Kenny believes that his young Ireland team are only going to get better": "REPUBLIC OF IRELAND MANAGER STEPHEN KENNY believes the current Ireland side are only going to get better as the years pass by.\n\nIreland lost 2-1 to Scotland on Saturday, meaning that Ireland are on the verge of being relegated from their Nations League group to League B\n\nIt's been a patchy Nations League for Ireland again, but they can end it on a positive note tomorrow.\n\nKenny's young Irish side welcome Armenia to Dublin tomorrow for the final Nations League game of the year.\n\nKenny says he is not looking at the implications of relegations yet. \"It's not something we are focusing on,\" he told the media.\n\n\"One of the things we want is to win tomorrow night and we want to play well. We saw in our last home game against Scotland, an emphatic 3-0 win. We hadn't beaten a high-ranked team like that at home in many years, convincingly or at all.\n\n\"That was important and we backed that up with a really good performance against Ukraine and drew, and played quite well on Saturday and were disappointed to lose the game. We want to back that up with a strong performance tomorrow night.\n\n\"We are looking to constantly improve. We know there are areas we can improve, we are not naive to suggest that isn't the case,\" added Kenny.\n\n\"We saw against Ukraine, on their day when they had everyone, how good they can be, and two good games against Scotland. We are constantly looking to improve.\n\nKenny has promoted a number of young players to the senior side from his time at the U21 side. The likes of Troy Parrot Andrew Omobamidele, Gavin Bazunu, and many others to the older squad.\n\nDespite the poor run of results, he claimed that the only way is up for a number of his young fledglings, A year will show the results of his footballing project claimed the 50-year-old\n\n\"We can see the emergence of players and that's been critical for us as a nation, critical as for us as a team. You can see players that are only going to get better, that are on an upward curve in their careers, and they will only improve when they get into the European Championship qualifiers from March to November next year.'\n\n\"In a year's time they will be even better, you can see that and that's by design. The players themselves have done that. They have got themselves into the team by their performances at club level and with the international team.\"\n\nIreland play Armenia at 18.15 tomorrow",
    "Ireland need Jeff Hendrick's influence off the bench in certain scenarios": "Irish Journalist Dan McDonnell joined Joe Molloy on The Football Show to discuss Ireland's midfield.\n\nIreland suffered a disappointing loss to Scotland in Hampden Park.\n\nIt was disappointing because they played well and still lost. Alan Browne's handball was silly. It gave Scotland the game-winning penalty, and there were plenty of other missed opportunities too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Ireland played well for the most part. The back three of John Egan, Nathan Collins and Dara O'Shea excelled together. Michael Obafemi and Troy Parrott continue to develop their relationship. Matt Doherty returned in a decent display and the midfield trio battled hard for 90 minutes.\n\nBut there was a lack of control in Ireland's performance. Scotland showed their experience during the second half and Joe Molloy couldn't help but notice Ireland lacked that same quality.\n\n\"There were definitely periods in the second half when Scotland had control of the game,\" Molloy said.\n\n\"We almost did that too readily and you would love if that midfield three had almost said...'We might just try to take the sting out of this game a touch.' Now I don't know if that's experience or nous or maybe they were under strict instructions to get it forward, that's the way we hurt them.\n\n\"But that was definitely a feeling watching the game.\"\n\nDan McDonnell agreed with Molloy.\n\nNone of Cullen, Knight nor Molumby controlled possession or dictated the play. They weren't bad on the ball, but they didn't understand how or have the ability to slow the game down when Ireland needed them to.\n\nMcDonnell explains it's an area that Ireland are concerned about.\n\n\"To a degree this comes back to quality of player in this department,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that where Ireland lack depth at the minute is in those midfield positions...That midfield, Knight and Molumby, probably more so picked for their off the ball work rate than their on the ball abilities. Although Molumby I think has improved on the ball...and Knight is a very good player, but he's someone who makes breaks and latches onto attacks.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have [someone like] Callum McGregor who controls things a small bit more.\"\n\nWill Smallbone and Gavin Kilkenny are potential call-ups for the November internationals. The under-21 team doesn't have fixtures during that window. Smallbone is particularly exciting, but Kilkenny is closer to the quarterback-style passer who will sit deep and slow the game down when Ireland need him to.\n\nBut neither player is an option for Tuesday night and neither player is even guaranteed to make the next squad.\n\nInstead, Ireland can look at their current bench. Jeff Hendrick has more experience than any other Ireland midfielder. He played well for Kenny previously and McDonnell reckons he could have made a difference for Ireland on Saturday.\n\n\"He's an unpopular player with sections of the fanbase...something different would have been bringing in Jeff Hendrick. On a good day, and there have been good days under Kenny. [He's] a good passer and he has a bit of a presence.\n\n\"With his experience he could have taken a bit of the sting out of it. It was a bit frantic, the game in general.\"\n\nMatt Doherty is expecting big things.\n\nFootball on Off The Ball brought to you by Sky.

And fittingly the 30-year-old was joined on the Late Late Show by legendary runner O'Sullivan to reflect on her stellar season.\n\nRead next: \"I know I am clean...\" - Ciara Mageean hits back at critics\n\nMageean received plenty of praise on social media for her appearance on the show, with people championing her as a brilliant role model for young women in sport.\n\nOne person said: \"You’d run a long way to find a better role model for your daughters than Ciara Mageean.\"\n\nThe Co Down athlete also told of her dream of hearing Ireland's national anthem playing as she competed and won medals and spoke about how she believed in the modern day Northern Ireland and winning Commonwealth Games silver.\n\n(Image: INPHO/Morgan Treacy)\n\nWhen asked about representing both nations, the Portaferry woman replied: \"It is something that I'm proud of to be able to go out and race for Ireland year in year out but I get the opportunity to race for Northern Ireland once every four years.

    "Ireland joins EU hawks on Russia, as outrage spreads": "Ireland has joined Poland and the Baltic states in lobbying for more hawkish Russia sanctions, in a sign of widening moral outrage in Europe.\n\nThe Irish added their \"IE\" stamp to a 9-page long list of proposals, including bank and diamond industry bans, circulated in Brussels and seen by EUobserver on Friday (23 September).\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nNo more smartphone sales to Russia, the group added (Photo: Wikimedia)\n\nThe Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, also condemned Russia's actions in strident terms at the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.\n\n\"Russia [is] behaving as a rogue state,\" he said, referring to its plan to annex parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIreland is neutral in military terms, located at the opposite end of Europe from the war, and has a liberal government.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are Nato hawks with Russian borders who fear Russian aggression and who have more conservative ruling parties.\n\nThe Irish foreign ministry declined to comment on the novel EU grouping.\n\nOne EU diplomat described it as a \"big deal\", which showed how the conflict was reshaping European politics. A second EU diplomat speculated that the US, which has close ties with Ireland, might have urged Dublin to side with Warsaw against more dovish EU capitals.\n\n\"We hope even more will join the group,\" a Polish diplomat said.\n\nBut a fourth EU diplomat said it wasn't so surprising, given Ireland's record of \"maximalist\" positions on human-rights issues.\n\nThe Irish-backed proposals say Russian lenders Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, Rosbank, and Tinkoff Bank should be cut off from the 'Swift' international payments grid.\n\nA Gazprombank ban would have far-reaching consequences because it handles payments for Russian gas exports.\n\n\"It shall be prohibited to purchase, import, or transfer, directly or indirectly, diamonds ... if they originate in Russia and if they have been exported from Russia into the [European] Union or to any third country,\" the group also proposed to add to the EU's sanctions regime. Russian diamond exports are worth €4bn a year.\n\nThey called for a \"ban on cooperating with Russia on nuclear energy\", on the transfer of EU or US cash banknotes to Russia, and on sales of real estate to Russians.\n\nIn the services sector, the EU should impose a \"ban on using Kaspersky Lab [a Russian cybersecurity giant] technology\" inside Europe and stop EU firms from doing IT work for Russian clients, the group said.\n\nOn the counter-propaganda front, they proposed taking three Russian TV broadcasters (NTV Mir, REN TV, and Rossija 1), as well as six online ones (NewsFront, SouthFront, Katehon, Strategic Culture Foundation, Fondsk, and InfoRos), off the airwaves.\n\nThey also wanted an explicit ban on Russian funding for EU-registered lobbying firms, NGOs, and think-thanks.\n\nThey said people who help Russia to circumvent sanctions should themselves be put on EU visa-ban and asset-freeze blacklists.\n\nAnd they listed dozens of high-tech products that should no longer be exported to the EU's war-mongering neighbour, including smartphones, radar equipment, and laser appliances.\n\nArt of the possible\n\nThe proposals come as Russia-occupied regions in eastern Ukraine begin fake referendums on independence, leading to Russian annexation as early as next week.\n\nAll 27 EU countries are to hold talks with the EU Commission over the weekend on the feasibility of sanctions ideas.\n\n\"The Commission has carried out consultations with national capitals, so it's in the best position to know what would be acceptable to everyone,\" another EU diplomat said.\n\nThe minimum the EU will do is blacklist officials involved in the bogus referendums, list a few minor Russian banks, and ban some high-tech products, diplomats predicted.\n\nThey will also try to stop firms shipping Russian oil sold at inflated prices, for instance by invalidating insurance coverage for tankers involved in the trade.\n\nThe eighth round of sanctions comes after the EU already listed 1,206 Russians and struck out at most sectors of the Russian economy, leaving few big targets left.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Poland and the Baltic States make headway with Irish support.\n\nRussia-friendly Hungary has in the past vetoed blacklistings and is up to its neck in nuclear cooperation with Russian firm Rosatom, which is building two reactors at Hungary's Paks atomic plant.\n\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, as well as smaller countries, such as Austria, Cyprus, and Greece, are also more dovish than Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAnd some EU sources saw the Irish-Polish-Baltic paper as more of a roadmap for action further down the line, than as a list of demands to be implemented in reaction to the annexations.\n\n\"It's more of a reflection paper, showing the direction of travel,\" an EU contact said.",
    "Haunted Ireland... Any Time Of Year": "The River Fane tracks the border between Ireland (left) and Northern Ireland (right.) Getty Images\n\nIn Ireland, there are almost as many ghosts as sheep, and even haunted castles, now hotels, have ghosts who sometimes find ways to spook guests during their stay. But even if you don’t believe in apparitions, a visit to the Emerald Isle will introduce you to a land of people who believe not only in ghosts, but also in leprechauns, fairies and banshees. I booked a private Ghostly Tour with John Colclough, Director of Ireland and Britain Observed. Colclough, a former lawyer, is an expert in ghosts, gardens, golf, genealogy and gourmet tours. I wanted someone loaded with esoteric information but who also had a wonderful sense of humor. That was John.\n\nThe Castle Leslie with swans on the lake Castle Leslie\n\nA three-hour drive from Dublin is the magnificent Castle Leslie in Glas Louch, Monahan, where Paul McCarthy married Heather Mills. No wonder. The property is set on a 1,000-acre estate with two lakes, 14 acres of gardens, fishing, an equestrian center, and three nearby 18-hole golf courses. Castle Leslie was built in 1878 by Baron Leslie who claimed descent from Attila the Hun. Since 1661, the Leslie family has lived on this site and now, Samantha, niece of the former 4th baronet, Sir John Leslie, and the last of the line, is the manager.\n\nThe West Wing Suite in the Castle Castle Leslie\n\nThe Castle’s original furniture, family portraits and archives date back to the 1660’s. The toilets still have their original Victorian fittings, and there is much Victoriana from the Churchill family (to whom the Leslies were related by marriage). The sitting room and public rooms are filled with tapestries, suits of armor, relics, medals, a painted Della Robbia fireplace from a Florence chapel, a harp (a gift from William Wordsworth), and an emerald bracelet from the empress of China. Castle Leslie has changed little except for modern conveniences and amenities.\n\nThe Mauve Room at Castle Leslie Castle Leslie\n\nThe bedrooms are a mix of Edwardian, Victorian, and “fun,” including a nursery in which a huge dollhouse façade opens to reveal a bathroom. The ghostly draw is Norman’s room. Norman Leslie was Sir John’s uncle and was killed in WW1. Norman’s sister swore she saw him coming home in his uniform on the very day he died. Norman’s bedroom, a sinister-looking room with a dark wooden bed is haunted. The bed, bought in England, was originally a ‘marriage bed.’ In this bed, an actress killed herself with a razor and another woman jumped out of the window, claiming a sudden sadness had come over her. In Norman’s room, people say the haunted bed rises into the air and doors open and slam shut all night long. But are they just telling tall tales? When I walked into Norman’s room, there was something foreboding about it, much darker than the mahogany furniture. I was too scared to spend the night there, even though this was a ghost tour. Instead, I opted for a much more cheerful room which was ghostless.\n\nDUBLIN, IRELAND - People walk over over Ha'penny Bridge on Getty Images\n\nThe Hibernian Hotel in Dublin, a Victorian red brick building which was formerly a nurses’ home, is now a restored hotel in which Room 307 is said to be haunted. Story has it that during the Crimean War, a young woman, heartbroken that her lover had died, decided to become a nurse. She moved into the nurses’ quarters overlooking the hospital, pacing night after night as she thought about her departed lover. For the next 30 years, she was head matron of the Royal Dublin Hospital, but remained in Room 307, a room that still exists, now part of the Hibernian Hotel. Guests have complained about hearing someone walking around the room, insisting it’s the ghost of the Matron. When one guest questioned a hotel employee, he laughed it off and said, “We put it down to people having a pint too much ”\n\nCurious about the ghostly presence, I spent the night in the Hibernian’s Room 307, but much to my disappointment, the ghost never made a peep. When I expressed my disappointment the next morning in not sighting the ghost, John reassured me. “Not to worry. There are thousands of ghosts in Ireland. Wherever there’s bloody history, there are ghosts. In the 18th century we had some extraordinary nasty rulers who make Nero and Caligula look like amateurs. I assure you, you’ll see ghosts.”\n\nAn 18th-century tombstone Getty Images\n\nWe stopped for lunch at Belvedere. This castle was built in 1750 by Lord Belvedere who married shortly after, and immediately took off to the continent, leaving his bride, Lady Belvedere, alone. Lady Belvedere had an affair with Lord Belvedere’s brother, who lived next door. She became pregnant, and when Lord Belvedere returned home, she asked for a divorce. Lord Belvedere refused and locked her up in her room, allowing her only to enter the garden. But the garden looked out on her lover’s estate, so Lord Belvedere erected “the jealous wall,” a strange Gothic folly, which blocked Lady Belvedere’s view of the brother’s home. Lord Belvedere forbade anyone to speak with his wife. Even while in the garden, a servant had to walk ahead of her and ring a bell to warn anyone there to leave. Lady Belvedere’s ghost has been seen walking next to the jealous wall.\n\nThe Jealous Wall at Belvedere Castle Belevedere Castle\n\nBut the apparition of Lady Belvedere didn’t appear, so John, like a true Irish guide, suggested we stop at Morrissey’s pub in Abbey Leix. (Opposite Morrissey’s is the Abbey Leix Carpet Factory where the carpets were made for the Titanic, but there were no ghosts there). We sat at the bar of Morrissey’s, in business since 1775, and where little has changed. A group who had just returned from the hunt invited us to join them for a pint. When I admitted I was on the lookout for ghosts, one of them laughed and said, “The only ghosts you’ll find here are live ones.” But John was in disagreement and said that ghosts definitely exist, and it’s just a question of whether or not you want to see them.\n\nExterior of Castle Durrow Castle Durrow\n\nJust 90 minutes from Dublin is Castle Durrow, originally built in the early 1700’s, and now a contemporary renovated mansion with such amenities as heated wooden floors, fluffy comforters, and velvet bedspreads. Twelve-foot tall Georgian windows overlook views of the estate, the restored gardens, and the “leafy loopy walk” on the grounds. The windows also overlook places were two female ghosts who haunt the castle, have been spotted. These ghosts, known as the Blue Lady and the White Lady, are the daughters of former owner Lord Ashbrook who lived in the castle from 1716-1922.\n\nOne daughter, the Blue Lady was killed in a horseback riding accident. In her honor, Lord Ashbrook built an obelisk as a monument, which can be seen upon entering the grounds. The Blue Lady’s ghost, always on horseback, has been seen by locals. Her sister, known as the White lady, had an affair with the gardener, got pregnant, and was sent off to Australia to have the baby. She’s usually seen on the third floor, walking the corridors. The new owner says he has not seen either ghost, but his wife admits she saw the White Lady while upstairs. “It was a nice female who blinked on and off as a light when I talked to it, but not when my friend did, only for me. It’s a friendly presence and I like that.”\n\nA Celtic cross in a cemetery Getty Images\n\nI felt the presence of neither the White or Blue Lady that night, but the next morning, I took an early walk to the entrance to the estate, were there’s an old cemetery. I tried, but couldn’t open the heavy metal gate, and kept tugging until it finally squeaked opened. Inside, were centuries-old tombs with inscriptions, which I couldn’t make out. I left the graveyard, closed the gate, and started back up to the castle. A squeaking stopped me dead in my tracks and I turned to see the gate had opened all by itself. How could that have happened when it had been so difficult to open? For a moment, I was spooked, but only for an instant because it was morning. Life is scarier at night.\n\nGraveyard with old stone graves Getty Images\n\nOn the way to Dublin is Ardgillan Castle where there is known to be a ghostly female presence. The presence walks up and down stone steps leading to the Irish Sea. The story is that in November of 1790, the Lady of Ardgillan, feeling unloved, walked down the stone steps and cast herself into the sea. Today, those steps are known as the “Lady Steps,” and a ghostly presence can sometimes be seen walking up and down aimlessly. The head ranger of Ardgillan said he’d seen a green lady on the stairs when he worked nights. ”I heard noises too, I did,” he said, “She must have had nail boots, because that’s what it sounded like. So, I turned on the lights, but the switch was turned off.” The Lady in Green is not the only ghost who has been sighted at Ardgillan. Day laborers claim they have seen the ghost of Colonel Taylor, who once owned the Castle, and Hercules Taylor his son. The housekeeper claims she saw a very fashionably dressed lady leaving the house.\n\nA valley of patchwork fields in County Kerry, Ireland Getty Images\n\nThe countryside of Ireland is a patchwork of rolling green hills without a house, street sign or building anywhere in sight. But the serenity ended the moment we arrived in Erke (pronounced uuurrkkk). We stopped at a burned out stone shell, an old rectory abandoned during the 19th century where the Vicar used to live. It seems the rectory is haunted because the Vicar was a Satanist, practicing black art. One day, he was found missing, and the townsfolk noticed a huge scorch mark in the church. The cook saw goblets and food strewn about everywhere in the kitchen. Eventually, the rectory burned down, and now the entire hill is supposedly haunted. Just standing there looking at the burned out shell, I had the same eerie feeling I’d felt in Norman’s room at Castle Leslie. It’s no wonder the town has a name like Erke.\n\nThe Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland Getty Images\n\nMaybe I hadn’t seen any ghosts during my tour, but I did feel their presence. Even without spotting an apparition, my haunted tour with John Colclough was an excellent way to experience the Emerald Isle’s velvety countryside, Irish Sea, and the convivial people.

    "Can Ireland's bumper savings be put to good use?": "Limited spending options and fears of what was to come turned Irish consumers into great savers during pandemic lockdowns.\n\nEven as the economy reopened, the average household was saving far more of their income than before – though recent data suggests the rising prices are forcing that to change.\n\nThis means that there is a huge bulk of money sitting in Irish bank accounts at the moment – right at a time when households, businesses and politicians search for ways to cover the rising cost of living.\n\nHow much money do people here have saved?\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nA huge amount – somewhere in the region of €146 billion by the end of July, according to the most recent figures from the Central Bank.\n\nTo put that into context, the upcoming budget is estimated to be worth around €6.5 billion– and that's a far bigger figure than it would be in a normal year, because of the billions of euro that are planned around the cost of living.\n\nSo the people of Ireland have more than 22 bumper budgets worth of cash sitting in their bank accounts at the moment.\n\nAnd that figure has ballooned significantly in the past two and a half years – because people saved an extraordinary amount during the pandemic.\n\nComparing the February 2020 figure with the July 2022 figure, there’s nearly €35 billion more in our savings. That’s the kind of money it would normally take a decade or more to build up.\n\nIt works out at about €28,600 for every person in the country.\n\nBut I don’t have anything like that in my bank account…\n\nUnfortunately, all of that money isn’t very evenly distributed.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, it’s the country’s higher earners that tend to hold the bulk of the money saved.\n\nIt should be said that most people in the country do have some level of savings – recent figures from the Central Statistics Office says that nearly 97% of households have some form of savings.\n\nBut the amount in those savings accounts tends to decline in line with the amount of disposable income a person has.\n\nThere are also links between the likelihood of having savings and your level of education, and whether someone is living in their own house or whether they’re renting.\n\nAnd that inequality in savings was only enhanced by the pandemic.\n\nIf you were to take two types of workers – let’s say, a high-earning tech worker, and regular retail worker.\n\nThere’s already a huge difference in their earnings here – but when the pandemic hit, the tech worker was able to continue doing their job from home, pretty much with no interruption.\n\nThat means their earnings stayed the same, in some cases they actually increased, and because they couldn’t go anywhere, suddenly all of their socialising money started building up in their bank account.\n\nThe retail worker also wouldn’t have had much available to spend their money on, but because they were forced to stop working altogether, and put onto the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they didn’t have much in the way of disposable income left once their bills were taken care of.\n\nAre we still saving our money?\n\nAs the economy began to reopen, there was lots of discussion about what might happen with all of the savings built up during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere were some – particularly retailers – who hoped that there might be some kind of post-lockdown spending spree.\n\nConsumer spending did rise – and some people seemed to put their savings towards some big ticket items, like a trip abroad. Some of the rapid rise in house prices has also been attributed to people directing their savings towards a deposit on a new home.\n\nBut while spending has been higher than before, it’s definitely not been the splurge that some had expected.\n\nIn fact, so far it seems as though people have continued their savings habit even as life returned to normal.\n\nThe most recent Household Savings stats from the CSO shows that people were still putting away almost 20% of their income in the middle of the year.\n\nThat’s about double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nPerhaps people realised that they were able to save more than they previously thought possible – or perhaps it shows that households are remaining cautious, particularly given the context of the war in Ukraine and talk of a recession in the Euro Zone.\n\nIt should be said, though, that these CSO figures only bring us to June – before the cost of living crisis really started to bite.\n\nA more recent survey from the Bank of Ireland shows that people are now saving less than they feel they should, because they simply can’t afford to.\n\nSo if we’re not spending it, what options do savers have to get the most out of their money?\n\nWell, if they’re looking to save it – there’s not a lot on offer at the moment.\n\nAcross the board, savings accounts are offering next to nothing in terms of interest – and that’s been the case ever since the European Central Bank dropped its interest rates to zero.\n\nECB interest rates are on the rise but so far the main Irish banks – outside of tracker mortgages - haven’t yet passed those on.\n\nThat’s good news for those on a variable mortgage, or someone with a personal loan, but it’s bad news for savers, because it means they’re not yet benefitting from the interest rate.\n\nFor those looking for a return on their money, investments are of course an option – but only if you have a lump sum of money that you’re happy to put out of reach for a couple of years.\n\nAnd, unlike savings, there’s no guarantee with investments – so you could end up losing money, or not making an awful lot.\n\nGenerally it’s about balancing risk and reward with this kind of thing – if you want the best chance of making a great return, you need to make riskier investments.\n\nIf you want to be sure you don’t lose money, you’re going to have to go with something that promises fairly modest returns.\n\nTake, for example, a 10 Year National Solidarity Bond– which is 100% guaranteed by the State.\n\nIf you put €1,000 into that today, in 10 years time you’ll get back €1,100.\n\nAnd with the current rate of inflation…\n\nThe is the problem facing all people saving at the moment – they’re getting little or nothing for their money, and the value of that money is being whittled away by the month.\n\nFor example, if you put that €1,000 into your savings at the start of the pandemic, in terms of buying power, it’s now effectively worth less than €890 because of inflation.\n\nThe rate of inflation is expected to tail off over the next year or two – but it’s still going to be higher than desired, which means your money is slowly losing value while it’s earning you nothing.\n\nSo what other options do savers have?\n\nWell, they could spend the money – though due to inflation there’s not much value to be had, especially if they were thinking of doing something like a home renovation or upgrade.\n\nPeople may also be unwilling to let go of their savings at the moment, for fear that they need it to fall back on if their household budgets get squeezed even further, or if there’s another economic downturn that threatens their income.\n\nAnd the general personal finance advice is to keep a certain amount of cash to hand at all times – just in case your income suddenly stops, or the washing machine breaks down.\n\nSo using up all of your savings isn’t a good idea either way.\n\nBut assuming you have money beyond that recommended buffer, paying off debt is probably a good use of money at the moment, especially if it’s high interest lending like on a credit card.\n\nThe most recent Central Bank statistics tell us that household debt stood at €128 billion late last year – so not too far behind what we have saved.\n\nIf people have the money to clear some of that, it might mean reducing or even wiping out a loan repayment altogether, which will bolster their monthly budget as they head into the winter.\n\nIn fact, even if you’re just paying off a part of a loan – like your mortgage – it will ultimately stand to you.\n\nAnother option is to put money towards a pension.\n\nFor many this is about as long-term of an investment as you can make, but we do know that a lack of pensions provision is a major issue in Ireland, and it takes a long time for people to build up the kind of pension pot that they would like to have a comfortable retirement.\n\nIs there any way for the Government to tap into those savings?\n\nWell it kind of does already – for example, any interest earned is liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax – or DIRT – at 33%.\n\nThough, given that people haven’t been earning much on their savings for the past few years, there isn’t really much money to be made from that tax at the moment.\n\nThe State Savings scheme, including things like the National Solidarity Bond and Prize Bonds are effective an attempt by Government to benefit from people’s savings, too.\n\nThat’s because they’re effectively a way for the State to borrow citizens’ money for an extended period of time, which they can then use for various investments and public services.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Government is actually in a bit of a bind when it comes to people’s savings.\n\nNormally if you were looking at businesses around the country struggling on the one hand, and billions and billions sitting in savings accounts on the other, it would make sense to try to come up with a scheme to try to unleash that cash in order to help businesses out.\n\nThink of some kind of reverse SSIA scheme that incentivises spending rather than saving.\n\nBut, if you were to do that, you run the risk of simply adding to the inflation problem at the moment – which would only prolong the pain that consumers and companies are facing right now.\n\nSo, as counter-intuitive as it seems, the Government probably doesn’t want too much money coming into the economy right now.\n\nIn fact, that’s partly why a central bank raises interest rates when it wants to cool economic activity. Because higher interest rates on your savings account – in theory at least – encourages you to save rather than spend.",
    "Emerging Ireland Squad: Meet the Players": "The Emerging Ireland squad that will compete in the Toyota Challenge in Bloemfontein over the next two weeks features a host of players that have starred for Ireland at underage level and on the world stage for the Ireland Sevens.

He played for the Ireland U20s in 2020 and has made 32 senior appearances for Connacht.\n\nJoe McCarthy also played in both fixtures against the Maori All Blacks on the 2022 New Zealand Tour and played Ireland U20s with Prendergast in 2020. The second row has made 13 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nThe Development Brief\n\nBoth Tom Ahern and Jamie Osborne trained with the Ireland squad as Development Players ahead of the 2021 Autumn Nations Series. Ahern was an Ireland U20 international in 2019 and 2020 missing the Grand Slam campaign through injury. He has made 21 senior appearances for Munster\n\nOsborne represented the Ireland U20s in 2021 but had already made his senior Leinster debut at that stage. He has made 20 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nProven Provincials\n\nStewart Moore, Calvin Nash and Diarmuid Barron have all established themselves as senior Provincial players. All three represented Ireland at U20 World Rugby Championships.\n\nSince making his senior debut for Ulster in December 2019, Moore has accumulated 32 senior appearances. Nash has played 38 senior games for Munster, while Barron has 36 senior Munster caps.\n\nThe Class of 2019\n\nJohn Hodnett, Scott Penny, David McCann, Dylan Tierney-Martin, Brian Deeny, Jake Flannery, Thomas Clarkson, Michael Milne, Callum Reid and Josh Wycherley were all part of Ireland’s U20 Six Nations Grand Slam winning squad in 2019.\n\nAt Munster, Hodnett and Wycherley have made 22 and 29 senior provincial appearances respectively while Flannery made six senior appearances for Munster before making the switch to Ulster this season.

Penny has made the most senior appearances for Leinster with 42 with Milne (18), Clarkson (18) and Deeny (3) also making the breakthrough at senior level for Leo Cullen’s side.\n\nThe Sevens Boys\n\nBaloucoune and Daly are not the only two players in the Emerging Ireland squad that have benefitted from exposure to the Ireland Sevens programme.\n\nAndrew Smith and Chay Mullins both won bronze medals at the recent Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town while Cormac Izuchukwu won two Ireland Sevens caps before clocking nine senior appearances for Ulster.\n\nSmith also won the Energia AIL title with Clontarf earlier this year and has made two senior appearances for Leinster. Mullins has joined the Connacht Academy this season having also helped the Ireland U20s to a 2022 Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nThe 2020 Triple Crowners\n\nThe 2020 U20 Six Nations was cut short by the Covid pandemic but after three games the Ireland U20 squad had secured wins over Scotland, Wales and England, claiming an unofficial Triple Crown. Ethan McIlroy, Jack Crowley, Tom Stewart and Ben Murphy were in that squad alongside the aforementioned Smith, McCann, Prendergast, Ahern and McCarthy.\n\nMcIlroy has made 37 senior appearances for Ulster while Stewart’s progress has been hampered by injury but he claimed an impressive try against Connacht in the first round of this season’s URC.\n\nOut-half Crowley has notched up 16 senior appearances for Munster including a start in the Champions Cup against Castres. Murphy has also made his senior debut for Leinster having gone on loan to Munster during the 2021/22 season.\n\nThe Class of 2021\n\nIn 2021, the U20 Six Nations took place in the summer months of June and July as the global pandemic continued to disrupt the rugby calender. Osborne featured strongly for the Richie Murphy’s side but so too did Nathan Doak, Cathal Forde and Sam Illo.\n\nDoak has already made a big impact at senior provincial level with Ulster clocking up 24 appearances since making his debut against Munster in December 2020. Forde has made two senior appearances for Connacht while Illo has featured three times since switching from the Leinster age grade system.\n\nInternational IQ Rugby\n\nThere are three players in the squad that have come through the Irish qualified player pathway. Mullins came via the Bristol Academy and the IRFU’s IQ programme in the UK.\n\nMichael McDonald was born in Ireland but represented Australia U20s at the 2019 U20 World Rugby Championship having emigrated down under with his family at the age of 13. He joined Ulster at the start of the current season.\n\nAntoine Frisch was born in France but qualifies for Ireland via his grandmother.

He was named Player of the Tournament as Ireland secured a memorable Grand Slam.",
    "Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland: Ryan Christie's late penalty gives hosts crucial win": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nRyan Christie scoring his late penalty for Scotland\n\nScotland need a point away to Ukraine on Tuesday to win Nations League Group B1 after a dogged comeback victory over the Republic of Ireland at Hampden.\n\nJohn Egan volleyed Ireland ahead early on, but Jack Hendry's header levelled.\n\nBoth sides spurned big chances before Alan Browne was penalised for handball and Ryan Christie stroked home the penalty winner eight minutes from time.\n\nThat puts Steve Clarke's side two points clear of Ukraine, who briefly went top with a 5-0 win in Armenia.\n\nHowever, Scotland head into their final group game in Krakow, Poland, with more injury worries after full-backs Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey were both forced off, while a late yellow card for Scott McTominay rules the midfielder out through suspension.\n\nIreland, meanwhile, can now finish no higher than third in the group.\n\nScotland were buoyed by Wednesday's 3-0 win over Ukraine at Hampden. But with that dominant performance came expectation they would simply roll over an Irish side who three months earlier had handed them a chastening 3-0 defeat.\n\nAnd a loud and confident Hampden was silenced when Troy Parrott slalomed through the Scotland defence and hammered the ball high into the net. The assistant referee's flag cut short the celebrations, but Ireland were again threatening to spring a shock.\n\nSoon the visitors broke on the counter-attack and got two v two. Hendry blocked Parrott's effort, but it only delayed the opener.\n\nSet-plays had been Scotland's downfall in Dublin and the frailty resurfaced. They struggled to clear a corner, the ball fell to Egan who lashed the ball through a ruck of bodies and past Craig Gordon.\n\nClarke's men had fallen apart in Dublin, but this time they responded strongly. The ball wouldn't fall for Stuart Armstrong and Lyndon Dykes in the box, while John McGinn mis-hit a shot wide, but the anticipation around Hampden was rising as the home side continued to pour forward.\n\nAnd four minutes into the second half Scotland were level. Matt Doherty allowed Christie to breeze past him all too easily, and Hendry met his delivery to guide a header into the far corner via the post.\n\nDoherty could have made amends at the other end when Greg Taylor was caught in possession, but he curled wide. Scotland's McGinn thumped past the post too as the game promised another goal.\n\nAnd that should have arrived when Ireland pulled the hosts apart. From Scotland's corner, Callum McGregor coughed up possession, the Irish broke two on one, Michael Obafemi laid the ball into the path of Parrott who saw the whites of Gordon's eyes but shot straight at him.\n\nThen a Gordon clearance bounced off Chiedozie Ogbene but back into the hands of the grateful goalkeeper. It was all Scotland possession, but Ireland were the ones passing up the chances.\n\nThe momentum shifted again in Scotland's favour. Ryan Fraser had a shot tipped over and Doherty defended brilliantly to head the ball away from McTominay.\n\nJust as Scotland's frustration grew as the winner looked to elude them, they were gifted a penalty when the hand of Browne diverted the ball from McTominay's path in the box.\n\nAfter a video assistant referee check, Christie slotted the penalty down the middle to bring Hampden to its feet. Ireland threw everything at Scotland in an attempt to find an equaliser but found a defence just as desperate to hold on.\n\nMan of the match - Jack Hendry\n\nHis defensive performance alone was enough to win the award, but he capped it with the equaliser to get Scotland back into the match\n\nDogged Scotland find a way - analysis\n\nIt was not the same flowing football from Wednesday, but the 90 minutes was just as pulsating as Scotland made it three straight wins.\n\nScotland's joy against Ukraine had come from their marauding full-backs and clever movement up front.\n\nTactically, though, Ireland were smart. Their two strikers pinned Scotland's wide players back, they defended their corners where Scotland had late joy in midweek. And despite Scotland having the lion's share of possession the Irish repeatedly found opportunities of their own.\n\nIt was a match that could have gone either way, but a penalty settled it.\n\nScotland did not have it all their own way as they did on Wednesday, but the confidence will be sky high before their rematch with Ukraine on Tuesday where Nations League promotion and a Euro 2024 play-off place are at stake.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGroup B1 concludes on Tuesday, as Scotland take on Ukraine in Krakow, Poland (19:45 BST) and Republic of Ireland host Armenia at the same time.\n\n'Mentality doesn't change for Ukraine game' - Clarke\n\nMatch stats\n\nScotland are unbeaten in all eight of their home games in the Nations League (W7 D1) - no team has played more at home without ever losing in the competition (Italy also 8).\n\nRepublic of Ireland are winless in all seven of their away games in the competition (D2 L5), losing each of the last four.\n\nBoth teams scored with their first shots on target - for Scotland it was just the second time they'd conceded first in a home game in the Nations League (also v Israel in 2018), while it was the first time Ireland had scored first in an away game in the competition.\n\nIn his 33rd appearance for Scotland, Ryan Christie both scored and assisted a goal in the same game for the first time at international level.\n\nJack Hendry completed all 60 of his passes - the most a player has made while maintaining a 100% pass accuracy in this edition of the Nations League.\n\nJohn McGinn has created more chances (12) and had more shots (19) than any other Scotland player at this edition of the Nations League, with the midfielder having a further three of each against Ireland.",
    "Killing Leprechauns: Irish satirist mines British ignorance in comedy podcast": "When Oliver Cromwell’s forces sacked the Irish town of Drogheda in 1649 and massacred its inhabitants the comedy potential seemed limited. Thousands perished and that was just the start of a military campaign that wiped out much of Ireland’s population before Cromwell returned to England.\n\nFour centuries later, however, those dark events and other landmarks of Irish history have been mined for humour – and the joke is on the British.\n\nOliver Callan, an Irish satirist, has questioned British comedians about their knowledge of Ireland and uncovered an apparently deep well of ignorance. For Killing Leprechauns, a six-part BBC podcast that launches on Saturday, Callan asked a dozen young comics about Irish stereotypes, history and current affairs. The general response: obliviousness.\n\nIt validated the old joke about the Irish never forgetting their history and the British never remembering theirs, Callan said in an interview. “It was much worse than I expected.”\n\nThe comedians appeared unaware that Britain’s closest neighbour had a young population and tech-driven economy, he said. “Their view is it’s still an old place, mass-going, the Catholic church still has a grip, we’re still backward; it’s a misty, old-fashioned country that’s taken to the drink.”\n\nComedians tend to consume a lot of media and to focus on what audiences find familiar, said Callan. “So if British comedians don’t know about Ireland and aren’t talking about Irishness, it’s indicative that their audiences don’t either and this is because their media and their establishment are not paying attention.”\n\nOliver Callan, centre, with Josh Jones and Sophie Duker who take part in the podcast.\n\nIn the series Callan pokes fun at the Irish, suggesting they were created when a red-haired rabbit copulated with a long streak of misery that floated through upper Cavan. But after prodding his guests to recount Irish tropes, such as drunkenness, he responded with facts and statistics that challenged the stereotypes.\n\nThe comedians, who include Rhys James, Glenn Moore, Ana Magliano, Josh Weller and Sophie Duker, submitted themselves to tests on their “Mick ignorance”, regarding Irish culture, and a segment called “Great Britain or hate Britain” that asked them how aspects of Britishness are regarded in Ireland.\n\nFew were aware of Cromwell’s record in Ireland, though James recalled learning in school the Puritan leader had invaded and irked the natives with “cosmic ways”. Told about massacres and that Drogheda’s governor was beaten to death with his wooden leg, James replied, tongue in cheek: “Now you’ve told me I’m furious about it, mate. If you’re listening in Ireland, I’m livid about it.”\n\nKnowledge about the Great Famine was scant but Callan said the Irish extracted a revenge of sort when the resulting emigrant tide to Britain produced an infamous descendent, Piers Morgan. “So things have a way of evening out.”\n\nThe British comedians were fuzzy about Éamon de Valera, who dominated Irish politics for much of the 20th century, but noted his name’s resemblance to “devil” and Cruella de Vil.\n\nQuestions about Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, and his predecessor Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s first openly gay and mixed-race leader, drew a blank. The comedians were surprised to learn Joe Biden, John F Kennedy and other US presidents celebrated their Irish roots, and that Ireland had become a liberal, secular state.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Irish people followed British TV, British sport, British politics, but Britons showed little awareness or interest in Ireland. “Our intense focus on British matters is not even reciprocated at a micro level.”\n\nBritons had little reason to share navel-gazing Irish obsessions such as Biden’s Irish heritage but it was a shame they did not follow the example of King Charles, his late mother and other members of the royal family who have visited and engaged with Ireland, said Callan.\n\nThe satirist said Irish people had their own blinkers, such as ignorance about Northern Ireland and aspects of Britain, especially its geography. “We couldn’t place many cities on a map.” Brexit gave the Irish licence to create their own stereotypes, he said. “We milked it quite a bit to portray Britain as narrow-minded.” Even so, the Irish yearned for attention. “We just want the Brits to notice us.”",
    "Ireland's economy is growing solidly — for now. But cost-of-living pressures loom large": "A view of the Google EMEA HQ building in the western part of the Grand Canal Docks in Dublin, seen during Level 5 Covid-19 lockdown. On Friday, 22 January, 2021, in Dublin, Ireland. NurPhoto | NurPhoto | Getty Images\n\nIreland's economic growth continued to outpace the euro zone average in the second quarter — but the country is still grappling with the same cost of living and energy security pressures as its neighbours. Government figures show Irish gross domestic product increased by 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, driven by higher consumer and business spending, although it was down markedly from the 6.3% growth posted in the first quarter. Gross national product — which strips out profit from the many multinational companies which are based in the country, and account for 54.8% of its economy — grew 2.1%. In comparison, the euro zone economy as a whole grew by just 0.8% in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. A fall in euro area business activity has some analysts, including at the Royal Bank of Canada and ING, arguing the bloc is likely to enter a recession sooner than previously thought. The U.K. economy, meanwhile, contracted 0.1% on the quarter amid similar recession warnings. And there are fears Ireland's growth may not remain so robust. \"A number of indicators suggest that momentum has eased in the third quarter, while the outlook over the coming quarters has weakened considerably,\" Irish Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement Friday.\n\nIreland is facing the same pressures as its neighbours over the cost of living and energy security. A flash estimate published by the European Union's statistics agency put Irish inflation at 8.9% in August, just below the euro zone average of 9.1%. And things are likely to get worse, according to Conall Mac Coille, chief economist at Irish financial consultancy Davy, given rising household energy bills in winter. Utility firm Electric Ireland has announced that residential electricity bills will be 26.7% higher and gas bills 36.5% higher from Oct. 1. Gerard Brady, head of national policy and chief economist at Irish business lobbying group Ibec, told CNBC there is \"no doubt\" businesses are starting to feel the strain as prices rise in energy, commodities and transport. \"That's putting a lot of pressure on operating margins. It's in every sector as well, it's a broad economic shock,\" he told CNBC by phone. \"Consumers will really feel the hit when winter arrives, but businesses are already seeing bills three to five times higher, so for energy-intensive industries it's a huge challenge.\" That includes dairy firms, which contributed 16 billion euros ($15.9 billion) to the Irish economy last year, according to trade association Dairy Industry Ireland. Its director, Conor Mulvihill, told CNBC that many businesses have increased their revenues over the last year, but this has been \"absolutely obliterated\" by higher costs in the likes of animal feed, fertiliser, diesel, and energy in particular.\n\nwatch now\n\nA tight labor market, with Irish employment at a record high of 73.5%, also means it has been a challenge for firms to recruit and keep workers, Mulvihill said. With its close links to the European energy market — and particularly the U.K.'s, from which it imports around 75% of its gas — Ireland faces similar worries about the potential for shortages this winter. Energy firm National Grid, which controls U.K. supply lines, says Ireland will not be cut off — but blackouts in both countries remain a possibility.\n\nFuller coffers\n\nAs plans to weather the winter cost-of-living storm emerge from different European governments, Ireland is due to announce energy bill grants and other support measures totalling 6.7 billion euros in its 2023 budget on Sept. 27. The country's current economic health does give it additional leeway. Figures released in August showed state finances emerged from a Covid-era deficit into a surplus of 6 billion euros. Multinationals in the country, many of which have been attracted by its low 12.5% corporate tax rate, include technology giants such as Alphabet, Meta, Intel and Amazon; and pharma firms like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. The higher profits made by these companies during the pandemic helped power a 30% year-on-year rise in corporate tax last year, totalling 15.3 billion euros — roughly the same as it collected in value added tax.\n\nShaky ground?",
    "Ireland’s labor and housing shortages are worsening": "France recently warned its citizens about moving to Ireland due to high rents and cost of living. The reality is just getting worse but what are the Irish government and Europe to do about it.\n\nThe Irish government has decided to raise the minimum wage for workers from January 1. The new rate will be set at €11.30 per hour, an increase of 80 cents. In these days of the surging dollar, it's equivalent to about $11.29 which, by comparison, is still almost $2 below the New York rate that currently stands at $13.20 per hour.\n\nHowever, in an economy of soaring inflation the increase is unlikely to satisfy anyone as the rate alone cannot reimburse workers for recent increases in the cost of living. Also, it will do very little to address a serious structural problem in the economy, namely the severe shortage of non-skilled workers and also those that are employed in the service sector.\n\nWhile there has always been competition for employees in the high-skilled, high-earner sectors of the employment market such as financial services, professional services, and IT, what the country is now seeing is a dearth of workers at the coalface. Areas such as hospitality, logistics, construction and personal services have all been hit by a lack of workers, with labor shortages now reaching crisis proportions.\n\nLooking for a plumber? Well, you can wait up to four weeks to get one. Taxi drivers are a rarity after a late night out, cleaners are in short supply, and cafes and restaurants have had to close early or not open because of staff shortages. Tourism Ireland estimated during the summer that there were 40,000 vacancies in that particular sector.\n\nParadoxically, with the unemployment rate below five percent, the labor market is in a much better place than it was before the pandemic, indicating a vibrant economy, but it also means that demand for staff is not being met by supply. There are now over 2.5 million people at work in the country which is an all-time record high.\n\nOne of the major issues is the high cost and, in some cases, the non-availability of accommodation, especially for low-paid workers and specifically in urban areas where most vacancies are.\n\nIn fact, the perilous situation in relation to housing has led to a French Embassy warning its citizens about moving to Ireland. The embassy advises on its website that “the strong demand and the saturation of the rental market have led to a sharp increase in rents, which are currently much more expensive than in Paris, including shared accommodation. It is therefore advisable for people planning to settle in Ireland to allow sufficient time for this search for accommodation (which can take several weeks).\"\n\nWhile the French government’s concern for its citizens is touching, there is another, more self-serving motive for the warning. Ireland’s corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent has served the country well by being internationally competitive and providing long-term stability for multinational companies investing here. But it has always been a bone of contention for the French, with President Emmanuel Macron calling for a change as long ago as 2017.\n\nFollowing negotiations, all EU and OECD countries signed up to major reform, with the overall aims of addressing tax avoidance and ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities take place. This has meant that Ireland will have to increase the tax rate to at least 15 percent and also remove some of its most important tax credits currently available to multinationals.\n\nSign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Subscribe to IrishCentral\n\nWhat this all means is that potential corporations considering investing in Ireland will have to be enticed by non-tax issues. Education, transport and access to public services will be high on any, list but so too is access to somewhere to live at a reasonable cost for their executives and workforce.\n\nTherefore, it is convenient for the French to point out, in banner headlines, that Ireland’s housing market is broken. In the battle for inward investment – and France is top of the EU in this regard – all is fair. What makes the warning on the embassy website more potent is that all of it is true.\n\nWhat can be done then to ensure that there are enough workers to keep the economy ticking over? In the past, we have looked to Eastern Europe to take up the slack.\n\nHowever, this pipeline of emigrant labor has not only ground to a halt but is in reverse. For example, there has been a huge exodus of Polish migrants over the past number of years. This is due mainly to the unaffordable housing but also a booming economy at home where housing supply has kept pace with demand.\n\nThe organization representing small and medium size enterprises (ISME) believes that one untapped source of employees is those receiving social welfare. A barrier for this cohort is that those leaving the welfare system have a lot to lose in terms of secondary benefits.\n\nAccording to ISME, if a single mother with a sick child earns more than €9,500 per annum, they will lose access to free medical care. Similarly, in relation to housing, a single person will qualify for social housing in Dublin if they have an annual income less than €35K.\n\nThis threshold is lower in rural areas. Both of these examples are pretty strong reasons for not taking up full-time positions.\n\nThe answer is clear – a more nuanced system that allows flexibility for a period of time once a person joins the full-time workforce. The bureaucratic objection to this is that it would lead to welfare abuse. However, its proponents believe that revenue gained by the taxman through taxes would far outweigh money lost by those who would try to game the system.\n\nAnother area of available employees is those who have retired. If a significant number can be encouraged to “unretire” it would have a beneficial impact on the job scene. With people living longer, healthier lives, extra cash in their pockets can give older individuals more options.\n\nBut some economists are suggesting more radical solutions. We should, they say, go down the route of a more generous visa waiver system for poorer countries, workers from outside the European Economic Area who would be happy to come here and sleep four to five to a room for the minimum wage.\n\nBut let’s face it, a policy based on slum landlords is an admission of abject failure by the political classes.\n\nThe government needs to appoint as a matter of urgency an employment czar, someone who can cut through the bureaucracy, identify solutions that will increase the workforce and push them through a moribund government.\n\nThe current political squabbling about which political party should occupy the top job among EU finance ministers shows exactly where their priority lies, and it is not with employers and their daily challenges where roles going unfilled means business opportunities are being missed. Time to take a taxi out of government, guys, if you can find one.",
    "Ben Collins – Unionists are already having conversations about a united Ireland": "Ben Collins's new book Irish Unity – Time to Prepare\n\nFor me the Good Friday Agreement was an amazing achievement. It brought to an end the Troubles and secured the peace, however imperfect, which we now enjoy. On a personal level it also enabled me to think about my own sense of identity and how I wanted to see Northern Ireland develop. It allowed me to think about a united Ireland and whether I wanted there to be one, in a way which had not been possible before. Until that point I was determined that I was not going to be forced into a united Ireland through violence or the threats of violence.\n\nI had been a student in Dundee while the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated and returned to Belfast just after the referendum had passed. There was a sense of hope that Northern Ireland could become an economic powerhouse. We are still waiting for that to happen. After the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2001 I returned to Scotland. I had joined the Conservatives just before I moved because I believed in enterprise and was keen to get involved with bread and butter politics. While I had hoped and expected that Ken Clarke would become leader and take the party in a more liberal and pro-European direction, the opposite happened. I was alarmed at their increasing hostility towards Europe. At the same time I heard the SNP talk about fiscal autonomy which really appealed to me. I left the Conservative party after two years.\n\nBeing away from Northern Ireland I was able to embrace my growing sense of Irishness and desire for Irish unity. The beauty of the Good Friday Agreement was that you could be Irish, British, European or all three. Borders were increasingly irrelevant until the EU referendum. While I realised that the vote would be a lot closer than people originally thought, I was genuinely shocked when the UK, or more specifically England and Wales voted for Brexit.\n\nWhile Irish unity had been a long term aspiration of mine, it became an urgent necessity for me after the vote for Brexit. The six years since the vote have been distressing and unsettling in many ways. Members of my own immediate family and close friends voted for Brexit. I do not think that anyone is happy with how it has turned out. My sense of Britishness had dissipated over time and seeing elderly men in Sunderland celebrating the vote to leave the European Union struck me as such an alien idea.\n\nThe idea to write a book on Irish unity came to me in July 2012 just before the London Olympics. I could tell that politics across the UK was changing when the Scottish referendum was called. The UK government intended to win by a clear two to one margin to put the issue to rest for a generation, but the final vote was much closer. It was only after the Brexit vote that I decided to focus seriously on setting out my thoughts on how we could achieve a New Ireland.\n\nI know that Irish unity has been an aspirational ideal for many people for a long time. But when you consider the damage which is being done to the island of Ireland by Brexit, there is now a hard-headed rationale for planning and preparing now.\n\nLike several thousand other people I will be travelling to Dublin on Saturday to attend the Ireland’s Future event ‘Together We Can’ in the 3Arena and I look forward to speaking at it. While political unionism rarely engages in the debate on Irish unity, I know from personal experience that people from unionist backgrounds are already taking part in this conversation. It may not often be happening out in the open, but these discussions are taking place. Often these private chats will cover the same points, Brexit is a disaster, Westminster is dysfunctional and political unionism is completely out of touch. People are open to a different future but they want to know what this will involve and what will it mean for them and their families. In a very small way I hope to add to this conversation with my book ‘Irish Unity: Time to Prepare’ and play my part in helping us to plan and prepare in advance of the border poll which I think is likely at some point over the next decade. I believe that we can win that vote and it will be a success if we have a plan in place beforehand.\n\n:: 'Irish Unity: Time to Prepare' by Ben Collins is published by Luath Press and will be launched at Belfast's Linen Hall Library on Thursday October 6.",

    "Coming of age as a poet: Tim Atkinson on Ireland’s other Larkin": "Philip Larkin: spent five vital years in Ireland in the 1950s, enjoying what he described as “The best writing conditions I ever had.” Photograph: Barry Wilkinson/Getty Images\n\nBig Jim might be better known (with good reason) but his English namesake Philip Larkin spent five vital years in Ireland in the 1950s, coming of age as a poet and enjoying what he described as “The best writing conditions I ever had.” Who knows how much larger his poetic legacy might have been had he enjoyed those conditions longer?\n\nBorn on August 9th, 1932, the lugubrious librarian and poet of provincial England fell under the spell of William Butler Yeats as a young man. That wasn’t to last; but Larkin’s fondness for Ireland was. He was sub-librarian at Queen’s University from 1950-1955. The man who became (unfairly) branded “the hermit of Hull” was anything but in Belfast. In charge of the issue-desk by day, he then “wrote between eight and ten in the evenings” in his high-windowed attic rooms in Elmwood Avenue before meeting colleagues in the SCR bar. After closing time he then “played cards or talked with friends until one or two.”\n\nAmbitious, both in his professional and literary careers, he moved back to England to take up the post of university librarian at Hull, remaining there for the rest of his life. But Ireland was always more than a memory. Two years after leaving he was back in Belfast as best man at his friend Alec Dalgarno’s wedding at St George’s Church in the centre of the city. At first amused to discover that the officiating priest was called St John Puke, Larkin was later alarmed by the cleric’s lack of self-control at the wedding reception. The priest insisted on loudly proclaiming “a stream of sentimental verbiage so nauseating as to be laughable,” Larkin confided to a friend. “At times I wondered if as best man I ought to knock him out, but he had apparently played rugger for Ireland in his day and was built on the general lines of Spencer Tracy and Tom Teevan (both of whom he strongly resembled) so I decided against doing so, perhaps wisely.”\n\nIn 1969 Queen’s awarded Larkin an honorary D Litt, and though he stayed in Belfast for just one night in July, he and his partner Monica Jones returned later that summer for one of their longest holidays, staying with friends at Westport in Co Mayo and paying a visit to the capital that was to inspire the poem Dublinesque just a year later. Describing a funeral procession, the poem ends with the half-heard name of the deceased, as sung by the mourners, as well as with one of the most succinct, emotional punch-lines imaginable:\n\nREAD MORE\n\nA voice is heard singing\n\nOf Kitty, or Katy\n\nAs if the name meant once\n\nAll love, all beauty.\n\nLate Larkin was very pro-Thatcher and anti-trade unions (which would have enraged Jim). Because of this, Jonathan Raban once described the Belfast Larkin as a Loyalist. But his attitude to the Orange marches he witnessed was nothing if not nuanced and a short, unpublished poem referring to Ian Paisley as the “Pope” of Ulster seems to be less than supportive of July 12th bonfires and marches:\n\nSee the Pope of Ulster stand,\n\nSpiked shillelagh in each hand,\n\nVowing to uphold the Border,\n\nFather, Son and Orange Order.\n\nThat may be doggerel, but what Larkin was writing in the Belfast years was the poetry that was to make his name. It marked the end of a period of doubt and inactivity. “After finishing my first books,” he writes, “I thought I had come to an end. I couldn’t write another novel, I published nothing . . . Then in 1950 I went to Belfast, and things reawoke somehow. I wrote some poems,” he remarks, modestly, and “felt for the first time I was speaking for myself. Thoughts, feelings, language cohered and jumped.”\n\nThose thoughts and feelings, that language, jumped to form The Less Deceived, Larkin’s second collection but the first to receive widespread acclaim. Although published in Hull by the Marvell Press, many of the poems had their genesis in Ireland. Some were written directly in response to experiences in Belfast. Church Going, for example, was inspired in part by a visit to a ruined church outside the city:\n\nA serious house on serious earth it is,\n\nIn whose blent air all our compulsions meet,\n\nAre recognised, and robed as destinies.\n\nAnd that much never can be obsolete,\n\nSince someone will forever be surprising\n\nA hunger in himself to be more serious,\n\nAnd gravitating with it to this ground,\n\nWhich, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,\n\nIf only that so many dead lie round.\n\n“One cannot overstate the effect that the move to Belfast had on his work,” writes Richard Bradford in his book The Importance of Elsewhere – “it wrought the transformation of Larkin from frustrated novelist to the finest English poet of the late twentieth century.”",
    "Travel Between Spain & Ireland Returns to Pre-Pandemic Levels As COVID-19 Restrictions Drop": "Irish passengers are no longer required to present a COVID-19 certificate in order to enter Spanish territory, which is expected to affect the levels of air traffic between the two countries.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs of Thursday, the Spanish government removed all requirements for a COVID-19 certificate, which indicates that the traveller is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, was infected with the virus, or has tested negative in the recent 72 to 48 hours, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nThis means that all Irishmen, regardless of their vaccination status, are now able to visit Spain restriction free.\n\n“Passengers coming to Spain from countries within the European Union or Schengen Area are not asked to show a Covid certificate or the Spain Travel Health form. From Ireland to Spain, there will be no Covid-19 restrictions. Certificates of COVID-19 vaccination/testing are not required,” the Department of Foreign Affairs wrote in a statement.\n\nHowever, due to the local public transportation laws, travellers on flights to Spain will be required to wear a mask, but not necessarily on their return flight.\n\nAlthough restrictions for wearing a mask in Spain differ by region, in general, while using public transportation, visiting dispensaries, healthcare settings, taxis and other sharing transportation services, travellers are required to wear a mask.\n\nIn addition, British holidaymakers, and others from countries outside the EU or Schengen area, are still bound to show proof of full vaccination, recovery from COVID-19, or a negative antigen or PCR test in order to enter Spain.\n\nStarting on Monday, September 26, Spain will start a new Coronavirus vaccine campaign, when the fourth dose will be provided to vulnerable groups. The country has experienced an increased incidence rate, with infections being more common among those older than 60 years old.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of hospitalisations has been relatively low in the past week, except in one region. The Ministry of Health has registered 10,306 new COVID-19 infections in Spain, which is higher compared to the 8,320 cases reported last week. This brings the total number of infections since the pandemic started to 13,403,502.\n\nAs of September 26, 92.8 per cent of the population over the age of 12 is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which means that a total of 39.1 million people have two doses of vaccination. On the other hand, 39.2 million people, representing 93.1 per cent, have had at least one dose of vaccination.\n\nEditor’s Pick:",

Photograph: Bryan O Brien\n\nNothing invites criticism quite like a column from an economist producing evidence, via facts and data, indicating that Ireland is not such a bad place. Critics on the hand-wringing left argue that Ireland is a neoliberal, fat-cat kleptocracy, while critics on the nativist right warn of a multicultural powder keg.\n\nBoth extremes have specific and legitimate grievances that represent real voter concern but the general picture in Ireland is far removed from the dystopia of the right and the left. The “Ireland is crap” brigade are way off the mark: Ireland is among the least unequal countries in the world, while the Irish tax and welfare systems, far from bolstering inequality, work the hardest in the world to redistribute income from the richest earners to the poorest.\n\nBefore taxes and transfers, Ireland is the 33rd most unequal country in the world, in a ranking where 35th is the worst position and first the best. After taxes and social welfare, Ireland is the 13th, moving in line with other European countries. The poorest people in Ireland, the 5 per cent at the bottom, are 63 per cent richer than the poorest people in the UK.\n\nThe evidence you are about to read serves to reinforce the need to fix Ireland’s housing crisis, which undermines the achievements of our economy and besmirches our society. If we fix housing, we fix almost everything, as most of the other heavy lifting has been accomplished.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe Financial Times’ economics journalist John Burn-Murdoch is incredibly skilled at explaining dense data in a visual and comprehensible way. He wrote a column last week about the levels of income inequality in the UK and the United States, concluding that the two countries displayed levels of inequality far exceeding those in other well-off countries.\n\nThis description chimed with my own experience in the UK. A few years back, having accompanied an under-13s football team (Cabinteely Boys) on a trip to Birmingham, I remember being taken aback by the poverty. Watching schoolboy football takes you all over Dublin — you get to see it all, including Cherry Orchard, incidentally, one of the great Irish schoolboy football clubs. Nothing compares to the urban poverty on view in Stechford, east Birmingham.\n\nLooking at the very richest first, the chart tells us that being in the richest cohort in Ireland, the UK or Norway puts you among the richest people in the world. Graphic: John Burn-Murdoch/@johnburnmurdoch/FinancialTimes\n\nThe Financial Times article trawled the data for disposable income, covering various income groups from the poorest to the richest people in a variety of countries. It found that the gaps between the richest and poorest were most stark in the UK and the US, which is not so surprising. Much of the economic and social policy pursued by both countries was designed to engineer such an outcome. Fascinated by such a comprehensive investigation, I asked Burn-Murdoch to send me the Irish data. The result is the chart above comparing Norway and Switzerland, the two best countries in which to be born either rich or poor, with the UK, US and Ireland, showing progress since 2005.\n\n[ French embassy issues warning over ‘severe housing crisis’ in Ireland ]\n\nThe way to read these charts is from left to right, noting the fifth percentile on the left is the poorest 5 per cent of the population; the 10th percentile is the poorest 10 per cent; the median is the income of the people right in the middle; the 90th percentile is the very wealthy top 10 per cent; and the 97th percentile is the uber-rich top 3 per cent.\n\nLooking at the very richest first, the chart tells us that being in the richest cohort in Ireland, the UK or Norway puts you among the richest people in the world. These are Irish people who take home about €95,000 or more after tax. Only the Swiss rich are much richer. Being in the top 10 highest earners in the country also puts you in the extremely rich global club. As you can see, the American wealthy leave the rest behind. Interestingly, Irish wealthy people are wealthier than their UK counterparts, meaning they have more disposable income.\n\nSocially, Ireland left the UK behind a long time ago. And although it seems natural to benchmark ourselves against our neighbours, such comparisons flatter to deceive\n\nSo far, so plutocratic. In terms of exposing myths and shibboleths, things get more interesting as we move towards the average. The people right in the middle in Ireland have 20 per cent more income, after tax, than the people in the middle in the UK, while the people in the middle in Norway, Switzerland and the US are richer. If you are in the middle in Ireland, your standard of living is about the same as the middle in most developed countries.\n\nAs we can see from the data, the poorest 10 per cent in Ireland rank well above the developed-world average and some 45 per cent above their counterparts in the UK, while the bottom 5 per cent of Irish earners have a standard of living which is 63 per cent higher than the poorest people in the UK.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the gap between the richest earners and the poorest is about three times, the richest taking home about three times more than the poorest. In Ireland, the richest 10 per cent take home a little bit more than three times the poorest, as is the case in Norway. In the UK, however, the richest 10 per cent take home closer to six times the poorest. This gap, more than anything else, explains the fractious, divided nature of UK politics, where regional and social deprivation pushes people to extremes. Underneath all that pomp this week lies a very unequal country.\n\n[ The Irish Times view on the student housing crisis: a test the State has failed ]\n\nSocially, Ireland left the UK behind a long time ago. And although it seems natural to benchmark ourselves against our neighbours, such comparisons flatter to deceive; we should compare ourselves with other developed social democratic countries in the European Union. However, this UK and international data will be interesting for the coming debate on a united Ireland. As Northern Ireland is among the poorest region in an already poor UK, one shudders to think what the comparators might reveal.\n\nAs is always the case with statistics, the old expression “every statistic has an agenda” should be kept in mind. Quite apart from disposable income survey data, which is the standardised way of measuring international living standards, there is another series published by the EU called actual individual consumption or AIC. This attempts to measure consumption per head of public and private goods. On this measure, Ireland comes out below the EU average and is used by others to argue that the country is poorer than the disposable income data indicates. However, AIC is an average figure, meaning you add up everything and divide it by the number of people to get a per-capita figure.\n\nThis approach masks a problem with averages. For example, say you were drinking with your four friends and those at the table had an average pretax income of €50,000. If Denis O’Brien joined you (worth €3.2 billion, apparently), the average income of the table would go up to €640 million. You get the picture.\n\nAlso, as AIC takes in health provision, Ireland, with not only the youngest population in Europe but also the smallest old population because of outsize emigration until the late 1980s, consumes less healthcare. Furthermore, AIC does not capture the fact that Irish people save a lot more than the rest of the EU — 19.1 per cent compared with 14.5 per cent, meaning a full 4.5 per cent of income is not captured.\n\nThe evidence reveals that Irish standards of living are high relative to the rest of our peers and that levels of income inequality between top earners and bottom earners are far better than the UK and are on par with other EU countries. Our tax and welfare systems are highly progressive. But the big problem is housing. Unless Ireland faces down property interests and builds tens of thousands of homes at every price range, then all the good work will come to nowt.\n\nWhat better incentive can there be to get our houses in order?\n\nRead more from David McWilliams\n\n[ David McWilliams: The property market and its players have changed profoundly since 2008.

    "Ireland has ‘stubbornly high gender pay gap’, says Ictu": "Ictu president Kevin Callinan during the launch of the union's toolkit relating to guidance for unions on closing the gender pay gap. Photograph: Gareth Chaney/Collins\n\nIreland has a “stubbornly high gender pay gap”, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) has said.\n\nKevin Callinan, president of the Ictu, said Ireland’s gender pay gap stood at 11.3 per cent, according to the latest Eurostat data, as a new guide for trade unions on gender pay gap reporting was published in Dublin on Monday.\n\nUnder new legislation which came into force earlier this year, organisations with more than 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap for 2022 in December, with the data based on a “snapshot” date of their choosing in June.\n\nThe legislation will be extended to organisations with 150 or more employees in 2024, and those with 50 or more employees in 2025.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMr Callinan said the Ictu believed that gender pay gap reporting legislation was potentially a “mechanism to encourage employers into tangible action to bridge the gap. It is also an opportunity for unions to negotiate actions to address pay inequality and we will be seeking engagement with employers when the first set of audit reports are published in December, in order to agree a set of measures to be taken by the employer to eliminate or reduce any gaps identified.”\n\n‘Unequal pay’\n\nDr Jane Pillinger, consultant and author of the guide, said gender pay reporting was an important milestone in “the fight against unfair and unequal pay, particularly for women workers in low paid and undervalued jobs. Trade unions have a vital role to play in finding solutions with employers and bringing unequal pay and its root causes into collective bargaining. The guidance is aimed at building union strategies and actions on gender pay gap reporting and the wider structural causes of unequal pay.”\n\nMinister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman said the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland was a “major step forward in terms of addressing gender inequality in the workplace. If a company doesn’t adhere to its obligations under the legislation, IREC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has the power to bring those companies to court. That’s quite a sizable and important provision to make sure that there is adherence to this new law.”\n\nMr O’Gorman said it was hoped gender pay gap reporting would go “a long way towards improving our understanding of the pay gap and incentivising employers to use whatever means they can to reduce that gap. With 65 per of all employees in the State estimated to fall within the scope of the act, the publication of gender pay gap information will provide a range of data about firms and sectors and how they contribute to the gender pay gap in the economy as a whole.”",
