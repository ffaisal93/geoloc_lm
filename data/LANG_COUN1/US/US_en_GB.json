    "Detection of circulating vaccine derived polio virus 2 (cVDPV2) in environmental samples– the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America": "\n\n\n\nSituation at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than two months later, these samples were classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2 on 8 August. As of 5 September, no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between 21 April to 26 August 2022 from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July, a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the first case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on 3 August and 11 August) containing more than five nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County – these viruses are now being classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel1.\n\nFigure-1 Detection of genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates in the United Kingdom and the United States of America from February to August 2022\n\nEpidemiology of Poliomyelitis\n\nPolio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).\n\nThe virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented by immunization.\n\nThe incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease often goes unrecognized.\n\nVaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).",

We are particularly concerned about the persistent digital divides that further exacerbate social and economic inequalities around the world.\n\nNow more than ever we need a strong, impactful, and efficient Union providing core expertise in the domains of radio communications, telecommunications/ICTs standards, and bridging the digital divide, including with regard to gender, age and persons with specific needs. The Union should contribute to the digital transformation that puts humans at the centre, empowers individuals and provides meaningful connectivity.\n\nTo this end, we promote a human rights-based approach to the whole life cycle of telecommunication/ICT technologies – including design, development, deployment, use and disposal - as part of a human-centric vision of the digital transformation, including in international standard-setting processes.\n\nIn this light, we should work together to achieve a digital transformation based on openness, inclusion, equality, sustainability, resilience and security. We encourage the ITU, as a member of the UN family and working with other Standard Development Organisations to develop international telecommunications/ICTs standards that are consistent with existing international frameworks on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nWe welcome other UN efforts in this direction, in particular the Human Rights Council Resolution on new and emerging digital technologies and human rights (A/HRC/RES/47/23) that calls for consultations with standard development organizations on human rights and telecommunication/ICT.\n\nIt is equally important that the ITU, which builds upon the expertise of various stakeholders, including industry, SMEs, and academia, redoubles its efforts to make its procedures more transparent and accessible, including to organizations active on human rights aspects of telecommunications/ICTs. Forging consensus and making sure that all stakeholders are heard forms a critical part of the ITU´s work.\n\nThank you for your attention",

    "Everything to Know About the Union Jack, United Kingdom's National Flag": "The Union Jack, also known as the Union Flag, is the national flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories, and is rooted in a 400-year history.\n\nIt is largely associated with ideals of pride and patriotism, which is why the flag has been proudly scattered and sported among the tens of thousands of spectators who have lined the streets to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's long life and reign following her death.\n\nWhile the Royal Standard flag was draped over Her Majesty's coffin during the funeral and several processions, it differs from the Union Jack in that it represents the Sovereign and the United Kingdom.\n\nBoth flags were notably used to signify the Queen's presence in Buckingham Palace. The Royal Standard would only fly when she was there, while the Union Jack would fly when she was not.\n\nIn the wake of the Queen's death, the Union Jack is to be flown at half-mast. (The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast — \"even after the death of a monarch, as there is always a Sovereign on the throne.\")\n\nFrom the Union Jack's origin to the meaning behind its multiple crosses, here's everything to know about the United Kingdom's national flag.\n\nWhich countries does the Union Jack flag represent?\n\nHollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe Union Jack flag is the national flag of the United Kingdom. It represents the four countries that are united under one Sovereign, including England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland — though since 1921, only northern Ireland has remained a part of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn addition, commonwealth countries have incorporated the Union Jack within their flags to signify the history of British settlement, including Australia, New Zealand, and Tuvalu.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. state of Hawaii, several Australian states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia), and three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario) feature Union Jack on their flags.\n\nWhy is the United Kingdom's national flag called Union Jack?\n\nEd Ram/Getty\n\nThere is much debate about the exact origin of the Union Jack flag's name. In the 16th century, it was initially called the British flag and in 1625, the word \"Union\" was introduced.\n\nWhen the flag was first created in 1606, it was ordered primarily to fly at sea, situated atop the main masthead of all English and Scottish ships, warships and merchant ships. Before the 1600s, the term \"jack\" was used to describe a small flag flown at the bow of a ship.\n\nSome believe the \"Union Jack\" title dates back to Queen Anne's reign from 1702 to 1714, per the royal family's official website. Others believe it derives from the \"jack-et\" of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who formed the first union in 1603.\n\nAnother alternative is that the name is rooted in a proclamation by Charles II, \"that the Union Flag should be flown only by ships of the Royal Navy as a jack,\" the royal family website also notes.\n\nWhat do the colors and crosses on the Union Jack flag represent?\n\nZac Goodwin - WPA Pool/Getty\n\nThe Union Jack consists of three heraldic crosses combined: Saint George's Cross of England, Saint Andrew's Cross of Scotland and Saint Patrick's Cross of Ireland. The layout of the flag has evolved since the first Union Flag — which is what it was initially known as — was created in 1606.\n\nThe first Union Flag only consisted of England's red cross of Saint George on a white background combined with Scotland's white diagonal cross on a blue background. But since it is not considered permissible to have red on a blue background, according to heraldry, the red cross had to be bordered with white.\n\nIt wasn't until Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom in 1801 that Saint Patrick's Cross was added to the flag, represented by the diagonal red cross on a white background.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

When its present design was deemed official in 1801, it was ordered to be flown solely on all the King's forts and castles.\n\nPrior to the Queen's death, the Union Jack was flown above Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Sandringham when she was not in residence. Following her death, it is flown at half-mast.\n\n\"The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast, as the Sovereign never dies (the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor),\" the royal family's official website states.\n\nGovernment buildings must fly the Union Jack flag on Royal Family birthdays, Commonwealth Day, Coronation Day, The Queen's official birthday, Remembrance Day and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament.\n\nIn more recent years, U.K. government buildings have been encouraged to fly the flag all year round. In the wake of the Queen's death, the Union Jack flag — in addition to all official flags — should be lowered to half-masted until 8 a.m. on the day after the Queen's state funeral.",
    "UK's former Labour leader snapped playing Thatcher-slaying Doom mod": "Audio player loading…\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour party and two-time candidate for Prime Minister, has been pictured enjoying a game of Thatcher's Techbase in Liverpool ( thanks, Indy100 ). Thatcher's Techbase is a Doom II mod where the late Margaret Thatcher returns to the tenth circle of hell, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the player sets out to make sure that this time 'CyberThatcher' stays dead.\n\nDoubtless the current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will be delighted to discover that Corbyn's been digitally blasting away at a dead Tory Prime Minister. There isn't even any ambiguity about it, one picture shows him staring at the screen with hands on the controls, and in the second it looks like he's… dabbing?\n\nHe liked the game 🙂 pic.twitter.com/fD9VuNVvYZSeptember 25, 2022 See more\n\nThe Thatcher's Techbase cabinet made its debut at The World Transformed festival, and was built by Thatcher's Techbase creator Jim Purvis to support the tenants' rights organisation Living Rent. Alongside the pictures of Corbyn, Purvis noted that \"he liked the game\" with a smile emoji.\n\nUK politics has been something of a clown show for the last decade and yet even so this is one of the wildest things to happen in some time. Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader from 2015-2020, during which time the party was in opposition, and was loved by elements of the left for exactly the same reason that the right hated him.\n\nCorbyn's a dyed-in-the-wool socialist leftie, the type of politician who attends picket lines (and radical festivals like this), and he has a knack for saying things that make more centrist voters baulk. A British Bernie Sanders with an allotment. Ultimately the Labour party under his leadership was an electoral failure, and this can be attributed partly to Corbyn's disastrous relationship with the media: he seems a nice enough guy but they monstered him, and he certainly gave them the material to do it with.\n\nJeremy Corbyn now sits as an independent MP, amidst an ongoing disagreement with the parliamentary Labour party, and so there's an element of this which is just him saying 'screw it, why not shoot Thatcher in a game'—it's not like he's worried about the next general election. It should also be said that this is, fundamentally, pretty funny: we're talking about an old socialist playing a Doom II mod starring CyberThatcher.\n\nNevertheless, if you're outside the UK, here's why this could well turn into a shitstorm. Margaret Thatcher is a figure reviled by elements of the UK, for reasons way too numerous to go into here, and conversely idolised by her own side as the Iron Lady of British politics. Jeremy Corbyn is meanwhile something of a boogeyman for right-leaning Brits, and a Captain Planet-esque idol for the socialist left.",

    "What the death of Queen Elizabeth II means for the United Kingdom": "The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport)\n\nOne of the main problems with the heavy handed establishment responses to the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign are the insistent the declarations of national greatness that so many feel cause to proclaim. Not only does this nationalist cringing conjure an anachronistic nostalgia for greatness at a time when more than one in five Brits live in poverty. Somehow, amidst all the commentary, there is very little reflection on what the death of Queen Elizabeth II might actually mean for the symbolic decline of that greatness, and which will be nowhere more clearly expressed in the end of two geopolitical arrangements: the Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nFirst, Elizabeth II’s death heralds the end of the Commonwealth – perhaps not immediately, but certainly before the century’s end, and possibly within the next decade. Initially formed in the year of Elizabeth’s birth as the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Commonwealth later dropped ‘British’ from its title and established a criteria of ‘free and equal’ status between its fifty six members in 1949.\n\nElizabeth took the throne just three years later, and the Commonwealth became a point of immense personal passion and pride. Her first public speech in 1940 had been addressed to ‘the children of the Commonwealth’, and she was in Kenya when she inherited the Crown. One of the few times she made her politics publicly known was when Thatcher refused to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa. Recognising the threat Thatcher’s position posed to the integrity of the Commonwealth, the Queen’s ‘dismay’ was uncharacteristically leaked to several papers, including The Times.\n\nIf the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise\n\nHistorically, the Commonwealth has been the institutional vehicle by which Britain managed the formal decolonisation of its Empire. In the past few days, many on the left have understandably pointed to the Queen as a symbol of British colonialism. But as the head of the Commonwealth, she might also be seen as the monarch who oversaw the careful management of the Empire’s gradual dismantling (this is not to say that colonialism does not continue in other forms).\n\nFrom this view, the Commonwealth can be seen as a halfway stage between Britain’s formal Empire and the arrival of full political decolonisation. In the Caribbean, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Saint Vincent, and the Grenadines have been on the verge of leaving the Commonwealth for some time, and several other territories host significant republican movements. The death of Queen Elizabeth II will only accelerate this historical flow.\n\nHastening the break up of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, it is likely that Elizabeth’s death will not only hasten the break-up of the Commonwealth, but also the fragmentation of the Union itself. Unlike the US, France, Germany, or pretty much any other modern democracy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no written constitution. Instead, when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland joined together in 1707, the constitution was embodied in the person of the monarch.\n\nThis is why you now hear politicians celebrating Elizabeth for standing as a constant above the ‘clashes of politics’ – she was the constitution, both figuratively and literally. With her death, the post-war iteration of that constitution – the only one most living Britons have known – has come apart.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that Charles III will be incapable of reinventing anything like the quiet soft power Elizabeth once held. A second independence referendum in Scotland seems just one general election away; a referendum on Irish reunification is only a little further down the line. If the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise.\n\nPerhaps this is the same process of decolonisation running its course – England and Scotland already had colonial possessions in 1707, and Great Britain was always an imperial state, so the break-up of the United Kingdom is arguably the decolonial endgame. But even if that is the case, this process is far more likely to fuel reactionary rather than progressive politics if no efforts are made to find stability through different constitutional means.\n\nAnyone with an understanding of the Queen’s political gravity may therefore feel concerned at the passing of her symbolic heft. For ‘Great Britain’, as an historical territory and imagined community, truly is adrift without it.\n\nA democratic non-monarchical settlement\n\nI say that not as a monarchist or nationalist, whose reach for hyperbolic epithets about British greatness betrays the deepening insecurity of our current settlement. Instead, I invoke it as a republican who recognises how desperately Britain needs a new settlement, one that is capable of tackling multiple, interlinked crises in health, energy, climate, education, social care, regional inequality, and political representation.\n\nWe need a new constitutional agreement for Britain that foregrounds democracy, devolves authority, empowers regions, redistributes wealth, and holds political and financial elites to account. We might call this something like a Green New Deal, but in Britain it must go much deeper than infrastructure plans. Practically, it could start with the removal of unelected leaders, including in the House of Lords, and move towards a vision of the isles as a collection of federalised states with shared constitutional values that are actually written down.\n\nThe specifics will need to be debated, of course. But whatever form they take, it is clear that we need an idea of Britain that has come to terms with the Empire that it was, and which is equally realistic about what it might yet become. Without recognition of this need in constitutional arrangements, we will continue to plunge forward, blind to the many challenges that are quickly becoming far too real to alleviate with the pseudo-warmth of nationalist platitudes.\n\nWe currently lack the imaginative and empathic leaders needed to bring such changes about. Until they emerge, Britain will continue to crumble, shedding parts of itself, and concealing its waning political power beneath the peeling sticking plaster of the culture wars. Meanwhile, more and more of British society will struggle and suffer, rocked by climate and energy crises, disinvested from meaningful imagined communities, and now deprived of even the symbolic salve that Queen Elizabeth II once provided.\n\nDominic Davies is Senior Lecturer in English at City, University of London.

    "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy": "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy\n\nThe Queen’s death came at a volatile period in British politics, with a recent scandal-induced change of prime minister and skyrocketing energy, food, and gasoline expenses, according to Kevin McGlone, a history professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, in an interview.\n\n“A 2021 poll conducted in England, Scotland, and Wales found that Queen Elizabeth had 70 percent approval, but only 50 percent approved of her son and heir Charles, now King Charles III. It remains to be seen how her death and Charles’ succession to the throne affect public attitudes of the monarchy,” he added.\n\nWith the death and burial of the Queen now over, King Charles is expected to settle in for his real role.\n\nWhat to know about the King and why he is called the ‘green monarch’\n\nCharles Philip Arthur George Windsor, the first son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip, was born on November 14, 1948. As the first modern heir to the British throne, Charles was educated outside of the palace rather than receiving private tutoring, and he later graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts.\n\nWhen the queen died on September 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, ascended to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles III is the oldest person to become a British monarch, at the age of 73.\n\nBritain’s next King is a dedicated environmentalist with a long history of pushing for improved conservation, organic farming, and climate change mitigation, which is likely to appeal to more environmentally aware younger Britons.\n\nHow wealthy is he?\n\nAccording to Forbes.com, an American business magazine, Charles now supervises $42 billion in assets and inherited $500 million from Queen Elizabeth, including her castles, jewels, art collection, and a horse farm—all of which are tax-free.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles established a number of initiatives to conserve the environment and promote organic farming. Charles controlled the largest organic food brand in the United Kingdom, as well as a nature retreat and crafts centre in Transylvania, both of which run as bed & breakfasts, through his Charitable Foundation (which William now inherited).\n\nThe sour love story\n\nLady Diana Spencer, later known as Princess Diana, was Charles’ first wife.\n\nThey were married for 15 years, from 1981 through 1996.\n\nDiana was 20 years old and Charles was 32 years old when they married.\n\nTheir wedding was described as a fairy tale, but their marriage was not. The royal couple divorced in 1996 after splitting in 1992.\n\nCharles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he met almost a decade before in 1970, as the public eventually discovered.\n\nEventually, Charles married Camilla in Windsor in 2005, 8 years after the death of Princess Diana in Paris.\n\nRead also: King Charles officially proclaimed as Britain’s new monarch\n\nHis experience in the corridors of power\n\nPrince Charles is no stranger to political machinations globally.\n\nHe has been to Washington at least 20 times and met every President of the United States since Jimmy Carter.\n\nDuring a three-day visit to the United States in 2015, Charles met with then President Barack Obama for the second time. Obama said in the Oval Office that the American people were “very fond of the royal family,” and that they “like them much better than their own politicians.”\n\n“I don’t believe that,” the king said.\n\nAlso, when former President Donald Trump’s visited the United Kingdom in 2019, Charles was supposed to meet with the American leader for around 15 minutes, but they ended up talking for longer.\n\nAfter their encounter, Trump described him as “a very good person” who was “very into climate change.”\n\n“What touched me was his concern for future generations,” Trump stated. “He wants to ensure that future generations have a decent climate rather than a calamity, and I agree.”\n\nSimilarly, he engaged President Biden at the COP26 climate meeting in Scotland in November 2021 who commended him for his environmental leadership, saying, “We need you badly… and I’m not just saying that.”\n\nThe king’s speech and the water it holds\n\nKing Charles III gave his first speech to the nation as the British monarch on September 9, 2022 following the passing of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn his speech, he paid tribute to his mother, saying: “Throughout her life, Her Majesty The Queen -my beloved Mother – was an inspiration and example to me and to all my family, and we owe her the most heartfelt debt any family can owe to their mother; for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example.”\n\n“Queen Elizabeth’s was a life well lived; a promise with destiny kept and she is mourned most deeply in her passing. That promise of lifelong service I renew to you all today,” King Charles continued.\n\n“The role and the duties of monarchy also remain,” King Charles said, highlighting his responsibility towards the Church of England and his own deep-rooted faith.\n\n“As the queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I, too, now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation,” he said.\n\n“And wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the Realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavor to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life,” he added.\n\nAccording to royal.uk, some of the roles of the monarchy that remains in practice include: to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters and by convention, to not vote or stand for election; however, they do have important ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the government of the UK.\n\nWhich countries recognise Charles as king?\n\nLike his mother, Charles is the king of the UK as well as 14 other nations, including Canada and others in the Asia-Pacific and Caribbean referred to as the Commonwealth realms.\n\nThey are distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations, a loose association of 54 former British Empire members, the majority of which are now sovereign.\n\nThe Commonwealth realms collectively have about 150 million residents, with the UK, Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand having the highest populations.",

I was extremely independent, and – as a woman – felt very strongly about being a role model for my boys. I think that is what you have to learn to hang onto, that on the inside, you haven't changed.”, she recounts.\n\nHelena is one of six people in a short film documentary that sheds light on the experiences of people living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions around the world. People with lived experience often can offer valuable expertise and powerful narratives on how to manage and improve their individual health as well as the health of fellow community members. Their first-hand insights can help shape policies, create better health programmes, and inspire others to contribute.\n\nWHO is dedicated to advancing the meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions worldwide, and has recently established a range of activities and platforms to support this goal. The latest is a new film series on the topic in all six UN languages.\n\nWatch the entire 30-minute documentary, “Nothing for Us, Without Us: listening and learning from people with lived experience”, on WHO’s YouTube channel:\n\nType 2 diabetes in a changing environment: Ali’s lived experience in Lebanon\n\nIn the municipality of Ghobeiry in Lebanon, Ali motivates others in his community to exercise, eat better food and lead a healthier life, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2017.\n\n“People may not be taking care of themselves, not because they can't buy medicine, or are without access to healthy food. They would have all the tools, but they are unable to use them for underlying mental reasons.” he says.\n\nIndividuals and communities with first-hand experience in living with NCDs and mental health conditions hold the key to designing effective, inclusive, equitable health interventions that leave no one behind. Their voices can unlock opportunities to overcome barriers in accessing and sustaining health care. The right to participate in one’s care is also a fundamental part of the human right to the highest attainable standard of health.\n\nWatch Ali’s story:\n\nGender Based Violence and Mental Health: Hauwa’s lived experience in Nigeria\n\nHauwa, a mental health and human rights advocate from Nigeria, was sexually assaulted in 2013 and diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years later.\n\n“We know what is best for us. That is why our needs, our choices, voices, and experiences have to be prioritized. We need to tell you what support looks like for us. We need to tell you what a system that is just and equal and fair looks like for us. We need to tell you what human rights respecting treatment looks like for us.”, as she calls upon policy-makers and health professionals.\n\nAmid the complex and interconnected global health landscape, the meaningful engagement of people with lived experiences is increasingly becoming a mainstay. In light of the global epidemic of NCDs, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and persisting health inequities, understanding the complex determinants of health conditions and upholding principles of respect, value and dignity are equally crucial.\n\nWatch Hauwa’s story:\n\nType 1 Diabetes and the next generation of leaders: Mark’s lived experience in Brazil\n\n“When I received the diagnosis, it was […] difficult to deal with a situation that was now mine. Even though I saw other people with diabetes […], they were much older, and I didn't know anyone my age who had diabetes. That's why it's not easy to face it., recalls Dr Mark Barone, the Brazil-based vice-president of the International Diabetes Federation.\n\nMeaningful engagement of people with lived experiences also pays particular attention to the voices of marginalized or neglected groups and communities. Community networks play a vital role in providing people with access to critical information and support and breaking down siloes and barriers.\n\nWatch Mark’s story:\n\nCommunity action on breast cancer: LaVerne’s lived experience in Australia\n\n\n\nLaVerne, a breast cancer survivor, mother, and community leader from Redfern, Australia, regularly organizes screenings and health promotion activities with Aboriginal women.\n\n“We have screening days where we bring the mammogram bus. We have lunch, we get hairdressers in, beauty practitioners. It's a real ladies’ day. It enables them to feel free and talk among themselves. Aboriginal women, you know, young women, they don't want to go and take all their clothes off and get tested.”, she points out.\n\nCrucially, meaningful engagement and co-designing health policies imply a shift from the individual as a passive user to an empowered and valued agent of change. People with lived experience do not only require a seat at the table of decision-making, but should be able to drive processes, co-create programmes, and implement contextual solutions.\n\nWatch LaVerne’s story:",
    "King Charles and the Jacobin Right": "Charles Windsor has gone through an extraordinarily rapid transformation. We all know that he became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its overseas territories and other Commonwealth realms, the second the Queen’s heart stopped beating on the afternoon of Thursday, 8 September 2022. In the minds of the UK’s Jacobin Right, he went through an even more dramatic metamorphosis at the same time: from the lunatic lefty “Clown Prince” who was in league with Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Soros and the other members of the shadowy elite syndicate that apparently run the world through the obscure auspices of the World Economic Forum — to His Majesty the King, the venerable Sovereign and beloved Liege Lord of the great country on God’s green earth.\n\nIt is one enormous throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology\n\nIt’s easy to mock the motley cast of characters that make up the crankish world of the Guido-GB News British right — and it’s very entertaining, too, so let’s do that for a paragraph. Many of them appear to be confused adolescent boys who accidentally wandered into a TV studio in the middle of a school trip and have mysteriously never been asked to leave since. Like a horrible right-wing mirror image of the deranged children that inhabit that barely-glorified hard-left intellectual creche “Novara Media”, they have been conducting an adolescent William Hague impersonation contest ever since — although to be fair to North Yorkshire’s favourite pint-downing former Tory leader, they have succeeded in making him look like a cross between Benjamin Disraeli and Edmund Burke.\n\nIt’s not just the kids though: there are plenty of hoary old-timers who have done a dramatic u-turn now that deranged eco-terrorist Prince Charles has become the Almighty’s glorious anointed. Nigel Farage interrupted a busy schedule of day-drinking, wistful self-googling and bashing away on the Daily Mail comment section to give his ever-so-slightly obsequious verdict on the King’s early performance. One can only surmise that a portrait of His Majesty has already replaced his beloved, and perhaps slightly soiled, framed photo of the Queen that he kept on his wall between the Pirelli calendars and his mint-condition collection of Rothmans cigarette cards.\n\nIn their various ways, what these characters sum up is the extent to which there is a section of the modern British right that is simply one enormous great throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology. Many of the younger ones take libertarian licence to an extreme of glorious self-parody. Should children be allowed to take crack cocaine? Or perhaps sell their kidneys at auction to a gang of international organ-harvesters in lieu of a school fundraising tombola? “Who are YOU to stop them, Nanny State Nazis?”, opine Darren Harwood and baby Guido.\n\nEnvironmental politics is a good example. It’s a complex area, and there are good reasons to be sceptical about many specific aspects of the green agenda of the government and activist groups. But it’s hard to shake off the impression that what lies behind the hysterical attacks on the then-Prince Charles’ work to highlight the risks of plummeting biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion and various other forms of environmental degradation is the same sort of emotion that lies behind the toddler who is told that they cannot have their fourth mini-milk: sheer disbelieving outrage than anybody should ever question their right to have whatever they want, whenever they want it and damn the consequences.\n\nIt’s a part of the Right Jacobin mentality that has become a distinctive phenomenon among many contemporary so-called conservatives. They share the abstract rationalising tendency of the French revolutionaries — and indeed most of the modern hard left — to see politics as a mere utilitarian machine designed to smash anything that gets in the way of the fulfilment of their immediate will and pleasure. The slow accretion of tradition as the collected wisdom of the species; the caution embodied in the idea of Chesterton’s fence; the grandeur of our long-standing national institutions: all such ideas are, in substance, so much lily-livered “bed-wetting” flim-flam so far as the San-Culottes of the Home Counties are concerned. They’d have the King in a tumbril tomorrow if they thought it would lead to zero per cent corporation tax and a lot of Albanians drowning in the English channel.\n\nSome faint glimmerings have been summoned up in their souls\n\nIronically, they reproduce in reverse so many of the assumptions of the hard left. In many cases — Tom Grimes being a good example — they are just Whiggish liberals who take the inevitable progressive course of history as a given, but disagree with the Corbynistas and nose-ringed Tankies as to what form it should take. They simply see the dynamism of the unleashed free market as a better way to the world of materialistic abundance and self-indulgence they crave than “Fully Automated Luxury Communism” or cyber-Stalinism or whatever tedious, nightmarish utopia the hard left are currently peddling. The difference is one of means, not ends: they are all equally lacking in any aesthetic or spiritual sensibility. This is really why they hated the postliberal politics of Charles, a man who values restraint, limits, boundaries, discipline; and understands that we cannot limitlessly abuse the Earth simply because we want endless wasteful profusion. It’s why they cannot truly appreciate the prescriptive wisdom of our customs and traditions.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that such Right Jacobins don’t exist in a vacuum. They are an understandable — if wrong-headed and unfortunate — overreaction to the condescension of a liberal-left technocratic mindset that is no better. When genuine debate, reasonable compromises and pragmatic accommodations are made impossible by the breakdown of meaningful democratic politics at the hands of both quasi-totalitarian progressivism and ultra-liberal hubris, one can hardly be surprised that morbid symptoms appear on the right. However intransigent the progressive Brahmins may be and however mad the social justice warriors are, it’s a mistake to respond with a sort of golf club Leninism.\n\nIn a spirit of generosity, let’s be encouraged by the fact that some faint glimmerings of the glories of tradition, duty and sacrifice have been summoned up in their souls by the death of our late Queen and the accession of Charles. It’s never too late to abandon one’s youthful revolutionary errors and embrace the politics of virtue, restraint and the transcendent. God hasn’t abandoned anyone to such errors irrevocably — even Nigel Farage.",

    "Despite Critics, Some UK Food Banks Will Close For The Queen's Funeral": "Despite Critics, Some UK Food Banks Will Close For The Queen's Funeral\n\nOn Monday, September 19, the longest reigning monarch in British history will be laid to rest at Windsor Castle after a funeral service at Westminster Abbey (via New York Times). Born on April 21, 1926, Queen Elizabeth II died at Windsor on September 8. Addressed in life by the honorific \"Majesty,\" Elizabeth's full regional title was \"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith,\" per Harper's Bazaar.\n\nA mouthful and arguably superfluous, given that the queen was one of the world's most recognizable individuals (via YouGov) and therefore unlikely to be conflated with anyone else, it's relevant nevertheless because it conveys the near-divine reverence with which the British monarch has traditionally been regarded, as reported by BBC News. And that might go a long way toward explaining why the funeral has been declared a national bank holiday by the Government of the U.K., with the result being that much of the nation will be at a standstill during the late queen's funeral and presumably, for many hours bookending the national event.\n\nFor example, hospitals are rescheduling non-essential surgeries because travel disruptions are expected (via Washington Post). Heathrow Airport will suspend flights as needed to \"ensure silence over central London\" during the processional from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. And despite vocal criticism from many, some food banks will see their important services disrupted.",

    "The Queen’s real name was a touching tribute to her family": "For over 70 years, the Queen ruled over the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth until her death last week. While she was known simply as the Queen for much of her reign, her full title was Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.\n\nOften the monarch will take on a regnal name which is different from their birth name, such as King George VI who was actually called Albert. Princess Elizabeth decided not to do this and became Queen Elizabeth II on February 6, 1952, when she began her 70 year reign.\n\nKing Charles III has followed in his mother’s footsteps by retaining his birth name as his reign name. This is thought to be, in part, because he is so familiar to the public as Charles due to the Queen's record breaking time on the throne.\n\nRead more: Full details of Queen's funeral have been released\n\nThe reason behind Queen Elizabeth’s decision to keep her birth name is unknown as she ascended so early in life. Her full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor with each name chosen to represent her lineage, although she was known as Lilibet affectionately by her family.\n\nElizabeth was the name of her mother, who was Queen Consort for 16 years and lived to be 101 years old. The Queen Mother was not known as Queen Elizabeth II to avoid confusion with her daughter who ascended to the throne at 25 years old.\n\nAlexandra was the name of Elizabeth’s paternal great-grandmother and wife of King Edward VII, Alexandra of Denmark. The Queen’s grandmother on her father’s side was called Mary, although she was known affectionately as May.\n\nThe last name for the royal family is Windsor which was chosen in 1917 by George V after the castle of the same name. Previously the royals had been referred to by house, for example Queen Victoria's eldest son Edward VII belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThis tradition was changed by Edward VII because of growing anti-German sentiment in the UK during the First World War. The Queen reaffirmed the name Windsor for royals but also said her direct line would use Mountbatten-Windsor to reflect Prince Philip’s lineage.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor is used when The Queen's children need a surname, such as upon marriage. It was first used in official documentation at the wedding of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips on November 14, 1973.\n\nREAD NEXT",

Not like his mother\n\nWho is King Charles III of the United Kingdom?\n\nBorn, Nov. 14, 1948, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor is the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip. Upon the death of the queen on Sept. 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, became king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles is known for his previous marriage to the late Princess Diana. The couple had two children, Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nMore Q&As:King Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth. What to know about British royal line.\n\nWhen will Charles be crowned?\n\nLegally, Charles became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and carries a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nThe name he chose as his regnal, or reign, name is his own first name, Charles, and it is followed by the Roman numeral III because he is the third king Charles in British history.\n\nIn the days following the queen's death, Charles was formally proclaimed as monarch in an accession ceremony and gave his first formal address as king.\n\nCharles will likely be crowned within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done.

As a result, William's wife Catherine, or Kate as she is widely known, also 40, became Princess of Wales. She is the first to hold that title since the death of Princess Diana in 1997.\n\nAfter Prince William, the line of succession turns to Prince William and Princess Kate's children. The succession is as follows:\n\nPrince William, the Prince of Wales (Charles and Diana's first-born son) Prince George of Wales (Will and Kate's first-born son) Princess Charlotte of Wales (Will and Kate's second-born daughter) Prince Louis of Wales (Will and Kate's third-born son) Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex (Charles and Diana's second-born son)\n\nMore:What happens to the other royals under King Charles III and his new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\nIs King Charles married?\n\nCharles is married to the former Camilla Parker Bowles, who was known as Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She is now the Queen Consort.\n\nLegally, Camilla was the Princess of Wales when she married Charles in 2005 but it was decided at the time she would assume one of the Charles' lesser titles instead. Diana long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles and public fury remained when Camilla and Charles married eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nWhen did Charles marry Camilla?\n\nCharles married Camilla in 2005 in two ceremonies in Windsor. Right after the reception for 800 guests at Windsor Castle, the couple left for a honeymoon in Scotland.\n\nFew Brits thought the wedding would actually happen. A future king had never married a divorced woman. Plus, Camilla was once the most despised woman in Britain, the alleged home-wrecker who broke up the marriage of Charles and Diana.\n\nBut by the couple's 10th wedding anniversary, public perception of Camilla began to change as the royal family, including the queen, embraced her. Charles once said she would never be called Queen Camilla when he assumed the throne. His wishes on that later changed, and the late queen made if official in February 2022 when she announced she wanted her heir's second wife to be known as Queen Consort.\n\nWhen were Prince Charles and Princess Diana married?\n\nCharles was first married to Lady Diana Spencer, later known as the beloved Princess Diana. They were married for 15 years from 1981 to 1996. Diana was 20 and Charles was 32 at the time of their nuptials. The wedding was billed as a fairy tale, but their married life was not.\n\nAs the public would learn later, Charles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he’d met over a decade prior in 1970. During the marriage of Charles and Diana, there were affairs on both sides.\n\nThe royal couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\n\nDiana, Charles and Camilla:The love triangle of the century\n\nWhat will Camilla be called now?\n\nPeople could call her just Queen Camilla, but her official title is Queen Consort Camilla, or Camilla, the Queen Consort.\n\nThe vexing question of what to call her once Charles assumed the throne was resolved when the late queen announced during festivities marking her seven decades on the throne that the then-Duchess of Cornwall should be known as Queen Consort, as opposed to Princess Consort, when Charles became king.\n\n\"Queen Consort\" is the fancy name for the wife of a reigning king. In general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. As with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIf King Charles dies, will Camilla be queen?\n\nWhile we call her Queen Camilla, she will never be the reigning queen. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch.\n\nWith Prince William and his son Prince George, 9, the next two in line for the throne after King Charles, a reigning queen is unlikely to come anytime soon. (There have only been six reigning queens in British history since 1066.)\n\nWho are King Charles’ siblings?\n\nKing Charles has three siblings: From oldest to youngest, Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, 72, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, 62, and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, 58. They are all children of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nCharles' only sister, Princess Anne, is a full-time working royal, currently 16th in line for the throne. She appears in line after her younger brothers because she was born before the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, which ended the system of male primogeniture.\n\nBefore the rules changed, younger sons would displace an elder daughter in the line of succession. Now the succession is based on birth order, not gender: Thus, Princess Charlotte, 7, is now third in line and ahead of her younger brother Prince Louis, 4, who is fourth.\n\nPrince Andrew is eighth in line for the throne despite his scandal-ridden history. He's been under fire in Britain since at least 2011 for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted American sex offender who died in jail in 2019. After a disastrous 2019 TV interview about his relationship with Epstein, Andrew officially stepped back from public duties and as a senior working royal.\n\nEarlier this year, Andrew settled a lawsuit with an American sexual assault accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had been airing allegations against him publicly since 2015.\n\nCharles' youngest brother, Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, is a full-time working royal and is 13th in line for the throne.\n\nWhat is King Charles III known for?\n\nBeyond his role in the royal family as William and Harry's father, the queen's son and the new king, Charles is known for his long and steady service as the Prince of Wales, as he carried out his official and ceremonial duties and established more than 20 charities, including The Prince's Trust, The Prince's Foundation and The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund.\n\nAs Queen Elizabeth's mobility waned in the months before her death, Charles stepped in for the monarch, including standing in for her for the first time at the state opening of Parliament this year, when he delivered what has long been called \"the Queen's Speech.\" Now it will be called \"the King's Speech.\"\n\nWhat are King Charles' interests? Did he serve in the military?\n\nKing Charles has shown keen interest in environmental causes including organic farming, architecture and urban planning, and fighting climate change. He served in the military, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the 1970s, and will no doubt be on hand for many military parades and events during his reign.\n\nAs king, Charles is expected to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show.\n\nMore:How much power did Queen Elizabeth II actually have? And will King Charles III have more or less?\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Marco della Cava, Andrea Mandell",

    "An Anglican theology of monarchy": "An Anglican theology of monarchy\n\nFor Christian believers, the accession of King Charles III to be king of 'the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of his other Realms and Territories' raises the question of how the monarchy is to be understood from a theological perspective.\n\nThat King Charles is the new king is without doubt, but why is he king, and what is the nature of his calling as the king? The purpose of this article is to briefly answer these two questions on the basis of the Church of England's traditional teaching about the matter.\n\nIn the British constitution (and in the constitution of the other realms over which the king rules) authority to govern flows from the king. The government is appointed by the king and rules in his name and the laws enacted by the government and voted for by Parliament have authority because king (or one of his royal predecessors) has given assent to them. Furthermore, those who have authority to uphold and enforce the law, the judiciary, the police, and ultimately the armed forces, have this authority delegated to them from the king. They act as his officers.\n\nIf we ask who gave authority to the king, the answer is that he was elected by an electorate of one, the one in question being God. This is a point that is emphasized in the homily 'Concerning good order and obedience to rulers and magistrates' in the Church of England's First Book of Homilies. This homily notes that as part of God's appointment of all things in creation 'in a most excellent and perfect order' he has given authority to kings and other rulers:\n\n'For Almighty God is the only author and provider for this forenamed state and order, as it is written of God, in the book of the Proverbs: Through me kings do reign, through me counsellors make just laws, through me do princes bear rule, and all judges of the earth execute judgement, I am loving to them that love me' (Proverbs 8:15, 17).\n\n'Here let us mark well, and remember that the high power and authority of kings, with their making of laws, judgements and offices, are the ordinances not of man, but of God: and therefore is this word (through me) so many times repeated. Here is also well to be considered and remembered, that this good order is appointed by God's wisdom, favour, and love, especially for them that love God, and therefore he saith, I love them that love me.'\n\nIf we further ask what is the role given by God to those he calls to be monarchs, the answer is that the role of the king is to exercise justice by promoting that which is right and by preventing and correcting that which is wrong. This calling to exercise justice is referred to, in line with Paul's teaching in Romans 13, as the exercise of the power of the sword, and it is symbolized in the coronation service of the British monarch by the king being given a sword by the Archbishop of Canterbury with the words:\n\n'Receive this kingly Sword, brought now from the Altar of God, and delivered to you by the hands of us the Bishops and servants of God, though unworthy. With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order: that doing these things you may be glorious in all virtue; and so faithfully serve our Lord Jesus Christ in this life, that you may reign for ever with him in the life which is to come. Amen.'\n\nThe coronation service also makes clear that the measure by which the monarch is to determine what it means to exercise justice is the teaching of the Bible. Thus, at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 the Queen was given a copy of the Bible with the words:\n\n'Our gracious Queen:\n\nto keep your Majesty ever mindful of the law and the Gospel of God\n\nas the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes,\n\nwe present you with this Book,\n\nthe most valuable thing that this world affords.\n\nHere is Wisdom;\n\nThis is the royal Law;\n\nThese are the lively Oracles of God.'\n\nThe words used at the giving of the sword, 'protect the holy Church of God,' remind us that that the monarch's calling to exercise justice by promoting the that which is right and preventing and correcting those things that are wrong extends to matters of religion as well as to secular matters.\n\nThe reason for this is explained in the words of the Church of England theologian Richard Hooker, who wrote:\n\n'A gross error it is, to think that regal power ought to serve for the good of the body, and not of the soul; for men's temporal peace, and not for their eternal safety: as if God had ordained kings for no other end and purpose but only to fat up men like hogs, and to see that they have their mast. Indeed, to lead men unto salvation by the hand of secret, invisible and ghostly regiment, or by the external administration of things belonging unto priestly order, (such as the word and sacraments are,) this is denied unto Christian kings: no cause in the world to think them uncapable of supreme authority in the outward government which disposeth the affairs of religion so far as the same are disposable by human authority, and to think them uncapable thereof, only for that the said religion is everlastingly beneficial to them that faithfully continue in it.'\n\nWhat Hooker is saying is that it is part of the role of monarchs to ensure that men's souls are cared for as well as their bodies. This makes absolutely no sense if you are a secularist and believe that this life is all that there is. However, if, in the words of the creed, you believe in 'the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come', if you believe that the final destiny intended by God for human beings is not the grave or the crematorium but 'the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God' (Revelation 21:2) and if you believe, as the New Testament tells us, that participation in the life of the new Jerusalem is not automatic, but depends on our belief and behaviour in this life, then you will think that it is the proper business of monarchs to care for the spiritual well-being of their subjects.\n\nWhat is more, because the Church is the instrument created by God to promote human spiritual well-being through the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments it follows that the monarch is properly called to 'protect the holy Church of God' from both external and internal attack in order that it may perform this God-ordained role.\n\nThe role of the British monarch as the supreme governor of the Church of England follows from the points made above. Like Hooker, Article XXXVII of the Church of England's Thirty-Nine Articles makes clear that the role of supreme governor does not mean that the Church of England gives 'to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments.' Although they are monarchs, kings and queens remain lay people.\n\nWhat it does mean is that the Church of England recognises that 'prerogative which we see to have been given always to all godly princes in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be ecclesiastical or temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.'\n\nAs we have seen, as part of their overall responsibility to bring about justice, monarchs are called to ensure the well-being of the Church of God and acting as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England is simply the exercise of this role.\n\nThe final thing to note is that responsibility flows both ways. As the monarch is called to faithfully exercise their God-given responsibilities so their subjects are called to accept their God-given authority, submit to their rule and pray for them and for all others in authority 'that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way' (1 Timothy 2:2).\n\nMartin Davie is a lay Anglican theologian and Associate Tutor in Doctrine at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford.",
    "How does the United Kingdom differ from England and Great Britain?": "Around the world the names ‘England’, ‘Great Britain’ and the ‘United Kingdom’ are often used interchangeably, generally referring to the island found just above the tip of France.\n\nHowever the death of Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned over the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, has shone extra attention on the geographical quirk. In short, those three terms relate to three different but overlapping areas.\n\nThe sovereign state which is ruled by the monarch and prime minister is the United Kingdom (UK), which is comprised of four nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The four countries are controlled by a central government in London, but do have some devolved law-making powers, similar in this regard to the US’ states.\n\nRelated: Nostradamus predictions in 2022\n\nEngland, UK or GB?\n\nWhile England is a country, it is not a sovereign state. It does not sit at the United Nations and cannot create its own border policy, for example.\n\nHowever it is by far the largest of the UK’s four composite countries, containing nearly 56 million of the UK’s 66 million inhabitants at last count. London, located in the south of England, is the national capital city and the home of the United Kingdom’s government.\n\nFor these reasons, England is often incorrectly used as shorthand for the United Kingdom, ignoring the involvement of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK is the only one of those terms that relates to a nation state with its own sovereign government.\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon offers her \"sincere and heartfelt condolences\" following the passing of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n\nLatest: https://t.co/8AFWhoW82a\n\n\n\n📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube pic.twitter.com/1Oc3NO8pQH — Sky News (@SkyNews) September 8, 2022\n\nAnd while the composite nations of the UK have their own legislative assemblies with devolved governments, ‘Great Britain’ has none of those powers. The name ‘Britain’ comes from the Roman word Britannia, which also gives the name to the Brittaney region of northern France.\n\nThere are competing arguments regarding the origins of the name ‘Great Britain’ but it is generally agreed to be a remnant of Roman occupation. Great Britain is not a country, but in fact a landmass.\n\nThe northern European island that houses England, Scotland and Wales; that’s Great Britain.\n\nWhat is the history of the name ‘United Kingdom’?\n\nOver the past 24 hours there has been a lot of mention of the UK’s thousand-year monarchy, which can be said to have begun around the year 925 with the unification of Anglo-Saxon tribes across modern day England.\n\nThe nations of England and Wales were united in 1536 when King Henry VIII enacted a bill that ensure that laws made in London applied to both countries. In 1707 the Kingdom of Scotland was added into the mix, along with England and Wales, to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nFor me, this was one of the defining moments of the Queen’s reign. 2011. The first British monarch to visit Ireland in 100 years. And she did this.\n\n\n\n“President, and friends,” she says, in Irish, to the visible astonishment of Mary McAleese.\n\n\n\nStill gives me goosebumps today. pic.twitter.com/HBic1kSG2T — Matthew Thompson (@mattuthompson) September 8, 2022\n\nIn 1801 Ireland was conquered by the British and was added to the crown’s kingdom, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However the union was not to last and in 1922 the southern counties of Ireland broke away from the UK to form the Republic of Ireland, leaving only Northern Ireland. To this day, the monarch reigns over the United Kingdom of Great and Northern Ireland."
