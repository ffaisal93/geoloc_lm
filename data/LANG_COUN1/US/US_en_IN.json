    "Apple will manufacture iPhone 14 in India": "NEW DELHI — Apple will make its iPhone 14 in India, the company said on Monday, as manufacturers shift production from China amid geopolitical tensions and pandemic restrictions that have disrupted supply chains for many industries.\n\n“The new iPhone 14 lineup introduces groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” Apple said in a statement.\n\nApple unveiled its latest line-up of iPhones earlier this month. They will have improved cameras, faster processors and longer lasting batteries at the same prices as last year’s models.\n\nIndia is the world’s second-largest smartphone market after China but Apple iPhone sales have struggled to capture a large share of the market against cheaper smartphones from competitors.\n\nThe announcement from the Cupertino, California-based company dovetails with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for local manufacturing, which has been a key goal for his government ever since he took office in 2014.\n\nThe tech company has bet big on India, where it first began manufacturing its iPhone SE in 2017 and has since continued to assemble a number of iPhone models there. Apple opened its online store for India two years ago, but the pandemic has delayed plans for a flagship store in India, according to local media reports.\n\nThe latest model will be shipped out by Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, whose facilities are on the outskirts of Chennai, a city in southern India.\n\nApple is likely to shift about 5% of its iPhone 14 production to India from later this year, raising it to 25% by 2025, according to a JP Morgan report quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\nThe analysts expect that nearly a quarter of all Apple products to be manufactured outside China by 2025, compared to about 5% now. Supply chain risks like the stringent COVID-19 lockdowns seen in China are likely the trigger for such relocation efforts that will continue over the next two or three years, the report said.\n\n“Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chain for a while, but these efforts have grown in the last two years over trade sanctions between the U.S. and China,” said Sanyam Chaurasia, an analyst at Canalys.\n\nLast year, the tech giant manufactured around 7 million iPhones in India. This news is likely to significantly increase India-made Apple smartphones, he added.\n\nHe said the plan to make more iPhones in India may also lead Apple to drop its prices for the Indian market, making it more competitive. “You can adopt a more aggressive pricing strategy if you manufacture locally,” Chaurasia said.\n\nMost of Apple Inc.’s smartphones and tablets are assembled by contractors with factories in China, but the company started asking them in 2020 to look at the possibility of moving some production to Southeast Asia or other places after repeated shutdowns to fight COVID-19 disrupted its global flow of products.\n\nApple hasn’t released details, but news reports say the company planned to set up assembly of tablet computers and wireless earphones in Vietnam.\n\nOther companies are keeping or expanding manufacturing in China to serve the domestic market while shifting export-oriented work to other countries due to rising wages and other costs, as well as the difficulty for foreign executives to visit China due to anti-COVID-19 travel restrictions.",
    "'India has a big role to play': New Delhi is trying to turn the country into a chip powerhouse": "The government of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has looked to boost the country's chipmaking prowess. Money Sharma | AFP | Getty Images\n\nIndia could have a large role to play in the semiconductor industry, analysts say, as the world's fifth-largest economy looks to boost its domestic chip sector. Along with other countries like the U.S., India has been looking to forge strategic alliances around semiconductors, a critical technology that goes into many of the devices we use from smartphones to refrigerators. But India has also been making moves to bring the manufacturing of chips to the country and has laid out incentives for the industry. \"I think India has a crucial role to play,\" Pranay Kotasthane, chairperson of the high tech geopolitics program at the Takshashila Institution, told CNBC's \"Beyond the Valley\" podcast, published last week.\n\nIndia tries to woo giants\n\nThe issue for many countries looking to boost their chipmaking prowess is that the companies and countries that dominate the industry are few and far between. For example, Taiwan and South Korea make up about 80% of the global foundry market. Foundries are facilities that manufacture chips that other companies design.\n\nIndia has typically not been in the mix of the top countries for semiconductors. So there aren't many giant Indian chip firms and certainly no leading-edge manufacturing companies. While India might not have native semiconductor firms, it's plan under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi relies on trying to attract foreign giants. In December, India greenlit a $10 billion incentive plan for the semiconductor industry. Therefore, New Delhi's strategy seems to be twofold — lure in foreign companies and build on areas where India has an advantage.\n\nIndian strengths\n\nThe large amount of capital required, the time it takes to set up factories and uncertainty over the business, tax and trade environment has often put companies off setting up in India. \"Previous attempts in India failed because of apprehensions on these counts,\" Kotasthane said. However, there are signs that things are changing. \"The track record has been not great but the new government has been heading in the right direction ... [with] policies to drive impetus and attract leading semi and fab companies,\" Neil Shah, partner at tech consultancy Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nIndia's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world. Neil Shah Partner, Counterpoint Research\n\nIndia has a number of strengths which could back up its bid to be a global chipmaking hub. \"India's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world,\" Shah said. The analyst also said incentive plans will help. \"Also, India has loads of English speaking engineering talent and [a] cheaper labor force making it cost effective,\" Shah added. That well-educated and cheap labor force could help India in a specific area of the semiconductor supply chain — chip design — an area that requires a large number of skilled workers.\n\n\"I have no doubt that India has a big role to play,\" Kotasthane said. \"India has semiconductor humanpower. Semiconductor design requires large numbers of skilled engineers and this is where India's strength lies,\" he added. Kotasthane said that of the largest semiconductor firms in the world, eight have design houses in India. While also in the early stages, India is trying to boost its domestic companies to build technology. \"What we are now seeing from the Indian government side is trying to take the next step. We have design centers of international firms, but India doesn't have a lot of intellectual property, which can be termed Indian ... because these are companies from other countries which are doing this. So now, the next step is the effort to build an ecosystem where there is some Indian IP (intellectual property) by Indian companies,\" Kotasthane said.\n\nManufacturing in focus\n\nWhile design is one area the analysts say that India can find success, manufacturing is a little more difficult. In terms of the most cutting-edge chips, such as those in the latest flagship smartphones, Taiwan's TSMC dominates the manufacturing arena. India doesn't have any fabs, or semiconductor fabrication plants, which manufacture chips. However, the government has looked to woo foreign chipmakers. ISMC Digital, a consortium of investors, is planning to build a $3 billion manufacturing facility in India. Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company, would be the technology partner on that project.\n\nwatch now",

    "India’s bond inclusion will be overdue and timely": "A broker reacts while trading at his computer terminal at a stock brokerage firm in Mumbai, India, February 26, 2016. Indian bonds, shares and the rupee gained on Friday after a key government report on the economy was seen as calling for fiscal prudence and stable inflation, while also acknowledging risks to the growth outlook. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade\n\nMUMBAI, Sept 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A bear market might be a good time to step onto the world stage. India’s sovereign debt is widely expected to be added to the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond index, tracked by some $220 billion of assets under management. It would be an overdue recognition of reforms in the world’s fifth-largest economy. Inflows may be muted at first, but that isn’t a long-term problem.\n\nThe $1 trillion sovereign debt market is similar size-wise to Brazil’s but isn’t included in major indices because of capital controls and trading barriers. Only one quarter of the issues are fully accessible to overseas buyers, though the number and value of issues they can buy is steadily increasing. Overall, foreigners own less than 2% of the sovereign market, compared to about 10% in China and over 20% in Indonesia, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley.\n\nInclusion might quickly shepherd over $20 billion of passive funds that track the benchmark, assuming India gets a 10% weighting, matching China and Indonesia. Its presence would also ease a concentration problem; around 70% of the benchmark is currently made up of just seven countries after Russia’s eviction earlier this year. Yet New Delhi has much to do if it wants those tracking the benchmark to take their full allocation.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nIndia can’t do much about its diminishing relative returns, however. Its 10-year bonds are yielding about 7.4% and the differential with U.S. Treasuries has narrowed by about 130 basis points to 3.7 percentage points since February; consumer price inflation is 7%. The rupee is 9% weaker against the U.S. dollar this year, and foreign reserves have fallen almost $90 billion as the central bank defends the currency. Deficits persist in the fiscal and current accounts. Returns are further eroded by capital gains tax.\n\nImproving access and reducing red tape will be key to luring active funds; such reforms in China helped convince foreign investors to put $350 billion into its government fixed-income market by September 2021. Whereas setting up a foreign portfolio account in India still obliges money managers to reveal arcane personal details, and successful trades require manually matching timestamps to the nearest minute, increasing the risk of transaction failure.\n\nInflows have picked up in anticipation of an announcement, though any actual inclusion might not kick in for a year or so. How much money follows, and the extent of benefits India captures from having an extra source of funding, is largely in its own hands.\n\nIndia spread over U.S. bonds is shrinking\n\nFollow @ugalani on Twitter\n\n(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

    "Are China and India changing their stance on Putin's war in Ukraine?": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nEarlier this month, Vladimir Putin met one-on-one with Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi as the three world leaders attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. For the first time, Putin publicly admitted that China had “questions and concerns” about the continuing war in Ukraine. Likewise, Modi reminded Putin that the present era is “not one of war.”\n\nThese developments are noteworthy. Until now, China has openly supported Russia, while India has avoided public criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the summit, Modi reaffirmed the historic importance of India-Russia relations. And China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement calling the China-Russia relationship “stable as mountains.” Both countries continue to buy Russian exports in large quantities. They even joined military exercises in Russia this month.\n\nWhy have China and India been so reluctant to rein Moscow in? While their dependence on Russia for defense and energy resources are significant factors, my research suggests that status also plays a role in their policies. India and China share Russia’s resentment about their second-tier status in a U.S.-led international order. That makes both countries likely to continue to be tolerant about Moscow’s ambitions.\n\nNot defending the international order is risky\n\nIt may seem that security and economic factors are driving Beijing and New Delhi’s policies. But Moscow’s war in Ukraine has disrupted the economies of both China and India. The conflict has affected food and energy supplies worldwide, raising the price of oil and other commodities for India and China. Bankrolling a warring country with mounting economic problems is risky — Russia’s collapse, for instance, would also hurt partner countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia’s invasion also jeopardizes the international order, by disrupting the settled rules and norms that govern relations between countries. Moscow’s actions have challenged foundational international principles such as sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination. Russia has also announced its intention to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and World Health Organization, institutions that are core to the international order. In that light, it’s surprising that China and India would support Putin’s efforts to undermine the very order that has enabled their rise.\n\nRising powers won’t support an exclusionary order\n\nHistory shows, however, that rising powers like China and India do not simply value economic and security goals. They also value being recognized as eminent countries with an elevated status in international politics. In my recent book, I show that this status comes from being recognized as equals of the great powers that manage the international order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen core institutions of the international order recognize a rising country’s equality — typically by including these new aspirants in global leadership positions — they’re likely to uphold the order, even at great cost to themselves. When the order instead excludes these countries, they will demand greater representation in the governance of global issues and will be less willing to cooperate. If these demands are denied or indefinitely deferred, they may get frustrated and challenge the order.\n\nThe United States itself was once in this position, in the 19th century. Initially, it cooperated with a mostly inclusive international order. As a club of European great powers took over after 1815, the U.S. sought — unsuccessfully — to transform international law as a way of joining the club. Feeling unfairly excluded, the U.S. eventually challenged the order. In 1856, when Britain and France introduced new rules abolishing the use of private vessels in maritime warfare, the U.S. vehemently opposed the effort and refused to cooperate. At the time, private vessels provided the only source of equality the U.S. had with the naval powers of Europe.\n\nChina and India see the current order as exclusionary\n\nChina and India today are looking for opportunities for leadership in a global order dominated by the U.S. and its allies. New Delhi, for example, seeks a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. India’s foreign minister declared in 2020 that India deserved “due recognition” for its contributions to global order, and called for “reformed multilateralism.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing, already a permanent Security Council member, seeks greater representation in international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, whose top leadership positions have been exclusively occupied by American, European and Japanese nationals, respectively. Indeed, scholars have found that since 1971, the year China joined the United Nations, senior management positions within the U.N. system have been held largely by nationals of the U.S., France, U.K., Japan and Canada, with China, India and Russia trailing far behind.\n\nFrustrated that these institutions have been slow to change in this regard, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2014. When the U.S. pressured other countries to boycott the institution, China’s vice minister of commerce compared the international order to a basketball game in which “the U.S. wants to set the duration of the game, the size of the court, the height of the basket and everything else to suit itself.”\n\nChina, India and Russia prefer a ‘multipolar’ order\n\nSo long as the international order continues to exclude China and India from the great power club, these nations have little incentive to defend rules and institutions that they did not create and over which they feel little ownership. Since the end of the Cold War, China and India have joined Russia in consistently declaring their preference for a “multipolar world order,” which would give them a greater say in global affairs.\n\nAt the same time, there are limits to how far China and India will go. The recent Shanghai Cooperation summit shows that Russia may be pushing its friends too far, and they are beginning to push back. The need to protect their own longer-term interests and to successfully transform — but not wreck — the international order may now be leading both countries to restrain Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory shows that rising powers do not wait indefinitely for their place in the sun. Without some accommodation of their status aspirations, China and India are likely to remain skeptical of Western efforts to defend the international order against Russian excesses.\n\nRohan Mukherjee is an assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

    "Exclusive: India's push for home-grown navigation system jolts smartphone giants": "NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) and GPS (Global Positioning System) logos are seen in this illustration taken, September 25, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies India wants local GPS rival in smartphones; industry fears costs\n\nSmartphone players want delay to New Delhi's Jan. 2023 deadline\n\nSamsung, others say Indian system needs hardware changes-sources\n\nBoosting native system part of Modi's self-reliance campaign\n\nNEW DELHI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - India is pushing tech giants to make smartphones compatible with its home-grown navigation system within months, worrying the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple who fear elevated costs and disruptions as the move requires hardware changes, according to two industry sources and government documents seen by Reuters.\n\nIn line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for self-reliance, India has over the years expanded the use of its regional navigation satellite system called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).\n\nThe Indian government wants to reduce dependence on foreign systems, including the widely used U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), and says NavIC provides more accurate domestic navigation and that its use would benefit the economy.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nChina, the European Union, Japan and Russia have their own global or regional navigation systems to rival GPS. Operational since 2018, NavIC's uptake is minimal; it is mandated in public vehicle location trackers, for example.\n\nBut government and industry documents show Modi's administration and space officials want to broaden its use, and have this year pushed smartphone giants to make hardware changes to support NavIC, in addition to GPS, in new phones they will sell from January 2023.\n\nIn private meetings in August and September, representatives of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others pushed back, citing worries that making phones NavIC-compliant would mean higher research and production costs.\n\nThe changes would also require more testing clearances, which with a Jan. 1 deadline would disrupt businesses and planned launches, according to two smartphone industry sources and documents.\n\nSamsung declined comment on the meetings, while Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India's IT ministry and the space agency ISRO that are both involved in the project also did not respond.\n\nSamsung in particular voiced concerns during a Sept. 2 closed-door meeting between top smartphone players and chipmakers with Indian IT ministry and space agency officials, according to the meeting's minutes reviewed by Reuters.\n\nSamsung's India executive Binu George warned of cost worries, telling officials that NavIC support requires not just new smartphone chipsets but also many other components.\n\n\"This would add to cost as it requires hardware design changes and additional investments to support devices specific to India. Further, the companies have already prepared for models to be launched in 2024,\" the minutes quoted him as saying.\n\nGeorge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe smartphone players have sought time until 2025 to implement the changes, and a final decision is expected in coming days, a senior government official said.\n\nThe minutes said the Indian space agency will provide technical support for implementing NavIC in new smartphones, adding another meeting may be called.\n\nINDIA VS OTHERS\n\nIndia's space agency has said systems like GPS and Russia's GLONASS are operated by their countries' defence agencies, making it possible for civilian service to be interrupted.\n\nNavIC, it says, is fully under the control of the Indian government, which one day wants to take it global like GPS.\n\nIndia would not be the first country to push smartphone makers to add support for a native navigation system.\n\nRussia has sought to mandate inclusion of its own GLONASS system in smartphones sold locally to reduce reliance on GPS, which Washington can switch off for civilian subscribers as it did during military operations in Iraq.\n\nChina's Beidou was completed in June 2020, and, though not mandated, the official Xinhua news agency has reported that in 2021, 94.5% of China-made smartphones had Beidou support.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung together account for 38% of the smartphone market in India, the world's second biggest after China. Apple's more expensive smartphones have a roughly 3% share in India, data from Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint shows.\n\nOther Chinese manufactures making up a further 28% of the market were also present at the Sept. 2 meeting, government minutes show. China's Realme, which has a 16% market share, did not attend, and neither did smaller manufacturers.\n\nApple's website says it already supports the five global and regional navigation networks including GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou in current iPhones. The Indian directive could force it to add a new one.\n\nA key concern for players like Samsung and Xiaomi remains the higher cost of so-called dual band chipsets they would need to support both GPS and NavIC, as these companies are leaders in the sub-$200 category in India's price-sensitive market, the smartphone industry sources said.\n\nCHIPSET CONCERN\n\nFor procuring NavIC-compliant chipsets, most smartphone makers are reliant on global giants such as U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc (2454.TW).\n\nVoluntary use of such chipsets has been limited in India as phone manufacturers remain hesitant to add the extra components - and cost - required to make it work, said Parv Sharma, senior semiconducter analyst at Counterpoint.\n\nIndia's space agency said that by mid-2021, only about two dozen mobile handset models in India had NavIC capability. In total there are around 300, Counterpoint has said.\n\nDuring the Sept. 2 meeting, MediaTek said all of the company's chipsets for 5G phones would support NavIC, with \"some cost enhancement\" and additional hardware. MediaTek added that it expected about 80% of mobile phones to be 5G-enabled in two years.\n\nMediaTek declined to comment on Reuters queries. Qualcomm in a statement said it has been working with the Indian space agency to enable NavIC on its chipsets for years and will continue to do so.\n\nAnother lobbying push from smartphone players is to convince the Indian government to make NavIC available on the so-called L1 satellite frequency which is already used by GPS, and not onlyon the L5 frequency used by New Delhi.\n\nThat, executives say, will make it easier for manufacturers to integrate NavIC in chipsets which mostly support the L1 band the world over, curbing separate development costs for NavIC.\n\nIndian space agency ISRO told the Sept. 2 gathering that was not immediately possible, as NavIC was likely to be available on the L1 band only by 2024-25, after more satellite launches, the meeting's record shows.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "India is repurposing its COVID-19 contact tracing app and vaccination website": "India is repurposing its COVID-19 contact-tracing app and vaccination website to address other health concerns in the South Asian country.\n\nA senior official said Sunday that the Indian government is planning to use Aarogya Setu as the country’s standalone health app.\n\nThe app will offer residents the ability to book medical checkup appointments and verify the registrations with QR codes to avoid waiting in queues at hospitals, RS Sharma, the chief executive of the National Health Authority, the body that oversees implementation of the country’s flagship public health scheme, said at a public event.\n\nAarogya Setu, launched in 2020, has amassed more than 240 million downloads, he said. The app was initially launched as a “temporary solution to a temporary problem.”\n\nShortly after its launch, Aarogya Setu, which means “bridge to health” in Sanskrit, attracted some concerns from privacy advocates over the app’s tracking of individuals. New Delhi dismissed the concerns and said at the time that the so-called flaws were implemented in the app by design.

(Steven Paston/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) — The fallout from the controversial ending to the women’s one-day international series between England and India shows no sign of ending.\n\nIndia secured victory in the third ODI at Lord’s on Saturday — and thereby clinched the series 3-0 — when spinner Deepti Sharma stopped in her delivery stride to run out England’s Charlie Dean as she backed up at the non-striker’s end in readiness to run.\n\nThis rare form of dismissal — known as a “Mankad” after Indian cricketer Vinoo Mankad, who first enacted it — is legitimate but is widely considered to be unsporting.\n\nThe law covering it states that non-strikers are “liable to be run out” if they have left their ground before the bowler “would normally have been expected to release the ball.”\n\nHowever, many believe it to be contrary to what is often referred to as the spirit of cricket, the preamble to the laws of the game that advocates a notion of fair play but is open to interpretation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere has traditionally been an unwritten convention that a bowler should warn a batter with a tendency to back up too far that they could run them out.\n\nAnd Deepti has said the team had “repeatedly” warned Dean for leaving the crease too early.\n\n“We did things as per the rules and guidelines,” she said after India returned home, according to cricinfo.com. “We told the umpires as well, but she was there (outside the crease). We couldn’t do much.”\n\nIt’s a version of events contradicted by England captain Heather Knight.\n\n“The game is over, Charlie was dismissed legitimately. India were deserved winners of the match and the series,” Knight wrote on Twitter on Monday. “But no warnings were given. They don’t need to be given, so it hasn’t made the dismissal any less legitimate.\n\n“But if they’re comfortable with the decision to (effect) the run-out, India shouldn’t feel the need to justify it by lying about warnings.”\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club, the Lord-based club regarded as the guardian of the laws of cricket, got involved to say the game was “properly officiated.”\n\n“MCC’s message to non-strikers continues to be to remain in their ground until they have seen the ball leave the bowler’s hand,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe MCC announced this year that the regulation concerning this form of dismissal would be moved from the unfair play section of the laws to the run-out section.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEngland seamer Kate Cross described the regulation as “wishy-washy” and said it needed to be clarified.\n\n“I think there needs to be the warning moving forward and they need to clear up the rules on where the front foot lands, or where the bowler is bowling from. Just make it really clear,” Cross told the BBC.\n\n___\n\nMore AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

    "First Covid, now monkeypox – India’s role is key in the scramble for jabs": "Rishabh Kumar woke up in his California bedroom in a cold sweat. In the space of three weeks, the 37-year-old finance executive had lost his mother, best friend, brother-in-law and two cousins. They all died of Covid back home in India in April and May last year. The experience left him shattered and experiencing nightmares that continue to this day.\n\nOn this particular night last month, it was not thoughts of Covid tormenting him, but monkeypox, which had just been declared a health emergency in the US. Like many Indians at home and abroad, Kumar was worried for his country and the rest of his family.\n\nAt the root of Kumar’s concerns were frustration and anger over India’s missteps during the Delta wave in 2021, when the country’s crematoriums and graveyards were full of bodies and smoke from funeral pyres. India has the largest vaccine manufacturing capability in the world, yet a failure to order and produce enough Covid doses in time led to shortages and a slow rollout. His mother had had a single vaccine shot before she tested positive – the others he grieves for had none.\n\nThe world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production Ishwar Gilada\n\nNow, as monkeypox cases climb steadily around the world, India’s government has been relatively prepared, say public health experts. Researchers at the National Institute of Virology in the western city of Pune isolated the monkeypox virus in July. And the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s network of biomedical labs, has offered the isolated virus to private firms for the development of indigenous vaccines.\n\nHealth workers screen passengers arriving from abroad for monkeypox at Anna International Airport terminal in Chennai, 3 June 2022. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut experts want India to do more. So far, only 12 monkeypox cases have been reported in the country, with one death. That’s a tiny fraction of the 61,000 known cases worldwide. Yet Covid has taught us that that could change. India’s vaccine preparedness matters not just for its population, but for the other developing nations dependent on its shots.\n\n“It doesn’t matter that India has only a few cases at the moment – the world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production,” says Ishwar Gilada, an infectious diseases specialist who set up India’s first Aids and HIV clinic in 1985.\n\nGlobally, monkeypox has killed fewer than two dozen people this year, according to the World Health Organization, and research suggests that the mortality rate is significantly lower than from Covid. Monkeypox spreads primarily through prolonged, direct contact with a patient, rather than through respiratory droplets or aerosols.\n\nStill, this is the first time the virus has spread widely to countries with no history of monkeypox: 104 nations have reported cases. And the global scramble for vaccines that marked the Covid pandemic has started with monkeypox, presenting a challenge for public health initiatives seeking funding, such as the Global Fund, which met on 21 September for its seventh replenishment conference.\n\nAn isolation ward built as a precautionary measure for monkeypox patients at a hospital in Ahmedabad, 25 July 2022. Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOnly one vaccine, for smallpox – Jynneos, produced by Danish firm Bavarian Nordic – has so far been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use against monkeypox.\n\nWealthy nations such as the US, UK and Australia, joined the queue for doses early but are already facing shortages. As with Covid, poorer countries risk falling far behind in accessing the vaccines. India is yet to order any.\n\n“Even if the government ordered vaccines today, the pile-up of demand is such that we aren’t going to get doses for many, many months,” says Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, and the first Indian woman elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n\nIndia’s efforts to develop indigenous vaccines for monkeypox could help it limit its dependence on Jynneos eventually, but that, too, will take time. “This isn’t going to yield vaccines soon either,” says Kang.\n\nIf the spread of monkeypox can be contained, mass vaccinations may not be needed, and some researchers suggest that a vaccine may not be needed at all – at least for now. T Jacob John, a paediatrician and virologist who was one of the founders of India’s successful polio vaccination programme, says: “If we could do well without a vaccine for HIV/Aids, we can manage here too.”\n\nHowever, in some ways monkeypox presents a challenge more complex than HIV, says Gilada. “There’s a double social stigma, especially in a conservative country like India.” It is a sexually transmitted disease – a vast majority of cases involve men who have sex with men. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the cases we’re seeing reported are just a tiny fraction of the actual number,” he says.\n\nWhile India waits for a homemade vaccine and for demand for Jynneos to ease up, its vast pharmaceutical industry should focus on developing antiviral treatments for monkeypox, Kang says.\n\nHealth workers test for the monkey pox virus at a molecular laboratory set up by the Tamil Nadu health department in Chennai. Photograph: Sri Loganathan/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nYet Covid brutally exposed a challenge that the government is still to address. “India does not fund research in sufficient amounts,” says John, meaning the private sector is left to take the risks. Even though the ICMR has invited private firms to join efforts to develop vaccines, it has not issued any research grants to incentivise their science.\n\nHowever, the way monkeypox is spread is a silver lining for India, says Gilada. Once a vaccine or antiviral is available, the country’s vast Aids-control network – consisting of 1,160 centres dedicated to treating sexually transmitted infections – could offer rapid frontline services. “We should be able to prioritise those who are most vulnerable, in settings where they already feel somewhat comfortable,” says Gilada.\n\nFor those traumatised by the unnecessary human losses of the Covid pandemic, the way India responds to monkeypox will be closely scrutinised.\n\nBack in San Jose, California, Kumar said it would be “unpardonable” if the Indian government were to repeat its Covid mistakes. “I hope they have learned their lessons,” he says. “I can’t deal with these nightmares any more.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n",
    "India seeks verified IDs to register email accounts": "Asia In Brief India's government last week released a draft telco law that defines all over-the-top services as telecoms providers and therefore makes them subject to the same regulations imposed on carriers.\n\nThe draft Indian Telecommunication Bill, 2022 [PDF] defines a telecommunications service as including \"broadcasting services, electronic mail, voice mail, voice, video and data communication services\" delivered over fixed or mobile networks. The Bill mentions over-the-top (OTT) communication services, too.\n\nThat wording means India proposes to regulate the likes of Zoom, Gmail, and WhatsApp.\n\nAs pointed out by India's Internet Freedom Foundation, the draft also requires all entities defined as telecommunications services operates to identify customers using whatever documentation the government decrees is necessary. The identity of the sender of any message must be made available to the recipient – a measure designed to reduce spam.\n\nThe draft also allows for India's government to shut down the internet during public emergencies or to protect public safety. Regulators will also gain the power to \"direct that communications or class of communications to or from any person or class of persons, or relating to any particular subject, transmitted or received by any telecommunication network shall be suspended.\"\n\nOr in other words, censorship during emergencies.\n\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation has criticized the draft as naïve, citing the presence of the WebRTC framework in most browsers and its enablement of real-time comms, and noting it is unregulated even though it can be used for the kind of interaction enabled by a videoconferencing app. The Foundation also has privacy concerns, and feels the Bill leaves some colonial era structures in place.\n\nConsultation on the Bill is open until October 1.\n\n– Simon Sharwood\n\nChina's payment apps may enable crime, need more attention from US lawmakers, say experts\n\nThe US House Financial Services subcommittee on National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy last week considered whether payment systems operated in countries like China and Russia represent a threat – and was advised they probably do.\n\nExperts warned that payment apps developed in these countries needed more attention as they could be used for nefarious purchases, much as they were used to influence 2016 US election results through Facebook ads.\n\n\"The nexus between adversarial illiberal regimes and cybercrime cartels acting as their proxies using these systems is clear. These alternative payment systems are not small, with China's centralized virtual currencies WeChat pay and Alipay processing 294.6 trillion won or about 45.6 trillion dollars in 2020,\" said global fellow at the Wilson Center Scott Dueweke, who pointed out this number \"dwarfed\" transactions conducted on other platforms during 2021.\n\nElon Musk wrote article for China's internet regulator, hinted at aged care robots READ MORE\n\n\"In particular, alternative payment systems that are owned by, or based in, countries like Russia and China, raise key questions about the impact on national security, such as the efficacy of traditional regulatory and financial integrity tools, including US economic and trade sanctions, as well as the impact on the strength of the US dollar,\" stated [PDF] the Memorandum on the hearing.\n\nThe committee added that the \"US dollar's role as the world's reserve currency allows US policymakers to leverage coercive economic measures\" against its threats.

The country's trade ministry has also proposed new rules for crypto asset exchanges.\n\nThe new law reportedly requires two-thirds of a crypto company's board of directors and commissioners to be Indonesian citizens and reside locally.\n\nThe law also requires an exchange service to use a third party to house client investment and bans the reinvestment of assets.\n\nNo time frame was given for when the law will reach parliament.\n\nHong Kong to develop central bank digital currency\n\nHong Kong's Monetary Authority last week decided to pursue development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nA strategy document [PDF] noted that previous work on an electronic Hong Kong Dollar (e-HKD) had not identified an urgent need to create such an instrument but expressed the opinion that global experiments in the field means a role for a local digital currency \"can emerge quickly out of the rapid evolution, or even revolution, in the digital economy.\"\n\nAlibaba execs hauled in to discuss Shanghai Police data leak READ MORE\n\nThe potential for CBDCs to take off as a cheaper and faster means of cross-border payments is seen as the likely driver of the need to develop digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong's CBDC development plan will see it work on two development \"rails\" – one considering technical architectural matters and the other focusing on applications and integration with banks and retailers. The document expects both efforts to extend beyond the year 2023 with implementation of the CBDC assumed to be several years away.\n\n– Simon Sharwood\n\nAWS adds Cantonese option\n\nAmazon Web Services last week announced its Polly text-to-speech service can speak Cantonese.\n\nDubbed Hiujin, the service is offered in 13 AWS regions and provides full support for traditional Chinese characters plus limited support for simplified characters. \"As English is one of the official languages in Hong Kong and mixing English words with Cantonese is very common, we have optimized the performance on common English-Cantonese mixed sentence to make Hiujin sound more natural,\" AWS stated. – Simon Sharwood\n\nIndia's chip and display incentives to reap $25 billion, says IT minister\n\nIndia's IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar reportedly said India can expect $25 billion of inbound investment thanks to a $10 billion incentive scheme that promotes local semiconductor and panel display manufacturing.\n\nA previous agreement saw India's government subsidize between 30 and 50 percent of costs for the facilities to build chips and displays.

    "Clues in Caves Suggest Drought May Have Brought Down India’s Mughal Empire": "This story was originally published on The Conversation and appears here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nIn a remote cave in northeast India, rainwater has slowly dripped from the ceiling in the same spots for over 1,000 years. With each drop, minerals in the water accumulate on the floor below, slowly growing into calcium carbonate towers known as stalagmites. These stalagmites are more than geological wonders—like tree rings, their layers record the region’s rainfall history. They also carry a warning about the potential for catastrophic multiyear droughts in the future.\n\nBy analyzing the geochemistry of these stalagmites in a new study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to create the most precise chronology yet of the summer Indian monsoon over the past millennium. It documents how the Indian subcontinent frequently experienced long, severe droughts unlike any observed in the last 150 years of reliable monsoon rainfall measurements.\n\nThe drought periods we detected are in striking synchrony with historical accounts of droughts, famines, mass mortality events, and geopolitical changes in the region.\n\nThey show how the decline of the Mughal Empire and India’s textile industries in the 1780s and 1790s coincided with the most severe 30-year period of drought over the millennium. The depth and duration of the drought would have caused widespread crop failures and the level of famine discussed in written documents at the time.\n\nAnother long drought encompasses the 1630-1632 Deccan famine, one of the most devastating droughts in India’s history. Millions of people died as crops failed. Around the same time, the elaborate Mughal capital of Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned and the Guge Kingdom collapsed in western Tibet.\n\nBuland Darwaza (Door of Victory) at Fatehpur Sikri, the one-time capital of the Mughal Empire. Marcin Białek, CC BY-SA 3.0/Wikimedia\n\nOur findings have important implications today for water planning in a warming world, particularly for India, which, with its vast monsoon-reliant agriculture industry, is on pace to soon be the most populous country on the planet.\n\nScientists began systematically measuring India’s monsoon rainfall with instruments around the 1870s. Since then, India has experienced about 27 regionally widespread droughts. Among them, only one—1985 to 1987—was a three-year consecutive drought or worse.\n\nThe apparent stability of the Indian monsoon in that data might lead one to surmise that neither protracted droughts lasting multiple years nor frequent droughts are intrinsic aspects of its variability. This seemingly reassuring view currently informs the region’s present-day water resource infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the stalagmite evidence of prolonged, severe droughts over the past 1,000 years paints a different picture. It indicates that the short instrumental period does not capture the full range of Indian monsoon variability. It also raises questions about the region’s current water resources, sustainability, and mitigation policies that discount the possibility of protracted droughts in the future.\n\nTo reconstruct past variations in rainfall, we analyzed stalagmites from Mawmluh Cave, near the town of Cherrapunji in the state of Meghalaya—one of the wettest locations in the world.\n\nStalagmites marked for study inside Mawmluh Cave. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nStalagmites are cone-like structures that grow slowly from the ground up, typically at a rate of about one millimeter every 10 years. Trapped within their growth layers are minute amounts of uranium and other elements that were acquired as rainwater infiltrated the rocks and soil above the cave. Over time, uranium trapped in stalagmites decays into thorium at a predictable pace, so we can figure out the age of each stalagmite growth layer by measuring the ratio of uranium to thorium.\n\nThe oxygen in rainwater molecules comes in two primary types of isotopes: heavy and light. As stalagmites grow, they lock into their structure the oxygen isotope ratios of the percolating rainwater that seeps into the cave. Subtle variations in this ratio can arise from a range of climatic conditions at the time the rainwater originally fell.\n\nOur previous research in this area showed that variations in oxygen isotope ratios in rainwater, and consequently, in stalagmites, track changes in the relative abundance of different moisture sources that contribute to summer monsoon rainfall.\n\nDuring years when monsoon circulation is weak, rainfall here is primarily derived from the moisture that evaporated from the nearby Arabian Sea. During strong monsoon years, however, atmospheric circulation brings copious amounts of moisture to this area all the way from the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe two moisture sources have quite different oxygen isotope signatures, and this ratio is faithfully preserved in the stalagmites. We can use this clue to learn about the overall strength of the monsoon intensity at the time the stalagmite formed. We pieced together the monsoon rainfall history by extracting minute amounts of calcium carbonate from its growth rings and then measuring the oxygen isotope ratios. To anchor our climate record to precise calendar years, we measured the uranium and thorium ratio.\n\nA cross-section of a stalagmite shows variations in ring formation, which can be linked to changing climate conditions. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nThe paleoclimate records can usually tell what, where and when something happened. But often, they alone cannot answer why or how something happened. Our new study shows that protracted droughts frequently occurred during the past millennia, but we do not have a good understanding of why the monsoon failed in those years. Similar studies using Himalayan ice cores, tree rings, and other caves have also detected protracted droughts but face the same challenge.\n\nIn the next phase of our study, we are teaming up with climate modelers to conduct coordinated proxy-modeling studies that we hope will offer more insight into the climate dynamics that triggered and sustained such extended periods of drought during the past millennium.\n\nGayatri Kathayat is an associate professor of global environmental change at Xi’an Jiaotong University.

    "Now the UK Has to Wrestle With India’s Demons, Too": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nHere in India, Hindu-Muslim clashes that threaten houses of worship, force shops to close and inflame passions on social media no longer constitute news. It is noteworthy, however, when they break out not in Madhya Pradesh but in the English Midlands. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Police in the city of Leicester have arrested dozens of people in recent days after what authorities described as “serious disorder.” Weeks ago, a game of cricket between India and Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates raised tensions, as such matches often do. Subsequently, Hindu revivalists marched through a Muslim-dominated part of Leicester, chanting religious slogans. A Muslim mob surrounded a Hindu temple and burned its saffron flag. Scuffles between the two groups broke out across the city.\n\nAlmost 40% of Leicester’s residents are of South Asian origin and the city has often been held up as a successful model of integration. Even now, official statements and media reports about the violence have taken pains not to puncture that reputation. Some have blamed “outsiders,” especially from nearby Birmingham, for the trouble. Police have complained that disinformation spread through social media fired up the mobs. And many observers have stressed the pacifying influence of “community leaders.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s some truth to all those statements. But they miss the larger story, which is that the sectarian politics of the Indian subcontinent can no longer be contained within the subcontinent. Such divides are being globalized, spreading alienation, disinformation, political partisanship, radicalization and violence in their wake.\n\nTake social media. Today, political mobilization in South Asia is driven largely by online content — and, increasingly, by made-to-order misinformation. This is true for Hindus, Muslims and even Sinhala Buddhists in Sri Lanka. Indeed, the subcontinent is making new and innovative advances in hate speech. Bigots are no longer content to relabel and retweet incendiary videos; they are creating their own fake content and labeling it as “entertainment.”\n\nJust last week, a viral video — retweeted by, among others, a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party — appeared to show a Muslim clergyman abusing a young woman. The video was in fact created specifically for “educational” — rabble-rousing — purposes. The scenes it depicted were imaginary, according to a portentous disclaimer, “because the reality is too bitter to be told or shown.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media has also dissolved boundaries between locals and “outsiders.” Technology makes it easy for angry co-religionists to collaborate and egg each other on, even if they aren’t physical neighbors. Until a decade ago, for instance, riots in India were predominantly an urban phenomenon. Then, in 2013, the advent of social media allowed mobs from different villages to launch a coordinated attack on Muslims in rural Uttar Pradesh, displacing tens of thousands of them.\n\nThe uneasy peace that has long held in places such as Leicester — negotiated by local faith leaders and maintained by separating the different communities — cannot survive this new age. If Leicester has more Hindus than Muslims, then a provocative march will be organized in a Muslim area. If the Midlands as a whole have more Muslims than Hindus, then they will in turn combine to intimidate Leicester’s Hindus. And on and on, to the level of the nation itself.\n\nNor will politics-as-usual solve the problem. Rather than speaking directly to minority voters, too many British politicians and administrators still rely on “community leaders” of doubtful opinions and increasingly limited authority. Why would a young British Asian man listen to his local imam or pandit when he consumes media from the subcontinent that is full of far more entertaining, and incendiary, voices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, it is too easy for politicians, in the UK as well as India, to exploit these sectarian divides. Priti Patel, until a few weeks ago the cabinet minister in charge of law and order, recently described her Tories and the BJP as “sister parties.” At least one Hindu Labour MP has accused his own party of employing a “divide and rule” policy in which, he implied, Hindus were at the bottom of the pile.\n\nThe worst possible outcome would be for Hindus and Muslims in the Midlands and the wider UK to start voting for different parties based on their religion. Then adoption of the subcontinent’s divisive politics would be complete.\n\nThat “divide and rule” comment — a reference to how the British supposedly controlled a diverse and divided subcontinent for two centuries — gets to the heart of the problem. Over the past fortnight, some in the UK have tried to examine how the echoes of empire still animate aspects of national identity. Yet they have failed to see how actual policies in today’s Britain, in what the state does and does not do, in its acceptance of ghettoized communities and its dependence on “faith leaders” as interlocutors, eerily reflect how the Raj once kept the peace half a world away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe modern British state cannot afford to continue ruling distantly through community leaders, allowing Hindus and Muslims in the UK to live separately and build up grudges against each other. Those policies no longer work in South Asia — and they certainly won’t work elsewhere.\n\nMore From Bloomberg Opinion:\n\n• Truss Faces Four Hurdles to Spur Growth in UK: Mohamed El-Erian\n\n• Modi’s India Risks Making the Case for Partition: Nisid Hajari\n\n• Could India Fall Under the Same Spell as Russia?: Pankaj Mishra\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMihir Sharma is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

So, I know firsthand what great efforts were made over those years to try to make the US understand that it was in American interest to have a strong, united, independent, prosperous India,” Jaishankar said.\n\n“At that time, they did not succeed, maybe the state of the world was such,” he noted. “The change that started was really triggered by the nuclear deal that removed a very big obstacle to go forward and then to actually take the relationship to a new level requires leadership in India,” that did not had reservations.\n\n“It takes two hands to clap. It was not just that all the problems are on the American side they were visitations on the Indian side as well,” he said.\n\n“So we also have to address the institutions on our side. I think today, the relationship is on a very different footing. We have possibility of working together in many more areas, especially the security domain. Some of our major exercises are with the American military. We fly a number of American planes today, the C 17,” the minister said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVery bullish on the future of India-US relationship, he said: “I think there are really deep convergences, which will sustain it over many, many years.”",
    "The people resurrecting India's ancient fruit trees": "It can take an entire village to grow a new-age garden. That’s what 42-year-old Shyju Machathi, a policeman living in Kannapuram in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, found out when his town was declared an \"Indigenous Mango Heritage Area\" by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board in 2020.\n\nThe honour came after the villagers had got together to grow over 200 indigenous species of mangoes, sourced from surrounding towns and villages, preserving diverse varieties that were in danger of dying out.\n\nThe technique that made it possible, Machathi says, is the age-old art of grafting. He started experimenting with the technique in July 2016, despite no formal training in farming, after an unfortunate incident shook the village of Kannapuram.\n\nA neighbour had hacked down a 200-year-old mango tree known locally as Vellathan, which grew in his home. \"The tree had produced the sweetest mangos I’ve ever tasted,\" says Machathi. \"It was exquisite, an endemic native variety that was very rare.\" But it was also undeniably old. Parts of the large tree would come hurtling to the ground, making it such a hazard that the neighbour decided that it needed to be chopped down for his peace of mind. \"The tree was so much a part of our growing years, the landscape of our lives that we were all just shocked over losing it overnight,\" says Machathi.\n\nStaring at the wasted branches the next morning, and feeling a deep sense of loss, Machathi reached out to a friend who was working as an agricultural officer with the Kerala government. There was a way to save the tree, his friend said. If they could graft portions of the tree onto a growing mango plant with a sturdy root, they could regenerate the old tree and one day, savour its exquisite fruit again.",
    "Most pilots in India fall asleep while flying: Study": "In India, two-thirds of pilots have admitted to dozing off in the pilot's seat. According to a study by the Safety Matters Foundation that included 542 regional, local and international pilots, 66% of those polled admitted falling asleep while at the controls of the aircraft without waking up a fellow crew member. There is a chronic scarcity of competent pilots in India, where airlines require up to 1,500 new pilots annually. However, only 200 to 300 of these new hires have the appropriate training.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA imposes ₹10 lakh fine on Vistara\n\nThe most common causes of falling asleep in the cockpit were overwork and having to fly back-to-back morning flights, which required getting up as early as 2am. One of the biggest causes of aeroplane accidents is fatigue. Between India and the UK, where 1.5 million British Indians reside, there are hundreds of flights per week. Around 54% of pilots reported having severe excessive daytime sleepiness, according to their responses, while 41% reported having moderate excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nAt least one-third of those polled admitted to having a near-accident experience while flying, which they attributed to being too fatigued. Pilot weariness accounts for 15-20% of human mistakes in fatal accidents. Aviation accidents do not happen every day. However, statistics reveal that 80% of the time, human error is to blame. Slower reaction times, diminished concentration and worse decision-making are all effects of fatigue.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA slaps 5 Kedarnath helicopter operators with 5-lakh fine, suspends officials\n\n48% of fatal accidents and onboard fatalities occur during the final approach and landing, according to a statistical review of commercial aeroplane accidents worldwide between 1959 and 2016. According to data from 2011 to 2015, the approach and landing phases of a flight accounted for over 65% of all accidents that were reported, with unstabilised approaches being a contributing factor in 14% of these incidents. Additionally, unstabilised approaches were at blame for 31% of runway excursions.",
    "Russia and India: A New Chapter": "Summary\n\nRussian-Indian relations are undergoing a major change.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the relationship rested on three pillars:\n\nSoviet arms sales to India;\n\nshared public-sector-heavy economic philosophy and extensive Soviet aid; and\n\nthe Soviet Union–India vs. United States–Pakistan–China geopolitical alignment.\n\nThe fall of the Soviet Union, the rise of India and China, the U.S.-China tensions, the deepening of U.S.-India ties, and the Russian-Chinese partnership intensified by Russia’s break with the West and the war against Ukraine have had a profound effect on Russian-Indian relations.\n\nOf the three pillars of the Moscow–New Delhi relationship, only one remains: the arms trade. Russia remains a major supplier of weapons to India, and Russian equipment still makes up a vast portion of Indian Armed Forces’ force structure; but Russia is facing competition in the Indian arms market. India’s desire to diversify its supply of weapons and develop its own defense industry has resulted in declining Russian arms deliveries to India in recent years.\n\nRussia’s break with the West because of its war against Ukraine has accelerated its pivot toward China. Against the backdrop of U.S.-China and China-India tensions, Russia’s position as China’s junior partner will make it harder for Russia to preserve partnership with India. Moscow’s leverage versus both New Delhi and Beijing is shrinking as they have greater capabilities of their own than they had previously and have new partners that offer more than Russia.\n\nRajan Menon Rajan Menon is a nonresident scholar in the Russia and Eurasia Program and director of the Grand Strategy Program at Defense Priorities. More >\n\nStill, the Russian-Indian partnership will continue. For India, Russia remains an important supplier of weapons and, most recently, oil. India has not joined the West’s sanctions on Russia. By doing so, it has demonstrated its independent foreign policy. For Russia, India is an important market for arms and oil. The Indian-U.S. security relationship is relatively new, whereas India-Russia ties have endured for over two generations. India has no reason to forsake the benefits of this relationship. Nor does Russia.\n\nIt has been said that Moscow plays a weak hand well, but sustaining strong security ties with both China and India will become more difficult for it. The question is how China will react to Russian arms sales to India, and what Russia will do if pressed by China to curtail them. For reasons of geographic proximity, economic ties, and personal relations between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the odds favor Beijing over New Delhi to have a bigger say in Moscow.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe encounter between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the September 2022 summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, captured the change that is occurring in the partnership between Russia and India. Speaking about the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, Modi, in what amounted to a public admonition, told Putin that he had spoken to him “many times before” about the need to rely on diplomacy and take the path toward peace to wind up a war that had caused food and fuel prices to soar.1 Xi Jinping, who also attended the SCO gathering, did not endorse Putin’s war, but neither did he overtly criticize it; Modi did. India, while it has long depended on Russia and still regards it as an important country, increasingly seeks to set the terms of their engagement.\n\nEugene Rumer Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, is a senior fellow and the director of Carnegie’s Russia and Eurasia Program.\n\nRussia and India have enjoyed a long history of friendly, mutually beneficial relations. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union as a superpower had the upper hand in the relationship with India, which was part of the community of “developing” nations, albeit also one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. The breakup of the Soviet Union and Russia’s subsequent diminished international status shifted the balance in the relationship toward India, which had emerged as a major power transformed by the economic reforms initiated in the early 1990s and as well as a growing global presence. In the continuing friendly and extensive ties between Moscow and New Delhi, no observer would describe the latter as the junior partner.\n\nIn the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, this relationship is poised to undergo an even greater transformation for four reasons:\n\nRussia’s pursuit of ever-closer ties with China.\n\nThe greater importance for Russia of its ties with China than with India.\n\nRussia’s diminished importance for India’s foreign policy agenda.\n\nIndia’s growing security relationship with the United States.\n\nThis paper first provides the strategic context surrounding the Russian-Indian relationship and its evolution from the end of the Cold War to the start of the February invasion of Ukraine. It then provides an analytical overview of the relationship, including the legacy of the Soviet era, the period since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the post-invasion dynamics. Finally, it offers two scenarios for the course the relationship could take and concludes with the implications for U.S. interests.\n\nThe Strategic Context\n\nThe consequences of Russia’s war against Ukraine will be felt for decades. In Europe—the epicenter of the conflict between Russia and the West—the war has shattered the remnants of the post–Cold War security landscape, triggered a historic break between Russia and the rest of the continent, and prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to fundamentally reassess its security posture.2\n\nThis shift follows a long series of milestones in the three decades since the end of the Cold War, during which Russia’s relations with the West steadily deteriorated. The key ones leading up to the full invasion of Ukraine were Russia’s opposition to the enlargement of NATO to former Soviet satellites, its disagreement with the United States’ overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, the 2008 Russian-Georgian war, and the annexation of Crimea and the start of the undeclared war in eastern Ukraine in 2014. In other words, an adversarial relationship with the West has been a hallmark of Russian foreign policy under Vladimir Putin’s leadership virtually the entire time.\n\nPutin’s foreign policy has also been guided by two other objectives: a deepening partnership with China, recently described by him and China’s President Xi Jinping as a “no limits” friendship, and the promotion of a multipolar world in which a coalition of other major powers, with Russia at the helm, would contain the influence of the United States and its Western allies.3 This concept was first articulated in Russian foreign policy doctrine in the 1990s by then foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov.4 This strategy envisions a concert of major powers that includes India and China.\n\nMeeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and former foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov. Primakov conceptualized a multipolar world with Russia leading a coalition of major powers.\n\nIn retrospect, it is easy to understand the logic of a project to oppose what Russia regarded as the global hegemony of the United States. Primakov intended to build on the traditions of post–Second World War Soviet foreign policy in which he was schooled, in spite of Russia’s military and economic weaknesses during the 1990s. Neither China, with which the Soviet Union had reconciled late in Mikhail Gorbachev’s term, nor India, with which it had enjoyed close and warm relations since the mid-1950s, had yet achieved the global stature they now enjoy. It must have been difficult for a Soviet-era apparatchik like Primakov to imagine that both, long perceived by the Soviets as backward, “developing,” countries would emerge as global powers equaling, and even surpassing, Russia in their capabilities, influence, and wealth. Hence the idea of Russian leadership in the club of three major Eurasian powers that, according to Primakov’s logic, would not bow to U.S. hegemonic ambitions and instead help Russia contain them. That concept also fit well with Putin’s anti-U.S., anti-Western strategy.\n\nFor most of Putin’s tenure, managing the dynamics within the Russia-China-India triangle has been a relatively easy task that required little diplomatic finesse. The relationship with China, which had been gradually improving since the late 1980s, accelerated after Putin’s return to the presidency in 2012. His visit to Beijing following his refusal to join the G8 leaders at Camp David just a few weeks earlier was emblematic of his commitment to develop closer ties with China.5\n\nThe partnership with China grew even closer with Xi’s accession to the presidency in 2013 and the forming of a personal bond between the two leaders. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the resulting downturn in its relationship with the West propelled it toward an even closer embrace of China. The expansion of economic ties included the construction of the Power of Siberia pipeline—and the 2022 agreement for a second such pipeline—to carry natural gas from Siberia to China as well as increased Russian arms exports.6\n\nThe partnership between Moscow and Beijing has been reinforced by their increasingly adversarial relationships with Washington. While U.S.-Russian relations deteriorated, U.S.-Chinese ties became increasingly tense as Beijing’s ambitions expanded along with its capabilities, and also as Barack Obama’s administration “pivoted” to the Asia-Pacific and pledged to increase the U.S. military presence there to reassure allies and partners, with the clear aim of containing China’s growing influence and ambitions.7\n\nRussia’s relationship with India has followed a different course. India has not received the same degree of top-level attention as China, for several reasons. At the top of the list are geography and geopolitics. For Russia, with its long border with China and adversarial relations with the West, avoiding a two-front confrontation is an imperative. Otherwise, it would risk making the same mistake the Soviet Union made during the Cold War. For decades, the Kremlin had effectively pursued two Cold Wars at once—with the United States and with China. Normalizing relations with China in the late 1980s and 1990s was therefore of paramount importance. Moreover, whereas Russia’s pursuit of ever-closer ties with China has been fueled by shared geopolitical rivalry with the United States, relations with India have lacked a similar motivation. Rather, Moscow’s approach to New Delhi has been driven by the sunk costs of their long-standing close ties: there was no reason for Russia to abandon the presence and influence in India that it had built up over six decades. Nor did Russia’s post–Cold War diminished circumstances position it to greatly increase its influence in India. Meanwhile, as India’s economic strength increased, its ambitions geopolitical horizons expanded, and its partnership with the United States progressed, the position of Russia as a strategic and economic partner declined relative to the Cold War era.8\n\nNotwithstanding several periods of attempted detente in India’s relationship with China, it has long been tense, notably because of the legacy of the 1962 war, in which the former lost significant territory to the latter, and the border clashes that have occurred since then.9 The two countries also see themselves as strategic competitors in Asia and make moves and countermoves accordingly. While India has not joined any formal alliances in response to the rapid increase in China’s economic and military power, and has maintained its tradition of nonalignment, it has also forged a “strategic partnership” with the United States and become—alongside Australia, Japan, and the United States—a member of the Quad, an informal grouping that since its establishment in 2007 has evolved into a closer partnership, reflecting these countries’ wariness of and determination to counter China’s expanding ambitions.10\n\nFor Russia, the task of managing its relationships with China and India simultaneously might have seemed complicated at first, but in reality, that has not been true for most of Putin’s tenure at the helm. Early on in Putin’s presidency, it became clear that Primakov’s vision of a concert of great Eurasian powers with Russia at the helm was unrealistic. For China and India, relations with Russia, while important, clearly took a back seat to other priorities. For Beijing, those priorities include relations with the United States and developments in the western Pacific, as well as its Belt and Road Initiative. Russia can play a useful supporting role in the first, but is of little consequence in the second and third.11 For New Delhi, those priorities are expanding its international footprint and managing relations with China, which also includes its partnership with the United States. Russia is likely to be of some help in the former (it supports India’s aspirations to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council) but its role with respect to the latter is ambiguous because of its increasingly close ties to China and continuing role as a major supplier of arms to India.12\n\nBeijing and New Delhi have paid lip service to Moscow’s aspirations for leadership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping but not much more than that. Russia apparently hoped to assert its global leadership by using both forums for countering U.S. influence, but neither has become a major venue that could help it advance its initiatives and project influence.13\n\nRussia’s task of managing the dynamics within this triangle is likely to become considerably more complicated. By shattering its relationship with the West, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has greatly reduced its space for geopolitical maneuver and pushed it closer than ever before to China, while also reducing its leverage with Beijing. The “no limits” embrace of China has become the strategic imperative. Russia’s prioritization of China in foreign policy against the backdrop of deteriorating relations between China and India as well as of the latter’s expanding range of partnerships raises the prospect of a major shift in Russian-Indian relations, perhaps even to the point of winding down their decades-old strategic partnership.\n\nThe Cold War Foundation\n\nFor most of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and India enjoyed warm relations, and at times were even closely aligned. India’s leaders and intellectuals believed that the USSR offered lessons for their country, which was determined to industrialize rapidly while combining growth with a reduction in poverty and stark economic inequalities. Moreover, ex-colonial countries like India did not regard the Soviet Union as an imperial power of which they ought to be leery.\n\nThe Soviet view of India—and of other colonies that gained independence in the first decade of the Cold War—was initially not so charitable. So extensive were the ties—economic, cultural, and institutional—between ex-colonies and their former rulers that Soviet leaders and ideologists did not regard them as authentically independent. As Soviet Marxist jargon had it, they were ruled by a “comprador bourgeois” class economically, and therefore politically beholden to former colonial overlords. Meanwhile, India, as one of the leading lights in the Non-Aligned Movement, was determined to stay clear of Cold War rivalries and to play a neutral international role. In the early postcolonial years that coincided with the beginning of the Cold War, Moscow dismissed such aspirations and even directed the pro-Soviet Communist Party of India to pursue the path of revolution against the country’s “bourgeois nationalist” governments.14\n\nFollowing Stalin’s death in 1953, this rigid Soviet ideological line changed, but India’s opposition to alliances proved lasting. U.S. Cold War strategy called for building alliances to contain the Soviet Union. India’s prime antagonist, Pakistan, joined the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO, also known as the Baghdad Pact) and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). India, by contrast, was a critic of U.S. containment and did not join any alliances. In November 1955, then Communist Party general secretary Nikita Khrushchev and prime minister Nikolai Bulganin became the first Soviet leaders to visit India. Before long, the three pillars of the Soviet-India relationship were in place. They would endure throughout the Cold War, solidified in large measure by the configuration of international politics from the mid-1950s to the late 1980s.\n\nMeeting between then Communist Party general secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1961, part of a long history of deep relations between the Soviet Union and India.\n\nFirst, the Soviet Union soon became, and remained until its collapse in 1991, India’s prime arms supplier, supplanting Britain, which New Delhi had looked to in the early years of its independence. Soviet arms were critically important to India because Pakistan was receiving U.S. arms and, from the 1960s, Chinese ones as well. As Figure 1 shows, the Soviet Union dominated the Indian arms market during the Cold War.\n\nSoviet-designed tanks and aircraft were also manufactured in India under license. As one of India’s leading strategic thinkers, K. Subrahmanyam, noted in 2005: “After 1964 . . . Moscow became almost the sole source of arms for India for all three services.”15 Even today, some 85 percent of the country’s force structure is of Soviet provenance, creating a decades-long dependency for spare parts and improved models of armor, missiles, and aircraft.16 In addition, many Indian military officers received training in the Soviet Union.17\n\nSecond, the Soviet Union played a substantial role through aid and technical assistance in building the public sector of India’s economy, notably in steel making, power generation, and heavy industry.18 The United States, which championed private enterprise, was far less enthusiastic about fostering the state-run sector of India’s economy. Moreover, India’s protectionist policy and restrictions on foreign investment during most of the Cold War constrained its economic ties with the West and resulted in expanded commercial opportunities for the Soviet Union. Even so, as Figure 2 demonstrates, trade was then hardly the strongest pillar of the relationship, especially when compared to the arms trade.\n\nThird, the alignment of the United States, Pakistan, and China made for convergent strategic interests between the Soviet Union and India.19 Notwithstanding the ups and downs and Moscow’s flirtations with Pakistan,20 following the Sino-Soviet split in the early 1960s, the Soviet Union and India were brought closer together by what both saw as a shared threat from Beijing.21 The Soviet Union’s support for India in its war with Pakistan in December 1971 and their Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation signed earlier that year were important manifestations of the two countries’ close ties.22 The geopolitical fault lines became even more evident when China, Pakistan, and the United States opposed the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979—India not only refused to condemn it and even expressed qualified support—and supported the Afghan resistance, which ultimately led to the Soviet withdrawal a decade later.23\n\nAfter the Cold War: A New Dynamic\n\nThe end of the Cold War proved highly consequential for the pillars of the relationship between Moscow and New Delhi—arms sales, economic and technical aid, and the geopolitical dynamics between China, India, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States. Russia emerged from the Cold War as a much less important, albeit still valued, partner for India with respect to all three of these fundamentals.\n\nArms Sales—Ties That Endure\n\nArms sales continued to be the most important element of Russian-Indian relations in the post–Cold War years. As Figure 3 demonstrates, Russia has supplied two-thirds of India’s total arms purchases since the Cold War ended.\n\nRussia benefits from the large share of Soviet and Russian legacy systems in the Indian arsenal. The overwhelming majority of India’s armored force consists of Soviet/Russian tanks—the T-72 and T-90S—and so does its fleet of ground-attack aircraft—variants of MiG-21, Su-30, and MiG-29.24 Over half of India’s conventional submarines are of Soviet design. So are all of its aerial refueling tankers (Il-78s) as well as its only aircraft carrier and nuclear-powered submarine.25\n\nRussian weapons have tended to be less expensive while remaining more or less competitive with Western equivalents, and available on more flexible payment terms.26 Russia is also willing to transfer technology and license weapons production in India—an attractive option for New Delhi. Between 2000 and 2021, the two countries signed more than fifty separate deals for main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, fighter jets, anti-ship and surface-to-surface missiles, multiple rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, frigates, and anti-submarine warfare aircraft.27 Of these agreements, fourteen were signed after Russia’s 2014 intervention in Ukraine, including the $5.2 billion agreement in 2016 to sell India the S-400 air defense system.\n\nRussian Sukhoi-30MK-6 jets are among the many arms transferred from Russia to India.\n\nThus, Russia is poised to remain a major arms supplier to India for a long time, and India is not about to give up on it as a supplier. Its multiple weapons deals with Russia were signed despite the risk of U.S. sanctions under the 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which is designed to punish Russia for the 2014 annexation of Crimea and its undeclared war in eastern Ukraine.28 However, as other countries—such as France, Israel, and the United States—enter the Indian arms market, and as India seeks to diversify its suppliers, Russia will face increasing competition.29 Since the peak of 2013, its arms exports to the country have declined by more than 50 percent (see Figure 4).\n\nStill, both countries appear committed to continue their arms trade relationship as long as it serves their respective interests. For Russia, this remains the most important Soviet legacy tool to secure its presence in India and to seek and retain influence there. By no means, then, are Russian arms about to become marginal for India: the legacy effect of past purchases remains strong as does India’s belief that Russia has long been a valued, reliable source of weaponry. As recently as 2020, during a Sino-Indian confrontation along the border, India’s defense minister discussed the supply of military equipment and spare parts during a visit to Moscow.30\n\nEconomic Relations: Russia Matters Much Less\n\nTrade and economic ties, never the most robust of the three pillars of the relationship during the Cold War, have declined significantly. This is due to Russia’s economic troubles, notably in the 1990s, which made it a much less attractive country to emulate, and to the radical change in India’s economic philosophy.\n\nThe shift in India from the emphasis on public-sector-driven economic development and on import substitution to a more market-driven model, lower tariffs, and greater openness to foreign investment has also reduced Russia’s economic significance for the country.31 Whereas the Soviet Union was regarded by Indian leaders as a country whose economic model offered valuable lessons, Russia today offers little by way of positive experience; if anything, it provides a lesson about what not to do. As Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate, Russia has been of marginal importance at best to India as a trading partner.\n\nOther than as a source of commodities, Russia has little to offer India as a trading partner. In 2020, Russian exports to India—other than weaponry—amounted to less than $6 billion and Indian exports to Russia to less than $3 billion.32 Coal briquettes were at the top of list of Russian exports to India, valued at $923 million, while packaged medicaments were the largest Indian exports to Russia, valued at $444 million. For comparison, in 2020 Russia’s two-way trade with China was just over $100 billion while U.S. two-way trade with India in 2020 was $120 billion.33\n\nWith $1.26 billion in total Russian investment in India from 2000 to 2021, Russia’s footprint in the Indian economy is small.34 The United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment in India with an estimated $42 billion.35 The declared goal of the Russian and Indian governments to increase two-way investment to $50 billion by 2025 is certain not to be realized.36\n\nThus, in trade and investment Russia’s importance to India is marginal, and there is no evidence to suggest that this will change.\n\nThe one area where their trade has increased significantly since the invasion of Ukraine is oil. India ranks third in oil consumption in the world and imports nearly 85 percent of its needs, a figure that is projected by the International Energy Agency to reach 90 percent by 2040.37 The West’s economic sanctions imposed on Russia in retaliation for its aggression against Ukraine, which include attempts to limit its oil exports and revenues, have been a boon to India. New Delhi has not joined the sanctions regime. Instead, taking advantage of discounts on Russian oil, it has stepped up its purchases dramatically—from less than 50,000 barrels per day in 2021 to nearly 1 million barrels per day, or just under 20 percent of projected total oil imports, in June 2022.38 Major Indian purchases of Russian oil are projected to continue as long as it remains economically attractive.39\n\nHowever, this aspect of economic relations only underscores the reversal of fortunes between the two countries. Outside India’s defense sector, where it faces competition from other entrants, Russia no longer has the upper hand in the relationship and has become principally a supplier of raw materials to a country that it once considered its client.\n\nThe New Geopolitics Shaping Russian-Indian Relations\n\nThe combination of the end of the Cold War, the dynamics in South Asia, and the great-power realignment has resulted in a major shift in the relationship between India and Russia. That shift is still ongoing and almost certain to be further fueled by the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s role in this realignment was almost entirely passive and marginal. Its own domestic upheavals after the end of the Cold War and retreat from the world stage to deal with them diminished its significance as a counterbalance to Pakistan in India’s eyes. But arguably, the most important driver of change was the political and economic dynamics in India. The country’s economic liberalization against the backdrop of similar trends worldwide has been accompanied by the expansion of economic and political ties with the United States. Then president Bill Clinton’s visit to India in 2000 was a major milestone in U.S.-Indian relations, which have developed further since then.40\n\nIn a parallel development, U.S.-Pakistani ties soured after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan in 1989. U.S. frustrations over Islamabad’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, combined with Pakistan’s backsliding on democracy and warming U.S.-Indian relations were unmistakable signs of a changing trilateral dynamic.41 The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the realities of the war in Afghanistan left the United States no choice but to patch up its relationship with Pakistan. Even so, Islamabad’s dual role throughout the war as a U.S. partner and as the Taliban’s sponsor was an obstacle to better ties with Washington.\n\nThe U.S.-Indian rapprochement has occurred against the backdrop of three other developments: the burgeoning Russian-Chinese partnership, growing U.S.-Chinese tensions, and steadily improving Pakistani-Chinese relations. As a result, the geopolitical dynamics in and around South Asia have been transformed. Whereas during most of the Cold War the compact between China, Pakistan, and the United States was juxtaposed with the quasi-partnership between India and the Soviet Union, in the new configuration India and the United States are aligning against China and Pakistan.\n\nWhile India and Russia maintain cordial relations, their geopolitical priorities have evolved. Partnership with the United States has grown in importance for India, whereas Russia has drawn ever closer to China. Unlike with the United States, India has neither common adversaries nor common partners with Russia. In other words, their geopolitical ties are loosening. The further Russia’s military and security ties with China grow, the more incentives there will be for India to deepen its relationship in these realms with the United States, though it is unlikely to do so at the expense of its ties with Russia which extend beyond arms trade to a larger, multifaceted relationship. India most likely will be determined to preserve it. As recently as December 2021, during Putin’s visit to India, the two countries restated a commitment to their “special and privileged strategic partnership.”42\n\nIn a telling example of India’s nuanced posture toward Russia, it has agreed to join the Russian-hosted military exercise Vostok ’22 in August-September 2022, alongside China. The exercise reportedly involves 50,000 troops, more than 140 aircraft and 60 warships.43 However, India sent only 75 personnel to take part in it. Moreover, no Indian Navy vessels have been dispatched to the naval part of the exercise reportedly because of concerns about damaging relations with Japan.44\n\nA Closer Look at Russia and Pakistan In recent years, Russia has pursued an improved relationship with Pakistan. This may be a signal to New Delhi, a move reminiscent of the 1960s. It could also be explained as a response to the long-awaited U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and to Pakistan’s importance to the trajectory of that country. In other words, rapprochement with Islamabad could be Moscow’s hedge against the spillover of instability from post-U.S. Afghanistan to Central Asia. The signs of this new Russian policy have been unmistakable.45 In 2015, Russia concluded a major deal to sell Pakistan transport and attack helicopters.46 Since then, there have been discussions about deals to sell Pakistan main battle tanks and air defense systems.47 One key question facing Russia is how far it is prepared to go given the risk these arms sales pose to its relationship with India.48 The possibility of selling the S-400 air defense system to Pakistan (whose military is interested in obtaining it), which India has already purchased, is one example.49 In 2015, Moscow signed a defense cooperation agreement with Islamabad, following a visit by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu the previous year.50 In 2016, the two countries initiated annual military exercises, the latest of which, Druzhba-VI, were held in September and October 2021 in the Krasnodar region in southern Russia.51 In April 2021, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Pakistan—a first after a nine-year interval. The visit was clearly arranged in anticipation of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Russia has convened several meetings focused on Afghanistan in the Moscow Format, which has included China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and the Central Asian states.52 However, in a remarkable snub to India, it was excluded from the meetings attended by China, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States.53 More recently, in a symbolic move, Pakistan’s then prime minister Imran Khan visited Moscow and met with Putin on February 24, 2022, as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.54 These developments suggest that Russia is trying to respond to New Delhi’s closer security ties with Washington by adjusting its long-standing India-centered South Asia policy, though without abandoning its ties with India, whose global strategic heft exceeds that of Pakistan. However, beyond the arms trade and apparently modest joint exercises, there is little that Russia can offer Pakistan to meet its larger needs in economic development, investment, or dealing with the consequences of climate change and frequent environmental disasters.55\n\nIn sum, Russian-Indian relations have undergone a rebalancing. That was to be expected, considering the radically changed circumstances of both countries and their geopolitical priorities. The balance in the relationship has shifted decidedly in India’s favor. That owes to its record of economic development and emergence as a great power with growing ambitions. But it also reflects the challenges India faces as a result of the even more impressive growth in China’s economic and military power, and the consequent increase in its global influence and status. The question is where Russia fits in this new dynamic given its commitment to the “no limits” partnership with China and simultaneous intent to protect its multidecade investment in its relationship with India. That is equally for Moscow and New Delhi to answer, as the latter has also invested a great deal in the relationship.\n\nWhat Next in Russian-Indian Relations?\n\nThe rebalancing of Russian-Indian relations cannot be said to have reached a new status quo, and they will likely undergo significant changes in the years to come. These likely will result from the erosion of the pillars on which the relationship has rested for decades—arms trade, economic ties, and congruent geopolitical interests. Russia, long the preeminent supplier of arms to India’s military, is already facing competition in this marketplace, not least because of India’s commitment to diversifying its sources of supply and other exporters’ hunger for lucrative arms deals. Russian arms manufacturers will have to compete with technologically more advanced suppliers such as France, Israel, and the United States as well as with India’s own defense industry—all the while remaining under tough Western sanctions. Despite the increase in India’s purchases of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia, the commercial relationship between the two countries, already a small fraction of their overall foreign trade, is still marginal to both and virtually certain to remain so.\n\nThe geopolitical pillar of Russian-Indian relations is also poised to be weakened by forces beyond Moscow’s control. The breakdown in relations with the United States has propelled Russia to seek ever-closer ties with China at the same time as the rivalry between India and China has intensified. Maintaining parallel partnerships with Beijing and New Delhi is likely to prove a difficult challenge for Russian diplomacy, especially in the event of increasing tensions, let alone conflicts, between India and China. If there are more clashes along the Sino-Indian border in the years to come, not to mention a full-scale war, it may become too difficult to manage at all.\n\nRussia is becoming a marginal player in this triangular dynamic for reasons ranging from the size of and prospects for its economy to poor innovation record and outlook to demographics. While their respective relationships with Moscow will remain important for Beijing and New Delhi, they will also be of declining value to both. Russia will find that being a junior partner to China while managing a legacy relationship with India reduces its room for tactical and strategic maneuver. Absent a major improvement in its own strategic position, which appears unlikely as long as it follows the foreign and domestic policy path cut by Putin, Russia could face a difficult choice between its “no limits” friend, China, and its oldest and most valuable Asian partner, India.\n\nThe dynamics within this triangle will likely follow one of the two following scenarios, with similar outcomes albeit on different timelines.\n\nChina’s “Vassal”\n\nIn this scenario, having burned its bridges to the West, Russia will become ever more dependent on China.56 This will occur against the backdrop of China’s growing power and increasing tensions with India, including recurrent clashes along their border; of growing Chinese influence along India’s periphery (in Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Central Asia); and of increasing apprehension in New Delhi about what it regards as a Chinese version of containment. This in turn will deepen India’s strategic alignment—though it falls short of an alliance—with the United States and lead to Russia being all but supplanted in the Indian arms market by the United States and its European allies.\n\nWith Russia’s importance to India as an economic partner in long-term decline, Moscow will become hard-pressed to compensate for these developments and offer New Delhi what it values on other fronts, such as favorable trade deals—especially regarding oil—and more advanced defense hardware and technologies. But oil discounts work only when prices are high, and the imperative of protecting its strategic alignment with Beijing will limit Moscow’s ability to deepen defense-industrial ties with India. China may even insist at one point that Russia significantly curtail or even end its arms sales to India.57 Should this scenario materialize, the decades-old partnership between Moscow and New Delhi, forged during the Cold War, would become much less special.\n\nA Difficult Balancing Act\n\nThis scenario also presumes that Russia’s dependence on China will grow. However, here China and India will manage their relations so as to avoid further escalation of tensions, enabling Russia to continue its policy toward India since the end of the Cold War. Moscow will do so by relying on familiar tools: sales of more advanced weapons systems, especially on favorable financing terms; long-term energy deals at discounted prices, building on the increase in oil deliveries following Western sanctions and boycotts; and a steadfast refusal to takes sides on the issues that divide China and India.\n\nHowever, the success of this strategy will be far from guaranteed for several reasons. It is not clear how much more military hardware Russia can sell in the more competitive Indian market. Oil is a useful instrument of statecraft but only when prices are high, which is not guaranteed due to the combination of energy transition and fluctuations in global supply and demand. Increasingly Russia will find that India, whose economic ties with the West and the Asia-Pacific will become even stronger, dictates the terms of their relationship.\n\nStill, facing an increasingly hostile and powerful China, India will not want to abandon its long-standing security relationship with Russia and will work hard to preserve it, in part because of a lack of confidence that the United States can be counted upon a reliable security partner. For all of its problems, Russia will remain in Indian minds a country that has, albeit for its own interests, stood by India in difficult times. In consequence, Russia will remain in good standing with India’s national security apparatus. The relationship will not come under pressure to the degree it will in the first scenario, but neither will it deepen and widen so as to ensure a good foundation the long haul.\n\nImplications for U.S. Policy\n\nBoth scenarios will be driven by developments that may be beyond Russia’s control—the pace of India’s relations with China and with the United States. Russia’s leverage will greatly diminish as will its ability to influence those developments. It has been said often that Moscow plays a weak hand well, but the odds of it sustaining strong security ties with China and India simultaneously do not look promising. Modi’s public criticism of Putin’s war against Ukraine at the September 2022 SCO summit stood in stark contrast to Xi’s public silence on the matter.58 The difference between the two leaders’ public positions is indicative of where Putin is likely to find a more receptive audience and whose words he is likely to heed.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the United States is in a good position to develop a multifaceted and durable relationship with India such as it has never had before. This will likely be strengthened and sustained by expanding trade and investment, security ties (arms sales, routine military-to-military contacts, joint exercises, and intelligence sharing), a young generation of Indians connected to the United States by educational and family ties, and an Indian diaspora in the United States that has harnessed its wealth to acquire political influence and is committed to fostering an Indian-U.S. partnership.59 In contrast to the Indian-Russian relationship, the one between Washington and New Delhi will fire on many cylinders.\n\nHowever, by refusing to join the Western sanctions regime, India has demonstrated that it intends to pursue an independent foreign policy guided by its interests. The Indian-U.S. security relationship is relatively new and untested. The United States’ Cold War alliance with Pakistan and its rapprochement with China in the 1970s have left a legacy of mistrust among Indian policymakers. By contrast, though it will lose the depth it had during the Cold War, India and Russia have important sunk costs in a relationship that has endured for over two generations and has served them well, including in difficult times. India has no reason to forsake the multiple benefits it has received from a decades-long relationship with Russia, and it would be a mistake to expect that it will do so, no matter the growing tensions between Russia and the West.\n\nWhether Washington’s relationship with New Delhi thrives or proves disappointing will depend on the extent to which it benefits both parties rather than on the degree to which the United States succeeds in pushing India away from Russia. The future of the Indian-Russian relationship will have its own logic, determined increasingly by India, and can be shaped at best only at the margins by the United States.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Rudra Chaudhuri, Ashley Tellis, and Andrew Weiss for their comments on an earlier version of this study.

The change owed to the deepening ties between China and Pakistan, which began in the 1950s but gained momentum in the following decade. Russia’s 1968 arms deal with Pakistan provided a more concrete example of the Soviet shift toward a more balanced South Asia policy. Moscow’s evident motive for the arms agreement was to contest Chinese influence in Pakistan while also using the opening provided by the U.S. suspension of arms to Pakistan after its 1965 war with India to weaken the U.S.-Pakistani alliance. See Zubeida Hasan, “Pakistan’s Relations with the U.S.S.R. in the 1960s,” World Today 25, no. 1, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40394188; and Hafeez Malik, Soviet-Pakistan Relations and Post-Soviet Dynamics, 1947-92 (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1993), 213.\n\n21 The most dramatic example of how China, Pakistan, and the United States contributed to the strategic alignment between India and the Soviet Union occurred in 1971. That year, Pakistan sent troops to its eastern province (now Bangladesh) to undo the electoral victory of the Awami League, which it regarded as secessionist. As refugees streamed into India, the prospect of an armed confrontation with Pakistan, backed by China and the United States, increased. To bolster its position, India signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union that year, which in places contained security overtones. India’s victory in the war led to Pakistan’s truncation, and Indians considered Soviet solidarity, credited with deterring China’s and even the United States’ intervention to help Pakistan, critical to their country’s triumph. Goodwill toward the Soviet Union in India rose to an unprecedented level.

    "What are the functions of the Attorney General for India?": "Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi has declined the government’s offer to be Attorney General (A-G) for India after “second thoughts”. Rohatgi, who had earlier agreed to take up the position, told The Indian Express on Sunday (September 25) that there was “no specific reason” for changing his mind.\n\nThe term of the incumbent A-G, K K Venugopal, ends on September 30. He is 91 years old, and on his third extension. Venugopal has conveyed to the government that in view of his advanced age, he would not be able to continue after the end of his current term.\n\nWho is the Attorney General for India?\n\nThe Constitution of India places the post of the A-G on a special footing. The A-G is the Government of India’s first law officer, and has the right of audience in all courts of the country.\n\nArticle 76(2) of the Constitution says “it shall be the duty of the Attorney-General to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character, as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the President”.\n\nThe A-G is also supposed to “discharge the functions conferred on him by or under this Constitution or any other law for the time being in force”.\n\nUnder Article 88, the “Attorney-General of India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member”. However, he “shall not by virtue of this article be entitled to vote” in the House.\n\nAlso, the A-G for India is not, like the A-G for England and Wales and the A-G of the United States, a member of the Cabinet.\n\nWho can become A-G?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Article 76(1), the A-G is appointed by the President from among persons who are “qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court”. Article 76(4) says “the Attorney-General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, and shall receive such remuneration as the President may determine.”\n\nThe post of the A-G has been occupied by some of the finest jurists in India’s history. The first two incumbents of the post were the legendary M C Setalvad and C K Daphtary.\n\nSoli Sorabjee served as A-G twice, in 1989-90 when V P Singh and Chandra Shekhar were Prime Ministers, and from 1998-2004 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Milon K Banerji was also A-G twice, from 1992-96 under P V Narasimha Rao, and from 2004-09 when Manmohan Singh was PM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMukul Rohatgi was A-G from 2014-17 before Venugopal took over.",
    "The new India: Expanding influence abroad, straining democracy at home": "On the margins of a summit meant as a show of force for a Russian leader seeking a turnaround on the battlefield, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India leaned in with a different message.\n\n“Democracy, diplomacy and dialogue” — not war — is the answer, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin as the cameras rolled on Sept. 16, before declaring that the two would speak more about how to bring peace in Ukraine.\n\nThat assured interaction in Uzbekistan was the latest display of India’s rise under Modi. An ambitious and assertive power, India has become increasingly indispensable in the search for answers to some of the world’s most pressing challenges, from diplomacy to climate change to technology and trade to efforts at diversifying supply chains to counter China.\n\nAlso Read | India on side of peace in Russia-Ukraine conflict: Jaishankar in UNGA\n\nIt is India’s credentials as the world’s largest democracy that Modi rides on the global stage. But at home, diplomats, analysts and activists say, Modi’s government is undertaking a project to remake India’s democracy unlike any in its 75 years of independence — stifling dissent, sidelining civilian institutions and making minorities second-class citizens.\n\nWhile past Indian leaders exploited religious divisions and weaponized institutions to stay in power, Modi’s focus has been more fundamental: a systematic consolidation of power achieved not through dramatic power grabs but through more subtle and lasting means, aimed at imprinting a majoritarian Hindu ideology on India’s constitutionally secular democracy.\n\nModi has bent to his will on the courts, the news media, the legislature and civil society — “referee” institutions that guarded India’s democracy in a region of military coups and entrenched dictatorships. As he has done so, the country’s indispensability on major global issues, coupled with challenges to democracy in both the United States and Europe, has ensured little pushback from Western allies.\n\nThe question for India and the world is whether the country can remain an engine for growth and a viable partner even as its heavy-handed marginalization of minorities, particularly its 200 million Muslims, stokes cycles of extremism and perpetual volatility at home.\n\nAlso Read | 'Jaage ho': How PM Modi surprised Jaishankar with midnight call\n\nThe contradictions of India’s rise were crystallized in Germany in late June when Modi stood alongside the leaders of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations as his public relations team worked to document his seeming intimacy with his counterparts: a shared laugh with President Joe Biden, an interlacing of fingers with Justin Trudeau of Canada.\n\nBut just as Modi was joining his hosts in signing a statement urging the defence of democracies and affirming ideals like “freedom of expression” and the “independence of civil society,” his government was continuing a crackdown on dissent back home.\n\nIndian authorities arrested an activist critical of the prime minister’s past record on human rights and a fact-checker who had highlighted disparaging comments about Islam by a governing party spokesperson. Days earlier, officials had again rolled in bulldozers to raze the homes of Muslims as part of a campaign of “instant justice,” this time targeting activists accused of leading sometimes violent protests against the provocative remarks.\n\nAlso Read | Dislodging Modi regime inevitable to save democracy, says Yechury\n\nFor now, Modi’s focus is on leveraging India’s strengths. As the global order has been disrupted by Covid, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an expansionist Beijing, Modi’s lieutenants have made clear that they see this as their moment to establish India, on their own terms, among the foremost powers.\n\nIndia is a rising economic force, having just passed Britain, its onetime colonial overlord, as the world’s fifth-largest economy. It is well positioned to prosper with its improving trade ties, large youth population and expanding technological infrastructure — a potential alternative, in the eyes of some democracies, to a future dominated by China.\n\nModi’s diplomats are emboldened to overcome seeming contradictions, such as holding military exercises with both Russia and the United States and increasing purchases of Russian oil despite American and European pressure.\n\nIndia’s Western allies have shown little appetite to challenge the Modi government as it diverges from some of their professed democratic values.\n\nA focus on trade and geopolitics has often pushed human rights to the back burner, analysts and diplomats said. With the European Union fast-tracking negotiations on a free-trade agreement with India, the talk is all “this deal, this deal, this deal,” one European diplomat in New Delhi said.\n\nAlso Read | India is a flourishing democracy: There’s proof\n\nThe United States, which two years into the Biden administration still does not have an ambassador in New Delhi, is reeling from former President Donald Trump’s assault on its democratic system. Its seriousness about a foreign policy that prioritizes human rights was questioned as the quest for cheaper oil took Biden this summer to Saudi Arabia, where he fist-bumped with the crown prince implicated in a journalist’s murder and dismemberment.\n\n“The U.S. also has lost some of its authority to criticize other countries on their records on democracy,” said Lisa Curtis, a former senior U.S. national security official who leads the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nIn many ways, diplomats, officials and analysts said, India’s rise brings together two unique developments: a natural opening in the country’s often-uncertain post-colonial trajectory, and the emergence of a leader at the peak of his power who has spent half a century pursuing his vision from the ground up.\n\nAfter India’s violent founding as an independent nation in 1947, the country remained consumed for decades with questions of whether it would remain intact and whether its economy could feed an enormous population. The moment to define itself, and its relations with the world, has come only after those questions have largely been settled.\n\nAlso Read | Using political epithets lightly in a fatigued democracy\n\nModi, 72, has spent his life in the trenches of a right-wing movement that calls India’s founding as a secular republic a grave injustice that accommodated minorities like Muslims and Christians at the cost of what they see as the Hindu majority’s rightful claims.\n\nModi’s political consolidation at the top, coupled with extensive welfare projects to maintain a strong voting base, has given India’s right-wing its most effective formula yet to bring about the cultural and systemic changes the movement has long fought for on the streets.\n\nThe country’s central investigating agencies have become willing levers of intimidation against dissenting voices, analysts say. Journalists and activists face frequent harassment, are mired in lengthy court cases or are thrown in jail under laws that make bail difficult. Independent institutions — from courts to parliament to the national human rights commission and the elections body — have been overwhelmed or have largely retreated, as the compliant are rewarded and detractors are punished.\n\nModi is not the first Indian leader to capture institutions and unleash them on political opponents, said Josy Joseph, who has chronicled a long history of abuses in his book “The Silent Coup.” The closest the country’s democracy has come to fracturing was in the 1970s when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared an emergency to jail opponents and censor the media in a bid to remain in power.\n\nAlso Read | From rights to duties: The deliberate remaking of the citizen\n\nJoseph said Modi had been much more effective than Gandhi in achieving his aims, aided by an unparalleled propaganda operation — allied broadcast media and newspapers, and a social media machine reaching into every phone — that provides cover both at home and abroad.\n\nModi and his Bharatiya Janata Party “have very cleverly combined India’s traditional democratic credentials and autocratic controls,” Joseph said.\n\nGopal Krishna Agarwal, a BJP spokesperson, attributed criticism of the government’s human rights record to politics and an unnamed “nexus globally” that cannot stomach India’s ascension.\n\n“Our rise at the international level is because India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is looking out for Indian interests, taking independent decisions,” Agarwal said. “We are leveraging the strengths of India — whether it is the large youth population, resources, manufacturing strength, IT strength, human resource strength.”\n\nAgarwal said the government’s approach to law and order should not be “classified as human rights violations.” He rejected the contention that Modi was deploying investigating agencies against his opponents, saying the raids were intended to clean up corruption.\n\n“If somebody has objection to the investigation agency, there is courts, etc., which takes care of the balance of power,” he said.\n\nBut local courts, analysts and activists say, often act as a stamp for the executive’s abuses. The already-clogged higher courts struggle to keep up and are at times accused of aiding the executive by ignoring important cases of constitutional overreach. There are nearly 6 million cases pending in India’s high courts and more than 70,000 in the Supreme Court.\n\nOne tactic the governing party deploys is to jail critics under strict laws against terrorist activities and money laundering. The conviction rate is abysmal, but the process of exoneration serves the political purpose of spreading fear, critics say.\n\nSiddique Kappan, a journalist, and his taxi driver were arrested in October 2020 as he tried to report on the government’s efforts to contain the blowback over a gruesome rape case. Before Kappan had even reached the village, the government charged him with intending to hurt local communal harmony. He was repeatedly denied bail.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court of India finally heard his appeal this month, the judges took less than 30 minutes to rule that the government’s case for denying Kappan his freedom was flimsy at best and granted him bail. Both Kappan and the taxi driver had already spent nearly two years in jail. But even the highest court’s intervention did not free Kappan: He remains in jail under another pending case against him, while the driver has been freed.\n\n“In our criminal justice system, the process is the punishment,” N.V. Ramana lamented before his retirement as India’s chief justice last month.\n\nModi’s confidence at home has extended into confidence abroad.\n\nOfficials in his government often denounce international indexes rating countries on key indicators like health or press and religious freedom, dismissing them as products of colonial agendas or foreign naivete on India’s civilizational approach — an attitude that reminds many diplomats of the stance often taken by authoritarian China.\n\n“Shall we not set our own standards?” Modi said last month at an event marking his country’s 75 years of independence, as helicopters showered rose petals. “We want freedom from slavery.”\n\nIn April, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a rare public comment on India’s domestic policies that the United States was “monitoring some recent concerning developments in India, including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police and prison officials.”\n\nHis Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, fired back. “I would tell you that we also take our views on other people’s human rights situation, including that of the United States,” Jaishankar said during a visit to the United States. “So, we take up human rights issues when they arise in this country.”",
    "Record for India after series win against Australia": "India beat Australia in a thrilling run chase in Hyderabad in the decider on Sunday to complete a 2-1 series victory.\n\nIndia maintained their excellent recent record in run chases in T20Is with a win over Australia in Hyderabad in the third and final T20I. Chasing 187 to win following impressive half centuries to Tim David (54) and Cameron Green (52), India completed the run chase with one ball to spare to make it 13 successful run chases in the format in 14 attempts since 2021.\n\nThe series victory also marked India's 21st T20I win in the calendar year, the most ever recorded by a team in men's T20Is. Pakistan had held the record until now with 20 T20I wins in the year 2021.\n\nIndia drew level with the Thailand women's team, which recorded 21 victories and four losses in 2019.\n\nMost wins by a Men's international team in a calendar year:\n\nTeam Wins Year India 21* 2022 Pakistan 20 2021 Pakistan 17 2018 Uganda 16 2021 India 15 2016\n\nGreen got Australia off to a flyer to start the match, with the young all-rounder reaching his half-century in just 19 balls - a record against India - as the visitors looked set for a big total.\n\nAustralia lost the key wickets of Steve Smith (9) and Glenn Maxwell (6) in quick succession, with David's last hitting helping the visitors compile a decent score of 186/7.\n\nIndia's run chase turned out to be a difficult one after they were reduced to 30/2. A century partnership between Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav put India back on track, but with the latter dismissed in the 14th over, the task turned out to be harder.\n\nWith 11 to win off the last over from Daniel Sams, Virat Kohli, who finished on 63 off 48 balls, hit a six off the first ball to make it five runs required off five balls. However, Kohli was dismissed the next ball with the equation further reduced to four runs needed from two balls.\n\nAn edge for four through third man off Hardik Pandya's bat gave India the record-equalling win and a series victory.",
    "Jaishankar takes a dig at American media for ‘biased’ India coverage": "India's voice counts in world because of PM Modi; U.S.-Pak relationship has not served either of two: Jaishankar\n\nIndia's voice counts in world because of PM Modi; U.S.-Pak relationship has not served either of two: Jaishankar\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, on Sunday, slammed the mainstream American media, including The Washington Post, for their “biased” coverage of India.\n\n“I look at the media. You know, there are some newspapers you know, exactly, what they are going to write including one in this town,” Mr. Jaishankar told a gathering of Indian-Americans from across the country amidst laughter and applause on September 25.\n\nThe prestigious Washington Post is the national daily published from Washington DC and is currently being owned by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.\n\n“My point is there are biases, there are efforts really, to determine,... Look, the more India goes its way and the people who believe that they were the custodians and the shapers of India lose ground in India the more actually, some of these debaters gonna come outside,” Mr. Jaishankar said responding to a question on the increase in anti-Indian forces in this country.\n\nSuch groups, he asserted, are “not winning in India”. Such groups, the Minister noted, will try and win outside or try and shape India from outside.\n\n“This is something which we need to be aware of. It is important to contest. It isn’t because most Americans will not know what sort of the nuances and the complexities of back home, so, it’s important not to sit back, not to let other people define me. That is something which I feel as a community is very important for us,” he said.\n\nResponding to a question on misrepresentation of the Kashmir issue in the American capital, Mr. Jaishankar said if there is a terrorist incident, it doesn’t matter what faith the person who’s killed belongs to.\n\n“If there are Indian soldiers or Indian policemen who are abducted; If there are people working for the government, or citizens going about their business, who will lose their lives?,” he added.\n\n“How often do you hear people talking about it; pronouncing it, in fact, look at the media coverage. What does the media cover what does the media not cover?,” the External Affairs Minister asked.\n\nThat is how actually opinions and perceptions are shaped, he underlined.\n\n“There is a big song and dance about the Internet being cut. Now, if you’ve reached the stage where you say an Internet cut is more dangerous than the loss of human lives, then what can I say?” Mr. Jaishankar said amidst applause from the audience.\n\n“If you look at A [Article] 370-issue. What was a temporary provision of the Constitution was finally put to rest this was supposed to be an act of majority. This was supposed to be majoritarian. Tell me what was happening in Kashmir was not majoritarian? I think the way facts are slanted, things are laid out. What is right, what is wrong is confused. This is actually politics at work.\n\n“We should not let it go. We should contest it. We should educate. We should shape the narrative. This is a competitive world. We need to get our messages out. That is my message to you,” he said.\n\n“We are not serving our country well or our beliefs well, or even our sense of what is right and wrong but by staying out of these debates. I think we have opinions we must express them we must share it with people, we must educate others on what is right and what is wrong.\n\n“I honestly believe that if you look at the whole 370 the Jammu and Kashmir situation, to me it’s mind boggling. Something whose merits were so obvious, should actually there even be people who would think different way,” Mr. Jaishankar said.\n\n‘U.S.-Pak relationship has not served either of two’\n\nJaishankar responds to US F-16 package for Pakistan\n\nAmerica’s relationship with Pakistan has “not served” either of the two countries, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on September 25 raising questions on the Biden administration’s approval of a $450-million sustenance package for F-16 fleet.\n\n“Very honestly, it’s a relationship that has neither ended up serving Pakistan well, nor serving the American interests. So, it is really for the United States today to reflect on what are the merits of this relationship and what do they get by it,” Mr. Jaishankar said in response to a question during an interaction with the Indian-Americans.\n\nReferring to the argument made by the U.S. that F-16 sustenance package is to fight terrorism, he said everybody knows where and against whom F-16 are used. “You’re not fooling anybody by saying these things,” he said in response to a question.\n\nEarly this month, the Biden administration approved a $450 million F-16 fighter jet fleet sustainment programme to Pakistan, reversing the decision of the previous Trump administration to suspend military aid to Islamabad for providing safe havens for the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network.\n\nIn a notification to the U.S. Congress, the State Department made a determination approving a possible foreign military sale for sustainment and related equipment for an estimated cost of $450 million, arguing that this will sustain Islamabad’s capability to meet current and future counterterrorism threats by maintaining its F-16 fleet.\n\nIn a call with U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had expressed India’s concerns about the F-16 package to Pakistan.\n\n‘India’s voice counts because of PM Modi’\n\nIndia matters in the world today and its voice counts because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Jaishankar said on Sunday.\n\nReferring to the series of meetings he had with the world leaders in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Jaishankar said he can say this based on the feedback from these meetings.\n\nThe voice of India matters and is being taken seriously at the world stage because of the leadership and policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Jaishankar said at an interactive dialogue with the Indian-American community organised by the U.S. India Friendship Council and Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS).\n\n\"Today our opinions count, our views matter and… have actually today the ability to shape the big issues of our time. I think … these are main takeaways from a very, very intensive set of interactions over the last six days,\" he said about his New York meetings.\n\nResponding to a question on Ukraine, Mr. Jaishankar said today the nature of the world is such that a big conflict by definition causes enormous ripples across the world. \"People across the world are paying the cost of fuel and food\".\n\n\"I think this conflict has different facets and perhaps some of those, maybe addressed (earlier),\" he said.\n\nIndian-Americans from various parts of the country flew in to attend the event. The External Affairs Minister arrived in the American capital from New York, where he attended the annual General Assembly of the United Nations, for a four-day official visit.\n\nDuring his stay here he is expected to meet the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. He is also likely to have interactions with the members of the corporate sector and the think-tank community.\n\n\"During my professional lifetime, as a diplomat, perhaps the biggest change that I saw, and I was privileged to be part of, was a change in the relationship between India and America,\" he said.\n\nThe Minister described Indian-Americans as the living bridge between the two countries as the one responsible for this change. The role of the Indian-American community in strengthening this relationship is something which \"I can never say enough about,\" he said.\n\n\"India, America relationship has changed because of Indian-Americans. It did not change only because of government policies,\" Mr. Jaishankar said.",
    "VPN Providers Flee India as a New Data Law Takes Hold": "Ahead of the deadline to comply with the Indian government’s new data-collection rules, VPN companies from across the globe have pulled their servers out of the country in a bid to protect their users’ privacy.\n\nStarting today, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT—a body appointed by the Indian government to deal with cybersecurity and threats—will require VPN operators to collect and maintain customer information including names, email addresses, and IP addresses for at least five years, even after they have canceled their subscription or account.\n\nIn April, CERT said it needed to implement these rules because “the requisite information is not found available” with the security provider during investigations into cybersecurity threats, thereby thwarting inquiries. The new rules, CERT claims, will “strengthen cyber security in India” and are “in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of India.”\n\nVPN companies and privacy experts believe this move impacts user privacy and freedom of speech, and defeats the sole purpose of using VPNs, which encrypt users’ internet activity and mask their locations and identities.\n\n“As digital privacy and security advocates, we are concerned about the possible effect this regulation may have on not only our users but people’s data in general,” says NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrylyte. “From what it seems, the amount of stored private information will be drastically increased throughout hundreds or maybe thousands of different companies.” She adds that similar regulations have been “typically introduced by authoritarian governments in order to gain more control over their citizens.”\n\nLast year, India became the country with the highest rate of growth in the use of VPN services worldwide. During the first half of 2021, 348.7 million VPNs were installed, showing a 671 percent jump in growth when compared to the same period in 2020, according to a 2021 analysis by Atlas VPN. This massive growth can be attributed to continuous internet shutdowns, a rise in digital scams, and the need for Indians to protect themselves online.\n\n“VPNs by nature can be a privacy advancing tool and can be capable of protecting information security in multiple ways, being used by individuals and companies to secure confidential information,” says Tejasi Panjiar, associate policy counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation. “They also help secure digital rights under the constitution, especially for journalists and whistleblowers, because the nature of information that’s transferred over VPNs is primarily encrypted, which allows them not only to secure confidential information but also to safeguard their own identity, protecting them from surveillance and censorship.”\n\nThe government defended its rules, saying it will not violate user privacy as information would be sought only on a case-by-case basis. This claim ignores the Indian government’s track record of surveilling critics, politicians, and activists. In August, an official investigation into whether Indians were spied on by the government using Israeli spyware Pegasus revealed that at least five phones of victims contained malware, but refused to disclose the report. Instead, the country’s top court recommended that existing surveillance laws incorporate the right to privacy and introduce mechanisms for citizens to raise complaints against illegal surveillance.",

    "There are concerns, but not too many alternatives to India too: Nirmal Jain": "“There are concerns about India but there are not too many alternatives also. One way to look at it is that Indian fundamentals are good, political stability, economic reforms, demographics are good, domestic market is also very good. People want an alternative in terms of sourcing centres from China. In investment also, people do not want to put too many eggs in one basket. So, India never had it so good,” saysSo let us look at two facts. One, India is a fastest growing economy and the best market to invest in as well as in terms of growth in the world today. But regardless of that, whatever be the best market, there is some value and beyond that investors start getting worried. It is human psychology to compare. Indonesia is doing very well, Vietnam is doing very well but they are smaller markets.So there are concerns about India but there are not too many alternatives also. One way to look at it is that Indian fundamentals are good, political stability, economic reforms, demographics are good, domestic market is very good and people are getting disillusioned by China’s growth which has been a little opaque. People want an alternative in terms of sourcing centres from China. In inestment also, people do not want to put too many eggs in one basket. So, India never had it so good.On RBI announcement banning third-party loan recovery by NBFCs The collection mechanism primarily should be done in-house as that way, there can be code of conduct. A company can have certain policies and what your people can and can not do so that there is a rule of law in this country and which everybody should abide by.Whether somebody is a defaulter or not, one can have legal remedies available and I firmly believe that all the lenders have to follow law. Nobody is above the law. Even if the gravest of crime happened, you cannot impart justice. Justice can only be imparted by the court. But sometimes there can be some stray and exceptional cases, I do not know about this particular case but fact of the matter is that if there are collection agents and they are incentivised based on the collection amount, then they tend to be aggressive.So collection agents should be used very sparingly and primarily for larger wilful cases, if at all, Even they should be very carefully empanelled based on their legal processes. Many Chinese apps were using socially coercive methods. Some people came and told us that we give loans and we get the entire contact book so we can target the people that they talk most to, which will be family members or whatever.We never accepted those kinds of things because you cannot intrude into anybody’s privacy in that manner. There is a code of conduct which every company will have to follow and that way, there will be lesser problems, it will go a long way and you will also grow faster.Tech is a huge solution. What we do is that we focus on small ticket loans. In small ticket loans, it runs like a process and that process should be good so that your NPAs are less, the legal notices are also automated and you do not have to do much because for a small loan, it is not worth your while to go after the customer.So it runs by process and numbers. You know that a certain percentage will go bad and that you will provide for but technology is very useful for monitoring the defaults happening anywhere else. Sometimes the DSAs (direct sales agents) can do fraud. Suppose you are a customer, you have not taken any loan and with your salary you are eligible for say Rs 1 lakh loan. Some DSAs will promise to give Rs 5 lakh loan. You will say how because the income does not justify that but you are greedy and you may accept it. So they can get you five applications simultaneously. Now what will happen is after a month or two, all five of them will discover what happened to this customer, he is overburdened. But there are systems and processes to do, to take care of everything and good thing about India is that the account aggregator, the digital technology is giving data access digitally at such low cost and if you use it effectively, it can be wonderful for everything, even for collection and serving the customer.Also now the Sarfaesi law allows you to purchase a property much more easily than in many other countries. In India, the legal infrastructure is coming, we should not have the mindset of the past that the legal framework is weak and we should use that.Demand is doing very well and has bounced back. What is happening is that credit collection as well as demand is improving from MSMEs. Even home loan demand has improved very well but when the interest rate increases, home loans are affected as EMI is dependent on interest rates. If EMIs go up, people may defer home purchase itself. Right now, the income levels are going up, people are seeing salary increases, business is doing very well and so we are not seeing any impact on demand but we are watchful.At this point in time we are very confident and very optimistic that things are going the right way. But if something unforeseen happens, we obviously have to review but the way things stand today, the underpenetrated credit market, the way we partner with banks and complement them is important. India is a very large economy, it is a $3 trillion economy. So when we are talking about say Rs 1 lakh crore, it is maybe $12-13 billion which is not even a fraction of what the market is. So we are fairly confident.",
    "Patrolling points do not define the Indian claim in East Ladakh LAC": "When External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was asked about the PLA troop withdrawal from patrolling point 15 in Kugrang River on September 13, he correctly and tersely replied that it was “one problem less” with the Chinese authoritarian regime post May 2020 belligerence on the 1,597 km East Ladakh LAC.\n\nOn May 17-18, 2020, the aggressive PLA under control of Chinese ruler Xi Jinping transgressed in the areas of Kugrang river, Gogra, and north banks of Pangong Tso and junked all the peace and tranquillity agreements of the past. The Indian Army bound by the 1993-1996 border agreements and subsequent Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) did not open fire as it would have led to vertical escalation like it did when brave Colonel Santosh Babu and his men taught a lesson to the Chinese at Galwan on patrolling point 14 on June 15, 2020.\n\nSince the May 2020 transgressions, the Chinese have made new permanent structures all along the LAC, which is in violation of the past bilateral agreements and CBMs. One must recall that in 1976, the Cabinet Committee on Security under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had approved what was then called “Limits of Patrolling” as defined by the then Cabinet Secretary and the China Study Group (CSG) on large topographical sheets.\n\nIn East Ladakh, the then Congress government approved 65 patrolling points from Karakoram Pass to Chumar as the limits for the Indian Army to patrol and avoid confrontation with the PLA. These points are well within Indian claim line on the LAC and were defined so to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border with China, which had proved to be a superior military power in 1962 border war.\n\nWhile the Narendra Modi government and the national security planners are quite clear that patrolling points do not define the Indian LAC claim in East Ladakh, the Indian Army must also not take the easy way out and only defend the LAC till these patrolling limit point on the map.\n\nThe disengagement from patrolling point 15 does not in any way restore the April 2020 status quo ante on the Ladakh LAC as the PLA must dismantle fresh military structures that have come up along the line since the aggression.\n\nThe Chinese must respect the Indian claim line in Depsang Bulge and Demchok area and restore the Indian Army’s right to patrol point 10 to 13 in the strategic bulge area as well as Charding Nullah Junction in Demchok before bilateral ties are normalized with Beijing. Simply put, the India-China LAC in East Ladakh is not defined by the patrolling points but by the Indian claim line.\n\nJust as the Modi government showed the way by ordering its troops to take dominant positions on south Pangong Tso banks on August 29-31, 2020, and force PLA subsequently to disengage from north banks of the lake, the Indian Army must now be in the position of strength all along the 3488 km LAC as the adversary only understands the language of power not peace.\n\nFact is that the Indian Army has no options as the PLA will continue nibbling on the East Ladakh LAC till it has impose its 1959 line, as advocated by then Chinese Premier Chou or Zhou En-Lai, on the disputed border. China has made its intentions very clear on the disputed border, time has come from Indian Army to also do so.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",

His friend Aznan was injured and is being treated in a hospital.\n\n“As soon as they set foot on the roof, they were hit by lightning and my son died,” said Mohammad Ayub, Usman’s father.\n\nOfficials said 39 people had been killed by lightning in the past five days, prompting authorities to issue new guidelines advising people how to protect themselves during a thunderstorm.\n\nLightning strikes are common during India’s monsoon season, which runs from June to September.\n\nCol Sanjay Srivastava, whose organisation Lightning Resilient India Campaign works with the Indian Meteorological Department, said deforestation, pollution and the depletion of bodies of water all contributed to climate breakdown, which was leading to more lightning.\n\nGlobal heating had increased the frequency of lightning, said Sunita Narain, director general at the Center for Science and Environment. A 1C rise in temperature increases lightning by 12 times.\n\nThere has been a 34% rise in lightning strikes across India over the past year, which has caused deaths to jump. India recorded 1,489 deaths due to lightning in 2016, compared with 2,869 in 2021, said Srivastava.",

    "Indian leaders are once again testing Big Tech’s commitment to data privacy and free speech": "Many large American tech companies have long looked to India as their next El Dorado, enchanted by the country’s massive population and steady modernization.\n\nAmazon is investing billions of dollars there, challenging domestic e-commerce giants. Apple is slowly but surely gaining a foothold in the Indian smartphone market, while also eyeing manufacturing expansion within its borders. Hundreds of millions of Indians already use Alphabet-owned YouTube and Meta-owned Facebook and WhatsApp, with room still to grow for each platform.\n\nYet just as they have in autocratic China for decades, Silicon Valley giants may soon face some sticky ethical wickets when it comes to operating in India.\n\nA new proposal introduced Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration would give the Indian government sweeping powers to regulate digital communication services and access vast troves of user data.\n\nMost concerningly, the proposed legislation would give Indian authorities the ability to take control of communication services and intercept user messages “on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety,” a nebulous provision ripe for abuse. The bill also forces licensed digital communications platforms to “unequivocally identify the person to whom it provides services,” rendering online anonymity impossible. To top it off, the Indian government essentially can’t be sued for abusing provisions of the act.\n\nThe plan builds on new rules and proposed guidelines in India about the government’s role in monitoring large tech companies. While some of the debate has been framed around defending user privacy, protecting domestic tech companies, and updating colonial-era laws, the practical implications of the regulations typically involve government officials expanding their surveillance powers.\n\nThe latest proposal fits snugly with this trend. Indian officials said the legislation, known as the Indian Telecommunications Bill of 2022, is a much-needed overhaul of laws that date back nearly 140 years in some cases. They also argued the reforms target the “importance of cybersecurity, national security, and public safety concerns, while ensuring constitutional and procedural safeguards.”\n\nAt the same time, the bill serves as a trojan horse for building out India’s growing surveillance state. The Internet Freedom Foundation, a leading voice in India for democratic digital rights, tweeted Wednesday that the proposal “increases government powers under vague grounds” and does not contain “meaningful reform.”\n\nThe Indian Telecommunications Bill of 2022 remains in the early stages, with amendments or a complete scrapping still possible. But its mere introduction offers another example of the Indian government exhibiting illiberal tendencies that cut against the professed principles of Western tech companies.\n\nIn 2019, Indian officials introduced a bill that would give the government “broad powers to store, use and control the large amounts of data it gathered on its citizens, including fingerprints and iris scans,” the New York Times reported. Indian legislators tabled the bill in August amid backlash from privacy advocates and tech giants, though government leaders said a new proposal is forthcoming.\n\nLast year, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to censor about 100 posts, including some authored by high-profile Indian figures, that were merely critical of Modi’s administration and political party. The three platforms complied with the demand, though some of the posts remained up outside of India.\n\nAnd on Sunday, a new regulation will take effect that requires virtual private network, or VPN, operators to collect personal information about users and provide it to the government upon request. Several companies providing VPN services have abandoned their Indian operations in response, with the Swiss company Proton announcing Thursday that it will join the list.\n\n“It’s going to have a chilling effect. I find it really sad that the world’s largest democracy is taking this path,” Proton CEO Andy Yen told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf Modi’s administration continues down this path, more tech companies will have to decide whether some moral compromise is worth accessing the Indian road to riches.\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions for Data Sheet?

Meta is targeting a 10% reduction in company-wide costs in the coming months, a response to this year’s slowdown in revenue growth driven largely by increasing competition from TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The Facebook and Instagram parent does not immediately plan to issue layoffs, but company executives are pushing out employees by reorganizing departments and forcing staffers to apply for new roles. Meta also is expected to trim spending on consultants and overhead to reach its goal.\n\nHead in the clouds. The U.K.’s communications regulator is investigating whether Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are violating competition laws through their dominance of the cloud computing market, the Financial Times reported Thursday. The Ofcom regulatory agency said it will “examine the strength of competition in cloud services generally” and the roughly 80% U.K. market share owned by the three companies. Ofcom officials could take enforcement action or recommend rule changes, among other steps, if they find violations of competition statutes.\n\nA dark day in Iran. The Iranian government has restricted access to Instagram and WhatsApp amid a wave of anti-government protests tied to the killing of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. The decision to cut off access to the two sites coincided with a broader shutdown of internet access across Iran, where protesters have clashed with police across the country. Meta-owned Instagram and WhatsApp are the only two global social media platforms still available in Iran.\n\nA crypto succession. Kraken CEO Jesse Powell plans to step down from his post in the near future, ending an 11-year run at the company he cofounded and helped build into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Powell has served as a high-profile advocate for cryptocurrency adoption, though his libertarian views on workplace culture and political issues has rankled some employees. Powell, who plans to remain as Kraken’s chairman, will relinquish his role once a replacement is found for the company’s new chief executive, current COO Dave Ripley.\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\nHe’s got an ear for it. Apple CEO Tim Cook takes some grief for failing to deliver revolutionary technology on par with the original iPhone, but a Bloomberg Businessweek feature published Thursday argues such criticism overlooks the understated brilliance of AirPods. While Apple doesn’t disclose sales figures for the wireless headphones, industry estimates suggest the company sold an eye-popping 120 million pairs of AirPods last year. If true, that would mean roughly half of revenue in Apple’s “wearables, home, and accessories” division, the company’s fastest-growing category, is attributable to AirPods. (Also: props to the Businessweek illustrator for the magazine’s cover, which features a parka-clad Cook making snow angels in AirPods.)\n\nFrom the article:\n\nAirPods are fragile, have just-OK bass, and look like the result of a horrific Q-tip accident. They’re easily clogged with earwax, lost in subway grates or couch cushions, and—at least in a handful of cases—swallowed in the wearer’s sleep.\n\nBut even if you don’t ingest them, your AirPods will need to be replaced every few years, because their lithium-ion batteries can’t be removed once they’ve run their course. While Apple has said newer versions use more recycled materials, AirPods remain costly both to the environment and our wallets, especially compared with the wired EarPods that came free with the company’s products for most of the past two decades. And yet, as anyone who’s been out in public lately can attest, people love ’em.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n\nJamie Dimon calls ‘dangerous’ crypto a ‘decentralized Ponzi scheme’ that’s not ‘good for anybody’, by Chloe Taylor\n\nNASA is about to crash a spacecraft into an asteroid.

    "India reacts to Queen Elizabeth II's death with grief, anger — but mainly indifference": "India reacts to Queen Elizabeth II's death with grief, anger — but mainly indifference\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images\n\nMUMBAI, India — As world leaders gather in London today for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – head of the Commonwealth's most populous country – is absent.\n\nSeventy-five years after it cast off British colonial rule, India sent its ceremonial president – a woman from one of the country's indigenous tribes – to its former monarch's funeral. As head of state, Indian President Droupadi Murmu's presence adheres to protocol, even though a mix of other prime ministers (heads of government) and presidents and royals (heads of state) are in attendance. Murmu also paid her respects to King Charles III at Buckingham Palace separately, before the service.\n\nModi's absence could be seen as a sign of his political priorities. Last week, he attended a security summit in Uzbekistan with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. But he's skipping a chance to meet President Biden and others at the queen's funeral, as well as the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nA mixed reaction to the death of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nIt's also a sign of the mixed reaction to the queen's death in India. There was some mourning, some anti-colonial anger – but mostly indifference.\n\nThere are no major public screenings of the funeral footage. It's barely on local TV. \"I did not think anything, actually!\" Richa Mahapatra, a 26-year-old chartered accountant, told NPR when asked what she thought about the queen's death. \"I did not have a lot of respect for her. So it didn't make any change for me, frankly speaking.\"\n\nMahapatra says she never thought much about the queen while she was alive either, and isn't grieving.\n\nIt's a sign of just how much relations have changed between Britain's royals and their former colonies. India removed the U.K. monarch as its head of state shortly after it became independent in 1947. The Caribbean country of Barbados recently did the same. Several other Commonwealth countries say they'll follow suit.\n\nFor many of the queen's former colonial subjects, her life and death are a reminder of a painful history of exploitation and racism. Some bitterness certainly persists.\n\n\"She benefited from the wealth and enslavement of colonized people and never did anything to rectify that,\" says Priya Atwal, a historian of empire and monarchy at Oxford University.\n\nSince India won its freedom from the British 75 years ago, it has been changing Anglicized or European place names to indigenous ones. (Bombay became Mumbai; Madras became Chennai.)\n\nOn Sept. 8, before word of the queen's death spread, Modi was renaming a street in New Delhi that's long been known as Rajpath, or \"King's Way\" – originally meant to honor Queen Elizabeth's grandfather King George V. Its new name is \"Kartavya Path,\" using the Hindi word for duty.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manish Swarup/AP Manish Swarup/AP\n\n\"King's Way, or Rajpath, the symbol of slavery, has become a matter of history from today and has been erased forever,\" Modi told a cheering crowd that day. \"A new history has been created.\"\n\nOn her trips to India, Queen Elizabeth II was met mostly with flag-waving – but also some riots\n\nThe queen visited India three times while on the throne: in 1961, 1983 and 1997. She rode many elephants, posed in front of a dead tiger shot by her husband and waved at Indians from countless convertible cars.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nBut on her final visit, in 1997, a royal stop in Amritsar triggered some riots.\n\nProtesters wanted the queen to apologize for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre – one of the worst atrocities of the British Empire. On April 13, 1919, a British general ordered troops to open fire on thousands of Indian civilians in a public park. Hundreds were killed.\n\nOn her 1997 visit, the queen laid a wreath at the massacre site, but stopped short of apologizing. Instead, she told attendees at a banquet in Delhi the night before that she found Jallianwala Bagh's history \"distressing.\"\n\n\"People kept straining their ears, but she never apologized – not for Jallianwala Bagh nor for any colonial crimes,\" says Aparna Vaidik, a historian at India's Ashoka University.\n\nVaidik says the queen was the product of a racist colonial regime and era.\n\n\"She grew up in an era where India was a colony. So those attitudes would persist. It's not like she's having her prejudices questioned,\" she says. \"Her world remained the same.\"\n\nBut the rest of the world has changed.\n\nFor Britain and India, the tables have turned\n\nOne of Mumbai's most ornate landmarks is a train station that used to be named Victoria Terminus, after Queen Victoria – the so-called \"Empress of India\" and Elizabeth's great-great-grandmother. The station has since been renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, after a 17thcentury Indian ruler. But its British-built flying buttresses and gargoyles remain.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer Lauren Frayer\n\nAt the station this past weekend, travelers told NPR they'd heard news of the queen's death. But they were more excited to discuss other news they'd heard recently: That this month, India's economy surpassed that of its colonial master. India's GDP is now the fifthh largest in the world, ahead of Britain's.\n\n\"They ruled us, but we'll never let that happen again,\" says Bipul Verma, 36, a member of the Indian Navy. \"What happened in the past doesn't matter. We have to look forward.\"\n\nAtwal, the Oxford historian, says the Indian economy would have surpassed Britain's much earlier if British colonial rulers hadn't extracted so much of India's wealth and resources.\n\nNevertheless, India is now arguably the more powerful entity in British-Indian relations — especially since Britain voted to leave the European Union, Atwal says.\n\n\"Now Britain is going through a period of a major flux. Since the Brexit referendum, Britain is the one looking for trading partners,\" she says. \"Britain is looking to India for deals and assistance and a future economic partnership.\"\n\nThere is one thing some Indians would like to make a deal with Britain for: The Kohinoor diamond. It's a massive, 105-carat jewel that was mined in southern India centuries ago. Now valued at more than $500 million, it's part of the incalculable wealth extracted by the British in India, over time.\n\nIt's currently embedded in one of the British royal family's crowns.",
    "From the U.S. to China, Major Economies Are Stalling. But Not India.": "“India felt some global headwinds, but the process of recovery continued,” said Sunil Sinha, the principal economist at India Ratings and Research.\n\nIn a resonant symbol of India’s growth, officials have been trumpeting the economy’s leapfrogging of Britain — the country’s former colonizer, which is now grappling with soaring inflation — to become the world’s fifth largest.\n\n“Those who ruled us for 250 years — we have left them behind to move ahead in the world economy. More than moving from sixth to fifth, the joy was in this,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. “We have come out of thousands of years of slavery; now is the opportunity. We will not stop.”\n\nLeft unsaid, though, is that India’s economy must support 1.4 billion people, while Britain has just 67 million. So even as the Indian government reported last week that the economy had grown 13.5 percent, year on year, in the April-to-June quarter — slightly below its expectation of about 15 percent — it still struggles to meet the needs of a nation that is soon expected to pass China as the world’s most populous.",

    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society. This cannot be allowed.",

    "Once Britain’s largest colony, India meets Queen Elizabeth’s death with indifference": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Just hours before news of Queen Elizabeth II’s death spread, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a fiery speech urging India to shed its colonial ties in a ceremony to rename a boulevard that once honored King George V.\n\nRajpath, formerly called Kingsway, was a “symbol of slavery” under the British Raj, he said. Instead, under the newly named Kartavya Path that leads to the iconic India Gate, “a new history has been created,” Modi beamed.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘I cannot mourn’: Former colonies conflicted over Queen Elizabeth II’s death\n\nHis speech last Thursday was the latest in a concerted drive to purge India of its colonial relics. It was also a clear sign that the country, once the largest of Britain’s colonies that endured two centuries of imperial rule, has moved on.\n\nThe renovated avenue now boasts a black granite statue of Indian freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, in the place where a mold of King George V, Elizabeth’s grandfather, once stood.\n\nThe queen’s death provoked sympathies to a deeply respected figure from some while for a few others, it jogged memories of a bloody history under the British crown. But among most regular Indians, the news was met with an indifferent shrug.\n\nThe British monarchy “holds precisely zero relevance to Indians today — they are of no importance,” said Kapil Komireddi, author of “Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India.”\n\nBritish rule shaped the country in significant ways, but India has since overtaken the British economy in size.\n\n“The country has come into its own … As a rising power, India can gain a lot from the U.K. but the U.K. can gain a whole lot more from India,” Komireddi added.\n\nREAD MORE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledges to make India a developed country in 25 years\n\nOn Thursday, Modi penned a heartfelt note, calling the queen “a stalwart of our times,” while the government declared a day of mourning. But for most Indians born a generation after independence from the British in 1947, there is little attachment to the queen or the royal family.\n\nSankul Sonawane, 20, was at home when he heard the news, which had “no impact” on him. “We have no sense of emotional connection with the queen. She was a monarch and I don’t believe in the idea of a monarchy.”\n\nDhiren Singh, a 57-year-old entrepreneur in New Delhi, felt the same way. “I do not think we have any place for kings and queens in today’s world, because we are the world’s largest democratic country,” he said.\n\nElizabeth visited India three times during her reign and was the first monarch to tour the newly freed country, cementing the start of fresh ties with Britain. After her coronation in 1953, she arrived in the capital New Delhi in 1961, where she addressed a massive crowd and nearly a million people lined up along streets to catch a glimpse of her and her husband, Prince Philip.\n\nDarshan Paul was 10 or 11 years old when she stood along a road in New Delhi and waved an Indian flag at the queen. “I remember her gloved hand waving back at me and was so impressed,” Paul, now 71, said.\n\nREAD MORE: Without a unifying queen, UK bonds could fray\n\nThere was abundant excitement and curiosity around her visit, Paul recalled, as she and her friends poured over newspaper photos of the queen and were dazzled by the gowns she wore.\n\nBut it was a different time then, Paul said, as she acknowledged that the traditional bond some Indians once held with the royal family has morphed dramatically since.\n\n“To young Indians today, they seem like any other high-profile celebrity family – you might follow news of them because you want to know what is happening behind closed doors. But beyond the glamor and celebrity allure, they don’t hold any significance any more.”\n\nIf her son, who was formally proclaimed King Charles III over the weekend, were to make an official visit to India, “it will certainly not matter as much,” Paul added.\n\nThe queen’s last visit in 1997 was tinged with controversy when she traveled to a memorial dedicated to hundreds of unarmed Indians who were killed by British colonial forces in 1919, amid calls for an apology over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nWATCH: United Kingdom enters national mourning period following death of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nFor many, the royal family remains a hallmark of a deeply painful history. Colonial rule is still remembered for the extraordinary violence and suffering it spawned, from numerous famines and economic exploitation to ultimately an unprecedented level of bloodshed in the partition of India and Pakistan.\n\nScrolling through social media after the news, 25-year-old Sumedha Chatterjee said the tweets in support of the queen felt almost like people had forgotten about all the “loot and plunder” the British monarchy oversaw. “They built their empire on the backs of the so-called third world,” she added.\n\nJust hours after her death, Indian social media lit up with renewed calls for the return of the famous Koh-i-Noor, the 106-carat diamond discovered in India that is part of the British crown jewels.\n\n“If the king is not going to wear (the) Koh-i-Noor, give it back,” quipped one user.\n\nEver since gaining independence, India has moved to shed its colonial ties, including changing back the names of a clutch of cities that were renamed during British rule. In the 1960s, officials removed figures of British officials and royalty from public view — the statue of King George V, which stood tall under the canopy of India Gate, was moved to Coronation Park, a graveyard or final resting place for imperial symbols in the capital.\n\nAnd under Modi, there has been renewed vigor to reclaim India’s past, which has seen the government scrub away colonial-era street names, some laws and even flag symbols.\n\nSuch gestures “represent a new India” which has nothing to do with the monarchy, said Archana Ojha, a professor of history at Delhi University. She added, though, that the country’s imperial history can’t be hidden away.\n\n“We may not need to cherish some of the legacies, but we need to preserve them to teach our future generations.
