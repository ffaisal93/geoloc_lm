Yuri Kochetkov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBRUSSELS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The EU on Monday denounced a decision by Serbia to hold foreign policy consultations with Russia, saying it raised questions at a time when Brussels has told countries seeking to join the bloc not to carry on with business as usual with Moscow.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Serbian counterpart Nikola Selakovic signed a document on Friday dubbed a \"plan on consultations\".\n\nSelakovic said that the plan envisages consultations on bilateral and multilateral activities, though there was nothing on security policies in it.

    "EU, US Question Serbia’s EU Commitment After Russia Deal": "By: Associated Press\n\n-\n\nThe European Union and the U.S. on Monday questioned Serbia’s proclaimed commitment to join Europe’s 27-nation bloc after Belgrade signed an agreement with Moscow pledging long-term “consultations” on foreign policy matters amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia’s officials signed the deal last week in New York with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUnder the 10-year rule of Serbian populist President Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist, Serbia has been steadily sliding away from its proclaimed EU goals and establishing close political ties with Russia.\n\nSerbia’s foreign ministry has sought to downplay the importance of the signed agreement, saying it’s a “technical” one and relates to bilateral ties and not security issues.\n\nAlthough Serbia said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its right-wing government has repeatedly refused to join Western sanctions against Slavic ally Russia. Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main preconditions for joining the 27-nation bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\n﻿The news of the deal triggered harsh criticism from both EU and U.S. officials.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Peter Stano warned on Monday that Serbia’s relations with Russia can’t be “business as usual” when Moscow is violating the U.N. Charter with its armed forces committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a very clear sign of their intention to strengthen their ties, to further strengthen relations between Serbia and Russia and this is raising serious questions,” he said. “We are taking this very seriously and we are following this up.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill said “further alignment with Russia is a step in the wrong direction and contrary to Serbia’s stated European aspirations.”\n\n“The United States believes that no country should be expanding cooperation with Russia while it continues its war of aggression against Ukraine,” Hill said in a statement to The Associated Press. “News of this agreement signed with Russia was surprising and stands in stark contrast with other constructive meetings in New York with Serbian officials.”\n\n\n\n",
    "ILUS Confirms Its First Investment Project in Serbia": "NEW YORK, NY, Sept. 26, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- ILUS International Inc (OTC: ILUS) is a Mergers and Acquisitions company focused on acquiring and growing public safety and industrial companies across the globe. Following decisive meetings with the Development Agency of Serbia and City of Čačak Municipality, the subsidies for the first ILUS investment project in Serbia have been secured and the mobilization plan finalized.\n\n\n\n“Our city is proud to welcome ILUS International for a long-term partnership which is creating thousands of jobs over the next ten years and strengthening the economy in our region. We are pleased that such innovative products will be manufactured in our region by our local people and exported to all parts of the world,” said Mayor of Čačak, Milun Todorovic.\n\nFor its first investment project in Serbia, ILUS has secured upwards of $8 million in government subsidies for ILUS EV Technologies. A further five planned investment projects are included in the company’s approved Phase One business plan for the region, each resulting in their own substantial government subsidies.\n\nAs part of the planned Phase One rollout in Serbia, ILUS has secured a large site on the outskirts of Čačak and also has the option to secure manufacturing facilities in Kragujevac and Jagodina. The planned Phase Two project is considered by ILUS as a separate project entirely, involving the privatization of a large government site.\n\nILUS is now preparing for its machinery and equipment to arrive in Serbia. This will include setting up the production lines for E-Raptor commercial electric utility vehicle manufacturing and OEM manufacturing. Simultaneously, ILUS’ urban mining company, Replay Solutions, will be shipping its plant machinery to Serbia as part of another investment project which will be announced separately. This alone is a substantial undertaking as the list of heavy machinery includes a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Crusher and Shredder, Electrostatic Separator, Airflow Separator, Pulse Dust Collector, Chemical Refining equipment and Copper Wire Recycling System. Serbia is also expected to be ILUS’ main production hub for vehicles and equipment outside of the United States. The planned investment projects are expected to boost the economy of the region and provide significant revenue for the ILUS subsidiaries, whilst creating employment for hundreds of Serbians over the next three years and thousands over the next five to ten years.\n\n“We are pleased to confirm commencement of our first of several projects in Serbia, whereby we have secured extraordinary benefits to boost our global manufacturing capability. Indeed, further sites are being discussed with the Serbian government and huge contracts are being negotiated for our subsidiaries in Southern and Eastern Europe, such as the Serbian governments need to replace more than 300 firefighting vehicles so that they meet EURO 6 emissions regulations. Our mobilization in Serbia forms part of our greater conglomerate plan to control large scale manufacturing capability in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East,” said ILUS Managing Director, John-Paul Backwell.\n\nThe Serbian city of Čačak is widely regarded as a European innovation hub and was originally chosen by ILUS for its first phase of European production because of its support for manufacturing companies as well as its excellent geographic position with efficient connection to the rest of Europe. Serbia has an attractive automotive and industrial manufacturing industry with highly regarded free zones and government incentives. Many of the world’s largest vehicle brands and automotive industry suppliers have manufacturing facilities in Serbia. Serbia’s low construction, labour, and energy costs compared with other European countries, combined with its pan-European highway network, has led many global conglomerates to have major operations in the country.\n\n“We have formed a favourable and long-term partnership with the Serbian government which gives us the large-scale manufacturing capability that we require for our existing operating companies and for our planned acquisitions which range across the emergency response, defense, and renewable energy sectors. This is only the first project with much larger deals on the horizon in the region. I am proud of what our team has achieved and what this means for the ILUS conglomerate we are building,” said ILUS CEO, Nick Link.\n\nFor further information on the companies please see the ILUS communication channels.\n\nWebsite: https://ilus-group.com\n\nTwitter: ILUS_INTL\n\nEmail: IR@Ilus-Group.com\n\nSource: ILUS\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://ilus-group.com\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nCertain information set forth in this press release contains \"forward-looking information\", including \"future-oriented financial information\" and \"financial outlook\", under applicable securities laws (collectively referred to herein as forward-looking statements).

A similar study has also began on the location of the Palace of Serbia.\n\nPreliminary results indicate that there is a geothermal resource in both locations with potential to supply power to the two buildings. This will then be followed by a Building Energy Rehabilitation Feasibility Study that will consider the scope, type, and manner of use of the geothermal resource. The planned geothermal resource research will be completed by November 2022.\n\nThese surveys are part of “Energy Efficiency in Central Government Buildings,” a EUR 40-million multi-year programme that aims to improve the energy efficiency in central government buildings. The geothermal resource research conducted at the Palace of Serbia was made possible owing to financial support from the West Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) and CEB trust funds financed by the Slovak Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, while the same study at the SIV 3 building was financed from grants provided by the Government of the Slovak Republic via the UNDP fund.\n\nThe application of geothermal power to provide for some of the energy needs of SIV 3 and Palace of Serbia buildings would help reduce the buildings’ primary power consumption, cut down CO2 emissions, and enable energy-related savings that can be used to improve working conditions for the staff. It would also address the rising need for introducing newer and cleaner energy sources, and contribute to the green transition of the Serbian economy and society.\n\nSource: UNDP",
    "Serbia Claims Third Title At Men’s U19 European Water Polo Championships": "Courtesy: LEN\n\nAfter back-to-back penalty shootout wins in the quarters (vs Italy) and the semis (vs Hungary), Serbia clinched the title in regular time against Spain. The final was no less thrilling as their previous encounters, the decisive goal came two minutes from time while the Serbs killed four man-downs in the last five minutes. It’s a painful loss for the Spaniards – while this was the Serbs’ third title in the last four editions, Spain had to settle for the silver for the 6th time since the inaugural 1970 championship (and yet to finish first). The bronze went to Hungary which managed to beat Greece convincingly.\n\nFinal: Serbia v Spain 9-8. Bronze medal: Hungary v Greece 10-7. For places 5-6th: Italy v Croatia 11-14. For places 7-8th: Germany v Montenegro 12-13.\n\nFinal rankings: 1. Serbia, 2. Spain, 3. Hungary, 4. Greece, 5. Croatia, 6. Italy, 7. Montenegro, 8. Germany, 9. Netherlands, 10. Malta, 11. France, 12. Georgia, 13. Turkiye, 14. Romania, 15. Czech Republic, 16. Slovakia.\n\nSerbia ‘finally’ won a game in the regular time – and that landed them the title. They got back to the throne they had occupied in 2014 and 2016, after missing the podium in 2018 (the 2020 edition was cancelled). The Serbs’ last three matches in the knockout phase were all thrillers, they ousted Italy in a shootout in the quarters, beat Hungary again with penalties in the semis, then nailed against Spain, scoring the winner two minutes from time.\n\nIn the final, Spain took the lead and Serbs needed almost six minutes to score their first but then added one more to go ahead 2-1 after eight minutes. Soon they doubled the gap and still held on for 4-2 deep into the third but the Spaniards levelled the score in 47 seconds while the Serbs’ captain Vasilije Martinovic got his second exclusion. Still, his team-mates didn’t panic, and Nikola Kojic netted an action goal in the very last second of the first half for 5-4.\n\nAgain, the Serbs managed to reset the two-goal difference twice, however, Spain could come back to even again, two man-up goals in two minutes were enough to make it 7-7, while the Serbs missed two extras still in this period.\n\nNot in the fourth, though, Aleksandar Kovacevic put away a 6 on 5 after a minute, however, despite missing their next man-up, Spain could equalise, Gerard Gil sent the ball home from action for 8-8. With 5:23 to go, Serbia took a time-out, but the man-up play didn’t work; still, a save also denied the Spaniards in their extra. A bit later, with 3:24 on the clock, the Serbian head coach Uros Stevanovic got a red card (not for the first time in his career, though his impulsiveness is definitely one of the keys to his teams’ successes) – that just boosted his players’ morale who killed back-to-back man-downs and then Martinovic, still in the water, sent a brilliant bouncer from the wing under the bar in an extra, with 2:03 on the clock for 9-8.\n\n𝗟𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 🤩🇷🇸 The future of Serbian Water Polo 👏 #ecwppodgorica2022 pic.twitter.com/hUzw4lz6kv — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 26, 2022\n\nIt was Spain’s turn, but even after a time-out they were unable to overplay the super-intensive defence of the Serbs and the goalie could make an easy catch to deny them in the fourth straight man-down. The Spaniards had one more possession, managed to launch a counter-like attack but the finish was poor from the left side, and together with the ball their chances also flew away.\n\nThe Serbs kept the ball in the last half a minute and could start the big celebrations together with many supporters coming over to the neighbourhood – they claimed their 4th title (as Serbia), while Spain had to settle for the silver medal for the 6th time.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗶𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝘁! 🔥 🇷🇸 Serbia win #ecwppodgorica2022 gold after victory over Spain! pic.twitter.com/saQ4LkqjI0 — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 25, 2022\n\nIn the bronze medal match, Hungary earned some consolation with a hard-fought win over Greece. The Magyars took a 2-1 lead after eight minutes, the Greeks hit back with three connecting goals early in the second to go 2-4 up. Then came a crucial phase as the Hungarians regrouped themselves and after coming back to even by half-time, they added three more in the third to stage a 6-1 run. After falling back to 8-5, the Greeks had desperate attempts but were unable to cut the gap to one goal at any stage. With 59 seconds to go, Erik Molnar – silver medallist with the senior team two weeks ago in Split – put away an extra to close down the contest.\n\n🇭🇺 Hungary beat Greece to secure bronze at #ecwppodgorica2022. pic.twitter.com/lsDIXxoeoM — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 25, 2022\n\nCroatia built a massive lead in the second period of the game played for the fifth place, and once they were 4-8 up, they never let the Italians back to the match.

    "Air Serbia Seeks Additional US Destinations": "Air Serbia hopes to expand in the United States by serving new destinations and agreeing to a new codeshare agreement.\n\nNext year, Air Serbia is planning to inaugurate service to Chicago, but it is already eyeing additional destinations in the United States.\n\nGet the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today.\n\nAmerican expansion\n\nAir Serbia's CEO Jiri Marek shared some insight into the airlines' expansion plans to the United States with Aero Telegraph,\n\n“We’re looking at other destinations in the US. But again, our main strategy is to target cities that have year-round potential. We do not want to increase seasonality, which is already high in our region. That's one of the reasons we favour Chicago over Toronto, for example, because the Canadian city is not only extremely seasonal, but also extremely unidirectional. At the beginning of the season the flights are full in one direction, and at the end of the season in the other direction.\"\n\nThe busiest unserved United States routes from Belgrade, excluding Chicago, are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Detroit, Atlanta, Boston, Washington, Tampa, Houston, and Orlando.\n\nAir Serbia owes a lot of its success to the Serbian government which subsidizes and owns much of the airline. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nThe Serbian carrier already plans to have daily service to New York next summer in addition to two weekly frequencies to Chicago and hopes to agree to a codeshare with a major United States airline. Air Serbia has previously attempted to form a codeshare agreement with American carriers but was unsuccessful.\n\n“We currently have interline agreements that work quite well. But we are working on reaching the next level, which is codeshare cooperation with one of the major airlines in the United States. We are in the final stages of negotiations and believe we can announce this before the end of the year.” - Marek\n\nRecent Air Serbia news\n\nEarly this week, Air Serbia announced that it was counting on 2022 to be a profitable year. Newly appointed CEO Jiri Marek said,\n\n“We are a smaller regional airline and want to grow with the market in a profitable and sustainable way. In 2021 we significantly improved our operational performance and even reduced our loss. This year we are aiming to be profitable, and we will continue to be on that path in the future as well. We want it to stay like that. Air Serbia will continue to be the leading regional carrier in the Balkan region, and we would like to keep our market share between 50 to 55 percent in Belgrade.”\n\nBefore 2020, Air Serbia recorded profits every year from 2014-2020. But had it not been for government subsidies, Air Serbia would have suffered significant losses. The value of the airline's subsidies is unknown, as well as the subsidies offered by the government to over 50 organizations.\n\nEtihad used to have an ownership stake in Air Serbia, but it recently withdrew. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nLess than two years ago, Air Serbia received a capital injection of $100 million, but how the money was used is unknown. The injection increased the Government’s stake in the airline from 51% to 82%, which happened as Etihad withdrew from Air Serbia. As the Serbian government and Air Serbia are tightly linked, Air Serbia has been able to grow significantly. Marek added,\n\n“Air Serbia played a significant role during the pandemic, helping the Serbian government with repatriation flights, with delivering medical aid and so on. And I think we proved that not only connectivity but also significant economic benefits are a result of our operation.”\n\nThe Serbian airline hopes that this year’s return to profit will begin a trend of long-term profitability.\n\nDo you think that Air Serbia will be able to reach a codeshare with an American carrier anytime soon?

    "Can the European Union broker a deal between Serbia and Kosovo?": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe European Union hosted further talks between the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia last month, though representatives of both sides once again left Brussels without a deal to normalize the countries’ relations. Attempting to capitalize on any remaining momentum, E.U. and U.S. envoys visited both countries in late August, with minimal success.\n\nWhy has the E.U. struggled to bring about a final agreement between the two countries on normalizing relations? My research suggests there’s an overlooked factor: what the people of Kosovo want. While an array of international organizations is involved in peace-building, many Kosovars disapprove of the E.U.’s role in these efforts. This suggests that who mediates the process matters for citizens — perhaps as much as what’s being mediated.\n\nWhat’s happening between Kosovo and Serbia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship between Kosovo and Serbia has remained tense for the past 20 years. Formerly a province of Serbia — within Yugoslavia — Kosovo came under U.N. administration in 1999 following the two-year Kosovo War and a NATO bombing campaign designed to end the widespread violence against ethnic Albanians.\n\nKosovo declared independence in 2008 with Western backing, though Serbia refused to recognize it. At that time, the E.U. deployed a mission to take over the U.N.’s duties of helping to rebuild Kosovo’s government institutions, and to mediate the dialogue process. The first major breakthrough in normalizing relations took place in 2013 with the signing of the E.U.-brokered Brussels Agreement.\n\nBut progress since then has stalled. Although the Kosovar parliament ratified the agreement, it wasn’t implemented following widespread protests — and Kosovo’s Constitutional Court issued a partial annulment of the agreement in 2015. Two years later, the E.U. led the establishment of an unpopular court to try Kosovo War crimes committed by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.\n\nFollowing a brief hiatus, the E.U. reinvested in the dialogue process in 2020. If anything, however, the situation has grown more tense. Last September, the Serbian government mobilized its military in response to ethnic Serbs’ protests against the Kosovar government’s decision to require documentation to cross the border. A month later, the Kosovo police arrested suspected smugglers in Serbian-majority North Kosovo, prompting criticism from the E.U. for “unilateral action.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions flared up this year as Serbia resumed its campaign to encourage countries to “de-recognize” Kosovo — and the Kosovar government again pushed ethnic Serbs in Kosovo to apply for Kosovar license plates and show identification documents at the border. The two sides reached a temporary moratorium on Aug. 27 on the registration issue.\n\nWhat do Kosovars think?\n\nTo understand what people in Kosovo think about the E.U.’s efforts, I implemented a 20-minute telephone survey of 1,608 adults in June and July. A team of independently trained, experienced researchers used random-digit dialing methods to select Kosovar citizens (or permanent residents) to interview. All contacted respondents agreed to participate.\n\nThe survey sample is similar in age, gender, education and socioeconomic status to the broader Kosovar adult population. However, the survey’s ethnic demographics are slightly skewed toward Albanians, who constitute about 93 percent of Kosovo’s population.\n\nI asked respondents questions regarding their attitudes toward the work of the E.U. in Kosovo, as well as that of NATO and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Response options ranged across a five-point scale.\n\nAre Kosovars satisfied with E.U., NATO and OSCE contributions to peace and stability?\n\nThe results suggest that Kosovars systematically disapprove of the E.U.’s role, both in relative and in absolute terms. While 42 percent of respondents were satisfied with E.U. contributions to peace and stability, 44 percent were unsatisfied. This stands in contrast to how they view NATO and the OSCE’s contributions — 94 percent of respondents were satisfied with NATO’s efforts, while 73 percent felt similarly toward the OSCE’s endeavors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, a sizable 64 percent of respondents believed that the E.U. was partial in whom it serves, a finding in line with the charges made by many Kosovars of the E.U. mission’s “anti-Albanian” and “pro-Serbian” tendencies.\n\nThese findings are further reflected in the responses to a broader question: “How successful or unsuccessful have the following been at performing their tasks in Kosovo?” While the vast majority of respondents believed that NATO and the OSCE have been successful (95 percent and 78 percent, respectively), just 42 percent felt similarly about the E.U.\n\nDo Kosovars believe the E.U., NATO and OSCE perform their tasks successfully?\n\nThis finding is noteworthy, given each organization’s duties in Kosovo. While the E.U. has taken the lead on the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo and institutional reforms, NATO is primarily tasked with preventing further conflict and interethnic violence, yet the threat of both has risen substantially in the past 12 months. Despite difficulties faced by both missions, it appears as though Kosovars have become increasingly and disproportionately hardened in their negative attitudes toward the E.U.’s efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean for the E.U. mediation efforts?\n\nWhile these data come from Kosovo, other survey results demonstrate similar levels of distrust in Serbia. A Eurobarometer survey found Serbian citizens are more distrustful of the E.U. than other citizens in the Western Balkans. And as Serbia seeks E.U. membership, a recent IPSOS poll found Serbians have become increasingly disillusioned with its promises, instead looking toward Russia for peace, security and stability.\n\nThese trends matter. The E.U.’s ability to broker a lasting agreement between Serbia and Kosovo hinges on how the two parties perceive its effectiveness and impartiality. This is especially true as efforts to mediate the confrontation between Kosovo and Serbia become increasingly protracted.\n\nDespite the recent defeats, the E.U. continues to place high hopes on its ability to mitigate increased threats to peace and stability in the Balkans. However, these findings may serve as a warning: The E.U. may have to overcome more challenges than solely crafting the appropriate terms of an agreement if it is to bring about a durable end to the dispute between the two countries. This is particularly important as the E.U. reinitiates the dialogue this week.\n\nCameron Mailhot (@crmailhot) is a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Serbia: Prospect of EU membership in exchange for giving up Kosovo?": "Long-stalled Serbia–Kosovo dialogue, sponsored by the EU, could be unblocked next year if claims that there is a new EU plan, published in some regional media, are officially confirmed.\n\nTalks on normalising relations between the two countries remain stagnant, and out of the handful of agreements signed, even less have been implemented. Over 11 years of talks, the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia has never been on the table.\n\nKosovo website, Albanian Post, reported that a new plan had been drafted on normalising relations after the engagement of German and French envoys.\n\nAccording to the website, the plan envisages Belgrade accepting, without formally recognising, Kosovo’s independence, getting some financial benefits and the prospect of EU membership in return.\n\nThe same source said that in 10 years when the next batch of EU candidates are likely to join the union, a formal agreement on mutual recognition would be reached and activated before the whole region ascends.\n\nThat would entail recognition of Kosovo’s independence by the five EU countries that have not done so (Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Romania, and Cyprus), while Serbia would get “huge financial aid” and be recognised as the “leading power in the region”.\n\nWhile the plan’s authenticity remains officially unconfirmed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic recently said he has “read this paper but, knowing what was going to happen, refused to receive it” from the EU special envoy for the dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, as he visited Belgrade.\n\n“I am experienced enough to know I was not to take that paper.”\n\nDuring a debate on Kosovo in the Serbian parliament, Vucic said that during his term in office, i.e. in the next four and a half years, the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008 would not be recognised, nor would it join the U.N.\n\nSeveral days later, at the promotion of the youngest generation of Serbian Armed Forces officers in downtown Belgrade, Vucic said that “we will not give Kosovo or any other span of our fatherland to anyone.”\n\n“Those who are threatening Serbia have never understood how great our resolve and determination is to guard what is ours,” said Vucic, without specifying who was threatening Belgrade and why he felt the need to reiterate that it would not relinquish Kosovo.\n\nWhat also piqued public curiosity was that in a patriotic song performed during a break in the programme, the lyric about Kosovo as “the soul of Serbia” was replaced with the line “to all the heroes of Serbia”.\n\nThe song’s author said the Kosovo bit was removed at the request of the Ministry of Defence, which the ministry later denied, saying there were different versions of the same song.\n\nThe plan – a consequence of EU’s more intense engagement\n\nAlbanian Post wrote that the plan is “a new framework” stemming from the direct involvement of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the dialogue after the EU leadership apparently concluded that “Kosovo and Serbia will never be able to solve the problem on their own”.\n\nTo soften the blow – as Kosovo remains a highly sensitive issue in Serbia – in the first decade of the agreement’s implementation, Belgrade would not have to recognise it but just accept independence.\n\nThat would be enough for the plan’s authors, given that the issue of Serbia’s accession to the EU will not be on the agenda for some time.\n\nHowever, this would entail Belgrade having to refrain from lobbying for the derecognition of Kosovo’s independence, as well as from opposing Pristina’s accession to international organisations.\n\nThat would enable Kosovo to join the Council of Europe, in the second phase, Interpol and UNESCO, then NATO and the EU, and finally the United Nations.\n\nThat UN membership would apparently be the most problematic because it does not depend solely on Belgrade but also on the position of Russia, as Moscow continues to express readiness to veto any such initiative.\n\nFor its part, Pristina would agree to enable forming the Association of Serb Municipalities at the end of the 10-year period, right before mutual recognition. The association would see the creation of a Serb structure in Kosovo, backed by Belgrade, something Pristina says goes against its constitution and has failed elsewhere, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe plan allegedly also envisages a precise sequence of events in case Belgrade or Pristina do not accept the document, but those details have not been published.\n\nNo clear confirmation of the document’s authenticity\n\nAlthough nearly all the parties mentioned in the article, aside from Pristina, have commented on the alleged document, its authenticity has never been confirmed or denied.\n\nMedia in Pristina, however, say that Kosovo journalist Baton Haxhiu, known for his close ties with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, is behind the article and the website. That is why the document is believed to be authentic.\n\nThe EU has declined to comment on the document, but political pundits have noticed that neither the document’s content nor authenticity has been denied.\n\nThe EU spokesman for foreign affairs and security policy, Peter Stano, has said that as a rule, the EU does not comment on alleged documents published by the media.\n\nAsked about the alleged document, US Ambassador to Serbia Christopher Hill said his country backed the EU in its efforts to achieve a solution in the Belgrade–Pristina dialogue because that problem had been going on for too long and had to be solved.\n\nAnalysts without a clear position on options for implementing the supposed plan\n\nThere is no consensus among political analysts on both sides as to whether the document is authentic but even less so on whether its implementation is feasible, even though they all agree that for the first time in many years, there is a certain readiness in the international community to get the ball rolling.\n\nBelgrade-based political analyst Dusan Janjic believes there are multiple documents in circulation. Vucic said that the West was preparing “a new reinforcement” for Kosovo precisely because he had seen one of those papers.\n\n“The US is insisting on a new format, and this document definitely exists. The timing mentioned in that document completely fits the methodology of operation of the US administration,” said Janjic.\n\nHe said that if the document were not accepted and should the conflict continue, Washington would apply “plan B”, which entailed conflict management and destabilisation controlled by the US, after which Washington would impose a solution on both parties.\n\nFormer Serbian Minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, said the published document is not a working platform for a solution but rather a means of ramping up pressure on Belgrade.\n\n“This is pressure based on a paper. This is a new phase on the same subject. There is nothing new, but what will happen if that story continues is new,” said Samardzic.\n\nOn the other hand, Kosovo’s former deputy foreign minister, Valon Murtezaj, believes the plan stands a slim chance of success because of, as he put it, “the destructiveness of Serbia,” which he considers “an unreliable party.”\n\nAccording to him, one should not wait an entire decade for Kosovo’s recognition because Belgrade would use that period to lobby against Kosovo abroad.\n\nFormer Kosovo diplomat Lulzim Peci found some provisions of the supposed plan highly controversial and suspicious, particularly the suggestion that Serbia would be acknowledged as the political and economic leader.\n\n“That terminology does not exist in contemporary legal acts because it entails the legalisation of hegemony and violation of the principle of international law of the equality of states… It looks more like a text for pleasing the sick egos of regional leaders who think they can become masters in others’ homes,” said Peci.\n\nPerhaps the story’s most mysterious segment is Pristina’s behaviour, which has stayed completely silent on the subject. However, Prime Minister Albin Kurti is known as an advocate of Kosovo’s instant recognition as a condition for any talks with Belgrade.\n\nAnalysts believe this might indicate that the international community has sent him a signal that this is a serious plan and that it would not be politically wise for him to reject it even if it does not entirely suit him.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]",
    "Kosovo-Serbia Tensions Are Reminder of Fragile Security, Unresolved Issues": "An agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, mediated over the weekend by the European Union and the U.S., settled a dispute over identity documents, but tensions over the matter, as well as license plates for ethnic Serbs in the north of Kosovo, are a reminder of the fragile stability in the region.\n\nCitizens can now move freely between the countries with their national ID cards. Until now, Kosovo citizens were given temporary Serbian documents when traveling to Serbia. In the latest deal, Kosovo agreed not to introduce entry/exit documents for Serbian ID holders.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the agreement.\n\n\"This is a European solution. We congratulate both leaders on this decision & their leadership,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n\"The United States supports this agreement and sees it as an important step forward towards normalized relations, centered on mutual recognition,\" a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Monday.\n\nBut analysts say it is precisely Serbia’s refusal to recognize the sovereignty of its former province that lies at the crux of the problems between the countries.\n\nDavid Kanin, adjunct professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University and a former CIA senior analyst, told VOA, \"There's only one problem between Serbia and Kosovo, and that is the status of Kosovo.\" He said that problems such as ID cards and license plates are \"simply part of that issue.\"\n\nFrank Wisner, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the U.S. special envoy to U.N.-backed talks between the countries, told VOA that the U.S. is steadfast in its support for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, which it declared in 2008.\n\n\"The United States has been foursquare behind Kosovo in consolidating that independence and achieving the widest possible recognition, but most particularly recognition by Serbia. That has not happened,\" he said, adding that it is not likely to happen soon.\n\nKosovo sees the latest agreement as one step on the road to mutual recognition, with Prime Minister Albin Kurti saying full reciprocity on other issues will be imposed, if an agreement to that end is not reached.\n\n\"We want there to be normalization to be achieved through an internationally and legally binding agreement for the complete normalization of relations with mutual recognition at the center,\" he said one day after the deal on ID cards was achieved.\n\nBut Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that allowing border crossing with Kosovo ID cards is done for practical reasons and \"cannot be interpreted as recognition of Kosovo's independence.\"\n\nThe European Union is leading the dialogue between the countries. Five of its own members do not recognize Kosovo, and Kanin says that that puts Serbia in a comfortable position.\n\n\"On the Kosovo side, on the other hand, they can't do anything to force through their sovereignty because the context in which they are operating prevents their sovereignty from being universally recognized, because that context includes five members of the EU who do not recognize Kosovo as a country,\" he said.\n\nThe European Union has told both countries their EU aspirations hinge on normalizing relations.\n\nRoadblocks in Kosovo\n\nThe latest round of high-level diplomacy followed tensions in late July in a part of northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbs are in the majority, after Kosovo's government announced it would begin requiring Serbian document holders entering Kosovo to obtain temporary Kosovo-issued IDs, just as Kosovo citizens entering Serbia have had to do for over a decade.\n\nKosovo also said it would begin requiring ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo to use Kosovo license plates for their cars, instead of Serbian ones. Some local Serbs responded by blocking roads, prompting NATO to warn against escalation.\n\n\"Should stability be jeopardized KFOR stands ready to intervene and will take any measures that are necessary to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all the people of Kosovo,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, referring to the 3,770-troop peacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n\nRoads were opened after Kurti agreed to postpone implementation of the plan for ID cards and license plates until September 1, but the flare-up was a reminder that security is fragile in a region where old disagreements are not settled and memories of the 1998-99 Kosovo war remain fresh. Kosovo still plans to implement the license plate requirement on September 1.\n\nBetween EU and Moscow\n\nSince the July flare-up, Moscow has repeatedly expressed its support for Serbia. The countries have historical ties. Serbia – like Kosovo and other Western Balkans countries – aspires to become an EU member, but unlike them it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nLast week its minister of interior, Alexandar Vulin, met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Referring to Western sanctions, Vulin said Belgrade \"will never engage in anti-Russian hysteria.\"\n\n“Serbia is the only state in Europe that didn’t introduce sanctions and was not part of the anti-Russian hysteria,” he told Lavrov.\n\nSerbia, however, has joined the U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion. In a Reuters interview on Monday, Vucic said that his country is the stage for a proxy war between East and West.\n\n\"You have a proxy war of big powers going on in Serbia through political players, the nongovernmental sector on both sides, the media and various social organizations, and you can see it every day, in every way,\" he said, speaking to Reuters at his office in Belgrade.\n\nKanin says Vucic is comfortable sitting on two stools.\n\n\"Serbia is not going along with Western policy in total,\" he said. \"They've gone along with certain things, [such as] the U.N. vote. There have been certain areas in which Vucic has leaned toward the Western stool. In certain situations, he leans toward the Russian stool.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nThere is no agreement yet on the license plates for local Serbs in Kosovo's North, and on Wednesday, Serbia's Vucic said he does not believe that a solution is possible.\n\n\"From September 1, [Kosovo] will ... try to force Serbs to change car plates, and I don't think they will have a big success\" Vucic told reporters.\n\nHowever, Major General Ferenc Kajari, the commander of NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, sought to dispel fears about a conflict. \"We are monitoring the situation ... and we don’t see even an indication of any preparation for a war,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans, Gabriel Escobar, has called on the parties to continue the dialogue and to implement all the agreements that they have agreed on, including one on a Community of Serb Municipalities in the North of Kosovo. Kurti is against such a monoethnic body with executive powers within the country.\n\nWhether one believes that incremental progress will ultimately yield mutual recognition or that agreements on practical matters are beneficial for their own sake, Kosovo and Serbia are bound to face their disagreements.\n\nWisner said full resolution is the ultimate goal, \"but you can only get there step by step.\"\n\n“It also falls to the two governments in Belgrade and Pristina to find steps short of a full resolution that will bring good sense to the region and allow practical solutions to practical problems and give time a chance to make a difference on the overall question of recognition.”\n\nBesim Abazi and Milan Nesic contributed to this report.

    "Serbia added to human rights watch list over Europride, freedom of assembly": "Serbia was added on Thursday to the CIVICUS Monitor’s International Human Rights Watch List with the rating of ‘obstructed’ due to the prohibition of EuroPride by the police with the backing of President Aleksander Vucic and other human rights violations.\n\nThe EuroPride march, which was banned by the authorities despite pleas from the EU, MEPs and international organisations, went ahead but resulted in the assault and hospitalisation of some LGBTI protestors and the arrest of tens of right-wing counter-protesters.\n\nNotable were discriminatory comments from politicians and figures from the Orthodox Church during the run-up to the event, as were counterprotests brandishing placards of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s face.\n\nThousands march in Belgrade against EuroPride Thousands of religious and right-wing activists marched through Serbia’s capital on Sunday, calling for authorities to ban EuroPride, which is scheduled for next weekend despite being cancelled by the government.\n\n“This ban is a continuation of the practice of banning peaceful assemblies because of violent counter-assemblies. All persons who called for or committed violence before and during EuroPride must be held responsible for their actions. This would be a starting point for authorities to show that they are fully committed to protecting the right to peaceful assembly and battling discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community,” said Uroš Jovanović, from the Gradjanske inicijative.\n\nCIVICUS, a group of over 10,000 international civil society organisations who publish their watchlist every quarter, highlighted Serbia due to attacks on LGBTI activists and journalists at the EuroPride march, protests on environmental issues have faced restrictions, and ecological defenders face judicial harassment through SLAPPs.\n\nActivists condemn right-wing violence at Belgrade EuroPride Almost ninety people were arrested by police while activists reported assaults from those countering the EuroPride march which saw over 10,000 people march despite a police ban with government backing. Thousands of activists took to the streets in the Serbian capital …\n\nThe organisation details several examples of attacks on the LGBTI community, including 15 in three years on a local centre with not a single arrest.\n\nTheir statement continues that the country is an example where “there have been significant increases in attacks against the right to free speech, the right to protest and the right to freedom of association. It is joined on the watchlist by Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Guinea and Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are 42 countries in the world with the obstructed rating. This rating is typically given to countries where civic space is heavily contested by power holders, who impose a combination of legal and practical constraints on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights.\n\n“Respect for civic freedoms is a key requirement for Serbia’s accession to the European Union. If the Serbian government is serious about joining the EU, it must urgently commit to respecting civic freedoms and halt all attacks on LGBTQI+ rights, journalists, environmental defenders and civil society. In addition, the EU must closely monitor developments on civic freedoms in the country, said Aarti Narsee, Civic Space Researcher Europe, CIVICUS.",
    "ADM opens extrusion facility in Serbia for non-GMO soy proteins": "ADM (Chicago) has opened a new extrusion facility in Serbia that is set up to produce non-GMO soy proteins after the acquisition of SojaProtein less than a year ago.\n\n“Our new extrusion facility not only increases the supply of locally sourced, non-GMO textured soy protein in Europe, which is in high demand, it also matches the pace of the incredible expansion of the meat alternatives category in the EMEA region,” said Leticia Gonçalves, ADM’s president of global foods, in a press release. “The growth in EMEA, showing a market value of $3 billion at the end of 2021 and an anticipated CAGR of 11.8% between 2021 and 2026, is astounding. With our 75+ years of experience developing tailored protein nutrition solutions now bolstered by both our expert colleagues at SojaProtein and our facility, we’re now even better suited to support our customers’ growth and innovation in the category.”\n\nADM will now offer both origination and extrusion capabilities, extending the non-GMO solutions currently available from SojaProtein. This is possible because 90% of the soy sourced is grown within 100 kilometers of the facility, enabling a local supply chain.\n\n“In just under a year, our operational synergies with SojaProtein have made massive strides to meet demand for non-GMO soy protein,” Gonçalves said. “We’ll see continued growth with the broader protein solutions toolbox and improved R&D capabilities through the opening of our facility. The ingenuity of the new plant provides advanced extrusion and texturizing equipment, delivering optimized and flexible solutions, ultimately allowing for unmatched speed-to-market for our customers to create in-demand textured plant-based protein offerings with a delicious bite and chew.”",
    "Serbia’s Move to Cancel EuroPride Shows How Vučić Plays Off West Against Russia and His Base": "The Serbian government is moving to cancel a long-planned parade in Belgrade this Saturday as part of the annual pan-European EuroPride celebration, hosted in a different European city each year, after thousands of religious conservatives marched on Sept. 11 to, as they put it, protect Serbian “traditional values.” President Alexander Vučić’s decision last month to cancel the weeklong celebration and the Serbian police announcement on Sept. 13 that it was banning Saturday’s parade may be part of his strategy of constantly playing the West and Serbian moderates off against Moscow and his domestic right-wing base. The EuroPride decisions and events, for example, should be seen within the context of Vučić’s decisions around the same time to accede to an agreement brokered by the European Union and the United States over border ID disputes with Kosovo.\n\nVučić’s decision to cancel EuroPride stands in contrast to Serbia’s historic role as one of the most pro-LGBTQ countries in the Balkans. Serbian activists have been organizing marches since 2001, and in 2014, Vučić took steps to back these activists by authorizing and mobilizing police to protect marchers from the threat of violent right-wing protestors. This official backing lent the marches an air of legitimacy, and Pride events in Serbia have since drawn activists from all over the region, including members of the European Union Parliament and the Western diplomatic corps. Pride marches have been violence-free since 2014 and became normalized.\n\nThat yielded Belgrade Pride sufficient political backing by European LGBTQ groups and the Serbian government in support of Belgrade Pride’s bid to host European Pride (EuroPride) in 2022. It marks the first time a Slavic country has hosted European Pride and a major step forward by Serbia in support of European LGBTQ human rights.\n\nWhy then take this step to cancel EuroPride, one that is sure to upset the leadership of many Western governments and human rights organizations, even as Vučić continues to give at least lip service to the country’s aspirations for EU membership? The move illustrates how Vučić’s power rests largely on his ability to balance the West and Russia, in turn mollifying and extracting concessions and promises from each as they fear that Serbia will fall under the other side’s influence.\n\nThis constant game is evident in everything Vučić does. He refused to join EU sanctions against Russia in the spring, but in June declared — as he frequently does — that joining the EU is in Serbia’s best interest. On the same day he announced the cancelation of the EuroPride event, Aug. 27, he also said he would propose that openly lesbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić be re-elected by Serbia’s National Assembly to an unprecedented third term heading his Cabinet. She has since been re-elected. This balancing act has allowed Vučić to negotiate, among other things, favorable arms deals with Moscow, while bringing in significant economic aid from the EU.\n\nAs a young member of Serbia’s Parliament in 1995, Vučić in a now-infamous speech during the war in neighboring Bosnia, vowed to Serbia’s parliament that “For every Serb killed, we will kill 100 Muslims.” Within a few years, he joined Slobodan Milošević’s government, serving as minister of information during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo.\n\nToday’s older Vučić is more pragmatic, a man who demonstrates allegiance to Moscow but understands well that he needs the West for Serbia’s — and his own — financial survival, via EU accession and the generous economic support that comes with it. Over the duration of his leadership, Vučić has toned down his rhetoric to a certain extent and pledged to bring Serbia closer to the EU, but still regularly takes steps that seem more aligned with the Kremlin than with Brussels.\n\nThe intersection of the EuroPride events with the Serbia-Kosovo border dispute was typical. On Aug. 27, the same day Vučić sought to cancel EuroPride, he not only endorsed Brnabić as prime minister again but also reached an EU and U.S.-brokered agreement with Kosovo to resolve their dispute over identification for border crossings. The accord would undoubtedly have angered the Kremlin, which has been among the outliers globally in rejecting recognition of Kosovo’s sovereignty since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008. The day before Vučić’s accord with Kosovo, on Aug. 26, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Gabriel Escobar had declared that it was time to forget the narrative that “Kosovo is Serbia” and start saying that “Kosovo and Serbia are actually Europe.” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova quickly responded , “Never.”\n\nMoscow, of course, also has long made its own phobias clear on issues related to LGBTQ rights. In 2013, for instance, Putin’s regime escalated its campaign against LGBTQ Russians with ”gay propaganda” laws that prohibited information for minors on LGBTQ issues, essentially a dog whistle against gays and lesbians and homosexuality. Such onerous laws are bolstered by the Russian government’s close relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, which the Kremlin has long wielded as an instrument of foreign meddling and sowing of chaos, including in the Balkans.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church maintains close relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church, which organized last weekend’s right-wing protest in Belgrade, according to the Associated Press, and both churches are known to maintain close ties with their respective governments. Both churches seek to safeguard what they perceive as the “traditional values” of their respective societies, so it was no surprise when Serbian Patriarch Porfirije supported the Serbian government’s decision to cancel EuroPride, which he said was not in accordance with traditional Serbian values – “the pillars on which our identity has been built for centuries.” Porfirije’s stance mirrors that of the Russian Orthodox Church, which for years has been a vocal opponent of holding public Pride events in Russia. In fact, last weekend’s right-wing Belgrade protest even featured Russian flags and portraits of Putin, the AP reported.\n\nIt’s clear the decisions by Vučić’s government against EuroPride mark just the latest iteration of his manipulative balancing act between the West and more moderate forces in Serbia on the one hand and Russia and his far-right base on the other. The West must ensure that his strategy of playing these sides off against each other, to the detriment of the EU values that Serbia must embrace to gain membership, backfires, and understand the complex games Vučić is playing. Make no mistake: Unrestrained, Vučić’s anti-Western and anti-human rights decisions will only become more extreme.\n\nIMAGE: Orthodox Christian believers hold icons as part of a joint “prayer for salvation of Serbia” on September, 11, 2022, during a rally “for marriage and family” in Belgrade called by the Serbian Orthodox Church against an upcoming EuroPride event.

    "Serbia: Rescind Pride Ban, Guarantee Participant Protection": "Click to expand Image Participants attend the Euro Pride 2019 gay pride parade in Vienna, Austria on June 15, 2019. © JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdate: On September 17, EuroPride 2022 went ahead, after EuroPride organizers notified authorities of a new route and received guarantees from the Prime Minister on Saturday morning that the March could go ahead safely. More than 5,000 police and military officers were deployed across Belgrade and 64 counter-protestors were arrested, according to Serbian authorities. At least seven LGBT people were attacked after the march, which victims reported to police. Thousands of participants walked from the Constitutional Court in Belgrade to a nearby park, along a much shorter route than originally planned. They were joined by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, Dunja Mijatović, the European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, Members of the European Parliament, and dozens of diplomats as well as other European and international leaders, marching in solidarity and in support of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\n(Berlin) – The Serbian government should immediately rescind its ban on EuroPride events scheduled for Belgrade in September 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. Instead, the authorities should work with organizers to ensure adequate safety for participants.\n\nOn August 27, President Aleksandar Vucic announced that the government is cancelling EuroPride, a regional event promoting equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people that Serbia was poised to host from September 12 to 18, with a march on September 17. Vucic acknowledged that the move is a “violation of minority rights,” but justified his decision because of threats from right wing groups to disrupt the event and rising border tensions with Kosovo. Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, a lesbian who is the first woman to hold the position, supported the cancellation, saying, “the first inviolable thing is to ensure peace and stability in the country.”\n\n“The Serbian government’s decision to cancel EuroPride is a shameful surrender to, and implicit sanctioning of, bigotry and threats of unlawful violence,” said Graeme Reid, director of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch. “Street protests by far-right groups and religious entities have already taken place. Now Serbia has an obligation to also ensure the safety and dignity of EuroPride participants.”\n\nThe government announcement followed a demonstration by thousands of people on August 27 in Belgrade opposing the Europride events, with slogans such as, “save our children and our family.”\n\nOrganizers have indicated that they have not received formal notification of a ban and intend to hold the event as planned. “President Vucic cannot cancel someone else’s event,” said Kristine Garina, president of the European Pride Organizers Association. “EuroPride is not cancelled, and will not be cancelled. During the bidding process for EuroPride 2022, Prime Minister Brnabic promised the full support of the Serbian government … and we expect that promise to be honored,”\n\nThe co-chair of the European Parliament’s LGBTI InterGroup has indicated that she will attend regardless of Vucic’s cancellation. Serbian civil society groups indicated at the end of August that they plan to appeal any ban in court. Vucic has responded to criticism by saying, without sharing details, that the government will enforce the ban: “If a gathering is banned, then it will be banned. There will be no games with state decisions.”\n\nThe Serbian government, after banning Pride events between 2011 and 2013, has allowed parades in Belgrade since 2014, which have been peaceful. Serbian authorities’ justification for cancelling EuroPride 2022 bears a striking resemblance to Russia’s arguments, for banning marches by LGBT people on grounds that they could lead to violent clashes with counterdemonstrators. The European Court of Human Rights struck down that argument in Alekseyev v. Russia in 2010 as a violation of the right to peaceful assembly.\n\nIn rejecting the Russian government's argument, the court reiterated that there is “no ambiguity” about “the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly.” The court emphasized that by refusing LGBT rights activists the right to peaceful assembly, “the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organizations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order.”\n\nRather than banning demonstrations because third parties threaten public order, the authorities should be fulfilling their duty to ensure that police protect peaceful demonstrators exercising their right to freedom of assembly, Human Rights Watch said. Based on human rights jurisprudence regarding pride marches, law enforcement authorities should remember they are there to protect those participating in the event.\n\nAs a member of the Council of Europe, Serbia should adhere to the Council’s standards to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, including that member states should ensure everyone’s freedom of peaceful assembly without any discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Council of Europe standards also say governments should not misuse legal and administrative provisions to impose restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly on grounds of public health, public morality, and public order.\n\nArticle 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Serbia ratified in 2001, explicitly protects the right to peaceful assembly. In a 2016 report, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association specified that, “The State’s failure to protect participants in a peaceful rally against violent, fundamentalist counter-protesters, for example, constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.” The special rapporteur said that the government “has a positive duty to protect those exercising their right to peaceful assembly, even if they are promoting unpopular positions (e.g., rights for LGBTI persons or those of a minority religion).”\n\nIn a 2022 report, the rapporteur emphasized that “Protests have been particularly important in facilitating participation of otherwise excluded groups such as … LGBTQI+ persons and other marginalized communities and victims’ groups … Where States adopt securitized, hostile approaches to protests, rather than welcoming them as an important part of democratic life, the result is often to deepen underlying crises.”\n\n“Instead of opportunistically pandering to anti-rights groups, Serbian authorities should work with EuroPride organizers to make the event safe and guarantee the right to peaceful assembly,” Reid said. “Threats against LGBT people’s dignity and rights should receive a serious reaction from the government. Cancelling a regional event is the wrong move.”",
    "Putin is banking on his friends in the Balkans to help sustain his bloody war in Ukraine | Michael Colborne": "I work at the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, where I lead our project using open-source research methods to monitor the far right across central and eastern Europe. In the Balkans, we’re seeing how Serbia’s far-right fringes are bolstering Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine. These groups aren’t just helping fan the flames in support of Russia’s war; they’re also receiving Russian help to push their own dangerous agenda in an already fractious part of Europe.\n\nAs Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, the Kremlin has some of the most disruptive and dangerous far-right forces in the Balkans on its side. In April 2022, thousands of Serbs took to the streets of Belgrade to protest against their government’s support for the suspension of Russia from the United Nations Human rights council because of its invasion of Ukraine. At the rally, marchers waved Russian and Serbian flags and chanted slogans such as: “Serbs and Russians – brothers for ever!”\n\nThe protest in the Serbian capital was organised by the far-right group People’s Patrol and its leader, Damnjan Knežević, who has also organised several other pro-Russian rallies. Just a few weeks later, Knežević and another People’s Patrol leader travelled from Serbia to Russia. They spent a week there, at the invitation of several Russian media organisations – including one headed by the notorious Putin associate Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nMany Serbs believe Russia has long acted as a protector of Serbia and its interests; the two countries share Slavic roots, and people in both Russia and Serbia feel they have been demonised by the west. Knežević has claimed that Russia, along with Serbia in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, has been unfairly framed as an aggressor when they are merely trying to protect their ethnic brethren. Knežević and his friends have flooded social media with pro-Russian exhortations. They have painted themselves as the most committed defenders of Serbs from all manner of perceived outside threats. This extends to defending those who, they feel, also defend the Serbian people; it’s why one regional analyst stated that Serbia’s far right provides “the most constant and intensive support” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis support involves more than just words or rallies. In May of this year, the small neo-fascist group Serbian Action posted a video to their YouTube channel documenting a visit they had made several months before to St Petersburg. Several Serbian Action members travelled there at the invitation of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), which has been officially designated a terrorist group in the United States and Canada. In the video, the RIM leader, Denis Gariev, fires off a handgun and brags that he teaches almost 1,000 Russians a year at the movement’s training centre.\n\nThe day after Serbian Action posted that video, Knežević appeared at a press conference in St Petersburg. He was accompanied by Aleksandr Lysov, the head of a “Serbian-Russian cultural information centre” accused of threatening anti-Putin Russians living in Serbia, as well as an activist from the Young Guard, the youth wing of Putin’s political party, United Russia.\n\nWhat interested me wasn’t so much what Knežević said at this press conference, but where it was taking place – the press centre of Patriot Media Group, a media conglomerate whose board of trustees is headed by Prigozhin. Patriot Media Group was one of the three media organisations People’s Patrol claimed invited them to Russia (the others included the infamous Russian state media outlet RT – for whom Knežević did a studio interview – and the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda).\n\nPrigozhin is a man we at Bellingcat unfortunately know all too well. He is an ex-convict and Putin confidant subject to US sanctions and wanted by the FBI for his alleged role in Russian interference in the 2016 elections. He has earned billions of dollars from Russian state contracts and allegedly controls Wagner, the private military company linked to numerous alleged war crimes in Africa and Ukraine.\n\nIt would be a mistake to ignore the relationships between the Serbian far right and Russia as meaningless or unworthy of further attention. Human rights organisations warned earlier this year that far-right extremism in Serbia is on the rise; EuroPride, the international LGBT event scheduled to run in Belgrade this month, faced a series of violent threats from the far right and the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, announced it would be cancelled. Neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where nationalist tensions threaten to tear the country apart, has elections in October.\n\nMontenegro, which separated from Serbia in 2006, could soon also have new elections. The country continues to be plagued by disputes over its national identity, between more independence-minded Montenegrins and self-identified Serbs who want closer relations with neighbouring Serbia. Tensions with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is home to a small Serb minority, remain the biggest flash point in the region. The timing, unfortunately, is just right for Serbia’s far right to cause trouble if it wants to – and they have friends in Russia to give them a helping hand.\n\nAnd Russia has already started to help. An English-language documentary recently broadcast on RT gave a platform to Knežević and other Serbian far-right figures to express their views unchallenged. “Just as Russia is freeing the Russian world via denazification and demilitarisation,” says Miša Vacić, a far-right figure long alleged to be linked to Vučić and his governing Serbian Progressive party, “we Serbs also have the right, through special operations, to create our own Serbian world.”\n\nWe ignore the far right in the Balkans at our peril. Their ideologies are based on the same resentments and grievances that caused the Yugoslav disintegration wars of the 1990s, but they’ve now found more people around the world, including Russia, willing to encourage and support them. It wouldn’t be the first time – the US state department claimed in a recently declassified cable that Russia has spent $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and others around the world, including in the Balkans. Russia may not have started this fire, but it’s more than happy to help stoke it.",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.\n\nThe rights group has said that there might be more detainees than those published by police and that it was only reporting names it could verify.\n\nIt was unclear if the latest figures included the detentions of anti-mobilization protesters in the capital of the southern Russian republic of Daghestan on September 25.\n\nCaucasus.Realities reported that police dispersed an unknown number of people who had gathered in Makhachkala to express their anger over the draft.\n\nIn one of multiple videos shared on Telegram capturing the confrontation, a police officer is shown beating a protester as two other officers hold the man down.\n\nOVD-Info said on September 26 that protesters who were detained in Makhachkala were beaten after being taken to a police department in the city's Lenin district, and that officers had refused to provide detainees with water.\n\nThe rights group also quoted a correspondent for the Caucasian Knot website as saying that he was held along with 60 other detainees at an Interior Ministry branch in Makhachkala's Soviet district.\n\nThe correspondent, Murad Muradov, said that \"some of the detainees were forced by the police to sign a protocol, threatening that otherwise they would be given a summons to the military registration and enlistment office.\" In at least one case, Muradov added, \"they carried out their threat.\"\n\nWATCH: Hundreds came out in the North Caucasus region of Daghestan on September 25 to protest against the partial mobilization announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on September 21 in an effort to step up the ongoing war against Ukraine.\n\nThe nationwide demonstrations erupted within hours of President Vladimir Putin announcing the partial military mobilization on September 21, which is intended to buttress Russian military forces fighting in Ukraine.\n\nRussian police have been mobilized in cities where protests were called for by the opposition group Vesna and supporters of opposition politician Aleksei Navalny.\n\nImages on Russian media have shown scenes of police using force against demonstrators, and many young men detained during the protests have reportedly been summoned to register for military service.\n\nIn Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, the Russian-installed leadership said on September 25 that their mobilization would be completed by the end of the day.\n\nThe call-up came as Russian forces suffered significant losses of occupied territories in Ukraine's east owing to a counteroffensive launched by the Ukrainian military. Putin followed up on his mobilization order on September 24 by imposing harsher penalties against Russians who willingly surrendered to Ukrainian forces or refused orders to mobilize.\n\nRussian officials have said that up to 300,000 reserve forces will be called up and that only those with relevant combat and service experience will be drafted to fight. However, Russian media reports have surfaced saying that men who have never been in the military or who are past draft age are being called up, and foreign media have reported that the real goal is to mobilize more than 1 million soldiers, which the Kremlin denies.\n\nWestern officials say that Russia has suffered 70,000 to 80,000 casualties, accounting for both deaths and injuries, since it launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine in February.\n\nThe mobilization to replenish those losses has seen men across Russia sent to register and to reports of Russian citizens attempting to flee the country.\n\nSeveral military enlistment centers and other administrative buildings in the country have been targeted in arson attacks in recent days, and on September 26 a military commissioner was shot by an apparent recruit at an enlistment center in Siberia.\n\nMedia reports say the 25-year-old shooter had been called to report to the office in the city of Ust-Ilimsk for mobilization that day.\n\nThe draft has also led to rare complaints by pro-Kremlin voices.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the state-backed media outlet RT, wrote on her Telegram channel on September 24 that while it had been announced that only people up to the age of 35 would be recruited, \"summonses are going to 40-year-olds.\"\n\n\"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite,\" Simonyan said of the authorities behind the draft.\n\nThe same day, the head of the Russian president's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called on Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to put a halt to the manner with which many draft boards in the country were proceeding.\n\nOn September 25, two of Russia's most senior lawmakers weighed in on the growing controversy.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of Russia's Federation Council, said that she was aware of reports that men who should be ineligible for the draft are being called up.\n\n\"Such excesses are absolutely unacceptable. And I consider it absolutely right that they are triggering a sharp reaction in society,\" she wrote.\n\nVyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, wrote in a separate post that \"complaints are being received.\"\n\n\"If a mistake is made, it is necessary to correct it,\" he said. \"Authorities at every level should understand their responsibilities.\"",
    "Serbia signs foreign policy document with Russia amid escalation of Ukraine war": "Members of the European Parliament warned Serbia on September 25 that Belgrade’s signing of a consultation plan with the Russian foreign ministry puts its EU accession progress at risk.\n\nThe consultation plan for the years 2023-2024 was signed by the Serbian and Russian foreign ministries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 24, at a point when Russia appears to be making a serious escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis weekend, referendums are taking place in Russian occupied parts of Ukraine on whether to become part of the Russian Federation. The conduct of the referendums, with some voters reportedly forced to polling stations at gunpoint, leaves little doubt that the decision has already been made to annex the territories. This follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of partial mobilisation in Russia on September 21.\n\nAs an EU candidate country, Serbia has already come in for criticism from EU officials and European politicians for its refusal to impose sanctions on Russia, in line with EU foreign policy. Pre-war, Belgrade pursued a successful ‘four pillar’ foreign policy, balancing its relations with the EU, the US, Russia and China, but this has become hard to maintain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nThe European Parliament's rapporteur on Serbia Vladimir Bilcik wrote in response to the signing of the agreement: “As a keen supporter of any steps towards a European Serbia, I find the news of planned consultations between Serbia & Russia a major blow to accession process in the Western Balkans. Let’s be clear: Russia is mobilising to attack EU candidate state Ukraine, Russia is attacking EU enlargement!”\n\nEuropean Parliament rapporteur for Kosovo Viola von Cramon also competed on the development on Twitter, linking it to Serbia’s EU accession process.\n\n“This is a serious scandal. In the midst of raging war, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Serbia signs the plan on future collaboration with the Russian aggressor. Or maybe it’s just a signal for us to freeze the EU accession talks as entering the EU does not go through Moscow,” she wrote.\n\nThe consolation plan was signed by the foreign ministers of Russia and Serbia, Sergei Lavrov and Nikola Selakovic.\n\nAt a press conference on September 25, Selakovic appeared to downplay the importance of the document, calling it a “technical matter” and pointing out that such documents have been signed since 1996.\n\nSerbia conflicted\n\nIn a sign of the conflicts within Serbia over its relations with Russia and the West, Selakovic told the same press conference that Belgrade cannot accept the results of the referendum in the Ukrainian regions.\n\n“[I]t would be completely contrary to our national interests, our policy of preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty and commitment to the principle of inviolability of borders,” he said — a reference to Serbia’s own situation related to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nThere is speculation that the signing of the consultation plan with the Russia foreign ministry was intended to send a signal that Serbia is not moving decisively towards the West, despite its decision not to recognise the referendums in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia also sent a message about the priority it places on EU accession last weekend when it hosted the EuroPride 2002 parade in the face of strong opposition from the Serbian Orthodox Church and conservative groups linked to Russia.\n\nHowever, there remains a strong pro-Russian contingent in Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, one of the more pro-Russian members of the Serbian cabinet, responded to Bilčik on September 25. “[T]he territorial integrity of Serbia is being attacked by 22 member states of the European Union, recognizing the fake state of Kosovo. Let's face it, this is a big blow to Serbia's European path,” said Vulin, as quoted by N1.\n\n“[T]o be clear, Serbia chooses its friends, and its enemies make themselves known,” he added.\n\nVulin has previously clashed with Energy and Mining Minister Zorana Mihajlovic, when the latter criticised Lavrov after Vulin’s visit to Moscow in August. Mihajlovic has accused the Russian foreign minister of “abusing” Serbia’s decision not to impose sanctions on Russia by falsely claiming Serbia supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Misa Vacic, the leader of the far-right nationalist Serbian Right party, is one of the international observers for the referendums in occupied Ukraine. Vacic is currently in Volgograd where he is observing the vote at refugee camps housing people who have fled Ukraine but are still allowed to vote in the referendum, Russian and Serbian media reported.\n\nDuring his visit, Vacic reportedly presented the deputy governor of the Volgograd region with a T-shirt bearing the image of convicted war criminal Ratko Mladic.",
    "Serbia Broadband “not for sale”": "United Group’s Serbia Broadband (SBB) has categorically denied that it is for sale.\n\nIn a statement, it said that “according to the staged scenario, which was evidently designed by the competition, “the company SBB was sold to the company Telekom Srbija”, and our users are recommended to switch to MTS services, because “we will soon be the same company”. For weeks, our users have been informing us that Telekom Srbija service sellers are persistently convincing them that it is better to replace the existing SBB equipment as soon as possible. Serbian citizens also write about similar experiences on social networks”.\n\nIt added: “We are shocked by the methods used this time against the SBB company, because this strategy of direct deception of citizens in the fight for users has not been recorded in Serbia in the field of telecommunications. We have evidence of numerous attempts to defraud our users who are told that “MTS has already bought Total TV and that users should return SBB equipment”, which is illegal and below any level of business communication and ethics. Due to all of the above, we are forced to publicly announce and inform our users and citizens that Telekom Srbija has not bought SBB, nor will it happen.\n\n“We are proud of the fact that SBB users are extremely loyal to our company, because they do not want to switch to the services of Telekom Srbija and that they respectfully refuse to participate in this dishonest scam. At the same time, we must publicly warn our users that the most basic means of deception are now being used against them and ourselves. We are glad that our users have clearly recognized this and that they regularly inform us about aggressive, illegitimate and violent attempts to change the situation on the ground.\n\n“For years, we have been pointing out the numerous obstructions of the SBB company by the authorities in Serbia, which provide indisputable support to the Telekom Srbija company, and that we are targeted for many discriminatory measures, which unfortunately the representatives of the authorities confirm in their public statements, among other things, with confessions concerning the prevention of SBB develops as a company with open favoritism of Telekom Srbija”.\n\nSBB concludes by saying: We remind you that we did not waver even in such an openly hostile atmosphere and that we decided to fight with all legal means allowed, before domestic courts and bodies, but also through arbitration proceedings in Washington, all in the desire to show and prove the extent of the pressures and injustice that we are exposed, due to the preservation of our businesses, the protection of our users, but also the public in Serbia”.\n\nBroadband TV News notes that BC Partners-owned United Group has been involved in a long-running dispute with Telekom Srbija, which it accuses of unfair competition. Like United Group, Telekom Srbija has undergone a period of a rapid expansion in the last three years.",
    "Serbian PM says willing to compromise during first Kosovo visit": "Compromise needed for ‘normalisation of ties between Belgrade and Pristina’, Ana Brnabic says.\n\nSerbia’s Ana Brnabic has expressed willingness to compromise during her first visit to Kosovo since becoming prime minister almost five years ago, a day after Germany and France appealed to Serbia and Kosovo to resolve a flare-up in tension.\n\nUnrest among Serbs in northern Kosovo over demands for them to use Kosovo documents has raised fears of conflict between the two countries, more than two decades after NATO bombed Serbia to end repression of Kosovo’s Albanian majority.\n\nSerbia does not recognise Kosovo’s independence and about 3,700 NATO peacekeepers still patrol to prevent violence between the Albanian and Serb communities.\n\nDozens of US-NATO troops stepped up patrols in northern Kosovo at the start of the month to preserve calm after the government in Pristina set a two-month deadline for Serbs in the area, which borders Serbia, to switch to Kosovo licence plates.\n\nEarlier attempts to introduce Kosovo licence plates in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo led to clashes between police and local Serbs, who erected roadblocks. The barricades were dismantled only when NATO peacekeepers stepped in to oversee the process and Kosovo agreed to postpone the licensing demand.\n\nDuring her first visit to Kosovo since she took over as prime minister in 2017, Brnabic said: “Compromise in the interest of peace and stability – definitely yes.”\n\nIn the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica, about 1,000 local Serbs greeted Brnabic, waving Serbian flags and holding signs that read “We have only one prime minister” and “Welcome to Serbia, holy land of Kosovo”.\n\n“I sincerely hope that the temporary institutions in Pristina become genuinely committed to dialogue and finding a certain compromise needed for long-term normalisation of ties between Belgrade and Pristina,” said Brnabic during a news conference, referring to Kosovo authorities.\n\n“That is something we need – not just for our European integration – but for ourselves,” she said.\n\nSerbia has been a candidate to join the European Union since 2012. However, most experts doubt the country stands a chance of entering the bloc until Belgrade hammers out a deal to normalise ties with Kosovo.\n\nBrnabic’s delegation travelled with a heavy security detail, while NATO troops were stationed along the main roads in the area and a helicopter circled overhead.\n\nDuring her one-day Kosovo tour, the 46-year-old was set to visit educational facilities, a Serbian Orthodox monastery, and chat with local farmers.\n\nIn another show of willingness to mend relations, Kosovo ministers visited areas in southern Serbia where Albanians are in the majority.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, wrote to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Sunday saying normal ties between Kosovo and Serbia are “of crucial importance” to the region.\n\n“Recent tensions have shown that constructive steps forward are urgently needed, both on the practical and the political level,” Scholz and Macron wrote in the letter, which was published by both Vucic’s and Kurti’s offices.\n\nTalks between Kosovo and Serbia under the auspices of the EU and US envoys have so far failed to solve the licence plates issue, although Belgrade and Pristina reached a deal on the use of personal identity documents.\n\nSerbs account for 5 percent of the 1.8 million people in Kosovo and Serbia accuses Kosovo of trampling on their rights, a charge denied by Pristina.\n\nKosovo is recognised by some 100 countries, including the United States and all but five EU members, but not by a number of other states, notably Russia and China.",

Serbian Foreign Affairs Minister Nikola Selakovic signed the agreement with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic, File)\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia has signed an agreement with Russia for mutual “consultations” on foreign policy matters, the Balkan country’s media reported Saturday.\n\nSerbian Foreign Affairs Minister Nikola Selakovic signed the agreement Friday along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe consultation plan covered by the agreement is expected to last for two years, Serbia’s foreign ministry said in a Friday statement. Serbia officially is a candidate for European Union membership, but the government maintains relations with Russia.\n\nAlthough Serbia said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the government has repeatedly refused to join Western sanctions against its Slavic allies in Moscow. Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main pre-conditions for joining the 27-nation bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMedia in Serbia and Russia said Serbia’s populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, met Lavrov in New York and the two “emphasized the joint focus on further dynamic development of Russian-Serbian relations.”\n\nOfficials from Serbia’s pro-Western opposition said the signing of the latest deal with Russia is a sign that Vucic, a former ultranationalist, has given up on the Balkan country joining the EU and is bringing it closer into Moscow’s fold.\n\nThe centrist SSP opposition party said “it is incredible” that at a time when most of the world is apprehensively watching Moscow’s actions, Serbia signed an agreement to consult with a country “that directly violates the U.N. Charter and intends to annex the (Ukrainian) territory.”\n\nInterior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, Vucic’s informal spokesperson, said in a statement that “expanding cooperation with Russia is not a matter of respecting the past but a responsible decision facing the future.”\n\nSerbia is important for Russia as a way to destabilize the Balkans and potentially shift part of the world’s attention from the war in Ukraine.",
    "Air Serbia Is Aiming To Return To Profitability This Year": "Air Serbia is hoping to make a profit this year as it continues to reduce its operating losses every year.\n\nAir Serbia is aiming to register a profit this year to start a trend of long-term profitability in the years to come. The Serbian national airline is a recipient of state subsidies and PSO funding, and its focus on building a regional hub in Belgrade is starting to deliver some serious levels of growth.\n\nAir Serbia to return to profit\n\nAir Serbia is counting on 2022 being a profitable year, according to its new CEO, Jiri Marek. He said:\n\n“We are a smaller regional airline and want to grow with the market in a profitable and sustainable way. (…) In 2021 we significantly improved our operational performance and even reduced our loss. This year we are aiming to be profitable and we will continue to be on that path in the future as well. We want it to stay like that. Air Serbia will continue to be the leading regional carrier in Balkan region and we would like to keep our market share between 50 to 55 percent in Belgrade.”\n\nIn the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, Air Serbia made a loss of just under $100 million.\n\nPrior to that, between 2014 and 2020, it was turning a profit every year, though its operational result would have been a loss had it not been for government subsidies that Serbia continues to inject into its flag carrier.\n\nThe exact value of the government subsidies is not known: Air Serbia is among over 50 organizations in Serbia that receive financial aid from the government, and it is not publicly known how much money goes to each.\n\nSimilarly, it is not clear how Air Serbia used the 100 million euro ($100 million) capital injection provided by the Serbian government just under two years ago. As Simple Flying reported at the time, this capital injection saw the Government of Serbia increase its ownership stake in its flag carrier from 51% to 82%. The move is part of Etihad’s withdrawal from Air Serbia, an airline that is one of its rare success stories.\n\nThe airline is now almost enitrely owned by the Serbian government. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nA strong relationship with the state\n\nAir Serbia is a regional success story when it comes to route launches, fostering hub synergies, and responding to new market opportunities. Most recently, the airline significantly expanded its offering to Bucharest (OTP) as a result of the market gap left by Blue Air. It reacted in a similar way in Ljubljana (LJU) in 2019 after Adria Airways declared bankruptcy.\n\nWhen Adria declared bankruptcy, Air Serbia boosted its frequencies to Ljubljana to capture transfer passengers. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe airline is a political project of the incumbent president, who has turned it into a success story that only became greater as Etihad started exiting the company. As a result, the Serbian state and Air Serbia are tightly linked, and this explains the large amounts of state aid provided for it.\n\nCommenting on this, the CEO, Jiri Marek, said:\n\n“Air Serbia played a significant role during the pandemic, helping the Serbian government with repatriation flights, with delivering medical aid and so on. And I think we proved that not only connectivity, but also significant economic benefits are a result of our operation.”\n\nWhat do you think of Air Serbia making a profit in 2022, following two pandemic years of losses?

    "Serbia seeks fighter it might choose MiG-35 or JF-17 Block 3": "BELGRADE ($1=121.06 Serbian Dinars) — The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Serbia is in the process of renewing its armament. Serbian sources say the time has come for a new Serbian fighter jet. Serbia has already bought Pantsir-S1 mobile air defense systems, the Chinese FK-3 anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile system, and the Chinese CH-92A reconnaissance and attack drones.\n\nPhoto credit: Pan.bg\n\nSerbian pilots are impressed by the Russian fighter MiG-35 4++ generation. As BulgarianMilitary.com previously wrote, the MiG-35 is one of the most successful Russian fighters, in no way inferior to its competitors in the same class. However, Russia is gradually abandoning the project, and if it does not find a customer soon, the MiG-35 will be forgotten, like many other Russian weapons.\n\nThe MiG-35 will be rejected by Belgrade. The reasons will not be the operational capabilities of the aircraft or the characteristics. The reasons will be political, local analysts comment. According to them, the fear that Washington will attack such a decision by Belgrade with economic sanctions under the CAATSA law will dissuade the Serbs. The possibility of this happening leans more towards one hundred percent.\n\nSome Serbian experts immediately turned their attention to another alternative. Of course, it is not an American opportunity, but a Chinese one. China’s JF-17 Bok 3. As already mentioned, Serbia buys from China. Sources close to Serbian political circles in Belgrade believe that the JF-17 Bok 3 will be not only a compromise but also a successful solution to the Serbian fighter jet crisis. Currently, the Serbian Air Force operates only 14 units of obsolete MiG-29s.\n\nPhoto credit: Pakistan Air Force\n\nWhy the JF-17 Bok III? The JF-17 Bok III is a 4th generation fighter but is equipped with 5th generation avionics and weapons. The operational costs of the fighter are low and this will also influence the decision. Also, the JF-17 Block III uses technology from the J-20 stealth fighter.\n\nSerbian experts comment that in case of possible prolonged air attacks, a Chinese fighter is an optimal option. The airframe of the JF-17 is capable of maintaining a high level of readiness. Aircraft maintenance is also kept to a minimum. Last but not least, it is expected that if Serbia buys the JF-17 it will receive it with its full armament. I.e. Belgrade will acquire high-class air-to-air missiles.\n\nSerbia may decide to turn to France and try to acquire Rafael. But, JF-17 and MiG-29 have a common engine. I.e. Belgrade may decide not to retire its MiG-29 fleet, but to augment it with JF-17s. However, this means that the Serbian budget will be increased more than expected because the MiG-29 will need a heavy modernization.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.

    "Chinese Influence in Serbia": "This report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nGoals and objectives of CCP malign influence\n\nThe rise of Chinese influence in Serbia began in 2009, when the two countries agreed to cooperate on economic matters and technological and infrastructure development. A subsequent formal “partnership” was declared in 2016. ) China is also a strong presence in Serbian politics, as well as digitalization and security. But the environmental impact of its high-profile projects has begun to make it the target of protests, locally and nationally.\n\nSerbia has become a “poster child” for Chinese influence. Belgrade and Beijing present cooperation as beneficial and friendly, and political leaders talk of ‘’brotherhood’’ and a “steel friendship,” an allusion to China’s 2016 purchase of a Serbian steel mill. The ruling political majority’s championing of China has gotten results: Polls show that 83% of Serbian citizens see China as a friendly country and 77% view its impact on Serbia as positive.\n\nChinese influence in Serbia is spread through various means, directly through the activities of the Chinese government, or more visibly in tandem with domestic politicians. While it is not simple to categorize a wide set of tools, the most conspicuous and successful have been economic cooperation between Serbia and China, activities of the Chinese Embassy, bilateral visits, “mask and vaccine diplomacy,” and cooperation with Serbian media. Other, less prominent, arenas of influence are culture, sports, and technology.\n\nThe main avenue of Chinese influence in Serbia is preferential loans by Chinese banks to fund infrastructure projects, for which Serbian politicians portray China as a white knight. These deals are often opaque, with no public explanation of how or why Chinese companies are chosen to work on them. Since 2009, Serbia and China have agreed on infrastructure projects worth more than $7.5 bn, financially tying Serbia to China for more than a decade. The total amount of the loan agreements and certain aspects of the contracts raise the specter of corruption, especially because the average costs of the projects are higher than in similar cases elsewhere in Europe. In addition to the infrastructure loans, China has significantly upped its investment in Serbia over the past decade, topping $2.2 bn since 2009. While that is a fraction of the 17 bn-plus euros that EU countries have poured into Serbia in the same period, making the bloc the largest investor, China became Serbia’s largest single country investor in 2021, putting in more than 700 million euros. The short-term economic benefits of the Chinese capital influx are indisputable, but the potential long-term consequences are questionable. Chinese investments have been mostly in export-oriented industries, meaning that most of the profits will go to Chinese companies and that Serbia’s take will be limited. There are also serious concerns about labor practices and the environmental impacts of these projects.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy plays a significant role in promoting Chinese influence in Serbia. Ambassador Chen Bo meets regularly with top Serbian officials, including President Aleksandar Vučić. Her statements emphasize the role of China and Chinese companies in Serbia’s economic development, echoing a narrative pushed by domestic officials. She is also on hand at construction sites when Chinese projects are presented as a boon to Serbian infrastructure and regularly attends press conferences when Chinese projects are announced or promoted. In addition to the work of the Chinese Embassy, officials from Beijing regularly visit Belgrade.\n\nEfforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic further cemented China’s influence. As it did elsewhere, Beijing reached out to politicians, who in Serbia were much more receptive than their counterparts in some other countries. Chinese-Serbian amity reached new highs during the pandemic, including among the general public, in turn opening up new possibilities for the spread of Chinese influence.\n\nWhile Chinese influence in Serbian media is hard to identify, there are key examples of Chinese interference. China Radio International has its own Serbian outlet as well as Serbian radio stations that broadcast content from CRI. But the second, more important feature, is the promotion of the pro-CCP media in Serbia. Chinese funding of media in Serbia is not as visible as its content’s reach, direct influence comes from promotional op-eds and articles that appear in some mainstream outlets. It is fair to say that the media play a significant role in creating a nation of “China lovers,” but the reasoning is twofold: direct Chinese media interference and close political relations with the ruling majority in Serbia.\n\nSources: The World Factbook 2022, (Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2020), https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/; World Bank, The World Bank Group, 2022, https://www.worldbank.org/en/home; “Parliamentary friendship group – China,” National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, Retrieved June 21, 2022, http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/parliamentary-friendship-groups/parliamentary-friendship-groups.308.499.html\n\nReach of influence measures\n\nInfrastructure projects by Chinese companies, backed by loans from Chinese banks, are the foundation of China’s popularity. Serbian politicians hail them as crucial to the country’s infrastructure and economic development, saving jobs in factories and companies that were failing before being purchased by Chinese companies. The hype escalated during the COVID-19 crisis, when Vučić said China was the only country that could help Serbia in the fight against the pandemic, initially dismissing the very notion of European solidarity. With ceremonial receptions organized for the arrival of medical aid from China, Chinese “mask diplomacy” gained a lot of traction in Serbia.\n\nWhile the assistance was initially presented as a donation, Serbian politicians later admitted that Serbia had also purchased medical equipment from China. Exactly how much equipment, and at what cost, has been designated a state secret. Nor has the government disclosed the details of its acquisition of several million vaccines from Pfizer/BioNtech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, and Sinopharm, except to say that Sinopharm was the largest provider. This opacity has received no pushback from the opposition or the international community. While the exact funding has not been disclosed, Beijing has been portrayed as the most ardent supporter of Serbia and its citizens in the immunization process, in a win for its “vaccine diplomacy” in the Western Balkans’s largest country.\n\nTarget audiences and populations\n\nChina’s influence has risen across Serbian society. Polls show all age groups, urban and rural and regardless of gender, hold a positive view of the country. That is largely thanks to the political relationship between China and Serbia, which has helped make China Serbia’s largest trading partner; the breadth of relations between China and Serbia, in health, economic development, media, culture, and elsewhere; and the power that the dominant Serbian Progressive Party holds in the political system.\n\nUntil recently, China has not been a target for political parties outside the ruling majority, mainly because the leaders of the opposition were in power when the initial China-Serbia agreements were signed. Still, some in the opposition have begun to call out the environmental toll on areas where Chinese companies operate, and local activists have begun to confront China over its labor and environmental practices. Chinese influence in Serbia is hard to counteract, given its backing by the Serbian government, but local activists, nongovernmental organizations, and now some parts of the opposition are trying.\n\nPhoto: A dumper truck travels along a trail in the open copper pit in the Serbian town of Bor, June 8, 2013. Credit: REUTERS/Marko Djurica\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past decade, Serbia has become a hub of Chinese influence in the Western Balkans, eager for economic cooperation via credit agreements for infrastructure projects and foreign direct investment. All the while, Serbia’s political elite, led by Vučić, have been cheerleaders for these deals. The Chinese have also used the COVID-19 pandemic to advance their interests in Serbia by distributing medical assistance and vaccines. While the rise of Chinese influence remains unchallenged by domestic political actors, it has faced resistance from some in the political opposition, as well as the environmental groups due to Chinese companies’ harmful practices in Serbia. Still, China remains one of the most popular partners for the Serbian government as well as a key partner for Serbian economic development.\n\nIn summation, China has significantly extended its presence in Slovenia over the last few years. However, while Beijing’s increased economic weight has brought more opportunities to exert political clout, its influence has been relatively modest. With a relatively small media and social media presence, Chinese actors have steered away from overtly aggressive diplomacy and have treaded softly. Chinese pressure usually becomes obvious only when Beijing pushes back on specific issues it sees as harmful to China’s national image and interests. The Chinese acquisition of Gorenje is increasingly seen as a success story, and Huawei has managed to capture the Slovenian market and to win the trust of key decision-makers. At the same time, fear of China’s economic retaliation has discouraged a more united political front in support of Taiwan. Yet, to the surprise of many, Chinese ambitions to invest in Slovenia’s strategic infrastructure have been watered down. Evidently, the Slovenian government has in general put political considerations over China’s economic appeal, which will in any event continue to serve as the main axis in Slovenia’s overall China policy orientation.",

Russia is not a country that can be underestimated.\"\n\nThe president also reiterated Ankara's balanced policy between Russia and Ukraine to help solve the crisis.\n\nThe Turkish policy of keeping lines of diplomacy open with Russia has also resulted in Türkiye hosting the highest-level meetings of officials from Moscow and Kyiv since the war begin.\n\nErdoğan was welcomed with an official ceremony in Serbia's capital Belgrade, on the second leg of his three-nation Balkan tour.\n\nThe two leaders held one-on-one talks and inter-delegation meetings, followed by a joint news conference.\n\nDuring the talks, all aspects of the bilateral relations were reviewed and steps to enhance cooperation in various areas were discussed.

Serbia won't allow a pan-European LGBTQ Pride event to take place in Belgrade next month, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Saturday, citing threats from right-wing extremists and fears of clashes. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Opposition parties in Serbia and international rights groups on Sunday denounced a decision by populist President Aleksandar Vucic to cancel next month’s pan-European LGBTQ EuroPride event because of what he said were threats from right-wing extremists.\n\nMost of the groups said that they would ignore the ban announced Saturday by Vucic and go ahead with the Sept. 12-18 events scheduled in the capital, Belgrade.\n\nVucic said that a political crisis with Serbia’s former breakaway province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, and economic problems facing the country amid Russia’s war in Ukraine were among the reasons why the Balkan nation’s authorities couldn’t handle EuroPride.\n\nThe U.N. office in Serbia said it was concerned about the announced ban, saying it would jeopardize “the right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by the Serbian Constitution.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The EuroPride is also an opportunity to celebrate the foundations of a strong and progressive society based on social equity, equality of all rights, solidarity, friendship and love,” U.N. Resident Coordinator in Serbia Francoise Jacob said.\n\nMembers of the European Pride Organizers Association chose Serbia’s capital three years ago to host the annual event, hoping it would represent a major breakthrough for a Slavic country that is traditionally conservative and under a strong influence from the Orthodox Church.\n\nSerbia is formally seeking European Union membership, but has for years been moving closer to Russia’s political orbit. The Balkan country has voted for U.N. resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but has refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow.\n\nIn a protest called before the cancellation of the pride event, thousands of right-wing church supporters marched through the Serbian capital Sunday evening in a procession they said was “to save Serbia.” They were led by the Serbian branch of the Night Wolves, the Russian biker group that is considered close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Civic Democratic Forum opposition party accused the Serbian president of “playing dictator” by modeling himself after Putin, and trying to ban the Belgrade pride event.\n\nCivic Democratic leader Zoran Vuletic said in a statement that the party wanted to remind Vucic “that he cannot cancel an event that he did not schedule and that he cannot, according to the constitution, prohibit the gathering of people.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVucic on Saturday announced the decision to cancel the EuroPride celebration during a news conference where he also proposed extending the term of Serbia’s prime minister, Ana Brnabic, who is a lesbian.\n\nBrnabic has been frequently accused by Serbia’s gay rights groups of doing nothing to help their status is Serbia during her first two terms in the government. She joined Vucic in supporting the cancellation of the EuroPride event.\n\n“No matter how you turn it, from any angle you look at it, the first inviolable thing is to ensure peace and stability in the country,” Brnabic said."
