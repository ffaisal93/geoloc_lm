    "Namibia on a budget": "Namibia, located on the southwest edge of southern Africa, is one of the continent's safest and most budget-friendly countries to visit.\n\nIf you want to stretch your money and get the most out of your vacation, there are cheap options so you don't sacrifice any of the magnificent sites and experiences the country has to offer.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nA trip to Africa is usually perceived as an expensive, once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but with proper planning and a willingness to rough it a bit, you can save on food, activities, accommodations, transportation and tours.\n\nHere are the top tips for creating an affordable Namibian adventure.\n\nFly to Johannesburg and take a bus to Namibia\n\nIf you’re traveling from the US, there are no direct flights to Namibia. Most itineraries have connections in Johannesburg, which has numerous flights arriving daily from around the world. The cheapest way to get to Namibia from Jo’burg is by bus and shuttle. A bus will take you to Gaborone, Botswana, where you can catch a shuttle to Windhoek, Namibia's capital. The cost is US$65 and will take about 20 hours. Along the way, you'll take in some pretty spectacular scenery while someone else does the driving.\n\nFlying into Windhoek takes only five hours, but the price is around $500. Travelers coming from Europe benefit from a nonstop route from Frankfurt.\n\nTravel during the low season\n\nDecember through April marks the wet season in Namibia. The crowds are gone, bringing down the cost of accommodations and tours. For example, a three-night stay at a game lodge in Etosha National Park will run about $1200 in July, but only $800 in January. Private and group game drives also see price reductions. Booking a group drive in the low season might even result in a private or semi-private experience.\n\nWhile it's not an ideal time of year for viewing throngs of big game, it's an excellent time for birding and seeing newborn animals. The landscape blanketed in wildflowers is also a gorgeous sight to see. Summer rains are typically isolated and brief, mainly occurring in the afternoon. Therefore, timing your excursions in the morning will allow you to relax and enjoy the welcome rain.\n\nRenting a 4WD and driving it yourself is cheaper than joining a tour © Westend61 / Getty Images\n\nSelf-drive your way around the country\n\nSelf-driving is a safe and economical alternative to a fully guided experience. A week-long scheduled group tour starts at around $1450. A 4WD vehicle outfitted for camping will cost $700 plus the cost of fuel.\n\nThe country is easy to navigate and clearly signposted. Though only about 25% of the roadways are tar, the dirt roads are well-kept and frankly more fun to drive on. Flat tires are the most common driver issue, so your vehicle will come with two spares. You'll want to make sure you know how to change one before your trip.\n\nStay at Namibia's vast network of campgrounds\n\nNamibia has no shortage of organized campsites throughout the country, which are clean and affordable with good amenities. Not only will you save a ton on lodging, but it's also an excellent opportunity to meet like-minded people and exchange stories and travel tips.\n\nThe average site costs $30 and has shared bathrooms, hot showers, as well as fire pits with grills at each spot. Some camps even have shops selling basic provisions like food, water and wood for your fire pit.\n\nNamibia has a good network of quality campsites © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nJoin a scheduled camping tour\n\nIt’s also possible to join a scheduled guided camping program. Companies that run these types of tours include C Africa Tours, African Overland Tours and Discovery Safari. Durations vary from three to 15 days, starting at around $450 per person. They typically include everything apart from drinks and water.\n\nThis is a great option for solo travelers and those interested in meeting others and sharing experiences. Because the logistics are taken care of and food and fuel are included, you won’t be hit with surprise costs.\n\nMix it up by staying in budget lodges and self-catering apartments\n\nBudget lodges are plentiful in Namibia. They're located all across the country and are clean, some with refreshing pools, starting at just $18 per night for a room with a shared bathroom. Self-catering apartments and homes average $60 per night for the entire place. These types of accommodations are great for spending a night or two between campsites. A nice hot shower and some air conditioning let you reset and get ready for the next leg of your adventure.\n\nStock up on groceries at the beginning of your trip\n\nNamibia's roads offer few opportunities to stop for a bite until you reach your destination, so it’s essential to shop for necessities like snacks and water before you head out. Some self-drive vehicles are equipped with a small refrigerator, allowing you to stock up and save on more than just the basics.\n\nIf you're camping or staying in an apartment, you'll have everything you need to prepare your own meal upon arrival instead of going to a restaurant in town, saving time and money.\n\nFees to enter national parks are just $7 per person per day © paula french / Shutterstock\n\nSpend your days in Namibia’s affordable national parks\n\nNamibia's national parks offer some of the world's greatest diversity: expansive sand dunes, vast deserts, plunging canyons, ancient salt pans and dramatic coastlines. Each of them is easily explored on foot or by vehicle. As of yet, Namibia doesn't offer a national park pass, but the fees are nominal. The government has added a small conservation fee to each park, bringing the total to a mere $7 per person per day.\n\nEmbark on Namibia's first shuttle service\n\nBorn out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global shortage of rental cars, the Gondwana Collection launched a shuttle service called Go2 Traveller Transfers. It stops at nine different areas of interest: the Kalahari, Fish River Canyon, Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Etosha and Damaraland. At each designated stop, lodges will arrange for pick-ups and returns. At $44 per leg, the service offers travelers a reliable, affordable, safe, and more environmentally friendly alternative to self-driving.\n\nThis new service could be a game changer for travel in Namibia. The drawback is that you'll need to stay in lodges and tented camps and pay for their excursions. But with the rising cost of fuel and the potential scarcity of rental cars, this option may be the more affordable one.\n\nDaily costs in Namibia",
    "The Namibia Investment Summit begins in New York": "Namibian President Hage G. Geingob will host the Namibia Investment Summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York\n\nNamibian President Hage G. Geingob will host the Namibia Investment Summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City today.\n\nInvestors interested in doing business with Namibia are invited to attend and participate in bilateral business and private sector-government meetings. The country is becoming a popular option for foreign direct investment (FDI), given its rich mineral resource supply and high political will to increase agricultural productivity. The Namibian energy sector is also booming with high-profile green hydrogen projects and a major off-shore oil reserve discovery this year.\n\nIn the wake of the Ukraine war and global supply chain shortages in wheat and oil, Namibia is becoming a valuable asset in the pursuit of international economic recovery via subsidization of global agriculture and energy production. Higher petroleum prices as a result of the Russia invasion have pushed oil-dependent states to consider fuel-alternatives such as green hydrogen. Foreign interest in clean energy is expected to increase FDI in Namibia by roughly thirty percent from $394.1 million USD recorded in 2021.\n\nAs Namibia supplies goods in high demand internationally, the Summit will allow trade partners like China, Russia, and European Union countries to stake further claim in the Southern Africa markets.",
    "Things to know before going to Namibia": "Namibia is a vast and mostly unpopulated country, full of otherworldly desert landscapes and wildlife that has adapted to some of the harshest conditions on the planet. Because Namibia is safe and largely free of malaria, it’s a great destination for families and adventurers.\n\nOn my most recent visit to Namibia, my husband and I spent two weeks exploring by car and plane from Windhoek to Sossusvlei, and then from Swakopmund we drove down to Walvis Bay, meeting locals eager to share information about their country along the way.\n\nSqueeze every moment out of your next vacation with tips and tricks from Lonely Planet in our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nSome of the worst travel stories I heard while there involved theft from open taxi windows and credit card fraud. I know now that hailing a random taxi in the streets of Windhoek is not always a great idea, and while you might think that taxi drivers know the way to your destination, that may not always be the case. We once gave the address of a not-so-touristy local shop and were dropped off in the wrong place, only realizing the error after we paid and got out of the taxi.\n\nI also learned about credit card cloning, where thieves make a digital copy of your credit card info using a disguised electronic scanner or some other device. Keep your eyes on your card at all times, ask vendors to bring the card reader to you instead of them taking your card and doing the transaction out of sight.\n\nHere are the nine most important things to know when planning a trip to Namibia.\n\nOff-road driving skills are useful on unpaved roads in Namibia © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nA self-driving tour of Namibia is a doable adventure\n\nTraveling by car in Namibia is safe though time consuming if you want to explore large portions of the country. Paved roads, like the Trans-Caprivi and Trans-Kalahari highways, are well maintained and link the most-visited corners of the country. If you’ve got the time, a self-drive safari is an affordable way to experience Namibia.\n\nManeuvering on unpaved roads comes with its own set of risks. On gravel roads, flying pebbles while passing other cars can cause damage to windshields, and driving on uneven terrain requires a sturdy 4WD vehicle as well as off-road driving skills. Driving with headlights on is a must at all times of the day. Avoid driving at night because of roaming animals.\n\nIn remote corners of the country, gas stations are few and far between, so keep an eye on the gas tank and fuel up every chance you get. Always travel with snacks and plenty of water.\n\nTo avoid credit card fraud or cloning, rent your car online through a major rental company, such as Avis, Budget, Triple Three Car Hire or Imperial, which operate across Namibia and at the international airport.\n\nNamibia doesn’t require a tourist visa\n\nYou don’t need a visa to enter Namibia if you’re a tourist and staying for fewer than 90 days. Check your passport to make sure it is valid for at least six months beyond the intended stay in the country and that it has sufficient blank pages for entry and exit stamps.\n\nMalaria is a risk depending on where in the country you visit © Anastasiia Shavshyna / Getty Images\n\nCheck your vaccines\n\nThere’s no risk of yellow fever in Namibia, but if traveling there from a country with risk of yellow fever transmission or transiting for more than 12 hours through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission, travelers are required to have a yellow fever vaccination certificate.\n\nOther recommended vaccines for traveling to Namibia include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, typhoid, and rabies. Confirm that your routine vaccines and boosters, such as MMR, chickenpox, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, shingles and polio are up to date.\n\nBring malaria medication to Namibia’s north in the wet season\n\nMalaria is a risk when visiting the north and northeast regions of Namibia during the wet season (November to June). You might need to start taking malaria medication several days before your trip, depending on the medicine your doctor prescribes. Check with your doctor about suitable anti-malarial tablets before visiting Namibia. There’s low to no risk of contracting malaria in the rest of the country, including the iconic Skeleton Coast.\n\nView wildlife from a safe distance\n\nWildlife is, well, wild and unpredictable. If you’re on a safari tour, your guide will give you instructions and protocols to follow. If you opt for a self-drive safari, follow the park’s rules, most of which advise you to drive a safe distance from wildlife and to remain in your car unless you are in a designated area and it is safe to get out and walk.\n\nDon’t drive between elephants in a herd, particularly if you see females with their young. If an animal seems disturbed or agitated, slowly back off.\n\nStay vigilant of your belongings when visiting Namibia’s cities\n\nNamibia is a stable country, but to stay safe during your visit, you should be aware of your surroundings. Keep an eye on your possessions, particularly when exploring Windhoek and other town centers where pickpockets can target foreign tourists. Beware of scams, such as someone trying to divert your attention while an accomplice snatches your bag or phone.\n\nIt’s best not to bring expensive jewelry or watches to Namibia. Whenever possible, leave valuables in the hotel safe. Keep cameras, phones and large amounts of cash out of sight when moving around in public. Avoid changing large amounts of money in busy public areas, and if you’re paying by credit card, try to keep your card in full view to avoid the risk of cloning. To do so, insist that the card reader is placed in front of you.\n\nIf you’re renting a car, keep car doors locked and windows shut while waiting in traffic. Keep valuables out of sight during the day and never leave anything in the car when parking overnight.\n\nTaxis are cheap, but know what you’re getting into\n\nIf you don’t have a rental car, taxis are a cheap and convenient way to get around in cities like Windhoek, Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. To operate legally, taxis must have a government registration. But that doesn’t stop anyone with a car from driving a “pirate taxi” in search of a fare. Sometimes these pirate taxis pick up more passengers during your ride. Ask your accommodations or tour operator to call a taxi for you or to recommend a reputable taxi company.\n\nBefore getting in the taxi, know your destination or ask the driver if they know how to get there, and always negotiate the fare in advance. Taxis don’t take credit cards, so make sure you have exact change because often drivers can’t break big bills and will require you to stop somewhere to get change. While riding in the cab, never place your bag or other belongings on the seat next to an open window; at a stop light someone in the street could reach in and snatch it.\n\nEven in winter, temperatures are still high in Namibia © Anastasiia Shavshyna / Getty Images\n\nBe prepared for the heat, but don’t forget there’s a rainy season too\n\nNamibia boasts on average 300 days of sunshine per year, with high temperatures no matter the season. Expect summer temperatures to reach 40°C (104°F), while winter temperatures hover around 25°C (77°F).\n\nThe coastal area, where the Namib Desert is located, is the driest region, as is the Kalahari Desert in the south. The air is humid and can get quite foggy along the coast, particularly in the early hours of the day. The northeast is the rainiest area of the country, with an average of 50 to 60cm (20 to 23.5 inches) of rainfall per year. The peak of the rainy season is from January to March.\n\nDress in earth tones\n\nKeep your wardrobe for Namibia simple and practical. If you’re going on safari, muted earth colors such as beige, khaki and olive green are best because they blend into the environment. During a safari, particularly a walking one, avoid wearing bright or colorful clothing and perfume. Long sleeves protect you not only from the sun but also from mosquitoes and other insects. Shorts, T-shirts, comfortable pants and long skirts are a good bet for when you’re in town.\n\nPack a light jacket or sweater for early morning and evening outings, and a lightweight waterproof jacket in case of rain. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, as are hats and sunglasses. Don’t forget sunscreen, swimwear, lip balm and moisturizer.",

    "Skating breaks societal prejudice, empowers young people in Namibia’s capital": "People visit a site in Namibia's capital Windhoek on Sept. 27, 2020, the World Tourism Day. (Photo by Ndalimpinga Iita/Xinhua)\n\nSkating is empowering children living with disabilities to realize their full potential as well as improve inclusion while helping to reduce stigma and increase self-confidence in adolescents living in Namibia's capital Windhoek.Through Skate Aid, an international nonprofit making organization, young boys and girls from the Namibia Institute of Special Education are breaking societal prejudice and transforming community attitudes, shifting negative perceptions against persons with disabilities.For Thomas, a learner, growing up with a disability has been very challenging but skating has given him confidence and value. He no longer feels inferior and discriminated against.\"When we are skating, it does not matter if you are blind, deaf, rich or poor, black or white, we are all just the same. We speak the same language and follow the same rules on the court. I am happy to be a part of this team,\" he said.The 12-year-old says skating has not only changed his life but it has given him a purpose where he is excited about his future which he hopes will include the sport.\"Skating is a beautiful thing, when I see all these kids, we practice together and every time we teach each other and for those that do not understand they are learning sign language just so that we can communicate,\" he said.\"I am happy,\" he added.Thomas has been a part of the skaters since a skate park was built inside the Namibia Institute of Special Education in 2018 and he is at the park almost every day except on weekends when he rests.The Namibia Institute of Special Education consists of three schools, including the school for the visually impaired, the school for the hearing impaired, and the school for the cognitive impaired.Children from these three schools make use of the park, which is also open to the public.Through the skate park, these children have managed to find acceptance. Love and hope make them strive to be the best in their everyday life and possibly change their circumstances of being overlooked and not always prioritized.Sixteen-year-old Kamaya has not only learned how to skate, but he has also learned sign language which he says is a bonus because now he is able to communicate with his fellow teammates.\"When I first started skating, I struggled to communicate because I did not know any sign language but I made it a point to learn, and now I can greet. I would like to say that I know the basics. It is a good thing because I do not just skate with my teammates, now we can talk stories,\" he said.Kamaya is now a pro skater and can do different tricks which he is now trying to teach the younger less skilled teammates.According to Michael Kagola, a skate aid volunteer and coach, the skaters consist of a variety of age groups ranging from 8 to 19 who are not only from the Namibia Institute of Special Education but also from the surrounding communities.Karola, who is a teacher by profession, believes that skateboarding is helping mold these children into better individuals and also teaching them the values of teamwork while allowing children to understand that their talent and abilities can be developed through effort and consistency.\"We work with children from all walks of life including the hearing, visual and cognitive impaired,\" Kagola said.\"We want to empower and instill values in them which will better their lives. Skateboarding will teach them that you always get up when you fall. Just like when you are learning a trick, you fall but always get up. It will teach them how to overcome failure.\"The children are facing tough situations where most of them come from impoverished backgrounds, Kagola said.\"We want to empower kids, get them off the street and deter them from roaming around, we want them to use their free time doing something productive instead of having them engage in bad behavior.\"\"It is funny how a piece of concrete and some skateboards can change people's lives and build confidence and drive,\" Kagola said.Although skating is not yet recognized as a professional sport in Namibia, these children already feel like winners as they practice and perfect their skills.\"We hope that one day the sport will be recognized professionally but for now we will just use it the best way we can, that is to give these kids a skating board and empower them,\" Kagola said.Xinhua",
    "Namibia genocide: Opposition demands new deal with Germany": "\"For a long time, we thought the Greens were our friends,\" said Nandiuasora Mazeingo, chairperson of the Ovaherero Genocide Foundation (OGF), shrugging his shoulders at news from Germany that the Berlin government sees no need to renegotiate the Joint Declaration with Namibia.\n\nThe deal was thought to have brought an end to years of negotiations to recognize the genocide of Herero and Nama people during the German colonial period in what is now Namibia.\n\nHowever, the agreement led to heated debates in the Namibian parliament in September 2021.\n\n\"It seems like this issue in Germany is only about gaining political power,\" Mazeingo said in an interview with DW. \"But we will outlast these governments because we are on the right side of history!\"\n\nStill, the leader of the official opposition in Namibia, McHenry Venaani, has hope in the environmentalist Green Party, part of the Germany's governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) .\n\nStreet Debate: The price of the genocide in Namibia\n\nThe president of the country's largest opposition party, Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), has written an open letter to German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a member of the Greens, which DW has obtained. In it, he called for the agreement to be \"renegotiated\" and \"restructured.\"\n\n\"Frau Baerbock had shown credibility while she was a candidate,\" Venaani told DW. \"Now we have to see if she brings the same understanding as a minister.\"\n\nBotswana and South Africa should join negotiations\n\nVenaani is particularly concerned about the diaspora communities.\n\n\"There are descendants of genocide victims living in Botswana and South Africa — and they are left to fend for themselves,\" he said.\n\nHe wants their representatives to be included in the renegotiation process, but told DW that the German government could perhaps begin talks with the government of Botswana.\n\nMcHenry Venaani has called for the agreement to be 'renegotiated' and 'restructured'\n\nVenaani's statements have been met with mixed feelings in Namibia. OGF chairperson Mazeingo rejected the politician's call for more government participation.\n\nWhile agreeing with the demand to include the Herero and Nama in the diaspora, he criticized a possible participation of more governments as a \"perpetuation of the exclusion.\"\n\nHe refered to the fact that the Ovaherero Traditional Authority (OTA) and the Nama Traditional Leaders Association (NTLA) — which see themselves as the official representatives of the diaspora communities — were not part of the negotiations between Germany and Namibia.\n\nHowever, Ileni Henguva, a traditional councillor for the Ovambanderu, said that the affected communities had actually been considered in the original negotiations with the German government, therefore he sees no need for further talks.\n\nThe German Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the demands when contacted by DW. As a matter of principal, Berlin does not respond to open letters, a spokesperson told DW.\n\n\"We respect the difficult decision making process and the discussions within the Namibian society and politics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDemonstrators call attention to the genocide in Windhoek, Namibia in May 2021\n\n'We will shame them'\n\nThe ministry also referred to discussions about the implementation of the joint declaration that took place in March 2022 between Namibian and German delegations in Windhoek.\n\nUltimately, renegotiating how the terms of the deal would be implemented seemed like a possibility, though this might not appease the critics in Namibia, where the OTA is demanding a completely fresh start to talks.\n\n\"We are not going to sign a sham agreement that makes Germany look good on the international stage,\" OTA representative Mazeingo emphasized to DW.\n\nHerero people were driven off their lands by German settlers, and when captured were sent to concentration camps\n\nWording in dispute\n\nHe demanded an admission of guilt by the German government. In the eyes of the OTA, the biggest stumbling block lies within the wording of the Joint Declaration, which calls the atrocities committed between 1904-1908 a genocide \"from today's perspective.\"\n\nOpposition leader McHenry Venaani also wants a clear, legal recognition of the genocide. In his open letter to Baerbock, he wrote that the atrocities \"cannot only be recognised in a moral and political sense.\"\n\nIn his interview with DW, he referenced reparations again, describing the aid deal — worth €1.1 billion ($1.34 billion) to be paid out over 30 years under the Joint Declaration — as an insult.\n\n\"It's not about extracting the largest possible sum. We are only asking for a package that will sustainably improve the socio-economic conditions of the affected communities,\" Venaani said.\n\nThe PDM party leader argued that even the Namibian government has come to understand that the people of Namibia are not ready to accept this agreement.\n\nThis also applies to a possible apology by the German government. A \"half-baked apology\" would only lead to boos in the Namibian parliament, he said. OGF chairperson Mazeingo shared these sentiments.\n\n\"We are going to organize protests. We would make sure that whoever comes here to offer an apology is shamed, shamed to know that it is the biggest mistake that they have done to come to the people whom they have brutalized and to come here and pretend to offer an apology that is not genuine, \" he told DW.\n\nModern-day slavery Illegal workforce Despite the fact that slavery is prohibited worldwide, modern forms of the sinister practice persist. More than 40 million people still toil in debt bondage in Asia, forced labor in the Gulf states, or as child workers in agriculture in Africa or Latin America.\n\nModern-day slavery Sold, threatened, exploited Human trafficking is big business, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Sectors such as construction or mining exploit almost exclusively men, while victims of forced prostitution and exploitation in private households tend to be women. But something they all have in common: they are coerced into working through threats, the use of violence, or fraud. Most cases go unreported.\n\nModern-day slavery When children are enslaved Because of poverty parents may sell their children as labor. That's often the case in Lake Volta, Ghana, where children are forced to work for fishermen. Parents are told their children will get to do an apprenticeship. But in reality, they're kept as slaves in appalling conditions. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) there are around 10 million child slaves worldwide.\n\nModern-day slavery Child brides One in five girls is wed before she turns 18, according to the UN Children's Fund UNICEF. Not all of these marriages are forced arrangements. But every year millions of underage girls are forced into marriage before the age of 15. In many cases they're taken out of school and essentially live as unpaid laborers in their spouse's home. Many report physical and sexual abuse in the marriage.\n\nModern-day slavery Locked up All over the world, girls are exploited as house slaves — by their own family or by strangers. Poverty-stricken families may be promised that their children will get the chance to go to school. But once they're taken, these girls are locked inside the house and forced to work 12-14 hours a day. Many also suffer sexual abuse. The number of unreported cases is high — even in industrialized nations.\n\nModern-day slavery Millions held in debt bondage Under this form of slavery, victims are forced to work to pay off a debt. Often the debts continue to pile up, even if the whole family toils for 10 hours a day at the brickworks, or in their owner's quarries, fields or mines. Often the debts are also inherited by children. The ILO estimates there are around 30 million people working as debt slaves, most of them in India and Pakistan.\n\nModern-day slavery Nowhere to turn Illegal migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation, regardless of where in the world they are. They often have nowhere to claim rights, usually cannot speak the local language, and don't know where they can turn for help. It's not clear how many illegal migrants work in agriculture in Europe alone. But many live in abysmal conditions as they slave away for well below the minimum wage.\n\nModern-day slavery Born into slavery The descendants of African slaves in Mauritania are called \"Haratin.\" Although slavery is officially banned in the northwestern African country, people are still inherited or sold as property there. An estimated 600,000 women, men and children in Mauritania are currently exploited as domestic workers or in the agriculture sector. That's one-fifth of the population.

    "Namibia Discovers Oil While Pursuing Green Energy": "The first \"green hydrogen\" power plant being built in Africa is expected to begin producing electricity in Namibia in 2024, an official from France-based HDF Energy told Reuters news agency this week.\n\nThat presents something of a dilemma for Namibia, which is championing the clean energy but also said this month that huge oil deposits had been discovered off its coast after many failed attempts at drilling.\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy — like wind and sun, both of which Namibia has in abundance — to power the electrolysis of water. A plant producing green hydrogen, a clean power source that can potentially be used for industry and electric vehicles, is due to open in less than two years.\n\nBut at the same time, oil companies Shell and Total recently discovered the oil deposits, estimated to amount to more than 1 billion barrels, about 290 kilometers off the Namibian coast.\n\nHerbert Jauch, the head of a local nonprofit, the Economic and Social Justice Trust, wants Namibia to forsake oil drilling and focus on green hydrogen, a much-touted energy source of the future.\n\nHowever, Jauch said, it's \"tricky\" for Namibia to give up possible oil revenues when advanced nations are still making heavy use of fossil fuels, even as carbon admissions cause global warming.\n\n“The oil discovery coincides with what needs to be the end of fossil fuels, and therefore it is quite tricky for Namibia to move into that direction, to go into large-scale oil exploration,\" he said, noting the potential for ecological danger in drilling and the effects of climate change in many countries. By accenting solar energy and green hydrogen, \"Namibia could become a front-runner in renewable energy.\"\n\nMaggy Shino, the petrol commissioner at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, cautioned that there was still a long way to go before Namibia could become an oil-producing nation.\n\n“We need to understand that for us as explorers, we have a very long journey ahead of us before we can be able to change the narrative to say that we are an oil-producing nation,\" Shine said. \"We are oil finders, we have oil accumulation, but we are not yet an oil-producing nation. For us to get to that stage, a lot of work still needs to be done.”\n\nMinister of Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo said even if Namibia did begin to produce oil, it would have competition from other African countries, and citizens should not expect a financial windfall from oil revenue.\n\n“We just came from an oil and gas conference that was held in Senegal,\" he said. \"Senegal has discovered a lot of oil; so has Ghana; Uganda has oil, although they have not produced yet. So has Equatorial Guinea, so has Angola, so has Nigeria.\"",
    "Jane Katjavivi obituary": "My friend Jane Katjavivi, who has died aged 69 after a short bout of ill-health, dedicated her life to Namibia. She and I first met in the 1970s when we were both working in the London office of the South West Africa People’s Organisation (Swapo), the liberation movement fighting to end South Africa’s illegal occupation of South West Africa.\n\nSwapo later formed the government of independent Namibia. After moving to the country at independence, Jane forged a unique role for herself. Six months after she arrived she started the first Namibian publishing house – New Namibia Books.\n\nJane was born in Leeds, one of four children of John Coles, a paper merchant, and his wife, Rosina (nee Pocock). She grew up in a family whose strong Christian ethics influenced her for the rest of her life.\n\nOn leaving Leeds girls’ high school, she began undergraduate studies in English literature at the University of Sussex, in the School of African and Asian Studies, later completing a master’s degree in African studies at Birmingham University. These studies, and a year as scholarship officer for the World University Service, an NGO that campaigned for racial and social justice, set her on her course.\n\nIn 1976 Jane went to work as information officer in Swapo’s small London office with Peter Katjavivi, its representative in UK and Europe. Work was intense with many crises at the height of the liberation struggle. Along the way, Jane and Peter fell in love, and in 1980 they moved to Oxford for Peter’s doctorate. They married in 1981 and a few years later their son Perivi was born.\n\nPeter’s university appointments took their family to Finland and the US, where their daughter, Isabel, was born, before they moved to Namibia for independence elections in 1989.\n\nJane’s publishing house successfully championed Namibian and African authors, especially giving a voice to women. Though publishers elsewhere warned her the market in Namibia was too small, Jane’s bestsellers included Last Steps to Uhuru by David Lush (1993) and The Price of Freedom by Ellen Ndeshi Namhila (1997). In 1994 she opened the busy New Namibia Bookshop in Windhoek.\n\nA member of the Communist party in her youth, Jane nonetheless moved seamlessly into new roles, as Peter became an MP, the founding chancellor of the University of Namibia, an ambassador, and the speaker of the National Assembly. As with everything, Jane performed with dedication and panache.\n\nThe irony of the anti-colonial campaigner becoming wife of an ambassador in Brussels and Berlin, at the heart of colonial Europe, was not lost on her. As a radical young woman in London, she had probably imagined a different kind of life – but she never lost her core political values.\n\nIn 2008, returning from Europe, Jane founded the University of Namibia’s publishing arm – an important and lasting legacy. She never stopped making things happen to help build the new Namibia. She combined this successfully with being a wife, mother and grandmother.\n\nShe is survived by Peter, their children, and her siblings, Sarah, John and Helen.",
    "Namibia, Botswana have agreed to stop border killings – Kapofi": "DEFENCE minister Frans Kapofi said Namibia and Botswana have agreed to abolish instances of citizens of the two countries being killed by their defence forces.\n\nHe said the agreement was made when officials from the two countries held a meeting at Swakopmund last year.\n\nKapofi was speaking during a meeting with traditional leaders at Eenhana recently.\n\nHe said he informed traditional leaders in the Zambezi region about this.\n\n“We have heard of our people killed by the Botswana Defence Force while crossing into Botswana. We were discussing those aspects and I assured them that we are engaging our counterparts in Botswana. That aspect of people being killed should not be repeated,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said the government has put policies in place for Namibians found within the borders or territory of Botswana, or Botswana nationals found poaching in Namibia.\n\nThose transgressing the law will be arrested, charged and taken to court, he said.\n\nKapofi said earlier this month, the Namibian chief of defence, air marshal Martin Pinehas engaged his counterpart in Botswana on issues relating to bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.\n\n“We decided when we met them at Swakopmund last year that we must put up structures that safeguard the safety of our people along our borders, and that the killing of our people, be it in Namibia or Botswana must stop forthwith,” he said.\n\nOver the past two decades, about 35 Namibians have been killed in Botswana anti-poaching operations, such as the three brothers Tommy Nchindo, Wamunyima Nchindo and Martin Nchindo and their Zambian cousin Sinvula Munyeme.\n\nThe four were killed in November 2020, along the Chobe River in the Zambezi region.\n\nAt the time, Botswana claimed they were part of a syndicate of poachers believed to be part of a network responsible for cross-border poaching. However, the Nchindo family denied those claims.\n\nNamibian Lives Matter representative Charles Siyauya yesterday told The Namibian despite Kapofi's pronouncement, there would likely be little action from the Namibian government.\n\n“It's an old song. There is no protection from the government of Namibia. God is the only protector of the lives of Namibians in the Zambezi region.\n\n“It is one of those unchecked political statements by honourable Kapofi, who is too arrogant, and lacks sympathy with the people he was supposed to protect from external threats posed by the government of Botswana, which is thirsty and is craving Namibian blood,” he said.\n\nILLEGAL FENCING IN ANGOLA\n\nKapofi also asked traditional leaders to inform residents grazing in Angola to stop fencing off grazing areas.\n\nHe said some Namibians have put up homesteads and declared themselves headmen in Angola, without the permission of the Angolan authorities.\n\n“Now people are angry,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said all Namibian citizens grazing in Angola should be known, and they should not violate Angolan laws.\n\n“Angola is a friendly country but if we push them, they will just close the borders and if they close the borders, what do we do? Please, let's try and respect the sovereignty of that country,” Kapofi said.",
    "Namibian Marula Oil makes it to America": "Taneta Investment is a women-owned, Namibian small business established in 2015 that has created a niche as a pioneer in the production and transformation of local Marula oil into luxurious cosmetic oil. Taneta partners with local rural women to obtain kernels of the Marula fruit and combines traditional knowledge with modern technology to cold-press the seeds into valuable Marula oil.\n\nMarula oil is rich in vitamin C, E and other antioxidants that revitalize, nourish and protect skin against premature aging. Its light texture allows for easy absorption to keep skin moist and luminous, while Marula oil-based hair products prevent hair from becoming dry and brittle.\n\nThe company is dedicated to engaging women and ensuring sustainability and safety while producing the best quality Marula oil for their clients. The global organic cosmetics market is growing and there are new export opportunities for Namibian based companies like Taneta that successfully obtained organic certification with the support from the Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub (SATIH), a project funded by the U.S. Government through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nIn 2020, Taneta Investment purchased Marula kernels from 60 rural women, a number that increased to 200 a year later. As part of the organic certification process, these women have been trained on sustainable harvesting processes. The women raise their incomes and living standards by selling Marula kernels to Taneta.\n\nThe USAID TradeHub also linked Taneta to South Africa-based trade promotion and marketing agencies, culminating in a deal with a South African natural and organic retail and skincare company for the supply of Marula oil products. Taneta created four ranges of Marula oil for various applications such as beard oil, baby oil, face oil and hair oil. The company is gradually increasing sales both locally and internationally with recent orders from European countries like Germany and Spain, and a shipment of samples to a U.S.-based buyer in July 2022.\n\nTaneta’s growing success on South African and global markets is a testimony to the company’s philosophy which aims at sustaining the ancient ways of processing Marula and other fruits. The new kids on the block of Namibian cosmetics producers are keen to protect such traditions while simultaneously improving the livelihoods of the country’s rural women who constitute their supply chain. In Namibia, Taneta’s Marula oil products are available in selected retail stores, the Namibia Craft Center, and the duty-free shop at Windhoek’s Hosea Kutako International Airport.",
    "Namibia's Hammerslaght eyes Mrs Universe crown": "NAMIBIAN beauty pageant contestant Ansua Hammerslaght recently announced that she would participate in the Mrs Universe competition taking place in South Korea in December.\n\nMrs Universe is an annual international event that honours women, which was first hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2007. The event is open to married, divorced and widowed women from all over the world, who are between 18 and 55 years of age, have a family and career, and are involved in a \"significant cause”. The pageant is set for 1-3 December.\n\nThe 35-year-old Hammerslaght is the second of four siblings. She says she grew up in a poor background, and that has taught her to work hard. She says she strives to help those in need because she knows what it feels like not to have anything.\n\nShe devotes her life to charity, community work, inspirational speeches and advising young women, mothers and girls.\n\nShe is a mother of two and has no educational background, but that never stopped her from doing what she wanted and loved, she says.\n\nHammerslaght is thrilled by the opportunity to participate in the pageant, saying she was supposed to compete in 2016, but fell sick and could not attend.\n\n“I entered the competition because we all have dreams and what we want to achieve in life. I hope by going after what I want, I will inspire others. That little hope the youth can get from me is an achievement to me. I might not change the world, but just having a positive impact on someone's life and my life is a step in the right direction,” she says.\n\nThis year the pageant's theme focuses on gender-based violence (GBV) and Hammerslaght wants to create awareness of how this affects Namibia to the world.\n\n“The fact that it's focused on GBV allows me to create awareness that this is happening in our country every day. I'm looking forward to changing, learning, developing and building international relations since all contestants have a common cause in their respective countries,” she says.\n\nHammerslaght says she enters pageants because she hopes to uplift and uphold her country's name and promote its culture.\n\nShe is passionate about participating in beauty pageants because she wants other women to know that having a child is not the end of the world.\n\n“I'm passionate about beauty pageants because I'm using the platform to inspire others. If through the inspiration I can contribute to a bit of change, I will do it,” she says.\n\nShe admits that preparations for pageants are always challenging for her and that the toughest is getting mentally and emotionally prepared.\n\n“God has always been my mentor and I always go to him first with whatever I need and want. It's always important for a contestant to prepare oneself for the outcome because everything is unpredictable,” she says.\n\nHammerslaght says if she brings home the crown, she wants to be a voice for the voiceless and to speak and fight for Namibian women. She says it is time women unite and regain their dignity, respect, and pride.\n\n“Have we forgotten our humanity that we turn our backs on each other? In today's world, it is hard out there. I'm speaking from experience. We tend to judge and criticise. I think it's time we realise how we look at one another. We need to support and help one another. We need to help fix one another's crowns,” she said.",
    "Namibia complete full haul in PNG": "NAMIBIA beat Papua New Guinea by 61 runs in their final Cricket World Cup League 2 match in Port Moresby yesterday to complete a highly successful tour.\n\nThe Richelieu Eagles won all four their matches in PNG, beating the home side twice and the USA twice, and their haul of a maximum eight points has seen them closing in on the leaders on the log.\n\nThey remain fifth, but with several matches in hand on the leaders they can move further up, especially with two home series coming up in November and December.\n\nThey will once again host PNG and USA in Windhoek from 17 to 26 November, while they will host Scotland and Nepal from 30 November to 9 December.\n\nYesterday, captain Gerhard Erasmus played a starring role with both bat and ball in Namibia's victory.\n\nAfter electing to bat, Namibia lost Divan La Cock early on for one, but Lohan Louwrens and Stephan Baard revived the innings with a 34-run partnership.\n\nThe momentum, however, swung PNG's way as they struck with three wickets in quick succession (Louwrens 34, Michael van Lingen 0, Baard 13), leaving Namibia struggling at 4/59 after 17 overs.\n\nErasmus and Nicol-Loftie Eaton launched a fine revival, putting on 60 runs for the fifth wicket, before the latter was dismissed for 35.\n\nErasmus was eventually run out for 49, while Zane Green added 31 not out further down the order, as Namibia recovered to reach a competitive 214/8 off their 50 overs.\n\nIn PNG's innings, Ruben Trumpelmann gave Namibia a great start when he dismissed Tony Ura for a second-ball duck, but Lega Siaka and Charles Amini revived PNG's hopes with a 47-run partnership, before Jan Frylinck got the breakthrough, dismissing Amini for 22.\n\nSiaka went on to score 38 before being dismissed by Bernard Scholtz, while Hiri Hiri added 29, but Namibia's bowlers kept up the pressure with regular wickets to dismiss the whole team for 153 off 43,1 overs.\n\nErasmus was Namibia's best bowler, taking three wickets for 31 runs off 10 overs, while Trumpelmann took 2/22, Frylinck 2/37 and Tangeni Lungameni 2/23.\n\nNamibia coach Pierre de Bruyn said it was a great performance in difficult conditions.\n\n“It was a fantastic tour - it was probably one of the hardest tours that I have experienced as a coach and to see how the guys fought was incredible. Until the last wicket today, it was just unbelievable and it just proves how strong our culture is and how much it means to these players,” he said.\n\n“We won eight valuable points on the Cricket World League 2 log, and to get eight points away from home in this environment is amazing,” he added.\n\nThe team now returns to Namibia for a few days before they fly out to Australia to start preparing for next month's T20 World Cup.\n\n“We will have three or four days at home and then its back to Australia for our World Cup preparations that start in Melbourne on the 29th of September, so we are trying to manage a couple of niggles and some mentally fatigued players, but we are just grateful for such a successful tour,” he said.\n\n“We now have to reset for the T20 World Cup. We are in a group where we can beat the Netherlands and we can beat the UAE - that's our aim, and we are also taking a lot of momentum with us into the World Cup, especially after this tour,” he added.",
    "Madison Metals Provides Update on Namibia Uranium Licences": "TORONTO, Sept. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madison Metals Inc. (“Madison” or the “Company”) (CSE: GREN) (OTC: MMTLF) is pleased to provide an update to the binding letter of intent (\"LOI\") with Otjiwa Mining and Prospecting CC (“Otjiwa”) pursuant to which Madison would acquire an 85% interest in Exclusive Prospecting Licences 8531 (“EPL-8531”) and 8115 (“EPL-8115”) (the “Transaction”). EPL-8531 and EPL-8115 are located in the renowned Erongo Uranium Province of Namibia, Africa, where Madison already holds rights to Exclusive Prospecting License 7011 (“EPL-7011”) and has an agreement to acquire a 24% direct interest in Mining Licence 121 (“ML121”) (Figure 1). Through the Transaction, Madison is looking to consolidate ownership of land holdings in the uranium province with the goal to build upon minable uranium resources by expanding currently known uranium zones and making new discoveries. Namibia is the world’s second-highest uranium-producing country and holds the fifth-largest total uranium resources in the world.\n\nOtjiwa currently holds an “intention to grant” letter from Namibia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy (“MME”) for EPL-8531 and EPL-8115. The approval and granting of the licences are subject to an Environmental Clearance Certificate (“ECC”). The Environmental Impact Assessment scoping study and Environmental Management Plan Report to obtain an ECC have already been submitted to the relevant authorities and is expecting a response shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Location of Madison North (EPL-7011 and EPL-8531), Madison West (EPL-8115 and ML121), and uranium-producing mines in Namibia’s Erongo Uranium Province.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that it is consolidating its various land holdings as a result of the continued expansion in the uranium province combined with the high likelihood of common infrastructure. Madison has designated that EPL-7011 and EPL-8531 (previously Rössing North) will be consolidated under the property name Madison North. Additionally, EPL-8115 and ML121 (previously Rössing West) will be consolidated under the property name Madison West.\n\nEPL-8531\n\nEPL-8531 is located 50 km northeast of the city of Swakopmund and surrounds the Arandis townlands. The Rössing Mine lies approximately 50 km east of the property. The geology is made up of Damaran Super Group lithologies wrapped around units of the older Abbabis Metamorphic Complex. The overall lithological trend is north-northeast, as is common within the Welwitschia magnetic lineament deformation corridor. Structurally, the area is characterized by numerous faults, synforms and antiforms (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Geological and structural setting of EPL-8531.\n\nPrevious operators identified eleven prospective targets for further exploration, five of which fall within EPL-8531 (Figure 3). In 2015, drilling over two of the targets totalled 3,720 metres of reverse circulation (RC) drilling from 50 drill holes. Based on this drilling, SRK Consulting (UK) Limited (“SRK”) prepared an initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the intersected uranium mineralization, in accordance with the disclosure standards of JORC. The estimate, dated November 2015, was entitled “MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE, EPLS3524 AND 3624, NAMIBIA.”\n\nSRK derived an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 15.6 Mt grading at 260 ppm U 3 O 8 for a contained metal total of 9.0 Mlbs U 3 O 8 . Madison’s attributable ownership of the resource will amount to 7.65 million pounds (Mlbs) U 3 O 8 .\n\nThe SRK estimate is considered to be a “historical estimate” under National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). It is not considered by the Company to be current and the Company is not treating it as such. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. Madison would need to review and verify the previous drill-hole data and conduct an exploration program to verify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Airborne radiometric signature and targets (blue outline) over EPL-8531. The white dots represent drillholes over the two different targets.\n\nEPL-8115\n\nEPL-8115 is located 42 km east of the city of Swakopmund and spans an area of approximately 61 km2. The property is located 18 km southwest of the Rössing Uranium Mine – the world’s longest-running open-pit uranium mine – and 12 km west of the Husab Mine (Figure 1). Other properties in the vicinity that have NI 43-101-compliant resources include the Etango project to the southwest and Ida Dome to the southeast.\n\nEPL-8115 is underexplored and Madison plans to capitalize on the potential of this area. Geologically, the project area is comprised of units of the Abbabis Metamorphic Complex, intruded by leucogranites. Airborne radiometric data acquired from MME shows anomalous radiometric signatures on the northern portions of the licence area (Figure 4). Madison considers EPL-8115 to be highly prospective for leucogranite-hosted uranium mineralization.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Airborne radiometric signature and targets (blue outline) over EPL-8115.\n\nQualified Person\n\nMary Barton, a Professional Natural Scientist (SACNASP) and a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects for EPL-8115 and EPL-8531, has reviewed, verified and approved the technical information contained in this news release.\n\nAbout Madison Metals Inc.\n\nMadison Metals Inc (CSE: GREN) (OTC: MMTLF) is a Canadian green energy resource company with experienced management having particular expertise in the uranium mining industry.

    "EU-like energy approach needed in Southern Africa, says Namibia presidential advisor": "JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – A collaborative energy approach, like that of the European Union (EU), is needed in Southern Africa, says Namibia presidential economic adviser James Mnyupe.\n\nAt least South Africa and Namibia should put together a case that shows seriousness about decarbonising sub Saharan Africa, says Mnyupe, with the two countries looking to share with the world the burden of building the required pipeline and transmission line infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMnyupe, who was a panel member at the Hydrogen Economy Discussion, says EU-like collaborative regional and continental approaches are needed in the renewable energy and green hydrogen space.\n\nModerated by Allen & Overy counsel Gillian Niven, the other panel members were EU-South Africa trade policy officer Darryn Allan, International Renewable Energy Agency programme officer policy Emanuele Bianco, and RebelGroup Southern Africa senior consultant Laurens Cloete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMnyupe says African policy makers need to be aware of the different policy toolboxes needed for African countries playing different roles.\n\nFor example, Namibia is poised to be an exporter of green hydrogen, South Africa perhaps a net importer and others playing self-sufficiency roles.\n\n“If you look at Morocco, it may export but it has really large industries that it may need to decarbonise, and South Africa might very well be a good example of that as well.\n\n“Depending on what type of country you are, you will need to think strategically about the different pieces of legislation and policy that you would want to be championing.\n\n“For example, if you are an exporter like Namibia, you will be thinking very hard about securing offtake agreements with clientele countries,” he highlights.\n\nFor others, the focus will be on regulating pricing for the use of specific infrastructure, such as pipelines and ports, and the need for some of that infrastructure needing to be common-user infrastructure so that the original builder of the pipeline does not necessarily restrict access to others down the line.\n\nFrom an upstream perspective, there will be a need for collocating assets in a way that makes sense.\n\nNamibia, with both good wind and solar in one jurisdiction, will need to ensure that it puts legislation for special economic zones around the generating assets to facilitate industrialisation clusters or a hydrogen valley around the generation assets.\n\nThought needs to be given to the prospect of assembling wind blades close to where the wind turbines will be located to negate the need to transport these large pieces of infrastructure over long distances.\n\n“Figure out whether you are a net importer or a net exporter - something that I think is very important from an African perspective, as well as beginning to think about inter-regional trade,” he adds.\n\nHe foresees not only green molecules in the form of green hydrogen and its derivatives being transported around Southern Africa but also green electrons in the form of renewable energy.\n\nIt could be that South Africa will be importing some of the molecules from Namibia to decarbonise its hard-to-abate sectors.\n\n“The one thing I would like to remind all African States to bear in mind is that hydrogen is not purely a molecule play. When you deploy very large renewable energy assets at scale, you will be getting electron connectivity. You could capture some of that, use that to become self-sufficient but possibly to trade electrons as well into the Southern African Power Pool,\" Mnyupe highlights.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa on 25 July spoke about South Africa possibly needing to consider importing electricity from neighbouring countries that have excess electricity.\n\n“If that electricity happens to be good, clean renewable energy that is cheap and affordable, I think that presents a really great opportunity for South Africa and its neighbours, such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. That’s what Africans need to start thinking about when looking at the hydrogen opportunity,\" he adds.\n\nBoth Namibia and South Africa are looking at green hydrogen business models, which could give rise to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) modelling its regulatory framework on that of the EU.\n\nWhile the US and China have big enough economies to do things on their own, the countries of Africa need to consider collaborating in the way the EU is doing.\n\nHe believes African countries will benefit from talking to one another and putting standards in place and then allowing States to play their own roles.\n\n“You do have things like the African Green Hydrogen Alliance being put together but I believe that at African Union (AU) member State level, we do need a coordinated, potentially continental approach to this.\n\n“At the very least you would want a regional approach to some of these endeavours. For example, SADC states, I believe need to talk to one another and I can tell you why. If you look at the EU, they are looking, for example, at building backbone pipeline infrastructure right across the continent that can take electrons from Italy and Spain to Germany, and from the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Germany as well.\n\nThat level of coordination and effort sharing in building inter-regional assets comes with significant benefits and in his view, Namibia, and South Africa, could collaborate on building a pipeline from Lüderitz into Boegoebaai that extends to Sasol in Secunda.\n\nSuch a pipeline of 2 300 km could cost anywhere between €6-billion and €6.5-billion, and moves could be made to jointly strengthen the transmission line network as well.\n\n“In a nutshell, an SADC approach will be needed and I do believe that at AU level, there should be conversations with the EU specifically on standards, certifications to ensure that Africa, as a supplier continent, is speaking to the EU as a potential importer continent.\n\nHe says Namibia wants to make some announcements at the United Nations Climate Change Conference from November 6 to18 in Egypt as it collaborates with the EU “and we’d encourage our peers and our neighbours to do the same”, he adds.",
    "Namibia & Botswana team up to keep Western pirates away": "Botswana-Namibia bi-national commission: Namibia and Botswana, two African countries are lifting passport requirements for cross border movement of people. This is a first of its kind initiative in the sense that now; nationals of the two countries would only need to produce IDs to move between the two countries. This is a significant move in its attempt at realizing the ultimate goal of a strong, united and conflict free Africa, as it has the potential to be further extended to trade and other economic purposes.\n\nNamibian President Hage Geingob said, “Our two countries not only share a common border, but also common people and heritage. Symbiotic and inter-dependent relationships exist along our common borders,” during the inaugural Botswana-Namibia bi-national commission.\n\nHe further called for fast-tracking the implementation of the usage of Identity-Documents (IDs) as travel documents between the two countries, without delay.\n\nFor a continent, so far plagued by conflict, terrorism, political instability this project is highly ambitious and if fructifies, is sure to usher in a new era of African Continental bonhomie, leading to economic self- sufficiency and less dependence on the west. Keeping in mind the enormity of this task, it’s natural to be viewed with cynicism. Cynics have raised concerns regarding militant groups such as Boko Haram and public health crises including Ebola as a big hurdle in its realization.\n\nBotswana-Namibia bi-national commission\n\nHowever, the fact that the leaders of these two nations have accepted one of the major continental challenges is indeed laudable. It is a stepping stone towards economic development; with open borders it will be easier for a landlocked country like Botswana to have access to the Namibian coastline, thereby increasing their revenue through trade. . Many researchers have argued that it is crucial for the landlocked economy to negotiate the domestic policies with its coastal neighbours in order to persuade them to agree to a lower degree of obstruction, making the landlocked economy less vulnerable to the caprices of its neighbours’ economies. Recently, it has been seen that several African countries without coastlines are embracing this growth model.\n\nEarlier, countries in the SADC bloc lifted visa requirements, but the Botswana-Namibia deal has gone one step ahead and has also lifted the requirements of passport for the citizens of these two nations to move freely. This is an unprecedented but a welcome change.\n\nAimed to foster intra-Africa trade, integration and socio-economic development, these two countries have shown the African Union, what exactly a Union of nations means.\n\nViolent political events, ethnic conflicts, illegal weapons, health crisis have plagued sub-Saharan Africa since independence, and have caused much death and destruction stalling economic development. Usually, the West gains unfair advantage of such tumultuous situations.\n\nWith the abundance of natural resources African continent can become the richest continent in the world but infighting, instability and exploitation by the west hinder its development. Western neo-colonialism has used foreign trade as a tool for exploiting the vast resources of Africa at unfair terms even in this age.\n\nAlso Read: Africa breaks up with EU\n\nMedium.com speaks about a journalist Mark Curtis’ report on ‘Britain’s scramble for Africa’s energy and mineral resource.’ where he talks about “how British companies have mining operations in 37 sub-Saharan African countries, which control over $1 trillion worth of Africa’s most valuable resources”\n\nIt is a matter of shame for a modern world that in countries like Democratic Republic of Congo, children are forced to work in life-threatening conditions to mine cobalt that ends up in smartphones, cars and computers, by household brands including Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone, according to a new investigation by Amnesty International as reported by ‘The Guardian’.\n\nThis shows how the west has built its wealth by commercially subjugating and exploiting Africa in the guise of helping it to develop economically. However, there is still a glimmer of hope. If African leaders can finally come together and addresses the challenges that the African continent is facing, it may put an end to Africa’s commercial exploitation at the hands of the West that has always benefitted from divided and conflict-ridden Africa.\n\nNamibia and Botswana have set an example for other African nations to come together and pave the way for a united, peaceful and prosperous Africa which has enormous potential to not only break free from the shackles of western neo-colonialism but also to be the new economic giant of the Global south.",
    "Namibia utilises One Health for rabies control including oral rabies vaccines for dogs": "Interview with Rauna Athingo (Namibia)\n\nThe northern part of Namibia in particular has been identified as a rabies hotspot, and many rabies cases, both in humans and animals (dogs and livestock especially), have occurred there in the last years.\n\n\n\n© Dr. Rauna Athingo\n\nIn 2006, Dr Rauna Athingo started working as a state veterinarian, responsible for disease control in the Oshana region – one of the regions in the north of the country where rabies is inflicting a particularly heavy burden. She was able to observe how vulnerable children were being exposed to rabid dogs and puppies in particular. At that time, she remembers, the Directorate of Veterinary Services did not have a strategy on how to handle rabies cases, and this made their work very difficult. Dr Athingo was part of a driving force in developing Namibia’s National Rabies Control Strategy, which provides guidance to all veterinarians and public health professionals in how to deal with rabies cases.\n\n“My vision is of a Namibia free from dog-mediated rabies, saving human lives and saving the livelihoods of farmers who also suffer as a result of mass livestock losses due to rabies.” – Dr Rauna Athingo, Chief Veterinarian for Animal Disease Control in the Directorate of Veterinary services, Namibia.\n\nRabies is a prime example of a disease at the animal-human-environment interface: cases in dogs, humans and livestock are directly correlated. To make elimination of rabies possible, therefore, different sectors have to collaborate and work together.\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\nIn 2015, to do just that, and in an attempt to address the increasing number of rabies cases, Namibia started to implement a One Health approach. The relevant authorities identified the need for collaboration between sectors and completely changed their approach to rabies control, by improving coordination and collaboration as well as communication at the human-animal-environment interface. Representatives from various sectors, such as human and animal health, education, environment and academia, took part in the formulation of Namibia’s strategy. Many activities were implemented under the One Health approach, both nationally and also in cooperation with neighbouring countries like Angola.\n\nCommitments from both the private and public sectors enabled Namibia to work towards the global goal of zero dog-mediated rabies cases by 2030, increasing awareness among communities and improving accessibility to post-exposure prophylaxis, especially in children and poor communities, given that rabies has devastating impacts not only on health but also on livelihoods. The financial burdens for bite victims, for example, include direct travel costs, as a number of trips to a healthcare facility are needed to complete the post-exposure prophylaxis schedule, and also the loss of income that can result from exposure. As well as this, rabies exposure can inflict a heavy psychological burden on families, and dogs too can be associated with this traumatic experience, resulting in long-term fear for humans.\n\nConsidering these economic, social and individual implications, controlling rabies at its source (i.e. the dogs themselves) is cheaper than providing postexposure prophylaxis. It also helps to empower communities – if community members understand the dangers of rabies, and ways to control it, they can contribute themselves to saving lives.\n\nDr Athingo’s message is clear: “Kick out rabies from Namibia – vaccinate your pet”.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\nFriedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) – Using oral rabies vaccines (value and use)\n\nFor more than five years now, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) has been supporting Namibia’s efforts to control rabies in various areas. Besides carrying out assessments, epidemiological analyses, and building capacity at the laboratory side, vaccination has been a particular focus.\n\nCurrently, rabies elimination efforts rely on mass dog vaccination by the parenteral route, which means injecting a dose of rabies vaccine under the skin. Vaccination campaigns usually rely on owners bringing their dog to vaccination points. However, free-roaming and stray dogs are sometimes hard to catch and this means that vaccination targets, to control rabies in the dog population, may not be reached.\n\nTo increase herd immunity, these free-roaming and stray dogs need to be specifically targeted by vaccination campaigns, and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of dogs is one possible solution in such cases.\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\n“With safe, efficacious and well accepted oral vaccine baits available, ORV has the potential to become a game changer in situations where parenteral vaccination alone cannot stop transmission within the dog population.” - Dr Conrad Freuling, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute\n\nBefore using the vaccine in a larger field trial, colleagues from the FLI, in conjunction with the University of Namibia, tested the immune responses triggered by oral vaccine baits in local Thai and Namibian dog populations 1,2.\n\nDuring a field trial in communal areas of northern Namibia, both veterinary staff and dog owners expressed their appreciation for this particular approach to vaccination. When it comes to oral vaccination, however, bait acceptance has to be considered. Dogs will only go for “tasty” baits. Fortunately for the trial, a great many dogs that were offered bait were interested. They ingested them and were then considered as being vaccinated 3.\n\nORV can complement current parenteral vaccination strategies and go a long way in making up for the lack of access to crucial parts of the dog populations that rabies elimination programs have to contend with.\n\nDr Thomas Müller of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute said, “The partnership with our Namibian colleagues has been and continues to be very fruitful. We are confident that the promising results from our field assessments of ORV will pave the way for other countries in Africa and elsewhere to integrate ORV into their rabies control programmes.”\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n",
    "Germany rejects new negotiations over Namibia genocide": "The German government has not said much publicly in recent months about the reconciliation process between Germany and Namibia.\n\nSix years ago, both governments entered into negotiations about a formal German apology for the colonial-era killings of tens of thousands of the Herero and Nama people in what was once Germany South-West Africa. Historians describe it as the first genocide of the 20th century.\n\nNegotiators agreed on a draft agreement in May 2021, but neither government has yet signed. Right from the start, the document drew loud criticism from politicians and some descendants of the victims, who demanded fresh talks.\n\nNo fresh talks\n\nHowever, the German government has now officially rejected these demands. \"From the German government's point of view, the negotiations for the joined declaration with Namibia have been finalized, even though talks about specific modalities of its implementation are continuing,\" the government wrote in response to written questions submitted by Sevim Dagdelen, a Member of Germany's federal parliament from the aocialist Left Party.\n\n\"It is a sign of arrogance that the German government simply ignores the massive criticism from Namibia's parliament and the outrage of the descendants of the victims and leaves Namibia to deal with it,\" Dagdelen told DW.\n\nThen German foreign minister Heiko Maas announced the end of negotiations in May 2021\n\nA number of Herero and Nama representatives are likely to agree. In December, they had requested a meeting with Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock to push for direct negotiations. They are angry that Germany is only ready to accept political, but not legal responsibility for the genocide.\n\nThey also criticize the €1.1 billion ($1.1 billion) rebuilding and development program that Germany is proposing to finance over 30 years. \"That is development cooperation. This is about financing projects and infrastructure, which is ok. But this deal does not get to the heart of the matter, it is not about justice and reconciliation,\" Nama activist Sima Luipert told German news magazine Der Spiegel in June this year.\n\nHereros and Namas are divided\n\nOther community representatives, however, have rejected demands for fresh talks. \"Protocol wise I don't think that a foreign government can enter into negotiations leading to an agreement with the citizens of a foreign country. Hence, reopening of the negotiation on genocide ... will not be accepted by our government, all OvaHerero, OvaMbanderu and Nama communities\", Ueriuka Tjikuua, a community representative who participated in the negotiations process, told DW.\n\nMany Hereros live in poverty\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the draft agreement, the German government is already taking steps toward its implementation. This year's federal budget includes €35 million for development projects and €4 million for a foundation that is supposed to keep the memory of the genocide alive. Both sums are part of the €1.1 billion package.\n\nA spokeswoman for Germany's Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development told DW that the development projects would target the descendants of the victims. They cover areas such as land reform, agriculture, water, energy supply, and vocational training.\n\nDevelopment projects are underway\n\nHowever, it is still unclear when the projects will be up and running. \"These plans can only be implemented once the two foreign ministers have signed the joined declaration,\" the spokeswoman said. The ministry did not provide specific information on the state of implementation but told DW that it was in constant dialogue with the Namibian government.\n\nThe debate in Namibia's parliament was marred by protests\n\nThe Namibian government's present position on the draft agreement is also unclear.\n\nAngry Herero and Namas took the capital Windhoek after the negotiations were concluded in May last year. A parliamentary debate about the agreement in September 2021 was also accompanied by loud protests. The mood inside the chamber was equally emotional: Angry opposition members blasted the outcome of the negotiations, with even some MPs from the ruling SWAPO party voicing concern. So far, the government has not put the agreement to a vote in the national assembly.\n\n\"The fact that the government withdrew and also did not schedule another debate about it clearly shows how uneasy it feels, because it realized that it won't be easy,\" German-Namibian scholar Henning Melber told DW.\n\nNo vote in Germany's parliament?\n\nThe German government, however, has tried to remain confident. \"The Namibian government is sticking to the draft of the joined declaration even after the controversial debate in the Namibian national assembly,\" it wrote in its response to the parliamentary questions by the Left Party.\n\nGermany's lower parliament, the Bundestag, does not plan to vote on the agreement at all.\n\n\"It is correct that the fully negotiated joined declaration is not an agreement under international law and does not require ratification by the German Bundestag,\" the government wrote.\n\nMP Dagdelen is not happy with this position. \"Politically, it is more than appropriate that parliament deals with such a historic declaration, even if it is not necessary from a legal point of view,\" she told DW.\n\nHowever, whether German politicians get to vote on the agreement or not may be decided thousands of miles away. Namibia is scheduled to go to the polls in November 2024. Faced with declining popularity, the Namibian government is likely to avoid anything that could generate public anger in the run-up to elections. That could mean the joint declaration with Germany will have to wait.\n\nStreet Debate: The price of the genocide in Namibia\n\nEdited by: Chrispin Mwakideu\n\nThis aritcle was originally published in German.",
    "Empowering informal and microenterprise is necessary": "By Jerome Mutumba,\n\nDBN Head of Marketing and Corporate Communications.\n\nThe recent focus on empowering informal and microenterprises is a necessary affirmation for the further development of Namibia’s economy. Development of new market spaces, as well as ongoing management of and upgrades to SME parks as good omens for the future.\n\nAn examination of Namibia’s recent enterprise history shows three broad origins of enterprise start-ups. The first is the local start-up, typically an informal or registered, regulatory-compliant micro-enterprise. The second is a South African adjunct, an enterprise that complements the South African parent. The third, rarest form is an international start-up.\n\nOf the three the informal or formal micro-enterprise is arguably the most productive for Namibia. A survey of large Namibian enterprises points to the local, micro origination of many of Namibia’s best-known brands and companies.\n\nThe roots of the successes and sustainability of these enterprises lie in their small, relatively low-cost beginnings, and the persistence of their owners in learning, adapting, and diversifying. Thus, by example and inference, to develop large, economically significant, and sustainable Namibian enterprises, a wide base of informal or formal micro enterprises must be fostered.\n\nHowever, the value of the progression from an informal enterprise to a large formal enterprise is difficult to predict, especially given that there will be attrition of the informal enterprises in particular.\n\nThe economic value of informal and micro enterprises becomes more apparent when evaluated according to current development needs.\n\nFirstly, the informal enterprise is a major employer. Recent findings by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as reported in the Namibian newspaper on 6 September 2022, show that 56% of Namibia’s workforce is employed in the informal sector. According to Tangeni Shindondola, Director of the Dynamic Informal Traders’ Association (DITA), as reported in the Namibian newspaper on 15 February 2022, the informal enterprise becomes an employment provider in the event of retrenchments.\n\nSecondly, the informal enterprise is known to be a sole form of income for many households, or augments household incomes, particularly where those households are in poverty or on the verge of poverty.\n\nThirdly, informal and microenterprises are important elements of the value chain as off-takers and distributors of goods and services. This is true of goods and services produced by large and medium-sized enterprises, with attendant impacts on formal enterprise revenues and employment. Informal and micro enterprises also generate network business on a peer level, creating their own ecosystem.\n\nTo reap longer-term benefits from the informal and micro-enterprise sector, activities need to be viewed and planned in four phases.\n\nFirstly, the nascent informal enterprise needs to be nurtured and enabled. Secondly, those informal enterprises with a potential need to be encouraged to transition to formalised, registered, regulatory-compliant microenterprises. Thirdly, microenterprises need to be nurtured to the activity level of SMEs. Finally, the most successful SMEs need to graduate to larger enterprises.\n\nWhat is obvious is that the process of growth of informal and micro enterprises requires support and inducements.\n\nA first inducement is a welcoming approach to start-ups. This requires liberalization of the regulatory environment for informal enterprises and the removal of early barriers. Although regulation is required, that regulation should be exerted gradually, post-start-up on the basis of impact on the community as well as the level of activity of the informal enterprises.\n\nA second phase will be required to induce the formalization of the informal enterprise to become a fully-fledged micro-enterprise, including full regulatory compliance.\n\nThe shift from informal enterprise to registered microenterprise entails costs that must be offset, including taxation and regulatory costs. To reduce the immediate burden, the enterprise will be required to grow, which will come at an expense. This can be offset with short-term bridging finance for stock and regulatory costs, and longer-term mezzanine finance to grow the asset base. This might be paired with concessional interest rates and the use of assets financed as collateral.\n\nWhat is also apparent is that formalization requires an augmented skill set to manage finance in a borrowing environment, as well as administer the regulatory aspects. This can be addressed with mentoring and coaching of the type envisaged by the Bank of Namibia’s SME Financing Strategy.\n\nWhat is implicit to a policy that nurtures informal and microenterprises is the need for a suitable agency to administer and coordinate finance, and mentoring and coaching.\n\nThe further benefits of an agency of this nature are that it will set the standards for services, and act as a control against predatory providers of microfinance. In addition, it may become a reference point for conducive regulatory practices. Finally, it may become a repository of knowledge and a brains-trust for the informal and microenterprise sectors.\n\nDevelopment Bank of Namibia, by design, is intended to finance large enterprises in the first place, as well as SMEs. It does however provide finance through its Apex microfinance facility for qualifying microfinance providers. In this way, the Bank currently complements the development impact of micro-lenders.\n\nAs much as Namibia’s future depends on policy-based lending to finance renewable energy, serviced land, affordable housing, and young entrepreneurs, it will also need to develop policy-based stimulus for informal enterprises and microenterprises.\n\nHits: 6",

In the spirit of reconciling various factions and normalising the game, the NC has spent the last few months consulting with various stakeholders, informing all parties including the Namibian public at large. During this time, we have had regard to various documentation and processes entered into in the past, with the view to obtain better clarity and confirm the correctness of procedures.\n\nAs background, on 22 February 2020, the 28th Ordinary Elective Congress expelled the Namibia Premier League [NPL] as a member of the NFA.\n\nOn 18 July 2020, the NFA held its 16th Extraordinary Congress at the Palm Hotel in Windhoek. This Congress, duly constituted by at least 50% of its members and through a three-quarters majority vote in favour of the expulsions, decided to expel and ban from the activities of the NFA, the executive committee members of the NPL i.e. the officials of the league.\n\nUpon thorough review of the NFA statutes, the relevant provisions cited, on the basis of which the expulsion and banning from activities of the individual members were decided, it is evident that there was no legal basis for the “expulsion” of these executives, who were at the time not members of the NFA or members of a member as contemplated by article 15. It is unfortunate that errors of interpretation or misunderstandings led to the issuance of these individual expulsion letters.\n\nThe NC also extensively engaged with FIFA on the matter and can confirm that both the NC and FIFA hold the view that the decision to expel and ban these individual members without any legal basis for such decisions to be taken, render these decisions null and void ab initio, i.e. from the beginning.\n\nConsequently, the NC hereby confirms that the individual members of the former NPL are in fact in good standing with the NFA and, subject to complying with all rules, regulations of the NFA, are open to participate in NFA activities.\n\nFurther to the above, it is our immense pleasure to inform our members that the NFA has successfully secured a sponsorship for the top tier men's league and the women youth league for the 2022/2023 football season. We are still in the process of finalising other sponsors.\n\nAs a passionate and dedicated sponsor, our partner has set forth various conditions applicable to this generous sponsor. We hereby inform our members that, amongst the conditions imposed by and attached to our sponsor is that:\n\nAny disputes within the football fraternity are resolved.\n\nAll clubs and members work closely together to protect the image of football and that of the sponsor and thereby zealously avoid any conduct which will bring the name of the sponsors into disrepute.\n\nWe are thus pleased to inform our members that we can now, fully comply with conditions imposed by our sponsor. In this way we have collectively brought back the beautiful game of football to our nation thereby empowering our footballers and the nation at large.”",

    "Sea Shepherd Global": "Incidents of ‘border hopping’ by foreign industrial factory trawlers that fish illegally in the most remote areas of Namibia’s sovereign waters have largely ceased due to at-sea patrols with Namibian fisheries inspectors and police officers working in collaboration with Sea Shepherd crew on board the Sea Shepherd Global vessel Ocean Warrior to defend protected zones.\n\nThree years ago, Namibian law enforcement stationed on board the Ocean Warrior intercepted an illegal fishing vessel moving at trawling speed, 20 nautical miles inside of Namibia’s maritime borders. On sighting the Ocean Warrior the illegal fishing vessel immediately changed course to escape apprehension. The Ocean Warrior came within 300 meters of the illegal fishing vessel, operating in close quarter situations in efforts to slow the larger vessel down. The unidentified fishing vessel had no discernible vessel markings, and unfortunately the illegal fishing vessel could not be boarded due to unfavorable weather conditions at the time.\n\nThe return of Ocean Warrior to Namibian waters under the invitation and direction of the MFMR, is a proud continuation of Operation Vanguard, an effort to increase patrol capacity under the leadership of the MFMR after the government received intelligence that incursions had resumed.",

    "WHO’s GBV clinical handbook an eye-opener for doctors in Namibia": "When Dr Ifeolu Oyedele first learned that he would be going for training on the World Health Organization (WHO)’s ‘Clinical handbook for the health care of survivors subjected to intimate partner violence and/or sexual violence’ he did not think he would learn anything new from the session.\n\nIn fact, he was already sensitized through his medical training to see signs of abuse and trauma. It was only while attending the training session in September 2021 that it dawned on him the seriousness of Gender-Based Violence and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as well as the trauma it causes to the victims.\n\n“The training opened my eyes to what happens after we see patients of GBV. The impact the training made was that I was now starting to give the sexual assault cases a higher priority,” said Oyedele, the Acting Senior Medical Officer at the Rundu State Hospital. He adds that before the training he and other doctors at the hospital did not really prioritize GBV victims.\n\nBefore, patients who would come to the Rundu State hospital for a sexual assault case had to wait for long hours before a doctor would attend to them. Patients were told to wait for the doctors’ lunch hour to be seen because of the high number of patients doctors at the state health facilities attend daily. This changed because Oyedele realized ‘the sensitive nature’ of these cases.\n\n“We would schedule their appointments from lunchtime but now after the training instead of giving her (victim) an appointment I would just see her as immediately as possible, basically I would finish my current patient and then see them and do the rape kit,” he explains.\n\nHe further elaborates: “My eyes were just opened to the sensitive nature of the issue and that they are going through a lot of psychological stress and trauma and telling them to wait, and they haven’t bathed or showered is a bit insensitive. I now do it as soon as feasible”.\n\nOyedele works in the gynaecology department and when doctors in other departments pick up cases of GBV or IPV they are referred to him. “It’s only my department that is dealing with these cases because we are the ones with gynaecological experience,” explains Oyedele.\n\nOyedele is one of 282 healthcare professionals trained in the clinical handbook nationwide. The purpose of the training is to orient health professionals, primarily doctors and nurses at government healthcare facilities to identify signs of abuse in patients.\n\nThe doctors and nurses are trained to see clinical cues and identify violence that healthcare providers are likely to miss in their patients. The doctors and nurses are also trained to be empathetic when dealing with victims of GBV and IPV.\n\nDr Leonard Kabongo is a Chief Medical Officer in the Erongo region. He was also trained on the ‘Clinical Handbook on the Health Care of Survivors Subjected to Intimate Partner Violence and/or Sexual Violence, Namibia’.\n\n“In the past, all we did was a quick physical examination of the patient and concluded that there was no sign of rape or sexual intercourse and that was it. But, now we know that GBV and IPV are not always physical,” explains Kabongo. Through the handbook, Kabongo has developed the ability to listen to his patients. He was also able to transfer these skills and other lessons provided in the handbook to other doctors countrywide as a trainer of trainees.\n\n“It is very important to listen because the story of the assault or the violence is actually guiding you on how to approach this individual (survivor) and where exactly your focus will be as you are listening,” explains Kabongo. By actively listening to his patients, Kabongo has also learned to empathise with his patients.\n\nTimely intervention\n\nDr Alice Kabongo, is a Senior Medical Officer at the Gobabis State hospital. She says that doctors in the state health facilities have to attend to many patients and that sometimes makes it difficult to prioritise sexual assault cases.\n\n“Although we know that GBV cases should not wait because it's an emergency we are sometimes forced to use the triage system where we prioritise who we will see. For example, if it's a young patient we will attend to them at whatever time we have that day and if it’s an older patient we let them sleep in the ward and we see them in the morning,” explained Alice.\n\nMeanwhile, Kabongo (Leonard) feels that even if the state hospitals are busy, GBV survivors equally need urgent attention. “We do a triage to attend to patients who need urgent medical attention, including survivors of IPV and GBV because they are also hurt emotionally and they need support and a place of safety,” Kabongo explained. GBV and IPV are emergencies, he emphasized.\n\nIn addition, time is of importance, especially in the case of a sexual assault. “If you wait too long to attend to the patient you are losing that opportunity to prevent infections, so there are medications that they need to receive, prophylaxis which they need to receive to prevent certain types of infections that could be the result of the assault,” he adds.\n\nEqually, waiting too long to attend to a sexual assault patient increases the chances of losing forensic evidence. The result is that there will not be sufficient evidence to prove in court that a sexual assault has occurred. “Forensic evidence actually disappears with time so the more time has elapsed the more the evidence is gone,” adds Kabongo.\n\nForensic kit\n\nDr Oyedele and Alice both have been using the rape kit for years. Oyedele says that he studied the instructions on the rape kit manual and has been doing it accordingly. “I just followed the manual that comes with the rape kit. This has already been part of the work I do so it didn’t add to the workload,” Oyedele explained. However, not every doctor knows how to use one, says Kabongo. The training was also helpful to the doctors who did not know how to use the forensic kit, Kabongo adds.\n\n“Most of the doctors are not really exposed to forensic examination, for example, how do you collect the evidence appropriately and how do you defend yourself in the court of law if you are summoned to be an expert witness,” he explained.\n\nExposing the doctors to the forensic kit during the training has increased their confidence, adds Kabongo. “And that’s another powerful component of the training that has actually helped to appropriately select the evidence. In the past, we have had cases dismissed due to a lack of evidence, including tampering with evidence. Now, people are aware of when they should open the rape kit,” he said.\n\nIn the event that they are summoned to court regarding a GBV or IPV case, doctors who have undergone the training know what type of evidence to present. “If I present myself in court and I’m being asked questions by lawyers I know how to respond. All these come as a component of the clinical handbook and I think it has really empowered doctors to be able to defend their cases effectively,” Kabongo explains.\n\nAbuse knows no gender or age\n\nWhile it is common for women and girls to be the faces of GBV and IPV, they are not the only ones who experience abuse, Kabongo emphasizes. The clinical handbook training touches on the human being and this includes men and boys.\n\n“Men and boys can also be subjected to this kind of violence and they too need care,” he adds. Oyedele says that the patients he sees for sexual assault and other forms of GBV are mostly women of reproductive age.\n\n“The youngest patient I saw for suspected abuse is three years old and the oldest is 41 years old,” Oyedele says. He has been keeping records of GBV patients he has attended since October 2020. “Even if they are picked up from somewhere they refer them to me,” he adds.\n\nGBV survivors must be protected\n\nMeanwhile, Alice credits the GBV training on the clinical handbook for her alertness and ability to pick up subtle cues and probe suspected abuse. “We take the patient’s comprehensive history to rule out abuse,” she says.\n\nStill, she feels that more needs to be done to protect survivors of GBV and IPV. People who report to the hospital for obvious abuse need to be protected, she says. At the moment, these patients’ first contact point is the casualty department where everyone can see they “have been abused,” says Alice.\n\n“GBV is a sensitive issue and we need a place where these people can be seen and received. For now, we send them to a ward or in the Old Theatre of the hospital when we suspect abuse. But we are advocating for a corner where they can be seen privately,” says Alice. She also feels that more medical professionals should be trained and a designated doctor should be assigned for these cases.\n\n“The only issue is that we are working in an environment where there is a shortage of doctors. In other hospitals, there is literally a separate doctor who attends to those cases and doesn't have to attend to any other patients,” agrees Oyedele. The response to the handbook has been overwhelming with some doctors requesting more training, concludes Kabongo.\n\nThe ‘Clinical Handbook on the Health Care of Survivors Subjected to Intimate Partner Violence and/or Sexual Violence, Namibia’ is an initiative of the WHO in collaboration with UN Women, the United Nations Population Fund and the Ministry of Health and Social Services. The handbook draws on the work of professionals who are dedicated to preventing and responding to GBV.",

    "Madison Metals to Acquire Interest in Namibia Uranium Mining Licence": "TORONTO, Sept. 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madison Metals Inc. (“Madison” or the “Company”) (CSE: GREN) (OTC: MMTLF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement on September 12, 2022 to acquire a 23% interest in Mining Licence 121 (“ML121”) through the acquisition of 24 shares of Namibia Nuclear Corporation (Proprietary) Limited (“Namibia Nuclear”) which equals a twenty-four percent (24%) ownership interest in Namibia Nuclear, by way of a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”). The consideration paid to the vendors will be $2,000,000 (USD) and 2,000,000 common shares in the capital of the Company to be paid and issued on the closing date, subject to certain conditions precedent contained in the SPA. ML121 is located in the renowned Erongo Uranium Province of Namibia, Africa, where Madison already holds rights to Exclusive Prospecting License 7011 (“EPL-7011”) (Figure 1). Namibia is the world’s second-highest uranium-producing country and holds the fifth-largest total uranium resources in the world.\n\n“ML121 and EPL-7011 are neighbours to Namibia’s two uranium-producing mines, Rössing and Husab, the world’s fifth- and third-largest producing uranium mines, respectively,” said Duane Parnham, Executive Chairman and CEO of Madison Metals. “The uranium outlook is continuing to strengthen because it is a critical metal for energy transition and energy security. Madison’s strategy of acquiring highly prospective concessions in a tier-one uranium jurisdiction provides the Company with an opportunity to establish itself as a key player in the uranium industry.”\n\nML121\n\nML121, which contains the Charlie Drilling uranium occurrence, is located 46 kilometres (km) east-northeast of the city of Swakopmund spanning an area of approximately 35 km2. The mining license covers base and rare metals, dimension stone, industrial minerals, nuclear fuel minerals and precious metals.\n\nML121 has significant potential for leucogranite-hosted uranium mineralization given that its geological and structural setting bears a strong resemblance to the Rössing deposit, with uranium-bearing granites concentrated at the Khan-Rössing boundary within the north-northeasterly trending deformation corridor of the Welwitschia magnetic lineament (Figure 2).\n\nHistorical airborne radiometric surveys over ML121 indicate anomalous prospective radiometric signatures (Figure 3) with the most noteworthy anomalies being related to isoclinal fold noses at the contact of the Khan and Rössing formations. Exploration work to date has focused on the radiometric anomaly in the northwest portions of ML121. The 2.3 km long anomaly was followed up with six (6) diamond drill holes and 59 reverse circulation drill holes.

    "Botswana junior eyes profits as it sends coal via Namibia to voracious European markets": "After a rough few years, Botswana coal miner Minergy, hopes next year it will report a profit as it continues moves product through Namibia's Walvis Bay and into export markets.\n\n\n\nIn its results for the year ended in June, released on Tuesday, Minergy reported it had extracted and processed over a million metric tons of coal in a single financial year at its Masama mine near Gaborone. Close to 40% of that production was realised in the fourth quarter of the financial year as the company moved to take advantage of strong demand from export markets.\n\nMinergy's is the first coal to leave through the port of Walvis Bay – an exercise which is now economic, despite the vast travel distance, thanks to exceedingly strong export coal prices in the face of supply disruptions related to Russia's war on Ukraine.",
    "Can Namibia turn oil into prosperity?": "Can Namibia turn oil into prosperity? Ralph Mathekga\n\nNew oil discoveries could lift Namibia’s fortunes if it avoids the economic and political pitfalls of a resource boom.\n\nNamibian president Hage Geingob hails from SWAPO, a liberation movement turned political party that has ruled the country since independence in 1990 but now faces fresh public discontent. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell New oil finds set the stage for possible conflict\n\nNamibia’s public is frustrated with socioeconomic conditions\n\nCorruption could squander the resource windfall\n\nThe recent discovery of large reserves of crude oil off the coast of Namibia has fueled speculation about the fate of the sparsely populated country, whose economy has been largely dominated by mining, agriculture, fishing and tourism.\n\nNamibia and South Africa are two of the world’s most unequal societies in terms of income and wealth distribution, with Gini index scores of 59.1 and 63, respectively. Together with Zambia, they place three members of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) among the four most unequal countries globally.\n\nThe oil discovery thus cements Namibia’s place among those resource-rich countries in the region, which has a history of conflict over assets like minerals, oil and gas. It has led to talk about whether oil exploration could help Namibia double its gross domestic product (GDP) by 2040. And it could shape not only the country’s own development but also benefit the SADC as a whole, with successful exploration and management of oil revenue in Namibia delivering value to other jurisdictions in the region.\n\nInequality and deepening poverty\n\nPoverty, inequality and unemployment are the scourges confronting the SADC’s postindependence democracies. Namibia is no exception, with its citizens largely dependent on subsistence agriculture. The region’s disproportionately young populations are increasingly agitated with worsening socioeconomic conditions, despite living in a resource belt.\n\nPoverty has resulted in wider disenchantment among Namibia’s youth, as evidenced by the significant loss of support for the ruling SWAPO (South West Africa People’s Organization) in 2020’s local government elections. SWAPO’s liberation credentials – which include leading the country to gain independence in 1975 – did not meet expectations for leading Namibia to economic prosperity.\n\nThe region’s disproportionately young populations are increasingly agitated with worsening socioeconomic conditions.\n\nA similar story has played out in South Africa and Zimbabwe, where liberation parties have squandered opportunities to rebuild. Corruption has threatened the credibility of institutions to the point where these democracies are generally seen as having failed to surpass what was achieved by pre-independence regimes.\n\nThe threat of corruption\n\nIn South Africa, the failures of local governments and weekly revelations about corruption by African National Congress (ANC) leaders led to a significant electoral decline in the local 2021 elections, with the long-dominant party receiving less than half of the total votes cast.\n\nIn Namibia, it was corruption in the allocation of fishing quotas that is thought to have sunk SWAPO in Namibia’s 2020 local elections, pointing to a possible shift of political trajectory not seen since independence.\n\nDisclosures that SWAPO officials received bribes for fishing rights raise serious questions about whether the recent oil discovery will double the country’s GDP by 2040, as suggested – or instead multiply its political problems and socioeconomic tensions even sooner. As SWAPO faces the mounting task of remaining in power amid a failure to properly manage public resources, one must ask whether the latest resource finds will not plunge Namibia into new scandals, as with the “Fishrot” case.\n\n× Facts & figures Moment of opportunity\n\nThere is merit to the idea that the massive oil revenues expected to flow in Namibia could turn the country toward economic prosperity, with positive implications for the SADC. Alternatively, the revenue could drive new levels of corruption that fuel social tensions and threaten political stability, adding to a worrying regional trend of conflict around extractive resources such as oil and gas. Nations with a history of liberation struggles always face the possibility of full-blown conflict stemming from resource wealth. In these countries, the rhetoric of “resource nationalism” often dominates public discourse, threatening political stability.\n\nGrowing frustration with the poor management of exploration revenues has led to discussions of resource nationalization. Liberation parties in the SADC have been unable to stamp out such ideas, as they are also seductive to politicians struggling to maintain influence over a discontented public.\n\nIn this context of resource-related conflict, Namibia’s oil discovery should raise flags about the ensuing risks, unless some kind of a renewal of purpose takes place among the country’s ruling elites. That SWAPO is deeply implicated in the Fishrot corruption scandal is an indication of what might be lying ahead for Namibia, which now holds the region’s largest reserves.",
    "Namibia's trade deficit up in July": "WINDHOEK, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's trade deficit widened to 4.3 billion Namibia dollars (about 288 million U.S. dollars) in July, up from 2.5 billion Namibia dollars recorded in the previous month, according to the country's latest trade statistics released Tuesday.\n\nIn the year that ended in July, Namibia maintained an average trade deficit of 3.3 billion Namibia dollars, according to the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA).\n\n\"For July 2022, Namibia's exports earnings were down by 14.8 percent on a monthly basis, while the imports bill was up by 4.5 percent,\" NSA Statistician-General Alex Shimuafeni said, adding that the deficit was reflected mostly in the petroleum oils import bill, followed by copper ores and concentrates, and ores and concentrates of precious metal.\n\nAccording to Shimuafeni, Botswana emerged as the main export market for Namibia, absorbing 20.5 percent of all goods exported, ahead of South Africa in the second position with a market share of 19.8 percent of total exports.\n\nChina ranked third with a relative share of 10 percent, while Zambia and the Netherlands occupied the fourth and fifth positions with respective shares of 8.8 percent and 6.6 percent, he added.\n\n\"The analysis of exports by commodities revealed that precious stones (diamonds) had the largest share of 25.3 percent in Namibia's total exports, ahead of fish with a share of 10.6 percent,\" he said.\" Uranium accounted for 7.5 percent, while non-monetary gold and petroleum oils came in fourth and fifth positions, accounting for 7.3 percent and 7 percent, respectively.\"\n\nIn terms of imports, South Africa, Peru, Oman, Bulgaria, and India were the major source countries, Shimuafeni said.\n\n\"The top five import markets supplied Namibia with 66.8 percent of all imports requirement, up from its June 2022 level of 52.3 percent and 62.8 percent recorded in July 2021,\" he said. ■",
    "Namibia to push for polluters to pay at COP27": "Namibia has stated its position to ensure negotiators at the COP27 and particularly the developed countries fulfil the promise that a minimum of US$100 billion (approximately N$1.7 trillion) in climate finance be achieved by 2024.\n\nEnvironment and tourism minister Pohamba Shifeta, in an interview with New Era last week, said Namibia’s agenda has always been clear, as the country has been pushing for a strong climate regime based on a polluter pay principle.\n\n“As you may recall, COP26 decided on a new collective quantified financial goal from a minimum of US$100 billion per annum to cater to the needs and adaption priorities for developing countries especially vulnerable nations such as Namibia. Our call is for developed countries to fulfil this promise before 2025. Namibia strongly believes that implementation shall be central as we continue to advance climate action both at national and international levels,” Shifeta stated.\n\nThe 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, more commonly referred to as COP27 will be the 27th to be held from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.\n\nAfter COP26 in Glasgow last year, Shifeta called on negotiators at the COP26 and particularly the developed countries to provide clarity on how they will ensure that a minimum of US$100 billion in climate finance is achieved by 2024.\n\nNamibia supports a scaled-up financial goal that is based on the needs of developing countries to support the implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).\n\n“As per the revised NDC, Namibia would require about US$11 billion between now and 2030 to achieve the targets set in this very important national document. The 90% of the US$11 billion that Namibia needs is conditioned to the provision of finance from the multilateral funding windows, particularly from the green climate fund, adaptation fund, special climate fund or the global environment facility,” he noted.\n\nAt COP26, nations finalised the Paris rulebook and came up with the Glasgow pact of decisions aiming at strengthening the implementation of the Paris Agreement.\n\nA number of key decisions have been referred to the subsidiary body of implementation and the subsidiary body on technological advice including the established committees for ease of implementation.\n\nShifeta stressed Namibia has been actively engaged in the work of these bodies, boards, and committees to ensure that its position is reflected throughout.\n\n“In a nutshell, Namibia is making a strong call for the steadfast implementation of the Paris Agreement. In Namibia, we have updated our Nationally Determined Contribution and crafted an implementation strategy and action plan that would enable us to fast track the achievement of NDC targets by 2030,” he emphasised.\n\nCountries, Namibia included, met in Glasgow in November 2021 for COP26 aimed to agree on measures to keep global temperature increases below 1.5oC. Climate finance, provided by developed countries to developing countries to support their efforts to address climate change and its impacts, will be one of the main issues at COP27.\n\nIt’s generally agreed that an existing target to provide US$100 billion of climate finance a year by 2020 has been missed.\n\nIn October, the UK COP presidency suggested it will be met by 2023. Environmentalists expressed that not meeting the target going forward will affect the level of trust that developing nations have in developed countries.\n\nThey feel less developed nations are being asked to cut their own future emissions while suffering the effects of climate change which they are not responsible for. –anakale@nepc.com.na",
