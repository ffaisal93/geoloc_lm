(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.\n\nTurkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.\n\nTurkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.\n\nErdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.\n\n“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.\n\nTurkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.\n\nTensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.\n\nMore recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.\n\nAthens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.\n\nA Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”\n\nThe official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.\n\nTurkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.\n\n“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries.\n\n———\n\nDerek Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.",
    "Best road trips in Greece": "Greece is meant for exploring, and not just by ferry. With your vehicle – rented or otherwise – there is a wealth of history, culture and, yes, beaches to savor.\n\nAway from relying solely on buses and boats, opportunities to leave crowds behind are myriad. Here are five of our favorite road trips in Greece that traverse the fabric of the country’s mainland and islands.\n\nGet local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nWander through the small fishing villages around the short loop on Serifos © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nGreek islands road trip\n\nBest road trip for beaches\n\nAthens–Paros; 180km (112 miles) total driving, not including sea travel\n\nAlthough you may think of exploring Greek islands as a sea trip, you’ll need wheels to properly explore and enjoy most of these rocky isles. This is particularly true with beaches, where the best – and least crowded – ones may only be reachable by car.\n\nFew parts of Greece are more iconic than the Cyclades, where the islands dotting the Aegean are the stuff of holiday fantasies. Start this trip in Athens, where the port of Piraeus is your gateway to what awaits. Begin on raw and rugged Serifos – less visited than many of its neighbors, it offers the perfect break from the usual hubbub of life. It has one main road that loops around the island, so your only real decision is whether to go clockwise or the reverse. Discover little fishing villages barely touched by tourism and long, sandy beaches in sheltered coves lapped by impossibly azure waters.\n\nJust next door – and within sight of Serifos – Sifnos exemplifies the distinct personalities that each of the Cycladic islands possesses. It’s popular with visitors and has a well-deserved reputation for its food traditions with many high-end and creative tavernas and restaurants. The roads radiate out from the central town of Apollonia. Follow these short and twisty routes down to a variety of seafront villages with well-developed beach scenes.\n\nMake your final stop on the large and varied island of Paros, which rewards drivers with a plethora of beaches, mountain villages and shimmering hillsides of olive trees.\n\nPlanning Tip: Your big decision on this trip is whether to use the same vehicle for the entire trip or to rent a car on each island. If you’re driving your own vehicle, you may appreciate its familiarity as you go from one island to the next. However, while many ferries transport cars, the costs can be high, and available vehicle slots may fill up even as there remains room for passengers. If hiring a car in Greece, it’s better in terms of price and hassle to just hire one separately on each island.\n\nScout new ways to explore the planet's wildest places with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe best way to explore Greece's history and mythology is by car © Matteo Colombo / Getty Images\n\nAncient Greece\n\nBest road trip for the wonders of the classical world\n\nAthens–Ancient Olympia; 590km (367 miles)\n\nMuch of the best of Greece's classic mythology and history is best visited by car. This trip starts in Athens – of course, you must take a moment to visit the Parthenon – and winds around the mainland and the Peloponnese Peninsula, with stops at sites of legend and lore.\n\nIt’s an easy drive northwest to Ancient Delphi, situated on a breathtaking site overlooking the Gulf of Corinth. Here the fabled oracle was the spiritual center of Ancient Greece when it was at its most powerful. Drive south to Nafplio in the Peloponnese, where you can split your time between a trifecta of sights: the acropolis at Tiryns, the citadel of Ancient Mycenae and the 2500-year-old theater at Epidavros.\n\nFinally, see where modern athletic competitions trace back their roots at Ancient Olympia. Walk amidst the reconstructed stadium that hosted the first Olympic games in 776 BCE and was the site of competitions for an extraordinary 1000 years.\n\nAround Athens\n\nBest road trip for a quick visit\n\nAthens–Marathon; 136km (85 miles)\n\nVisitors to Greece are usually in a hurry to head out from Athens to the islands – and with good reason. But if you’re on a short visit or just looking for a change of pace from the capital, Attica – the water-surrounded region with Athens at its center – will reward visitors who would like to sample excellent beaches, ancient monuments and expanses of natural beauty.\n\nSome 17km (10.5 miles) southeast of Athens, Glyfada is a tiny suburb that marks the start of the so-called Apollo Coast (or Athenian Riviera, depending on whose marketing material you favor). Small beaches backed by upscale clubs and more isolated strands on coves favored by nudists dot the coast. Pause for a cultural moment at the gleaming marble Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion.\n\nFollowing the craggy shore northeast, finish your drive at Marathon – yes, that Marathon – where Pheidippides began his run to Athens with news of military victory. Today, it’s a comfortable and beachy suburb, where the greatest challenge you’ll face is choosing between its many seafront tavernas.\n\nPause your Crete road trip to enjoy one of the island's numerous uncrowded beaches © SolStock / Getty Images\n\nThe magnificent island of Crete\n\nBest road trip for exploring a Mediterranean highlight\n\nIraklio–Hania; 280km (174 miles)\n\nGeographically very much separate from the rest of Greece but culturally a core part of the nation, Crete is unmissable. The Mediterranean’s fifth largest island (right after Corsica) is a panoply of historical sights, areas of superb natural beauty, hidden and uncrowded beaches and soaring peaks that seem almost Alpine in their grandeur.\n\nStart in the eastern city of Iraklio and go immediately south to the ancient Minoan Palace of Knossos. Get lost within this sprawling complex where the links to the past are tangible. Drive west to the holy site of Moni Arkadiou, a 16th-century monastery that embodies the indomitable Cretan spirit. Here you can understand how invaders from the Romans to the Turks to the Nazis, with dozens more in between, found their dreams of conquest shattered by the island’s fiercely independent spirit.\n\nDrive through the sheer cliffs, high mountain passes and deep gorges down to the south coast, where the beach town of Sougia remains untouched by mass tourism. Get a ferry or take a hike to ancient sites and even more remote beaches.\n\nFinally, head north to Hania, the evocative port town that oozes history within its Venetian-era walls.\n\nPlanning Tip: Distances on Crete can be deceiving. That seemingly short 60km (37-mile) jaunt from the touristy north to the untrammeled south will take much longer than you might expect. Roads curve sharply through the deeply eroded landscape, and the going can be very slow. And don’t expect many roadside signs to offer guidance; Cretans have yet to see a sign they didn’t shoot full of holes, a local source of pride and spirit.\n\nA drive into the Zagorohoria region will lead you to traditional villages tucked away in pristine mountains © Posnov / Getty Images\n\nNorthern wilds\n\nBest road trip to get off the beaten path\n\nThessaloniki–Sithonia; 880km (547 miles)\n\nGreece’s second city, Thessaloniki, is a wonderfully under-visited center for history, art, great food and intoxicating nightlife. Start here exploring the nation’s north, which borders a diverse range of neighboring countries and bears the influences of Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Slavs, Turks, and many more.\n\nDrive southwest to the fabled peak of Mt Olympus, Greece’s highest. A spiritual heart of the nation, you can drive up to its loftier elevations and go for hikes, both easy and world-class.\n\nStay in the mountains as you go west into the Zagorohoria region, which is dotted by tiny villages that have carried on across the millennia. Circle back towards Thessaloniki and finish your road trip at the unheralded but unmissable beaches of the Halkidiki Peninsula. Plunge deep into the very southeastern tip of remote Sithonia.\n\nTips for driving in Greece\n\nAlthough Greece follows EU conventions for driving regulations, there are some valuable things to remember as you drive around.",
    "Greece: EU using Med countries like a refugee 'parking lot'": "ATHENS (AP) — Greece on Monday urged the European Union to lift movement restrictions for refugees recognized by individual nations, accusing the bloc of applying a double standard when dealing with Ukrainians fleeing the war compared with the victims of other conflicts.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, Greece's migration affairs minister, said a “lack of solidarity” was holding up efforts to comprehensively reform migration rules across the 27-nation bloc.\n\nRefugees granted international protection by EU nations currently cannot take full advantage of the bloc’s provisions for free movement. But Ukrainians escaping the Russian invasion of their country face fewer restrictions.\n\n“That is not fair, and Greece will insist on that point ... the Ukrainian arrangement should apply to all refugees as long as they are officially recognized,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, the EU at some point decided that countries of entry ... would be used like a parking lot for refugees who want to come to Europe.”\n\nThe EU is struggling to overcome divisions among its members over rules for refugee settlement and border protection but wants a new migration pact to be hammered out next year.\n\nNegotiations have shifted from resettlement quotas, which many eastern European countries have rejected, to a proposed voluntary mechanism.\n\nMitarachi welcomed a reported proposal that refugees could be granted free movement after a three-year waiting period, but warned that resettlement was likely to remain a major sticking point.\n\nHe told reporters: “If we don’t see progress on the issue of solidarity, a (new deal) won’t make it past the EU Council or lawmakers\" in the next few years.\n\nGreece was a key transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the EU in 2015-16, many fleeing wars in Iraq and Syria. It has since toughened its borders and built a steel wall along its land border with Turkey.\n\n___ Follow all AP stories on migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "2nd camp harboring terrorists in Greece opened next to Lavrion: Sources": "A second camp that is harboring terrorists was opened in Greece next to the existing notorious Lavrion camp, sources said amid increasing tensions between Ankara and Athens.\n\nA Turkish official told Daily Sabah that although Athens rejected claims that Lavrion has become a breeding ground for terrorists, Ankara has discovered another camp similar to Lavrion had been opened. “We are in a very fragile process,” the official said regarding bilateral ties.\n\nGreece has long been accused of being a favorite hideout for terrorists from the DHKP-C and PKK. Those fleeing Türkiye have taken shelter in refugee camps in Lavrion near Athens under the guise of being asylum-seekers, especially in the 1980s. Despite the closure of Lavrion in 2013 amid pressure from Türkiye, Greece continues to be the primary destination for DHKP-C terrorists.\n\nFootage from the camp shows that it has turned into a base for PKK terrorists.\n\nThe camp seen resembles a terrorist base, with terrorist symbols and pictures of its imprisoned ringleader Abdullah Öcalan adorning its walls.\n\nFurthermore, a diplomatic official had told Daily Sabah previously that “there is everything ranging from the DHKP-C, the PKK and FETÖ (Gülenist Terror Group) and the location of all of them is known.”\n\nThe aim is that these groups could be used one day against Türkiye, the official said. “An EU member country in the 21st century is openly feeding terrorists. The PKK is a terrorist group and designated as such by both the EU and the U.S,” explained the official.\n\n“Athens is not a transit country for terrorists anymore, but the direct target country.”\n\nAthens has also rejected Ankara’s extradition requests for terrorists from groups advocating armed insurgency against the state and had been involved in armed attacks against Turkish security forces and political parties, in addition to other targets.\n\nRejected extradition requests include members of the outlawed terrorist group The Revolutionary Left (Dev-Sol), members of the DHKP-C, the Turkish (or Kurdish) Hezbollah, the illegal Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP), the THKP-C, the PKK, the illegal Communist Party of Türkiye/Marxist-Leninist (TKP-ML) and from other groups.\n\nMost recently, Turkish police detained a PKK terrorist who received training at the notorious camp in Greece and had been planning to carry out armed and bomb attacks in large cities, Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu had announced.\n\nThe terrorist, identified as Hüsamettin Tanrıkulu, code-named “Delil,” was detained in a joint counterterrorism operation by Istanbul and Diyarbakır police.\n\nHe had entered Türkiye through illegal means after receiving sabotage training at the Lavrion camp in Greece.\n\nAthens permitting the existence of another camp harboring terrorists within its borders comes as relations between Türkiye and Greece hit a new low in recent months.\n\nTürkiye and Greece are at odds over a number of issues, including competing claims over jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean, overlapping claims over their continental shelves, maritime boundaries, air space, energy, the ethnically split island of Cyprus, the status of the islands in the Aegean Sea and migrants.\n\nAnkara accuses Athens of illegally militarizing Greek islands in the East Aegean and questions Greece's sovereignty over them. There is also a dispute over the exploitation of mineral resources in the Aegean.\n\nAmong the most recent developments that flared tensions was the harassment by two Greek coast guard boats of a cargo ship in international waters, continued pushbacks by Greek elements recorded by Turkish unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the harassment of Turkish fighter jets under a NATO mission by Greece’s Russian-made S-300s.\n\nIt was reported recently that Turkish jets on a reconnaissance mission, flying in international airspace, had been harassed by the Greek defense system stationed on Crete. Athens rejects the claims.\n\nTürkiye is planning to submit to NATO and its allies the radar logs showing how a Greek S-300 air defense system locked on to Turkish F-16 jets during a mission in international airspace, sources said last week. Türkiye has also lodged a protest and demanded an explanation and investigation from Greece into an incident that was \"totally in violation of international laws,\" according to Turkish diplomatic sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the Greek government wrote letters to NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, asking them to formally condemn what they claim is \"increasingly aggressive talk\" by Turkish officials in response to the continued Greek violations, and suggesting that tensions could escalate into open conflict.",

    "The Column: Lowell mayor travels to Greece on city's dime": "EIGHT LOWELL officials and their family members are currently sightseeing in Kalamata, Greece, the city’s new cultural and economic partner across the Atlantic. It’s a union that both sides hope will be prosperous, as they aim to establish study abroad programming, strengthen imports and exports, and support the rich history of Greek Americans in Lowell.\n\nIt’s a once-in-a-lifetime trip for many in the delegation, including Mayor Sokhary Chau — it’s his first time in Europe, which he said he will not take for granted. Prior to his departure, Chau said he was especially excited to learn about the history of Kalamata and explore the main ancient ruins for personal enlightenment.\n\n“Greece to me is really the foundation of democracy,” Chau said in an interview. “The history of Greece especially, I only read them in books. Now I’m going to go experience that firsthand… I’m going to walk the footsteps of Socrates.”\n\nIt’s a nice sentiment, but undeniably tourist-y. Isn’t this supposed to be a business trip?\n\nWell, there are other, more “professional” excursions during the seven-day visit, including conversations with administrators from the University of the Peloponnese, a trip to the Greek Parliament and a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Greece.\n\nBut a big question has emerged in the wake of the journey: Who’s paying for it?\n\nChau isn’t.\n\nHis airfare alone cost the city of Lowell $1,470.07, but it’s all in an effort “to foster cultural, educational, tourism, and business collaboration,” according to a letter he addressed to the City Council on Sept. 8. And he’s allegedly brought his wife and his son with him.\n\nThe city also approved Chau an additional $50 a day over eight days, which includes that first day of travel, and all together totals $1,870.07. It’s unclear where exactly this money is coming from.\n\nFor context, Chau makes about $30,000 a year as mayor, an increase from the $21,000 that the council approved in 2016. Comparatively, other councilors earn $25,000 annually, and City Manager Tom Golden gets a whopping $235,000.\n\nThe delegation left for Greece the evening of Sept. 21, arriving in Athens at 12:30 p.m. Thursday.\n\nFormer Lowell Mayor Bill Samaras spoke at the Sept. 13 council meeting, offering some background into establishing the sister cities, which has been a long time coming, given COVID-related interruptions.\n\nSamaras said he is pleased to see the partnership finally come to fruition, and the two countries will only benefit in many ways by working together.\n\n“It’s our hope as a group that we will be a model for the rest of the city for the creation of more sister cities,” Samaras said. “Because Lowell certainly is a welcoming city, a city of all groups and for all groups. This allows all groups to hold onto their heritage, and it makes us a stronger city, a stronger country.”\n\nInterestingly, Samaras didn’t ask for the council to fund his trip, nor did Dimitrios Mattheos, a board member of the Federation of Hellenic-American Societies of New England who was also at the council meeting and is part of the delegation. It appears as though Chau is the only one asking for the taxpayers to fund him.\n\nThis might be an issue of bad timing, too.\n\nResidents are facing a proposed 5.5% property tax increase in the next fiscal year, which the City Council voted to approve very recently. Many people voiced their displeasure with the motion back in June, so to have their sitting mayor take more money from their pockets probably isn’t sitting right with them.\n\nThe Sun actually received an email drawing attention to the “source of funding” for the international visit, referencing a previous article on the challenges many unhoused people in the city face, as well as their often fraught relationships with businesses in Downtown Lowell.\n\nAre our city officials’ priorities mixed up? How might they justify funding an overseas trip when there is a demonstrated lack of resources and support for people living right here, blocks from their offices?\n\nThere was absolutely no mention of the specific funding for the trip during last week’s council meeting, and Chau spoke very little, only to move the proceedings along. He did thank the police and other local government officials for their work accommodating Kalamata Mayor Athanasios Vasilopoulos and company.\n\n“It was great welcoming the Kalamata mayor’s delegation to the city of Lowell,” Chau said. “(What) made it possible was the support of the city managers and the chief of the police that provided the escort service and made sure that they would enjoy their stay in Lowell.”\n\nNo councilors offered any input, and a quick vote sealed Chau’s finances.\n\nThe best defense is good offense — not to give offense\n\nTHE “BAD Boys” of the Detroit Pistons were players you loved if you were a Pistons fan, and they were players you loved to hate, if you weren’t.\n\nTheir defense-oriented style of play was both theatrical swagger and physical intimidation. They rode their no-holds-bared playmaking all the way to back-to-back NBA championships in 1989 and 1990.\n\nSwagger, intimidation and theatrics are certainly key components of today’s political or politicized class, which seems to model itself on the Bad Boys’ methods and over-the-top displays (center Bill Laimbeer’s dramatic flops were legendary).\n\nWhich brings us to the 50 Venezuelan immigrants who were transported — across state lines, and allegedly through deceptive means — from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, took almost gleeful credit for the stunt, saying that liberals’ (read: Democrats) surprise and indignation at how the migrants came into their community was “virtue-signaling” and “a fraud.”\n\nHe was referring to the fact that the cities to which migrants have been transported by Floridian and Texan taxpayers — like Washington, D.C., New York City and Chicago — are designated as sanctuary cities, or municipalities that offer sanctuary from federal immigration law.\n\nHow do you like those immigrants on your doorstep, now? DeSantis taunted. The southern border is the point of entry for an ongoing massive human migration from our Mexican and Central American neighbors — even South American neighbors. The fact that this took place during Latino Heritage Month lent a cynical and callous air to the ploy.\n\nOn the surface, it was an effective Bad Boys-style move. Catch your opponent off guard, harass them with constant badgering and trash-talking, inflame the crowd, throw sharp elbows, dish out hard fouls when the refs aren’t looking and claim the high ground as the aggrieved party when called out (a la the Laimbeer flop).\n\nBut are these the kind of moves that can win the Nov. 8 electoral championship? Is that the point of these seemingly choreographed events? Or are these just random acts of chaos to disrupt and destabilize our political conversation, further polarizing an already divided electorate?\n\nFormer Massachusetts state Sen. Dean Tran, a Republican 3rd Congressional District candidate, issued a statement this week that called the Martha’s Vineyard crisis an “unconscionable double standard.”\n\n“The Martha’s Vineyard incident highlights the sheer hypocrisy of the Biden-Pelosi and Trahan immigration policy,” read the statement. U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan holds the seat Tran is campaigning for.\n\n“As a former immigrant myself, whose family desperately sought refuge from Communist aggression, I am acutely aware of the fear and uncertainty immigrants face because I have experienced it myself,” Tran wrote.\n\nThe statement went on to say that moving the migrants from the small island community to the former Camp Edwards military base, 33 miles away on Cape Cod, “unmasked the nascent racism and exclusively of Martha’s Vineyard, a community that ardently supports the Biden regime.”\n\nTran called Biden’s immigration policy “non-existent.”\n\nPerhaps Abbott, DeSantis — maybe even Tran — are running these kinds of incidents “up the flagpole” to see how they play out. If it plays well with their base, expect to see more internal “migrations.”\n\nThe Bad Boys tactics worked exceeding well with their Detroit fan base, who packed the stands at their games. Eventually a series of debilitating player injuries — no doubt due to their aggressive play — as well as the high-flying, smooth moves of a shooting guard named Michael “Air” Jordan, who could switch the ball between hands while in flight to make a basket, ended the Bad Boys era forever.\n\nIt’s for the electorate to say if the smash-mouth, meat-head, gutter-style Bad Boys politics has also run its course because an “Air” Jordan is on the scene.\n\nTran’s statement suggests he could be that change agent.\n\n“When elected to the U.S. Congress, I will work tirelessly to develop and implement reform to our immigration laws that will improve opportunities for legal immigration, but will also protect the nation from the chaos that we are witnessing now,” he wrote.\n\nWith less than 45 days to the general election, it will soon be up to the voters as to whether they want a Bad Boy or an Air Jordan-style candidate leading the 3rd District.\n\nTrahan, in contrast to her Republican opponent, was one of several federal lawmakers to sign onto a letter led by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey urging the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Inspector General to review “Florida’s apparent misuse of federal pandemic relief funds from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund,” according to a Sept. 16 press release.\n\n“According to reports, Florida has used federal funds intended to help communities recover from the coronavirus pandemic for an inhumane program to transport newly arrived immigrants,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. “We believe this program misuses federal COVID-19 relief funds and violates federal law.\n\n“We request that you investigate Florida and take all necessary action — including potentially rescinding any misused funds — to stop this abuse of coronavirus relief programs,” the lawmakers continued. “States should not be permitted to use COVID-19 relief funds for any parochial interest unrelated to the pandemic, particularly for naked political conduct that imposes severe and unjust harms on disadvantaged groups of individuals.”\n\nOne MVP in the migrant story is a small nonprofit called La Colaborativa, in Chelsea, which works to provide lifesaving supports to community members living through a pandemic in Massachusetts’ hardest-hit city.\n\nExecutive Director Gladys Vega said donations have substantially increased since the migrant crisis hit the news, saying her organization is “proud to be a destination for these families and we will continue welcoming them with open arms.”\n\nVega said that in keeping with its sanctuary city focus, La Colaborativa welcomes immigrants with compassionate, experienced and bilingual staff in a safe and confidential space. They’ve been seeing more of them “come out of the shadows for services” since the Martha’s Vineyard crisis.\n\n“We make sure they have food, clothing, shelter, jobs, doctors, medication, and lawyers,” Vega said. “Whatever they need, we will find a way thanks to key partnerships with our local schools, hospitals, city departments, and legal partners. All of this is done with the highest level of dignity and care.”\n\nSounds like a full-court press, with a championship team, scoring points and winning fans and games with a high-flying style.\n\nMaybe the best defense is a good offense — not by giving offense.\n\nThis week’s Column was prepared by reporters Cameron Morsberger in Lowell and Melanie Gilbert on the Martha’s Vineyard migrant issue.",

    "Social attacks continue in Greece despite end of enhanced EU financial surveillance": "On August 20, the so-called enhanced financial surveillance of Greece by European Union (EU) lenders ended. After 12 years of austerity dictates and strict control of the Greek budget, the finance ministers of the eurozone countries and EU Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni voted in favour of this step.\n\nGreek and European politicians alike exceeded each other with their excessive flattery and promises. An “historic day for Greece and all Greeks,” proclaimed Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the right-wing conservative Nea Dimokratia (ND), predicting a new beginning “full of growth, unity and prosperity.”\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the Thessaloniki International Fair on Sept. 10 [AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos]\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that Greece could now close this chapter “thanks to the determination and resilience” of its people and “look to the future with confidence.”\n\nTo decipher the phrases, replace “prosperity” with poverty, “confidence in the future” with fear of job loss, “resilience” with suffering and hardship. What is being celebrated here as a chapter closed and an historic new beginning means the Greek population faces the continuation of austerity and aggravation of the social crisis over further decades.\n\nThe cost of the loans of almost €289 billion that Greece received from the EU in three “memorandum” programs in recent years was paid by the working class with income losses of 25 percent, mass unemployment and pension cuts. With public debt at 189.3 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2022, the country remains at the top of the EU debt table. According to Eurostat, Greece recorded the highest youth unemployment rate (28.6 percent) and the second highest unemployment rate (11.4 percent) after Spain in the month of July.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the EU, under German leadership, has used Greece as the spearhead of its austerity policies. Within a few years, with the help of the trade unions and pseudo-left parties, led by the Syriza government (2015-2019), it broke the strong resistance of the working class and lowered living standards to the level of a developing country. In response to the pandemic and NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine, European governments are building on the Greek experience and intensifying social attacks across Europe.\n\nWhat does the end of “enhanced surveillance” mean? The mechanism had been adopted in 2018 for a period of four years following Greece’s formal exit from the so-called “bailout” programs of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB)—the “Troika” for short. Greece had to continue to pass regular quarterly budget audits by creditors in order to obtain debt relief and access to the capital market. Now, far from ending this scrutiny, there will only be a transition to “simple surveillance,” with semi-annual rather than quarterly reviews.\n\nLike other European countries, including Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal, Greece will remain under EU control until 75 percent of its loans are paid off. According to the Greek newspaper Ethnos that would be in 2059, following current calculations, and as late as 2070 according to other sources. That means that for up to 50 more years, the EU’s dictates will continue, inevitably involving austerity measures and privatization.\n\nThe latest move gives Greece greater budgetary freedom, but it will not be to the benefit of the working class. Above all, the Greek elite—as well as Europe’s corporations and banks—have in mind incentives for investments and lucrative business deals. Greek Finance Minister Christos Staikouras stressed that the new regulation would strengthen the country’s position on the world market and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nThe EU had ordered a rigorous privatization policy and the systematic erosion of the welfare state, labour laws and the right to strike in order to turn Greece into a low-wage country. Having bled the country dry economically and socially, transnational corporations are falling over the spoils like vultures. Governments of all political stripes, especially the previous government under Syriza, privatized state-owned assets on a massive scale, selling them off to international companies and shareholders on favourable terms.\n\nThis month, the privatization process for the ports of Igoumenitsa and Alexandroupoli is entering the next round. While the former is an important link to Italy, the latter is currently of great geopolitical significance. The northern Greek port of Alexandroupoli serves as a hub for NATO arms deliveries to Ukraine in the war against Russia. The sale of state-owned natural gas company DEPA Infrastructure, which owns stakes in 7,500 kilometres of gas networks, to Italy’s Italgas was also completed in early September.\n\nMitsotakis also hopes to attract large investments via closer ties with reactionary regimes such as the al-Sisi dictatorship in Egypt and the Gulf monarchy of the United Arab Emirates, with which he negotiated a Strategic Partnership in 2020 and signed 12 agreements and the establishment of an investment fund this year.\n\nGerman corporations are also benefiting. Frankfurt-based flight operator Fraport bought the rights to 14 Greek regional airports. IT companies are taking advantage of access to cheap skilled labour, including Göppingen-based software company Teamviewer, which in 2020 opened a site in the city of Ioannina in northern Epirus, one of Greece’s poorest regions. Companies such as Essen-based utility RWE, Bremen-based solar and wind farm developer wpd and Germany’s largest wind turbine manufacturer Enercon are also getting involved in the wind energy and solar markets.\n\nWhile rents and housing expenses for Greek workers rose rapidly in 2022, especially in metropolitan areas such as Athens, the luxury real estate market in Greece is celebrating a record year, according to real estate agency Sotheby’s International Realty, with wealthy buyers coming mainly from the United Kingdom, United States and France.\n\nThe Greek government boasts of economic growth of 8 percent of GDP last year and an expected 4 percent in 2022. It is using this as window dressing, which has little to do with the real situation, to distract attention in the run-up to next year’s elections from the deep political crisis that has gripped it and the entire ruling class. ND is not only shaken by a far-reaching wiretapping scandal that is exposing the authoritarian tendencies of its rule. It also fears an escalation of social tensions in the face of skyrocketing prices for food, electricity, and heating gas.\n\nIn his opening speech at the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, which ran this week, Mitsotakis promised a package of €5.5 billion for 2022 and 2023. This includes minimal special payments for low-income earners, families, pensioners, farmers and students, as well as relief for businesses, funding for the tourism industry and higher salaries for the armed forces, according to Euronews.\n\nThe official inflation rate was 11.4 percent in August. According to the latest figures from the Greek Statistical Office, bread and cereal products cost 18.5 percent more, dairy products 18 percent, and oils 25.5 percent. Travel costs also rose rapidly: airline tickets were 71 percent more expensive, ship tickets 25.4 percent and taxis around 33 percent—and that in a country with countless islands, where many people rely on ship and air transport. Even before the Ukraine war, prices for most foodstuffs were at the same level as in Germany, while the official minimum monthly wage is only about a third at €663 euros.\n\nAs in other European countries, the price explosions in the energy sector are particularly glaring: the price of natural gas rose by 261.3 percent in one year, heating oil by 65 percent and electricity by 38.5 percent.\n\nIn early September, speaking on Mega TV, Adonis Georgiadis, Minister of Development and Investment, warned of the “worst winter since 1942” and blamed the situation on “Putin’s energy war against Europe.” Georgiadis—a well-known right-winger who began his career as a historian and publisher and was a deputy for the ultra-right Laos Party before joining ND—knows exactly what he is talking about.\n\nUnder the yoke of Nazi occupation in Greece during World War II, tens of thousands died in the 1941-1942 Winter of Hunger. The Nazis had plundered the economy for their military campaigns and starved the population. During the unusually cold winter, many people also froze to death because fuel was confiscated. The gruesome images of emaciated starving people and piles of corpses in the capital Athens still make one shudder today.\n\nWith his comparison to the winter famine of 1941/1942, Georgiadis is directing an open threat to the Greek population. Not Putin, but the sanctions and rearmament mania of the NATO powers has led to the collapse of gas supplies from Russia and the price speculation of powerful corporate monopolies.\n\nGreece is one of the closest allies of the US and Germany in the war, spending 3.59 percent of GDP on its military apparatus even before the outbreak of war in 2021, according to NATO figures—more than all other NATO countries, including the US. On Friday, the Greek Defence Ministry confirmed the start of a so-called back-fill operation with Germany. Athens will supply Ukraine with 40 Soviet-designed BMP-1 tanks. In return, Greece will receive 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles from Berlin.\n\nThe burden of the war policy is to be shouldered by working people. That is why they are already being prepared for a new “winter of hunger.”\n\nThe fascistic attitude contained in the government’s reaction to the human emergency could be seen on Tuesday when Deputy Minister of the Interior Stelios Petsas addressed the media. On the morning program on the ANT television channel, he referred to the gigantic increase in the price of natural gas and urged households with a natural gas supply to make an expensive switch to heating oil (whose price is also increasing sharply). When asked by a journalist if there will be solutions provided for affected households, he said, “In these cases, the main thing is to show adaptation. Those who don’t want to adapt will unfortunately die.”\n\nThis is the Social Darwinist logic of survival of the fittest in the “struggle for existence” pursued by the Greek ruling class in the last three years of the pandemic, with its herd immunity policy of allowing infections to run wild, and in the preceding years of austerity policies under the dictates of the Troika.\n\nPetsas’ statements triggered an outcry on social media and an exchange of blows with the opposition Syriza party in parliament. In fact, however, he was merely stating bluntly what has been the mindset of the Greek elite and international capital for years. In order for stock market profits to continue to soar, workers are supposed to starve, freeze and die. Or as Marx once wrote, “To the outcry as to the physical and mental degradation, the premature death, the torture of overwork, it [capital] answers: Ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits?”\n\nWith the same determination with which the capitalist class defends its profits, workers must take up the struggle and prevent a winter of war and hunger. For this they need a socialist perspective and their own party. Contact the WSWS to prepare for the formation of a Greek section of the International Committee of the Fourth International.",

    "Greece Is for Tourists": "As a smallish country of only 10.3 million people, Greece is already set to beat the country’s 2019 record of 33.1 million foreign visitors, now welcoming more than 1 million travelers a week, according to Greek Tourism Minister Vassilis Kikilias. Hotels on popular Greek islands are fully booked through late September—well beyond the traditional season—and celebrity spotting has become a sport.

Images of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, actress Demi Moore, and rapper 50 Cent are being posted from the bars of Mykonos, the waters of the Ionian Sea, and the yachts of the Cyclades.\n\nBut ordinary Greeks are not basking in Greece’s successful summer.\n\nTourists pose for selfies at the foot of the Acropolis.\n\n“Greece is for tourists only,” said Amalia Zavacopoulou, a single working mother from Athens. “Everything is more expensive, from fuel to something as simple as a souvlaki [a Greek staple street food],” and ordinary Greeks, she said, are struggling to keep up with the budgets of their foreign guests.\n\nHer electricity bills have risen nearly 50 percent since before the pandemic. Fuel costs in Greece have risen by more than 23 percent this year due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Russian efforts to starve Europe of energy. Greece relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its natural gas, so it has been hit particularly hard.\n\nInflation hit 12 percent this summer, its highest level in 29 years, according to data released by Eurostat, the official statistical authority of the European Union. And in a nation where the minimum wage is 713 euros per month, more than 43 percent of the labor force can’t afford to take a holiday, according to a survey by the European Trade Union Institute. Return ferry tickets to an island last year for a family of four, including a car, cost around 600 euros.\n\nThis year, it’s over 850 euros, according to the Greek Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy. The cheapest hotel on the Greek island of Mykonos this week costs at least 200 euros per night. That’s prohibitive even for most middle class Greeks. In total, a family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary. And that’s before accounting for food, drinks, and restaurant costs.\n\nPort officials direct traffic from a ferry in Piraeus, Greece.\n\nGraffiti is seen in central Athens.\n\n\n\nYet Athenians’ biggest complaint of all is the rise in rent.\n\n“We in Greece had the big financial problems of 2010 to 2016. We recovered. Everything went well, and then came COVID, and then the war,” said Giorgios Stampoulos, an Athens cab driver for over 22 years. “Now, the tourists came back. We have a lot of tourists. … But the problem is we can’t afford an apartment because it’s all Airbnb for tourists, and if you find something, they want double or triple from last year.”\n\nBefore the pandemic, a modest two-bedroom apartment in central Athens would rent for roughly 300 euros a month. Now, the monthly price is at least 550 euros. Prices in large part have soared as tourists, expatriates, and digital nomads are making the most of the capital’s comparatively low rents and living costs. “If you have a Western European salary, Athens is a good base,” said 27-year-old Ben Biasi, a French tourist strolling through the pedestrian backstreets of Athens’s Plaka neighborhood.\n\nGiorigios Stampoulos waits for tourists arriving at Athens International Airport.\n\nTaxis and buses wait outside Athens International Airport.\n\n“Let’s go to an island, buy a house, and work from the house!” he said to his group of friends.\n\nCompanies like Airbnb and Booking.com have been catering to not only tourists but those seeking longer-term stays. One such company is Blueground, which has more than 1,000 fully furnished apartments in Athens, rented out to mostly U.S. citizens for around 1,200 euros per month.\n\n“Business is a booming! It’s good,” said Demetri Geras, 27, from Blueground. “They come for the sun. It’s the Florida of Europe.”\n\nA family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary.\n\nAs a Greek-American with family here, however, Geras recognizes the hardships that Greeks are facing. “Most of the youth here are living with their parents. They make less than 1,000 euros a month, so they can’t move out.” Although he works in property, Geras sees the problem as a lack of fair employment opportunity and remuneration from employers.\n\n“We can point fingers at people in real estate, but it’s almost criminal how much [Greeks] get paid,” he said. “They are almost starving. … Wages are not so great due to austerity measures and low Greek minimum wage. Food and rent have gone up. Homeowners have raised their Airbnb prices for foreigners who are coming to Athens. And Greeks are the ones paying the price.”\n\nA street vendor sits in central Athens.\n\nOne of those people paying the price is street artist and graphic designer Kostas Sergiou, 36. “I’m struggling,” he said. “In March, I had a health problem, a panic attack. … The cause was stress.” Sergiou’s landlady put up his rent, and now, he’s struggling to find the money to pay his bills.\n\nSummer holidays are sacred to Greeks, and most Athenians tend to flee the city heat for vacations on the coast or mountains. Sergiou is staying put. “I prefer to stay here because I feel less stressed. … For us Greeks, it’s cheaper to go on a trip outside Greece than to an island.”\n\nTourists pose for a selfie in Monastiraki Square in Athens.\n\nTourists walk through the Monastiraki Flea Market in Athens.\n\n\n\nDespite the economic hardships, Greeks are still finding ways to have a break. Drive along the coast from Athens to the ancient Temple of Poseidon, known as Sounio, this summer, and you will find lines of parked cars dotted around rocky swimming holes. The so-called Athenian Riviera is packed.\n\nAs city residents seek swims closer to home, Greeks also continue to have a relatively high level of property ownership within their families, and many Greeks are choosing to take breaks at their family homes or with friends who own property. Others are finding cheaper alternatives like “free camping,” playing a cat-and-mouse game with authorities as they erect tents along the coast before being told to move on or saturating areas where it is tolerated, such as the far-flung Greek island of Tilos, which has seen a spike in campers this year.\n\nOthers, still, are going abroad to European destinations like Berlin, Sergiou said, as Greece becomes unaffordable.\n\nBut amid it all, a trace of traditional Greek attitudes remains. “Open your Instagram, and you see everyone splashing about. … Summer is summer,” Sergiou said. “Greek people will go wherever they can and face their problems in September.”",
    "How Bitcoin ATMs in Greece fare during a record-breaking tourist season": "Greece is globally recognized for its touristic lures of idyllic beaches and a laid-back lifestyle. Prior to the outbreak of the global pandemic, the World Travel and Tourism Council said that tourism generated over one-fifth of Greece’s total GDP.\n\nThis year, the country faced a record number of travelers during its summer tourism season. In the month of August alone, the country received nearly 1 million travel arrivals per week, according to the Greek Minister of Tourism Vassilis Kikilias.\n\nA report from ForwardKeys on this year’s summer tourism revealed that, of the top ten “sun and beach” locations in Europe, Greece held six spaces. These included the island destinations of Mykonos, Thira (Santorini) and Heraklion (Crete), as well as Thessaloniki. Athens, the country’s capital, took third place for “urban” destinations in Europe.\n\nOf the 27 European Union member states, Greece takes the sixth spot in terms of cryptocurrency ATMs, with 64 active for usage. Over half of Greece’s crypto ATMs are shared between Athens and Thessaloniki.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ATM operator BCash strategically placed some of its ATMs in the country’s trendy island destinations of Mykonos, Santorini and Crete. Cointelegraph spoke with the managing director and co-founder of BCash, Dimitrios Tsangalidis, on how crypto is impacted by or itself impacts the tourism season in Greece.\n\nAlthough Mykonos and Santorini are the most visited tourist destinations, the mainland ATMs have the majority of traffic, according to Tsangalidis — especially central Athens, where the first ATM was installed, and Thessaloniki.\n\nHowever, the co-founder noted that in Crete, the country’s most populated island and a popular tourist destination, there is a \"very loyal cryptocurrency crowd.\"\n\n“There is a strong crypto community in Heraklion of Crete [which is] the location of one of our ATMs.\"\n\nIn Heraklion, the capital of Crete, the local start-up accelerator H2B Hub collaborated with the Greek-speaking University of Nicosia to create and support a local blockchain community.\n\nBoth Athens and Thessaloniki have active, regular meetups for the crypto and blockchain community.\n\nWhile tourism bolsters parts of the Greek economy, according to Tsangalidis, it doesn’t translate to the crypto scene. “Unfortunately, the absolute opposite happens,” says Tsangalidis.\n\n“In summer months and high tourist seasons, the demand drops. But we are in the middle of crypto winter that came earlier this year, so it is really hard to tell.\"\n\nEspecially in terms of regular traffic, the decrease can also be equated to locals leaving for vacation.\n\nRelated: Tourists flock to El Salvador despite Bitcoin bear market\n\nIn general, Greece needs more awareness of cryptocurrencies and their utility in everyday life, Tsangalidis sums up.\n\n“Influence on local tourism can be noticeable only if there is a general adoption of cryptocurrency within society.”\n\nHe adds that for now, there is little to no infrastructure or adoption from the level of Greek businesses and local governments. “If our government will become crypto friendly and if a green light will be given to businesses, then adoption will follow.”\n\nIn May of this year, the president of the Greek National Tourism Organization, Angela Gerekou, said the country is currently exploring how blockchain technology can bring about safety and transparency in tourism.",
    "Türkiye commemorates victims of Greece's Tripolitsa massacre": "The Turkish president on Friday marked the anniversary of the Tripolitsa massacre committed by the Greeks during the Greek revolt that started in the Peloponnese in 1821, the year Greece separated from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn a Twitter post, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Türkiye has not forgotten and will never forget the Tripolice Massacre, which took place on Sept. 23, 1821, \"in which thousands of Muslim Turks, our Albanian brothers and Jews were brutally and barbarically murdered.\"\n\nOn Sept. 23, 1821, tens of thousands of Muslims and Jews were massacred by the Greeks in Tripolitsa, a strategic city in the southern Peloponnese region of today’s Greece.\n\nTurks in Peloponnese faced not only death but also starvation and captivity. The Ottoman Jews living in the region also faced Greek atrocities and lost their lives due to famine, misery and plunder.\n\nTürkiye still criticizes Greece for its unwelcoming stance toward its Muslim population. For instance, up until recently, Athens was known as the only European capital without a mosque, even though there are an estimated 300,000 Muslims in the greater Athens area. Back in November 2020, for the first time since the 19th century, Athens witnessed the inauguration of an official mosque, as years of efforts by the Muslim community finally paid off.\n\nGreece was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, until 1829 when the Greek population succeeded in gaining independence from the empire. At the time, there were many mosques and other Ottoman architecture all over Greece. However, the riots and independence triggered a wave during which all such architecture was damaged or removed, eventually leaving Athens without any mosque. In fact, Athens' lack of mosques is a norm for the majority of the Greek cities as the only officially sanctioned mosques in the country are in the northern border region with Turkey where up to 150,000 members of the Turkish minority live.\n\nTürkiye has long decried Greek violations of the rights of its Muslim and Turkish minority, from closing down mosques and letting historic mosques fall into disrepair, to refusing to recognize Muslims' election of their own muftis. These measures violate the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne as well as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) verdicts, making Greece a state that flouts the law, Turkish officials say.\n\nSimilarly, the election of muftis, or Islamic clerics, by Muslims in Greece has become yet another point of contention that caused trouble for the Muslims in the country. Even though it is regulated by the 1913 Treaty of Athens, a Greek-Ottoman Empire pact that was implemented by Athens in 1920, that the community will be able to elect their own muftis, in 1991, in violation of international law, Greece annulled the treaty and unlawfully started to appoint the muftis itself. The muftis appointed by the Greek state have since usurped local Muslims' right of jurisdiction on family and inheritance matters. The majority of Muslim Turks in Western Thrace do not recognize muftis appointed by the Greek state and instead elect their own.",

    "Diaspora Greeks discover Greece": "In the last two to three years, something unprecedented and particularly optimistic has happened. Thousands of our compatriots from the distant diasporas of the US, Australia and Canada have discovered Greece. To some extent, this happened because of the coronavirus pandemic. Our country stood out in the way it dealt with it, while there were quite a few people who decided to come to Greece and work from here.\n\nAt the same time, the country’s brand improved dramatically, becoming fashionable again, after many decades. It is impressive how popular Greek destinations are in the US and Canada. But the trend is being led by people who have nothing to do with what we used to think of as the “uncle from Brooklyn.” We are talking about the second- and third-generation Greeks who have studied and improved spectacularly in terms of education and living standards.\n\nBut these people also come to their country and are surprised to find that Greece is not the “poor relation” that they had in their minds from their grandparents’ time. It is a country with a high level of services in some areas, with roads and infrastructure much better than those of big American cities and people who combine professionalism with warmth. They are enthusiastic about what they discover, from Greek wines to museums and of course the more relaxed way of life. They visit their ancestral villages and search for their roots. Some go a step further and try to find out how to acquire Greek citizenship.\n\nFor years we have been looking for ways to bring the diaspora closer to the homeland. Over the years, it became clear that this cannot be done through state-fed pharaonic schemes. After all, the basic condition for their return was to make Greece more attractive for them. Of course, the ties with the country were maintained and, in difficult times, various organizations played a decisive role by bring young diaspora Greeks either for the summer or for a year of university studies.\n\nBut what we are seeing now is a new phenomenon. It fills us with joy and optimism because our compatriots are returning to their places of origin and are Greece’s best possible representatives and ambassadors.\n\nYou hear them talk about the country and you feel like you’re getting an antidote to the usual domestic misery and cynicism that – unfortunately – manages to gobble up even the usually forgiving Greek sun.",
    "Turkey-Greece Tensions Could Disrupt NATO Unity, Experts Warn": "Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have been at loggerheads for decades over territorial and airspace claims in and over the Aegean Sea. As the historic rivals escalate their war of words, analysts warn about the risk of current tension spilling into NATO business at a time when there is a need to focus on unity against Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest spat began when Turkey accused its neighbor of locking onto Turkish fighter jets with its Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems deployed on the island of Crete. Ankara also said Greek pilots placed Turkish aircraft under a radar lock over the Eastern Mediterranean during a NATO mission last month.\n\nAthens dismissed Turkish claims and accused the country of violating its airspace.\n\nAs both countries lodged complaints with NATO about the incidents, the deletion of a tweet by NATO Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) congratulating Turkey on its Victory Day, following a demarche by Greece, caused fury in Ankara.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doubled down when he spoke earlier this week at Teknofest, an event dubbed as Turkey’s biggest aviation and aerospace festival.\n\n“Look at history.

Don’t forget Izmir,” he said, alluding to a defeat of occupying Greek forces in the western city in 1922.\n\nHe echoed those words earlier this week, warning “Turkey could come all of a sudden one night.”\n\nHis remarks were perceived by Greek officials as threats, suggesting Turkey could take military action against the Aegean Sea islands. Athens says it is ready to defend its sovereignty.\n\nGreek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias asked NATO, European Union partners and the United Nations to formally condemn what he described as “outrageous and increasingly aggressive talk by Turkish officials” in letters addressed to three international bodies, copies of which were seen by The Associated Press.\n\nIn a statement sent to VOA, a State Department representative called on the two allies to resolve their differences diplomatically.\n\nPointing to the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Washington said statements that could raise tensions between NATO allies are “particularly unhelpful,” adding “Greece’s sovereignty over the islands is not in question.”\n\nThe Pentagon did not comment on Turkish claims that Greece locked its S-300 surface-to-air missiles onto Turkey’s jets last week but said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin emphasized the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue during his previous talks with Turkish and Greek counterparts.\n\nPossibility of war\n\n\n\nDeep-rooted friction brought Turkey and Greece almost to the point of war three times in the last 50 years.\n\nAnalysts speaking to VOA say they don’t see a resolution any time soon, noting the troubled history of bilateral relations and the “tight politics” in the two nations’ capitals.\n\n“It will take a mediator who has the skill and some leverage to be able to come up with something that these two nations can agree with. But I don’t see that on the horizon,” said Jim Townsend, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense on European and NATO policy. Townsend is currently an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security Transatlantic Security Program.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who served as NATO supreme allied commander from 2013 to 2016, said the long-standing problems between Turkey and Greece rise and fall over time.\n\n“The leadership in Turkey is pushing the country in certain directions that have caused these tensions to rise once again as they have over the years,” the former top NATO commander said in a phone interview with VOA on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBreedlove, who is now a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said NATO and the United States have managed similar tensions in the past and the alliance is still up to the task.\n\nConcerns about disrupting NATO unity\n\nThe recent spat between Turkey and Greece takes place as NATO is focusing on displaying a united front against Russia in the face of its invasion in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nExperts are worried that if the tension escalates to the point of hostilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin can take advantage.\n\n\n\n“Whatever little cracks can appear in European unity, Putin can make them even larger and in fact split the rock. So, it not only undercuts European unity but also can spill over into NATO councils if one or the other country uses NATO as a weapon to hurt the other,” Townsend said.\n\n\n\nHe warned that those cracks can be exploited by Moscow as winter approaches; Russia has already cut back on its gas exports to Europe.\n\nElection dynamics\n\nTurkey and Greece will both head to the polls for crucial elections next year.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan is said to be facing a major challenge to his 20-year rule amid the country’s economic woes and immigration problems.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in 2019, reportedly suffered a popularity loss to some degree because of rising energy prices partly driven by the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Rhetoric on both sides has always been part of the problem and it’s something that doesn’t help things,” said Townsend.\n\nBreedlove agrees. He believes some of this is “playing to an internal audience.”\n\nBalancing act\n\nThe United States is known to have maintained a balance between regional rivals Turkey and Greece, which it says are both important NATO allies.\n\nAthens and Washington extended a bilateral military agreement for five years and the deal was ratified by the Greek parliament in the summer, days before the Greek prime minister’s visit to Washington in mid-May. The deal gives the U.S. more military access to bases in Greece.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met with his Greek counterpart, Konstantinos Floros, at the Pentagon in July. “The military leaders discussed mutual items of interest,” said a statement from his office.\n\nThat visit was followed by Greek Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos’ visit to the Pentagon July 18 to meet with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The two discussed the “growing defense partnership between the United States and Greece and the close cooperation on basing, [and] defense modernization,” according to a statement from the Pentagon.\n\nThey also discussed “the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nAustin spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, July 25, discussing “the need for continued efforts to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nTurkish and Greek defense requests\n\nGreece is seeking to acquire F-35 fighter jets from the United States. The country formally requested the fighter jets in June.\n\nTurkey was kicked out of the F-35 program because of its purchase of an advanced S-400 missile system from Russia. Ankara wants to buy F-16s and modernization kits from Washington. U.S. weapons sales to foreign countries are subject to congressional approval.\n\nAnalysts argue that Turkey’s decision to buy the Russian S-400 system was a huge blow to defense cooperation between Washington and Ankara, which they say has traditionally been very strong.\n\nTownsend, who spent 30 years at the Pentagon working on Turkey issues, tells VOA that he “mourns the loss of [the] close working relationship with Turkey,” hoping it can be restored again.\n\nHe is hopeful that the United States will be able to provide the F-16s requested by Turkey, saying he thinks the administration — working with Congress — will be able to allow that transfer to happen.\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force General Breedlove maintains the same hope.\n\nFocusing on ‘common threat’\n\nThe former NATO commander argues that Turkey made some security decisions that aligned it more closely with “NATO’s enemy,” in reference to its S-400 purchase from Russia, which was identified as the most significant and direct threat to the allies’ security in NATO’s strategic concept document.\n\n“The enemy is not Greece versus Turkey and Turkey versus Greece. It is NATO versus Russia. I would want Turkey to have that if they can't have the F-35. We need to understand who the enemy is,” Breedlove tells VOA.\n\nHe said the United States would want to move forward with Turkey because it is an incredibly important part of the NATO alliance despite recent lows in the relationship, adding he cannot speak to the policy of the current U.S. government.\n\nBut he also acknowledged that “Greece is a little more aligned with where America wants to go in the area,” saying Washington would want to have the same kind of relationship with Turkey.\n\nHe calls on the United States and Turkey to focus on how they can bring back the same level of cooperation rather than growing apart.\n\nErdogan’s criticism of the West’s Russia policy\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan has recently accused Western nations of provoking Russia, without naming any.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Serbia, he suggested the “West’s policy on Russia was based on provocations.”\n\nHe vowed to continue Turkey’s balancing policy between Russia and Ukraine, adding Russia is not a country that one can underestimate.\n\n“Russia has cut off natural gas now. Prices in Europe have skyrocketed. Everyone now broods on how they will get through this winter,” Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey supplies Ukraine with combat drones, which are used by Kyiv to destroy Russian targets in the conflict.\n\nAnkara also played a role with the United Nations as a mediator to secure the deal that allowed grain exports to resume from the ports in Ukraine. But it has not joined the Western sanctions against Russia.\n\nThis story originated in VOA’s Turkish Service. The service's Dilge Timocin contributed.",
    "Greece incentivizes state workers to save power": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s government on Wednesday announced a carrot-and-stick drive to cut public sector energy use by 10 percent this year, linking compliance to funding and urging state employees to switch off lights and appliances when leaving the office.\n\nEnvironment and Energy Minister Costas Skrekas said Greece wants to cut public sector energy consumption an overall 30 percent by 2030, and will in coming days be making savings recommendations for households and businesses.\n\nGovernments across Europe have been urging their citizens to save energy ahead of this winter’s anticipated crunch in gas supplies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeasures range from tweaking office temperature levels and reducing night-time floodlighting of public buildings to telling people to take shorter and colder showers, or forego neckties to stay cooler.\n\nSkrekas said the government has set up a digital platform to monitor public sector energy use, and will link compliance to funding for budgets, with bonuses for over-performing branches and cuts for those who fail their savings targets.\n\nREAD MORE: Europe is facing an energy crisis as Russia cuts gas. Here’s why\n\n“We are asking everyone working in the public sector to see that there is no pointless use of energy in their workspace,” he told a press conference in Athens. “At the end of the working day, when employees leave they must ensure that their computers are switched off, together with lights and other appliances that are not in use.”\n\nSkrekas said an energy supervisor will be appointed in every building used by the public sector, tasked with ensuring that savings action is taken. Temperature settings will be adjusted for “reasonable use,” windows will be left open at night to cool offices and air-conditioning and heating units will undergo maintenance.\n\nMunicipalities will be pressed to reduce night-time lighting of buildings for decorative purposes, and revise street-lighting time schedules.\n\nThis month, a 640-million-euro program will be launched for the energy upgrade of 2,5 million square meters of buildings used by public sector.\n\nRussia has already cut off gas exports to several EU nations. There are fears that Moscow will use the gas exports as a political weapon to get sanctions against Russia reduced, or even cut the exports to Europe off altogether in the winter when demand peaks.\n\n“Russia is increasing its blackmail of Europe by cutting natural gas flows, and in the end sending energy prices to unprecedented levels,” Skrekas said.\n\nGreece is less dependent on Russian gas imports than other EU countries, and also buys gas from Azerbaijan and North Africa.",
    "Hercules Statue Unearthed in Northern Greece": "Wednesday, September 21, 2022\n\nATHENS, GREECE—The Greek City Times reports that pieces of a larger-than-life-size statue of a youthful Hercules have been unearthed in northern Greece at the ancient city of Philippi by researchers from Aristotle University. The statue, dated to the second century A.D., was found in a city square where two main streets intersected. It appears to have been reused to decorate a building dated to the late Byzantine period in the eighth or ninth century A.D. The figure wore a wreath of vine leaves and held a lion skin in his outstretched left hand. His club was found nearby in pieces.

    "Greece: 30 migrants picked up from islet off Crete": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities say they have picked up a group of 30 people from a wooden boat that had lost steering and was drifting close to the rocky coast of a small islet north of Crete, in the latest case of boats carrying migrants running into trouble in southern Greece.\n\nThe coast guard said Tuesday they had received a distress call on Monday from the boat while it was sailing between Crete and the small island of Antikythera. The wooden motorboat was eventually located near the uninhabited islet of Gramvousa, just off the northwestern tip of Crete.\n\nThe 30 people on board, who included nine minors and four women, were transported to Crete, the coast guard said. There was no immediate information on their nationalities.\n\nIt was the latest of several migrant boats that have run into trouble and ended up on southern Greek islands in recent days. Over the weekend, the coast guard announced it had picked up 69 people on Friday from a sailboat that was drifting and had sent out a distress signal 26 nautical miles (30 miles, 48 kilometers) southwest of the Ionian island of Zakythnos.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe boat had set sail from the Turkish coast near Izmir on Aug. 22 and had been heading to Italy when it ran into trouble, the coast guard said.\n\nThe 69 — 61 people from Iran, two from Afghanistan and six from Turkey — were rescued by a passing cargo ship and taken to the southern mainland coast of Kalamata on Saturday, the coast guard said. The six Turks were arrested on suspicion of migrant smuggling.\n\nEarlier this month, about 240 people arrived on the southern island of Kythera on three sailboats that had also set sail from Turkey and had been aiming directly for Italy.\n\nFor years, the preferred route for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa was the much shorter sea route from Turkey to nearby Greek islands in the eastern Aegean.\n\nBut with Greek authorities increasing patrols in the area and facing persistent reports of pushbacks — summary and illegal deportations of new arrivals back to Turkey without allowing them to apply for asylum — more people are attempting to circumvent Greece and head directly to Italy.\n\nGreece denies it carries out pushbacks, but insists it robustly protects its borders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“No new tactic by smugglers and no new maneuver by Turkey will change our stance,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a speech at the start of a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, where he also touched on migration.\n\n“We save the innocent, we protect our borders, and the other side should look at its own unguarded borders,” he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",
    "8 Reasons You’ll Fall In Love With Greece In The Fall": "Anyone who’s ever been to Greece tends to fall in love with the country and return. With its range of islands with pristine beaches, Greece is a perfect summer destination. Yet don’t overlook Greece for a fall vacation too. Fall — from September through to November — is actually a better time, in my opinion, to visit this beautiful country. Gone are the heaving crowds that make even moving around the islands and sights in the capital difficult in the summer months.\n\nIt’s still warm enough to swim in the sea, and nature changes to give a different insight into the country. It’s a time for hikers to come and comfortably explore the stone pathways as air temperatures during these months average from rarely under 50 degrees Fahrenheit up to 77 in the daytime, depending on whether you choose a mainland or island vacation.\n\nSo let’s explore some reasons why you’ll fall in love with Greece in the fall and make these months your Greek vacation.\n\nAthens Acropolis Photo credit: Rebecca Hall\n\n1. Climb The Acropolis\n\nAthens\n\nOne of the main reasons people visit Athens is to visit the Acropolis. The Parthenon — the remains of the ancient temple dedicated to the Goddess Athena — sits atop this 156-meter hill, making a climb inevitable if you want to see it up close and the gorgeous views from it.\n\nThe best time of the year to climb this monument starts in October, when the daytime average temperature is 68 degrees F, rarely falling below 59 degrees. It’s not cold, but lovely and cool as you ascend the path and steps leading up, meaning it’s the perfect time of year to visit and help you appreciate and fall in love with Greece just that bit more.\n\nPro Tip: Between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. is the Acropolis’s busiest time. An early morning visit is recommended to avoid the crowds, even in the fall. It’s open from 8 a.m.\n\nThessaloniki, Greece’s second largest city Photo credit: Rebecca Hall\n\n2. City Tour Around Thessaloniki\n\nThessaloniki\n\nGreece’s second biggest city, Thessaloniki, is situated in the north of the country. It’s more like a very large town by the coast and boasts a large port, an airport accepting domestic and European flights, and the popular beach promenade where locals and visitors alike stroll and come to watch the sunset.\n\nNearby Aristotle Square has many coffee shops to relax in and sit outside, watching the world go by surrounded by the Commercial Center with its plethora of shops, restaurants, and pastry shops that sell the delicious desserts of the region.\n\nThe main sights in the city date back to Byzantine and Roman times and include the famous 16th-century White Tower on the beach promenade that was used as a fortress, prison, and university workshop in its time.\n\nThe Old Town is worth strolling around. It was originally the Ottoman quarter, which now houses the Turkish Consulate. The Jewish Quarter which was here originally was destroyed in a fire in 1917.\n\nSmaller than the country’s capital, Thessaloniki is a unique city brimming with history, culture, and fine shopping to explore, the fall season being the best to wander around with temperatures ranging from 55.5 to 68.5 degrees.\n\nPro Tip: As Thessaloniki is a city by the sea, humidity can be high at 67 percent, so this can make it feel chilly in the fall months. Bring a light sweater.\n\nMonastery of Meteora Photo credit: Rebecca Hall\n\n3. Visit The Monasteries Of Meteora\n\nThessaly\n\nNot really known to international tourism, except for those traveling for religious purposes, a visit to Meteora in the Thessaly region of the mainland proves you don’t actually need to be religious to appreciate this unique destination.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, Meteora is known for its huge pinnacle rocks that were formed millions of years ago by a series of earthquakes pushing the seabed up, creating a high plateau. The landscape alone makes it the perfect destination for natural exploration, the fall months offering ideal temperatures — but come here to be wowed by the monasteries built hundreds of years ago atop these pinnacles.\n\nOriginally, 25 were constructed and separately housed monks and nuns. These days just 6 remain and are in operation, open to the public to visit so long as you are appropriately dressed with covered shoulders and legs.\n\nVisitors to Meteora love to walk and hike — or hire a taxi to take them to the monasteries to visit and admire the sweeping views. As Meteora is inland, daytime temperatures in October can reach 76 degrees F. Bring light clothing and a light jacket for the nightly temperatures that can drop to 41 degrees.\n\nPro Tip: Catch the train or bus or drive from Athens to the small town and station of Kalambaka in the central/northern part of the mainland. It’s quicker by train or to drive — just over 4 hours — whereas the bus takes upwards of 6 hours.\n\nThe ancient site of Delphi Photo credit: Rebecca Hall\n\n4. Walk Around Ancient Delphi\n\nDelphi\n\nNot only is Delphi great to visit in the spring, the fall season is also the perfect time to explore this important archaeological site in central Greece.\n\nHeld in very high esteem in Ancient Greek times, pilgrims from across the Mediterranean would travel to Delphi to understand the prophecies of the ancient God Apollo. The Ancient Greeks believed that Delphi radiated a special energy and was the navel, or absolute center, of the earth.\n\nWith daytime temperatures averaging 61-72 degrees F, it means walking up to the site — among the ancient relics and up through the pine forest to the ancient stadium used to host what is thought to have been the preface to the Olympic Games — is a pleasure, not an endurance as in the summer months.\n\nPine trees, olive groves, and Mount Parnassus surround Delphi; it’s the perfect fall destination.\n\nPro Tip: Many people just take a day trip here as it’s only a little over a 2-hour drive from Athens. But stay a couple of days in nearby Arachova to really appreciate the place.\n\n5. Hike The Samaria Gorge\n\nCrete\n\nMountainous and with a superb coastline, Greece’s largest island, Crete, offers the visitor many activities at all times of the year. However, there will be some best done in the cooler months such as the fall, purely down to temperature reasons.\n\nCrete is home to the longest trekking gorge in Europe — the 10-mile Samaria Gorge that cuts through the White Mountains.\n\nStarting from Xyloskalo in the south of the island, you’ll descend the wooden staircase into the gorge and trek through to the small seaside town of Agia Roumeli on the coast of the Libyan Sea. Along the way expect to see the abandoned settlement of Samaria, the odd goat or two, pine and cypress forests, plus rivers and high gorge sides.\n\nPro Tip: The long walk with little shade proves that fall is the best month, but it’s only open until the end of October. Later in the year, there’s a danger of flash flooding.\n\n6. Corfu Beer Festival\n\nCorfu\n\nAdmittedly not as famous or as large as the Beer Festivals held in Germany, the Corfu Beer Festival, held over five days in September, aims to showcase local producers’ beers and has a contribution from one foreign country with their own beers too.\n\nThere’s local food to sample and music events to attend, and the festival crowns itself as a “meeting among people, cultures and products.” It’s the perfect place to ingratiate yourself with the local culture and experience another side of the island beyond that of beach days, plus it’s an opportunity for the local community to extend their summer period and show off their island.\n\nPro Tip: The Festival was put on hold in 2021 due to COVID, so check its website for further information for 2022 onwards.\n\nEnjoy the Greek Islands, like Kefalonia, without the crowds. Photo credit: Rebecca Hall\n\n7. Enjoy The Greek Islands Without The Crowds\n\nGreek Islands\n\nTake your choice — the Greek islands are a perfect time to visit during the fall months as the crowds are gone and the days are still warm to swim, yet do pack a light pullover or jacket for the nights as they can get a bit chilly.\n\nAs there are so many Greek islands to choose from, it’s difficult to know which ones to visit. Many have airports so are easily accessible with domestic flights from Athens in the fall. These Greek islands are some of my recommended ones, even in the fall months.\n\nRhodes, however, is one of my favorite Greek islands. As it’s quite far south, and the average daily temperatures range from 69 to 78F, meaning exploring the UNESCO Old Town on foot is not as challenging as it would be in the summer months. Even taking a dip in the sea remains possible.\n\n8. Oxi Day\n\nNational Public Holiday On October 28\n\nOctober 28 is a very special day for the Greeks. An annual national holiday, it commemorates the day in 1940 when the then Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas denied Mussolini’s request to allow his Italian troops to cross into Greece. Oxi (sometimes Ochi or Ohi) means “no” in Greek, you see. Word spread across the country and the days that followed saw Greeks nationwide take to the streets shouting “Oxi!” in solidarity. They would not capitulate to the enemy.\n\nMetaxas’s actions are seen as heroic and brave, so on this day every year, there are public parades across the country, from large cities to small villages. Naturally, the largest is held in Athens in Syntagma Square with marching bands, school children, clubs, and societies, and everybody lines the streets, cheering them on and waving the Greek flag.\n\nPro Tip: If you go to the parade in Athens, it starts at 11 a.m., but get there at 10:30 a.m. or earlier if possible as it’s a very proud day for Greeks and there’ll be huge crowds. Expect road closures.\n\nAs you’ve seen, Greece is so much more than a summer destination. I hope this article has tempted you to enjoy Greece in the fall too.",
    "Spying scandal clouds Greece’s political future": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nATHENS — A persistent espionage scandal has upended Greece’s political landscape, fueling doubts the country can form a stable government after the next election.\n\nThe controversy started last month when the government acknowledged it had wiretapped an opposition leader’s phone — a move it called legal but wrong. It then quickly blossomed into a labyrinthine story that involved controversial spyware being planted on the phones of an ever-expanding network of politicians and journalists.\n\nBut the government has claimed no connection to — or even knowledge of — these broader cases. And after firing two top government officials, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now holding firm, insisting he must stay the course amid gathering economic storm clouds, a war raging nearby and increasingly bellicose rhetoric from rival Turkey.\n\n“I’m not going to be the overseer of political instability,” Mitsotakis said Saturday night at an annual trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki — Greece’s biggest annual political event. “I will lead the country safely to the end of the four-year term and then we will be measured.”\n\nThe public is split on whether they want to see Mitsotakis stick around until then, though. Two recent polls showed just over half of Greeks feel the prime minister should resign. And with elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, Mitsotakis’ potential coalition partners are trying to pounce on the crisis.\n\nHanging over everything is the possibility that more espionage plots will emerge. Already, there has been a consistent drip of fresh allegations in the Greek press in recent weeks.\n\nStill, Mitsotakis has reason to be confident that he and his center-right New Democracy party may emerge relatively unscathed. Even though some party members are grumbling about the revelations, New Democracy itself has not suffered in the polls. And voters appear far more focused on the tempestuous economy than they are on espionage.\n\n“Mitsotakis pledged not to go to elections in autumn, after a good tourist season, but in spring, after a very difficult winter,” said Athanasios Diamantopoulos, a Greek political specialist at Panteion University. “By then, reports of the wiretapping will not have died down, but there will be so many economic troubles that this will be the main stake.”\n\nCracks from within\n\nThe lingering scandal has not been without consequences — far from it.\n\nTo start, there were the resignations, which included one of Mitsotakis’ top aides and his intelligence chief. Those came after the government conceded it had authorized a wiretap of Nikos Androulakis, a European Parliament member who leads the third-largest party in Greece’s parliament, the center-left Pasok.\n\nMaking matters worse, intrusive spyware known as Predator was also found on Androulakis’ phone, in addition to those of a journalist and a lawmaker from the main opposition party, the left-wing Syriza. The government has denied any links to those buggings.\n\nStill, there are lingering questions about what, exactly, occurred. Mitsotakis has refused to explain why his political opponent was spied on, pointing to national security concerns.\n\nThe silence has left some New Democracy members uneasy.\n\n“In such situations, catharsis occurs only when they are fully clarified,” Kostas Karamanlis, a former Greek prime minister and one-time head of New Democracy, said during a recent party event in Crete. “For these events to have been caused by government initiative is not only undemocratic and illegal but so far beyond the bounds of morbid imagination and political nonsense that it is unthinkable.”\n\nThe frustrations have spilled into parliament, where Nikitas Kaklamanis, a New Democracy member and deputy house speaker, said he now opposes a provision he and the ruling party passed depriving citizens of the ability to find out if they are under surveillance. Pasok also initially backed the legislation.\n\nNew Democracy parliament member Konstantinos Tzavaras even branded the Greek media a “disgrace” for not covering the scandal more.\n\n“The functioning of the constitution has taken a severe blow and the prime minister must rise to the occasion,” said Tzavaras, one of the party’s representatives in a parliamentary inquiry investigating the issue.\n\nWith elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, t he public is split on whether they want to see Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stick around | Aris Messinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDespite the public reprimands, a full revolt from within the party remains unlikely — the number of disaffected New Democracy figures has not increased in recent days.\n\nTo some political specialists in the country, Mitsotakis’ staying power is a symptom of a malfunctioning Greek political system.\n\n“If we were in any democratic state we would not have political instability,” said Nikos Marantzidis, a political science professor at the University of Macedonia. “The PM would have already resigned and succession developments would have been initiated.”\n\nMitsotakis, Marantzidis argued, “identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country when he says that if I resign there will be instability.”\n\nMitsotakis struck back at that thinking on Sunday, saying: “People know us. If not us, then who?”\n\nAn eye on elections\n\nUltimately, Mitsotakis is likely to spend the coming months both trying to keep his party together — and trying to navigate an ever-more complicated election, which must be held by next July and is expected to take place in the spring.\n\nUntil the spying revelations surfaced, New Democracy and Pasok were seen as heading toward forming a centrist coalition government after the upcoming elections.\n\nThat’s all over.\n\n“It is now very difficult for Pasok voters to move towards New Democracy, but even more difficult for them to put pressure on their party leadership to participate in a coalition,” said Diamantopoulos, the Greek political specialist at Panteion University.\n\nMitsotakis put the blame for that on Androulakis himself, accusing him of playing politics with his surveillance.\n\n“I believe that what happened helped Androulakis to walk a line that was predetermined, that of rupture with New Democracy,” he said, alleging that the Pasok leader is in “disharmony” with his own voters.\n\nGreece’s next national election will be held under a proportional representation system, making it almost impossible for any party to gather a majority. Because of that, the country will most likely head to a second election, which would be held under a system granting bonus seats to the first party. Current polling, however, shows no party close to reaching an absolute majority, even with a second-round bonus.\n\nBefore the spying scandal, that reality had fueled expectations that New Democracy and Pasok would be pressed into a coalition. Now, with the two parties squabbling, speculation is running rampant about what coalition formations could emerge from such a divisive moment.\n\nMitsotakis could link up with the nationalist, Russophile Greek Solution party. Yet that would represent a U-turn for the prime minister, who styles himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician.\n\nOn Sunday, Mitsotakis said that he doesn’t feel “at all close” to Greek Solution but didn’t exclude a potential tie-up, arguing he is “not ready to talk about what the options will be” if a coalition is needed. He also left open the option of teaming up with specific lawmakers from various political parties to bolster his standing.\n\nRemarkably, a team-up between New Democracy and Pasok is still on the table, according to political analysts in Athens — but realistically only without Mitsotakis as the prime minister. That’s not something Mitsotakis will likely go for.\n\n“The leader of the first party must be the prime minister, even in the case of a coalition government,” the prime minister underlined on Sunday.\n\nSimilarly, a grand coalition between New Democracy, Pasok and Syriza — an approach Pasok favors — would likely require new leadership within New Democracy.\n\n“This is possible, but won’t be simple,” said Marantzidis, the political science professor. “As long as [Mitsotakis] identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country, this will have a negative impact on developments after the elections.”\n\nMitsotakis himself warned against another possibility — a coalition that pulls together all the center-left and left-wing opposition parties to form a government omitting New Democracy, even if it finishes first.\n\n“This will be a political monstrosity and I have to inform and warn people about this possibility,” Mitsotakis said.\n\nPolls hold steady\n\nDespite the rapidly shifting political dynamics, polling last week showed limited damage to the government over the spy scandal.\n\nDepending on the poll, New Democracy has only slid between 0.2 and 1.7 percentage points since the scandal erupted. Meanwhile, opposition parties Syriza and Pasok merely gained between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\n“We have been surprised by the short-term reactions in the past,” said Giorgos Arapoglou, the general manager of Pulse polling company. Arapoglou recalled that after a massive 2018 fire that saw 100 people perish, the government first gained in the polls before losing power in 2019.\n\nUltimately, Arapoglou said the economy is usually the biggest factor in elections. Recent polls back up his theory. In a Marc survey, 84 percent of Greeks said they were concerned about inflation and the looming energy crisis this winter. Only 16 percent expressed worries about the wiretapping discoveries.\n\nWhen just considering politics, though, the espionage story does seem to loom large. A recent GPO poll showed nearly 70 percent of Greeks thought the case was a “very” or “quite” important part of the current political scene. Well over half, 59 percent, also thought Mitsotakis bore some responsibility, while about the same amount said the case had diminished their trust in government.\n\nAnd notably, multiple polls show a slim majority wants Mitsotakis to step aside — a Public Issue poll had it at 54 percent, while a ProRata poll put it at 51 percent.\n\nSome political analysts believe it’s just a matter of time until the issue catches up with the prime minister.\n\n“Obviously the government strategy is to forget what is happening,” said Marantzidis. “But,” he added, “one way or the other, just as Nixon didn’t avoid the truth, Mitsotakis will not be able to avoid it either.”",

Descending back into the land of mortals, wander the ancient Agora neighborhood before joining the merry mobs hopping from one taverna to another in the Plaka district. For extra credit, pause at some point at the extraordinary Acropolis Museum.\n\nGo from Athens to Mykonos: Catch one of the many ferries that make the run from Piraeus, the main port of Athens, to Mykonos. The fast times are on speedy hydrofoils, while the slower runs are on traditional boats, with their broad and sunny decks.\n\nHow to get around Greece\n\nDay 2: sail the Aegean to Mykonos\n\nBurn off your pre-trip stress on the island of Mykonos. One of Europe’s fabled party destinations (St Tropez and Ibiza are rivals), this small island has just enough to keep you occupied by day. Explore the maze of covered lanes, boutiques and flower-bedecked cafes in the old town of Hora. Head to nearby beaches for your first dip in the ever-blue Aegean. But save some energy for well after dark when the notorious clubs like to party until dawn – or later.\n\nGo from Mykonos to Delos: Boats to Delos make the run in a quick 30 minutes starting in the morning.\n\nThe island of Delos is covered in an extraordinary collection of ancient ruins © R. Lemieszek / Getty Images\n\nDay 3: walk with the ancient Greeks in Delos\n\nFight off any after-effects of the night before and catch a morning boat to Delos, the mythological birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. The entire island is a sacred shrine – ruins stretch across the sunbaked landscape. Let your imagination run wild as you reconstruct this once magnificent center in your mind. Make the quick return to Mykonos by boat and cool off at a beach. Then get lost in Hora until you stumble upon the perfect seafood dinner.\n\nGo from Mykonos to Paros: Several ferries a day make the run in about one hour.\n\nIf you're looking to ferry from island to island, Paros is an excellent place to start © Starcevic / Getty Images\n\nDay 4: relax on Paros\n\nSomething of a ferry hub for the Cyclades, Paros – the group of islands that in many ways defines Greece – literally has something for everyone. Flower-draped tavernas in the port town of Parikia make great post-ferry lunch spots.\n\nGet a rental car and drive the circumference of the island. This can be an all-day adventure and includes plenty of beach access along the east coast. The island is also noted for its produce – especially the tomatoes – so enjoy something delicious in the oh-so-cute mountain village of Lefkes or the locally popular beachside town of Aliki.\n\nGo from Paros to Antiparos: Car ferries link the adjoining islands in under 15 minutes.\n\nDay 5: slow down on Antiparos\n\nAlmost touching its much larger neighbor, the diminutive island of Antiparos really is the anti-Paros. Parts of the island qualify as sleepy, and there’s an unhurried vibe across its narrow, windy roads. Take the quick boat ride to Despotiko, a restored ancient sanctuary, then enjoy a seafood feast in Agios Georgios at a waterfront taverna. If you’re feeling sporty, join the windsurfers taking advantage of some of the most reliable winds in Greece.\n\nGo from Paros to Santorini: Ferries take 2–3 hours.\n\nIt's easy to get lost wandering through charming narrow pathways of Santorini © Michela Ravasio / Stocksy United\n\nDay 6: join the throngs on Santorini\n\nWith its polychromatic cliffs soaring above its drowned caldera, Santorini is the definition of a ‘Greek island’ for many. Steep and narrow lanes are lined with brilliantly whitewashed houses topped with cerulean domes. Beaches dot the curving coast, and gentle hiking paths follow the island’s spine, offering sweeping views. Sunsets are mesmerizing. Take in the spectacle from tiny hillside Oia, which offers a choice of tavernas serving deeply traditional Greek fare (expect grilled meats, creamy tzatziki and more).\n\nGo from Santorini to Crete: There’s usually one speedy ferry daily, making the two-hour run to Iraklio in Crete.\n\nDay 7: get lost in Greece’s best palace at Knossos\n\nThe island of Crete is so big that it almost feels like its own country. The main city of Iraklio is best enjoyed for a quick lunch in a café and as a place to secure a rental car. Then charge south for barely 20 minutes to one of the top ancient sites in a nation of ancient sites. The Palace of Knossos was built by the Minoans and is a vast and somewhat restored ruin that can easily absorb half a day or more. If you have time to take a tour, there are more than a dozen wineries nearby that make the excellent local wines you’ll enjoy with every meal.\n\nGo from Iraklio to Hania: Rental car prices on Crete are competitive, and distances are manageable. The run between the island’s two main cities takes only two hours, although endless stops and diversions to admire incredible views can greatly extend that.\n\nDay 8: revel in the stunning beauty of Crete\n\nCrete’s second city of Hania is really the island’s first city in the hearts of those in the know. The old town and harbor combine the legacies of the Minoans, the ancient Greeks, the Venetians and countless other influences from occupiers and others who just happened to sail by. The food here is extraordinary, and the chefs put Crete’s fabled produce to remarkable use. Two excellent detours are the absorbing ancient port town of Rethymno and the grand and glittery Orthodox churches in the hills, such as Moni Arkadiou.\n\nGo from Hania to Elafonisi: Driving direct will take about two hours, but, as always, detours and myriad excuses to pause and enjoy the scenery will extend that greatly.\n\nFind turquoise waters and pinkish-hued sands on the beaches of Crete © SolStock / Getty Images\n\nDay 9: hit the beaches of Crete\n\nThe Samaria Gorge is the most famous of southern Crete’s many gorge walks, which start high in the craggy hills and follow often-lush, stream-fed canyons down to little villages and beaches. If the crowds at Samaria are daunting, consider the Agia Irini Gorge instead. Finish your day at sublime Elafonisi Beach, where the sand has a pinkish hue in a certain light, and the swimming is superb.\n\nGo from Hania to Athens: Frequent flights to Athens take under an hour from Crete’s second-largest airport.\n\nDay 10: stroll around Athens\n\nThe Acropolis is never far from view as you stroll the compact and endlessly fascinating center of Athens. Catch the changing of the guard at the center of government (and Athens) in Syntagma Square. Choose from sights such as the antiquity-stuffed Benaki Museum, the lush National Gardens, the ornate Hadrian’s Arch and the grandiose Temple of Olympian Zeus.\n\nFinish your time in Greece with a languid session in the upscale neighborhood of Kolonaki and cafe-lined Plateia Kolonakiou.",

    "Greece’s opposition parties rail at Mitsotakis over ‘Greek Watergate’ inquiry": "The Mitsotakis government has admitted it acted wrongly and promised to investigate the case | Giorgos Kontarinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nATHENS — Greece’s opposition parties are railing against the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis over the inquiry into a wiretapping scandal dubbed “Greek Watergate.”\n\nAt a parliamentary session on Thursday investigating the spy scandal, opposition parties stormed out in protest, after the ruling New Democracy party blocked any political figures from being called to testify, including those directly involved.\n\nThe scandal broke last month when the government’s Secretary-General Grigoris Dimitriadis (who is the prime minister’s nephew) and the head of the National Intelligence Service (EYP) lost their jobs, after it transpired that the phone of Nikos Androulakis, head of the center-left Pasok party, had been surveilled by EYP. A separate attempt was made to tap his phone around the same time with illegal software called Predator, but Athens strenuously denies that EYP had any connection with that.\n\nThe Mitsotakis government has admitted it acted wrongly and promised to investigate the case.\n\nThursday’s parliamentary committee hearing in Athens was convened to form a list of people that will be summoned to testify. But New Democracy, which holds the majority in the panel, blocked dozens of witnesses proposed by opposition parties, including Dimitriadis and Mitsotakis, who is in charge of the EYP.\n\n“Mitsotakis is trying to impose an omertà so that other aspects of his parallel state are not revealed,” main opposition party Syriza said in a statement.\n\nNew Democracy also blocked from the list of witnesses journalists whose phones have been wiretapped, or have investigated the issue, as well as state officials from police and the Greek secret service. In the end, fewer than 10 people will be summoned.\n\n“The one who advocated light has imposed darkness,” Pasok said in a statement. “Mitsotakis has staged a theatrical performance in order to hide himself and his nephew and to obscure his parallel state actions.”\n\nAccording to a report in the Greek newspaper Ta Nea, surveillance evidence in the cases of Androulakis and of journalist Thanasis Koukakis has been destroyed due to technical factors. Such files are usually stored by the spy services for two years.\n\n“The case is in the hands of justice and parliamentary institutions,” government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou said at a briefing on Thursday. “I don’t know if it has been destroyed or not. Those who are competent by law and implement the protocols in place know.”\n\nAt the European Parliament in Brussels, meanwhile, the assembly’s spyware inquiry committee, known as PEGA, on Thursday held an exchange of views on the use of spyware in Greece. The panel heard from, among others, three journalists involved in uncovering the scandal and who have themselves been surveilled.\n\nMEP Stelios Kouloglou from the Left group contrasted the investigation in Athens with the inquiry being carried out by the European Parliament.\n\n“The transparency and the search for the truth from the PEGA committee is in contrast to the violent cover up efforts of the relevant inquiry committee of the Greek Parliament,” Kouloglou said. “MEPs got a taste of the deep state that Mitsotakis has established. “\n\nBut government officials who testified in the PEGA committee on Thursday, refrained from shedding more light, referring to the Greek judicial authorities.\n\nMEP Sophie in ‘t Veld called the panel a “Computer-says-No” sketch. “Hardly any answers, cos ‘not within our power,’ ‘no comment on matters sub judice,’ ‘national security therefore top secret,’ she said in a tweet.\n\nThe Greek government refused to give a specific answer on whether there is a judicial investigation on the wiretapping scandal, rather than just on how the story was leaked to media. They said however that the Greek government stands ready to work with the European authorities to investigate the issue.",

    "Greece: Pushbacks by Sea and Land, Türkiye an Increasingly ‘Unsafe Third Country’": "Brutal pushbacks continue off the Aegean islands and in the Evros region. The situation for Syrian refugees in Türkiye deemed safe by Greek authorities is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nReports of non-response and pushbacks by Greek authorities by sea and land continue. According to Aegean Boat Report, the Greek authorities and Hellenic Coast Guard remained unresponsive to alerts of 49 people in distress off Samos on a rubber boat taking in water. On the same day, the organisation warned of 44 Palestinians “in imminent danger of being pushed back by Greek authorities” after arriving on the island of Agathonisi. The NGO hotline Alarm Phone has published detailed testimonies from a group of 29 people pushed back by Greek authorities in August after being pulled to Rhodes and pushed towards Turkish waters. A survivor describes the brutal incident where Greek officials: “took our phones, beat us up heavily and took our personal belongings. (I could hide my phone, so one phone was left with our whole group). Then, the Hellenic Coast Guard took 2 people of us (both Syrian nationals) and beat them up very hard and kept them there. Since then we don’t know anything about the 2 people – we have no contact to them anymore”. A young Turkish man went missing on 8 September while crossing the Evros river separating Greece and Türkiye. After arriving safely in Greece, he was detained along with other people seeking protection, loaded onto the same rubber boat they had arrived on where the young man lost his balance and disappeared in the water. On 11 September, Alarm Phone reported of: “a group of around 80 asylum seekers in prison in Greece, close to Evros. Several of them are in severe medical conditions and are being held in squalid conditions!”. The organisation later confirmed that the group had been held at Isaakio border guard station along with hundreds of other people and had been pushed back to Turkey. While the Greek government denies pushbacks it has reported “averting” 150,000 irregular arrivals in 2022. As of 11 September, 10,139 people had arrived in Greece in 2022 – 5,742 by sea and 4,397 by land.\n\nGreece deems Türkiye a safe third country for people originating from the main refugee-producing countries including Syria, allowing authorities to refuse asylum claims as inadmissible. However, the already difficult situation for the more than 3,6 million Syrian refugees in Türkiye is rapidly deteriorating. According to Le Monde, a crackdown is intensifying and raising mounting concern among Syrian refugees who are “facing increasing administrative difficulties as the government enforces tougher measures”. This development is taking place in the context of an emerging economic crisis in Türkiye and increasingly more extreme rhetoric from nationalist politicians. Sadly, such rhetoric resonates with the population and reportedly 82 per cent of the population demands Syrians to return home. According to Der Spiegel, President Erdogan has turned on Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of people are arrested and deported at gunpoint by Turkish authorities. Turkish media reports that 25,000 Syrians left Türkiye for the EU over recent months due to rising anti-refugee sentiments – 10,000 through resettlement and 15,000 Syrians who travelled through other means. “Many of the people around me are preparing to leave again, to go to Europe,” said Zaynab from Idlib (northwestern Syria), adding: “To some extent, we’re reliving the experience of 2015”. Reportedly, a group of Syrian refugees are planning a caravan to the EU via an online channel followed by almost 70,000 people with organizers calling on people to bring sleeping bags, tents, life jackets, water, canned food and first aid kits. The number of migrants and refugees who cross from Türkiye into Bulgaria has increased substantially. Border authorities have recorded 85,000 arrivals over the first eight months of 2022 which is more than double the number for the whole of 2021.\n\nFor further information:\n\nThis article appeared in the ECRE Weekly Bulletin.

    "Greece goes Putin Putin, and pro-Russia party is all set to take over Athens": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis is one of Europe’s most unpopular leaders. In his tenure, Athens has just added insult to Greece’s injury. The economy is in complete tatters, Turkey is heckling Greece like there is no tomorrow, whereas, Mitsotakis himself is drowning in a pool of scandals. If elections are to be held today, he will lose all his ground. However, time puts everything in place. Greece’s ruling party is now officially trying to call the shots and leave their liberal disguise.\n\nAccording to a news report by Euractiv, Greece’s ruling New Democracy party is looking for an alliance with the “Greek Solution”, a greek party known for its pro-Russian stance.\n\nReportedly, Greek Minister of Domestic Affairs Makis Voridis has confirmed that New Democracy might walk into elections with a Greek solution. The minister stated, “We don’t exclude anyone. Besides the parties whose programs are completely different than ours, we can work with all parties”.\n\nThe next general elections are scheduled for 2023, however, demand is growing to call early elections in the wake of Mitsotakis’ decaying popularity. The “Watergate” controversy, involving the secret services of Greece monitoring opposition politicians and journalists, has pushed New Democracy into a difficult position.\n\nGiven the fact that Mitsotakis’ popularity has fallen, political analysts are predicting that a coalition government will be required in order to form a majority administration in 2023. Mitsotakis, himself though, is no great fan of Greek solutions. He has constantly turned down talks of any collaboration with the Greek Solution. But it seems that his party is testing the waters.\n\nLovers of Russia\n\nClearly, Mitsotakis and his Party leaders appear to have a conflict of interest here. However, it doesn’t matter for New Democracy at this point because Mitsotakis is losing credibility.\n\nNow, when we talk of the Greek Solution, their stance on Russia could be a page-turner for Greece. Greek solution is a party that has not hidden its pro-Russian feelings. Its leader, Kyriakos Velopoulos, has openly criticized the EU’s decision to send weapons to Ukraine, saying that Greece “needs its last bullet”.\n\nAt the inception of the Ukraine war, he told the Greek parliament: “In a war, you are with the defender. You are with the victim, with the crying children… Ukraine is not our friendly country, as Kyiv tweeted in favor of Turkish drones and Turkish friendship.”\n\nHe has even backed Russia as the Ukraine war dragged on. Velopoulos stated: “Yes, Putin made Russia. It is a truth. Is he authoritarian, or his country, he is a leader. We admired what he did [to create Russia]; we do not admire and condemn what he is doing now [with Ukraine]”.\n\nRead More: Greece and Russia are just one step away from snatching the Turkish straits\n\nAlarm for Turkey and NATO\n\nIf New Democracy links its ties with the Greek Solution, the whole political scenario of Greece will change. The new government of Greece would be making a complete U-turn of all its actions in Ukraine. Mitsotakis as prime minister has always styled himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician. However, his recent acts suggest that staunch conservatism is not far from the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nAlong with that, Athens is already leaving no stone unturned to thwart Turkey. Just a few days ago, Greece was armed to teeth with Russia’s S-300 defence system to take down Turkish Jets wandering in Greece’s airspace.\n\nWhereas, just a week ago, Greece officially warned NATO to take care of Turkey or else the government won’t hesitate to answer Turkey’s unprovoked, unacceptable insult to Greece and the Greek people.\n\nRead More: Erdogan loses his war against Greece even before the war actually started\n\nA pro-Russia party is all set to take over Athens, though, there is still time. Consequently, New Democracy is mulling over a coalition with the Greek Solution. This coalition would mark yet another staunch hardliner of the West marching towards power. NATO, the EU, and Turkey would thus be forced to make a Hobson’s choice over whether to ignore Greece or lock horns with it just like Budapest or Rome.",

    "One Year Since Greece Opened New “Prison-Like” Refugee Camps, NGOs Call for a More Humane Approach — Refugees International": "Exactly one year ago, the first EU-funded Closed Controlled Access Centre (CCAC) for asylum seekers in Greece was inaugurated on the island of Samos. Concerns were raised from the outset, that residents would be subjected to disproportionate restrictions on their movement and to surveillance measures more associated with prison-type controls than with reception facilities hosting and supporting people seeking international protection. A year later, with two similar CCACs now operational on the Greek islands of Leros and Kos, and another two additional facilities being built on Lesvos and Chios, NGOs who have witnessed the impact are calling for the approach to be urgently revised.\n\nThe combined expected cost of building all five CCACs is 260 million euros. Meanwhile, the average distance from the closest towns is 14 kilometers, with no access to regular, adequate and affordable transport services. These EU funds could be used instead to host people in suitable conditions that respect their dignity, and ensure access to healthcare, employment opportunities and promote people’s ability to become part of the society in Greece. There is also a real danger that this model will be replicated along the border with Turkey and elsewhere in Europe. It is time to reverse this harmful trend, and instead build functioning Greek and EU asylum systems that recognise the humanity of all who are forced to flee.\n\nThe continued use of containment measures on both the islands and mainland undermines repeated calls by NGOs for Greece and the EU to focus on integration and social inclusion. The EU Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion states that the “successful integration of migrants depends both on early action and long-term investment. Providing support to migrants and their receiving communities at the earliest possible moment”. It is time for Greece and the EU to align with this approach.\n\nCompared to the overcrowded, substandard and unsanitary camps people had been forced to reside in previously, some aspects of their living conditions may have improved in the CCACs. However, the cost to people’s rights and wellbeing has been unacceptably high. The increased securitisation and restriction of freedoms has had a devastating impact on the mental and physical well-being of CCAC residents, many of whom report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.\n\nLocated in remote areas far from local communities, with 24/7 CCTV and barbed-wire fences, these prison-like complexes go against the core principles of European policy, including for example in the EU Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion, with disproportionate focus on deterrence, isolation and containment. Instead of being welcomed and supported to rebuild their lives and contribute to their new communities, asylum-seekers are isolated, subject to constant surveillance, and provided limited access to essential services.\n\nNGOs are today calling for the use of border facilities to be limited to frontline assistance, registration and identification of asylum seekers, after which people should be transferred to suitable, dignified housing options, in conditions ensuring their freedom of movement. Community-based accommodation, when adequately supported, should be preferred as the solution most conducive to refugees becoming part of and contributing to their communities, in line with the recommendations in the EU action plan on Integration and Inclusion.\n\nPrison-like conditions inside Samos CCAC\n\nSurrounded by multiple barbed wire fences, isolated in a valley eight kilometers from the town of Vathy, Samos CCAC currently houses approximately 1,000 men, women and children in one operational area of the camp. There is no safe space for single women, with or without children, or other vulnerable groups that need special reception conditions, despite NGOs highlighting this issue in a joint statement addressed to the Ministry of Asylum and Migration when the plan was announced. For its residents, the prison-like structure, combined with a heavy security presence and stringent entry/exit conditions, creates a pervasive feeling of imprisonment:\n\n“You can only enter/exit between 8AM-8PM. When you arrive at the camp doors, one by one they let you inside, to the checkpoint where they check your phone, wallet, pockets, even the small pockets of your clothes. Then when you want to go inside you have to pass through doors with fingerprints.” - Mehdi, 23-year-old man from Afghanistan, Vathy, Samos, 2022.\n\nClosed and controlled facilities are not a humane or dignified reception option for people seeking international protection. Restrictions of people’s liberty to exit or re-enter the facility freely can amount to de facto detention and can lead to a violation of their right to private and family life. Without an asylum applicant card (which is necessary to access the center's security systems), people are prohibited to leave the camp. This applies to new arrivals until their asylum applicant’s card has been issued, as well as to those waiting to appeal a negative decision or to submit a subsequent asylum application.\n\nIn addition to this, asylum seekers are the only category of people who are still subjected to a mandatory COVID-19 quarantine when they arrive in Greece for at least five days. This approach creates a constant sense of containment. According to I Have Rights (IHR), an organisation that provides free legal information and legal support on Samos, asylum seekers are detained on average for 12 days after being identified by the Reception and Identification Service. In addition, in 6% of IHR’s cases, people were detained longer than the 25 days that are foreseen by the law, even if identification procedures have been completed, raising serious doubts on the movement restrictions. This decision has been taken by the Asylum Service on the grounds of an increase in arrivals in Samos - even though there are currently fewer than 1,000 people in the facility which has capacity for 2,040.\n\nIn the Samos CCAC, asylum seekers are kept ‘out of sight and out of mind’, with limited access to services and opportunities to interact with the local population. Despite this, as of the time of writing there is no appointed doctor for the residents of the camp. Although a doctor from Samos hospital visits the camp twice a week, she only identifies vulnerable people among the residents and does not provide medical care. MSF are filling this gap with a mobile clinic three days of the week. In 2022, 42% of IHR beneficiaries met the legal category of vulnerability in Greece, with 26% being survivors of torture and 12% being survivors of human trafficking. Only 33% of those who were vulnerable were in contact with the CCAC psychologist before their full asylum interview.\n\nContainment policies have a devastating impact on people's mental health\n\nExtended stays in CCACs create enormous stress and uncertainty for the asylum seekers residing there:\n\n“Living in the camp [CCAC] on Samos is a very difficult experience. They shouldn’t even give it the name ‘camp’; in my opinion it is a prison – there is no difference… Everyone is inside their container, nobody comes outside, everyone is depressed and sick in some way – from loneliness, from their legal situation or status, and other problems they have in their lives. We refugees are not guilty criminals, we are human, we came here with hope.Somali, African, Afghan, Arab – it doesn’t make a difference, we are all in the same situation.” - Mehdi, describing conditions in the CCAC; Samos, May 2022.\n\nIRC mental health and psychosocial support teams worked on Samos between 2019-2022 and witnessed first-hand the detrimental effects of Greek and EU containment policies. The focus on walls rather than welcome has contributed to immense feelings of hopelessness and despair among asylum seekers and refugees trapped on the Greek islands.In the last year, 91% of people supported by the IRC mental health programme in Samos experienced anxiety and 87% depression-related symptoms, while an alarming 41% showed symptoms of suicidality. Containment-centered accommodation models have devastating impacts on the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees, who may already have to cope with trauma endured in their country and on their journey towards Greece.\n\nIt's time for answers from the Greek Government and the EU\n\nGreek and EU authorities need to move away from short-sighted policies based on containment and deterrence. They should instead adopt specific measures to promote a sustainable, dignified reception and asylum system for all people seeking protection. To this end, we, the undersigned civil society organisations, call on the Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum and the European Commission for specific answers on the following issues:\n\nAs COVID-19 quarantine requirements are being waived across Europe, on what grounds are asylum seekers in Samos and Lesvos held in a quarantine section upon arrival? When will the designated hosting areas for single women with their children and/or unaccompanied children inside the CCACs start operating? What is the timeframe and what concrete measures have been taken towards ensuring adequate and specialised staffing of the Medical and Psychosocial Unit inside the CCACs? Given that ongoing asylum trends in Greece indicate many residents of the camp(s) will be granted asylum, what measures have been taken to establish integration pathways, and how is the impact of having to reside in prison-like conditions for protracted periods assessed with respect to prospects of integration? Does DG Home agree that elements of the Greek CCACs are incompatible with the EU Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion? For example, asylum seekers are contained, although the Action Plan proposes autonomous housing options that can speed up the integration process, especially when linked with early provision of integration support’. What actions can be taken to ensure Greece's compliance with the Reception Conditions Directive and the asylum acquis more broadly? Given that the EU has provided material support for the construction and running of the CCACs and oversees Greece's use of EU funds for these purposes, what steps would the Commission take to hold Greece accountable for possible violations of fundamental rights in these facilities?\n\nCo-signing Organisations",
    "Greece to launch parliamentary inquiry into spy scandal": "Greece is to launch a parliamentary inquiry into a spy scandal embroiling the government as MEPs also step up calls for an investigation into the use of phone taps in the country.\n\nAn inquiry proposed by the centre-left Pasok party was backed by the entire political opposition late on Monday after revelations that the group’s leader, Nikos Androulakis, had been placed under surveillance while serving as an MEP.\n\n“It is necessary more than ever for these cases to be investigated,” the Pasok MP Haris Kastanidis told the chamber, saying the inquiry should not be limited to Androulakis. Eavesdropping claims made by the communist KKE party as well as the bugging of journalists should also be addressed, he said.\n\nThe centre-right government has faced charges of a cover-up by liberal and leftwing MEPs, who are pressing for a fact-finding mission to be sent to Greece. Lawmakers with the ruling New Democracy party abstained from Monday’s vote although they made clear that they, too, supported the inquiry in the name of reforming Greece’s intelligence service, the EYP.\n\nThe wiretap disclosures have been described as “probably the tip of the iceberg” by Sophie in ‘t Veld, a Dutch politician heading the European parliament’s PEGA committee looking into the use of malicious spyware across the continent.\n\n“The Greek authorities, on the one hand, claim they are innocent so they’ve got nothing to hide, and on the other hand they are very reluctant to shed light on the whole matter,” she said. “And so far all their moves over the last year or so have been to cover things up.”\n\nThe Androulakis affair is expected to be raised on Tuesday when the 38-member PEGA committee holds the first of two hearings this week on “spyware against citizens”.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged that the phones of the financial journalist Thanasis Koukakis had been monitored with Predator spyware, manufactured by Cytrox, a surveillance start-up based in North Macedonia. The malware, which has the ability to read encrypted data and turn a mobile phone into a listening device, was also deployed against Androulakis but the attempted hack failed because the politician failed to activate the necessary clickbait. The software was discovered when the MEP, who was subsequently targeted by EYP, sent his mobile phone to the European parliament’s cybersecurity department for a routine check.\n\nThe scandal threatens political turmoil in the run-up to elections next year amid calls from the former premier and main opposition head, Alexis Tsipras, for the prime minister to resign.\n\nKyriakos Mitsotakis 54, who has vowed to see out his full four-year term, citing the need for stability at a time of global uncertainty and rising tensions with Turkey, has said he was unaware of the bugging operation. “I have looked the Greek people in the eye and I have assured them that I knew absolutely nothing. It is my word against yours,” he said, turning to Tsipras during a heated debate in Athens’ 300-seat parliament on Friday.\n\nFrom the outset, Mitsotakis has accepted the surveillance of his political opponent was wrong. In a surprise step, his office announced the resignations on 7 August of Greece’s spy chief, Panagiotis Kontoleon – going so far as to publicly chastise the intelligence service for “incorrect actions” – and Grigoris Dimitriadis, the leader’s nephew and powerful chief of staff.\n\nMitsotakis has also suggested that the revelations are the result of “dark forces” bent on destabilising Greece.\n\nWith rising energy costs and economic worries topping the agenda, officials insist the disclosures have done little to dent the administration’s popularity.\n\nA report issued by Google’s threat analysis group in May said the product was used by “government-backed actors” in several states, including Greece. Mitsotakis has rejected any suggestion of Predator being used by the Greek authorities, although the software is known to be packaged by Intellexa, a firm based in Athens and registered in Cyprus.\n\nIn one of his first moves after winning power in July 2019, Mitsotakis placed EYP under the aegis of the prime minister’s office and not the interior ministry, as had previously been the case. The direct line of communication has also played a role in the criticism being levelled against the leader.\n\nSurveillance is by no means a new feature of the Greek state, where memories of such practices during the 1967-74 military dictatorship have yet to fade among the older generation.\n\nUnder Tsipras, wiretapping also increased, with the then government taking the step of reducing the number of prosecutors required to approve permits. Addressing parliament on behalf of the ruling New Democracy (ND) party on Monday, the MP Dimitris Keridis said the inquiry should also include the period when Syriza was in power.\n\nThe committee, which will sit in closed session, is dominated by ND MPs.\n\nThe number of wiretaps placed on citizens for reasons of “national security” have allegedly soared since Mitsotakis assumed office. The independent telecoms watchdog, ADAE, has referred to 15,000 eavesdropping requests being made last year alone.\n\n“Other revelations are bound to follow,” said Stelios Koulouglou, a Syriza party MEP who also sits on the PEGA committee. “What has been happening in Greece reminds me of the tactics pursued by the Stasi in east Germany. Mitsotakis’s aim was complete control and under [his purview] surveillance was broadened and became extremely systematic.”",
    "Greece at a Crossroads: History, Landscape, and Material Culture – Carleton College": "Welcome to the home page for Carleton’s new OCS program in Greece! My name is Alex Knodell, and I am an archaeologist specializing in the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. I’ve been a professor in the Classics Department and Archaeology Program at Carleton since 2014.\n\nMy work as an archaeologist has taken me to a lot of interesting places over the years. I’ve done fieldwork in Jordan, Guatemala, and the US, and traveled more broadly to visit and study archaeological sites on five continents. The one place I keep coming back to, though, again and again, is Greece. My research in Greece focuses on long-term social change in a variety of regional contexts, mostly through team-based international survey projects like the Mazi Archaeological Project and the Small Cycladic Islands Project. I also wrote a book called Societies in Transition in Early Greece, which focused on central Greece in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age—the very cusp of history, in which we see the development of Greek city-states, writing and the poetry of Homer, and a more interconnected, multicultural Mediterranean world.\n\nI’ve been coming to Greece for over 15 years. I’ve lived in Athens (off and on) for about four of them. While Greece is obviously a place where I work and study, I’ve also developed a deeply personal connection to the people, language, and culture (especially the food!). I’ve enjoyed sharing all of these things with Carleton students over the years, both on campus and on field projects. I couldn’t be more excited to introduce a new group of students to Greece on this OCS program. Πάμε! (let’s go!).\n\nAlex Knodell, Associate Professor of Classics, Director of Archaeology",
    "Turkey obsessed with Greece": "The Turkish economy is in a very poor state and Erdogan will, reasonably, lose the election. You cannot know how an authoritarian leader will react, but we do know that the more the economy worsens, the more he’ll use other issues to draw votes. It is possible, for example, that he’ll cause crises in foreign policy.\n\nThis is much more likely in the case of Greece than, say, in the case of Syria, as it is an issue that strikes a powerful chord with Kemalist voters. Turkish citizens “bite” when it comes to matters of security and Erdogan wants people talking about anything but the economy. A crisis with Greece would be big enough to counteract the economic crisis.\n\nI am not saying that it will happen, but I believe that if Erdogan chooses to play this game, the Greece front is likely. And I also believe that Erdogan is even prepared to sacrifice relations with the West just to win this election. He’s willing to risk everything. The question is whether it will work. This will depend on the opposition’s ability to react. So far, it has been quite passive on several issues.\n\nErdogan may challenge the process if he loses the election, but I think this will only happen if the margin is small. This election will be a test of whether Turkey remains on the democratic path. The question is who the opposition puts forward.\n\nIf the opposition wins, things will only be marginally better in terms of Greece. Turkey’s foreign policy towards Greece is something Turkish society agrees with. We even see Kemalists adopting an extreme stance towards Greece. The different is that the Kemalists will not manipulate public opinion to such a great extent on this issue. Structurally, though, we should not expect any significant change. The disputes with Greece are an obsession in Turkey.\n\nGokhan Bacik, Palacky University, Czech Republic, expert on Islam and Turkey.\n\n* This opinion piece is part of an in-depth look by 10 analysts, journalists and experts into Turkey ahead of the June 2023 elections: Where will Turkey be a year from now?"
