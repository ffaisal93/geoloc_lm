    "Top Things to See and Do When You Visit Peru": "One of the most popular destinations for anyone visiting Peru is Machu Picchu, however, it’s not the only attraction this South American country has to offer.\n\nThat’s not to say you shouldn’t include the Inca Trail as part of your Peru tours. Make sure it’s number one on the list, but remember to include one or more of the following.\n\nHike the Rainbow Mountain\n\nThis journey will be a day-long trek at more than 14,000 feet, but when you get to the rainbow-colored mountain it’ll be a scene you won’t forget.\n\nYou’ll be walking along a dirt path that winds between looming green peaks and eye-catching red rock but the route is gorgeous. Along the way, you’ll also find yourself walking past local villages built from local stone and alongside glittering mountain streams.\n\nSacred Valley\n\nIf you haven’t got the time to visit Machu Picchu, one alternative is to see the Sacred Valley. This tourist location includes an impressive Inca City known as Ollantaytambo and it’s a great place to explore.\n\nDune Hiking\n\nDid you even know that Peru has a desert? Well, it has and it’s a massive 188,700 square kilometers. While there’s nothing quite like hiking to the top of a dune to watch the sun go down, it’s also great fun riding around on a dune buggy.\n\nThe dunes in Peru are high enough to get your heart pounding. It could well be one of the most thrilling rides you’ve ever taken.\n\nHuacachina\n\nThis is the name given to a village that’s been built around a natural lake. It also happens to be located in the middle of the desert known as the Oasis of America.\n\nThe location is very beautiful and should be added to your list of things to do in Peru. Massive dunes surround the lake and along the shoreline, there are plenty of restaurants, guesthouses, and hotels where you can relax and chill out for a while.\n\nSandboarding\n\nIf you prefer to explore the dunes without the help of an engine, why not try sandboarding instead? If you’re already an expert snowboarder, you’ll soon get to grips with riding the sandy waves and carving out edges.\n\nNazca Lines\n\nThe Nazca Lines are possibly the coolest thing you can see in Peru. To date, nobody has been able to explain these ancient geoglyphs, which makes them all the more amazing.\n\nFrom the air, you can see 70 different plant and animal drawings along with hundreds of lines and other geometrical shapes. Some of the lines are 10 kilometers long and speak over hundreds of square kilometers.\n\nA few of the most notable figures are a lizard that measures 180 meters long, a condor with a 130-meter wingspan, and several other animals including a killer whale, spider, hummingbird, and a monkey.\n\nIt is thought that these unusual lines date back to 500 BC in Nazca culture. The Lines are one of the many UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Peru.\n\nThese intricate designs, created by primitive humans, reach 370 meters and have lasted for 2500 years.\n\nLake Titicaca\n\nThe picture at the top of the page is Lake Titicaca. It’s located at the border with Bolivia and is known for being the highest navigable lake in the world. It’s located at 3,812 meters in the Andes.\n\nApart from its height, Lake Titicaca is also somewhere where you can discover more about the culture of Peru. One memorable part of this visit is bound to be the famous floating houses.\n\nThe floating islands have been created by the Uros people out of reeds. Entire communities live their lives on the lake. As old rotting reeds float away, new reeds have to be added.\n\nThe best way to appreciate the lake is to take a boat trip to the islands and surrounding villages. While the floating islands are a popular attraction, the real charm of the area lies in the small villages lining the hills along the shores of the lake.\n\nParagliding Miraflores in Lima\n\nIf you’re a bit of an adrenalin junkie and are looking for something more adventurous to do, paragliding is for you. Peru is one of the easiest places to go paragliding and Lima is a city you should fly over. Walk down the cliffs at Miraflores and you’ll find plenty of guys willing to take you.\n\nPisco and the Ballestas Islands (Isla Ballestas)\n\nSometimes referred to as the “poor man’s Galapagos,” the Islas Ballestas are home to hundreds of thousands of birds, pelicans, dolphins, penguins, and large colonies of sea lions.\n\nYou can take a boat tour from Paracas and Pisco to the islands, leaving in the morning. The tour will take you past a hillside geoglyph, known as the “Candelabra.”\n\nAs you can see, there’s so much more to Peru than Machu Picchu. If you love an adventure, take a hike along the infamous Inca Trail to Machu Picchi. But don’t forget to include some of the suggestions above.",
    "Peru declares state of emergency after Amazon oil spills": "The government of Peru on Saturday declared a 90-day state of emergency in the Peruvian Amazon communities of Cuninico and Urarinas, two indigenous-inhabited areas whose rivers have been affected by oil spills. Official information shows that the zones are home to some 2,500 native individuals who depend on artisanal fishing.\n\nThe decision comes less than a fortnight after a rupture was reported in the Petroperú-controlled Norperuano Pipeline (ONP, in Spanish), a 40-year-old construction that is 1,106 kilometers long and takes oil from the Northeastern department of Loreto to the Pacific coastal port of Bayóvar, in the Piura province.\n\nMIDAGRI, a través de la @ANAPeru, verifica en campo los efectos causados por el derrame petróleo en la región #Loreto. pic.twitter.com/18P2DMP38P — MIDAGRI – PERÚ (@midagriperu) September 24, 2022\n\nIt is estimated that about 2,500 barrels of crude oil were spilled into local rivers as of this week, affecting at least six indigenous communities of the Kukumas ethnicity. According to state-owned Petroperú, the accident was caused by an intentional 21-centimeter-long cut in the pipes, the 11th “attack” suffered by the structure since January.\n\nPeru’s National Society of Mining, Petroleum, and Energy (SNMPE) says the Norperuano Pipeline has been the target of at least 29 acts of sabotage since 2014. Peruvian special environment prosecutors have already opened a new investigation.\n\nAs The Brazilian Report has previously explained, the 782,880 square kilometers of Peruvian territory considered part of the Amazon rainforest are threatened by climate change.",

    "Peru Marxist party is still a barrier to impeachment attempts, leader says": "Vladimir Cerron, the head of the far-left Peru Libre party that ushered Peru's President Pedro Castillo into power, talks to Reuters, in Lima, Peru September 20, 2022. REUTERS/Marcelo Rochabrun\n\nLIMA, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Vladimir Cerron, the head of the far-left party that ushered Peruvian President Pedro Castillo into power last year, told Reuters on Tuesday that his congressional bloc is still committed to staving off impeachment attempts against the embattled leader.\n\nCastillo won the election by a razor-thin margin last year, spooking investors on the campaign trail with a radical plan written by Cerron, the head of the Marxist-Leninist Peru Libre party. The plan included rewriting the constitution and nationalizing key industries. Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer.\n\nBut once in office, Castillo has kept the economy under moderate hands and said he will not change Peru's market-friendly rules, angering Cerron who demanded Castillo's resignation from the party, which Castillo agreed to. However, Cerron still supports Castillo remaining in the presidency.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"What is missing for a (successful) impeachment are a few votes that Peru Libre could have provided at any moment,\" Cerron, a neurosurgeon trained in Cuba, told Reuters in a rare interview at his party headquarters.\n\n\"And that is definitely not our intention...Peru Libre remains an insurmountable barrier so far.\"\n\nPeru Libre controls 16 of 130 seats in Peru's unicameral Congress. Ousting Castillo requires 87 votes, but the two impeachment trials so far yielded 46 and 55 votes respectively.\n\nCerron's remarks will give Castillo breathing room at a time when some lawmakers in the opposition-led Congress are discussing launching a third impeachment attempt, although they have acknowledged they do not currently have enough votes.\n\nPeruvian politics are notoriously volatile, cycling through five presidents since 2016 and witnessing six impeachment trials in the same period.\n\nCerron said he would like Castillo to finish his term in 2026, which would make him the first elected president in a decade to do so, after Ollanta Humala who took office in 2011.\n\nCastillo is also in a weak spot, besieged by six criminal investigations, among them whether he has used the presidency to benefit his family and whether he has obstructed justice to protect key allies. His sister-in-law has been jailed, while a former minister remains on the run.\n\nCastillo has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNEW CONSTITUTION EFFORTS STALLED\n\nCerron said Peru Libre is not currently seeking a constitutional assembly to redraft the Constitution.\n\nWhile writing a new magna carta remains a key party objective, he acknowledged currently there is no legal way to achieve that without persuading a majority of Congress, which remains split among conservative parties that are opposed to a rewrite.\n\n\"The doors have been closed not just for Peru Libre but for other social organizations that were supporting (a new constitution,)\" Cerron said.\n\nWhile analysts have said a constitutional rewrite is unlikely, Cerron's comments are the strongest so far acknowledging that improbable scenario.\n\nHe added he has not spoken with Castillo in a month and that Castillo's administration has abandoned virtually all of Peru Libre's objectives.\n\nCastillo \"is a pragmatic man,\" Cerron said. \"He's a president who is facing the day-to-day without having an agenda for the future.\"\n\n(In paragraph 6, corrects voting tally of first impeachment attempt to 46, not 76)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marcelo Rochabrun and Marco Aquino; Editing by Josie Kao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Mexico's 'Chucky' Lozano steps up with late winner vs. Peru to give El Tri pre-World Cup boost": "PASADENA, Calif. -- For a little over 80 minutes on Saturday night against Peru, it looked as if a dark period for Mexico's men's national team would extend one game further as they approach the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBefore kicking off the weekend's friendly at the Rose Bowl, Mexico had one win in their last five games, which built additional tension for manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino and his side after a questionable run through World Cup qualifying and poor friendly results earlier this year.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nDuring a media day on Tuesday, themes of fan discontent, injury problems and leadership issues surrounded the national team. Martino looked frustrated behind the microphone at the media day, admitting that Mexico haven't played their best soccer since 2019-20, while also listing injuries for key players like Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Raul Jimenez, Houston Dynamo DP Hector Herrera, Ajax's Jorge Sanchez and Monterrey duo Rogelio Funes Mori and Luis Romo. Sevilla's Jesus \"Tecatito\" Corona, arguably El Tri's top player, was also unavailable in the international break after suffering a leg injury this summer that will likely keep him out of the World Cup.\n\nOff the field, the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) has dealt with a chaotic time of its own. Coupled with complications in the women's national team and at youth level, FMF president Mikel Arriola announced sweeping changes in July. Gerardo Torrado and Ignacio Hierro were fired from their respective posts as general sporting director and sporting director of national teams. Luis Perez was also let go as the men's U20 coach. Women's senior coach Monica Vergara would eventually lose her position as well.\n\nMartino held on to his post, despite failing to win the latest CONCACAF Nations League, the 2021 Gold Cup and going through four consecutive games without a victory against El Tri's U.S. men's national team rivals. Rumors of his possible exit from the FMF after the World Cup have led to a disharmonious and potentially cataclysmic end to 2022, but back on the field at Pasadena this weekend, a glimmer of hope emerged for all involved.\n\nIn front of a raucous 62,729 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, El Tri eventually looked enlivened after a dull start to the game through second-half substitutions for Uriel Antuna, Santiago Gimenez, Andres Guardado and Orbelin Pineda. Possibly due to desperation in changing the script that appeared pessimistic once again, there was excellent movement and playmaking in the final third that helped lead to a decisive corner in the 85th minute, which provided star winger Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano with a goal that sent the Rose Bowl into a frenzy. and secured a 1-0 win.\n\nThe 27-year-old did well to lead attacking efforts, and eventually found the game-winner late into the second half. Lozano was emotional after scoring his first goal in 2022 for Mexico, while fans sang his name to the usual tune of \"Seven Nation Army.\" Chants of \"El Chu-cky Lo-za-no\" were by far the loudest that they've been heard in years, joyous in the trust that the Napoli player had created a necessary step forward in Mexican soccer.\n\nConfidence at an all-game high, it was easy to forget about any of the problems El Tri has had on or off the field. The Rose Bowl became a party, and unlike the dire scenes that have become the norm at many Mexico matches, there was elation in their first of two World Cup \"sendoff\" games this month in California that ended in a 1-0 victory.\n\nHirving 'Chucky' Lozano gave Mexico a much-needed win in one of their final friendly matches before the World Cup. Omar Vega/Getty Images\n\n\"A victory is always important, and even more so against such a difficult team,\" Lozano said to TUDN after scoring the game-winner. \"I think they made the match very tough for us.\"\n\nEven the typically serious and tired Martino was beaming after the game, knowing not just that Mexico had earned a vital result, but that also he could have an unexpected leader through Lozano.\n\n\"After so many years in Europe, obviously, it makes a footballer evolve in every way,\" a proud Martino said about the Napoli winger after the match. \"It's clear that he is evolving, not only in the soccer part, but also in the professional part and in the human part.\"\n\n- 2022 World Cup bracket and fixtures schedule\n\nIt wasn't just about Chucky, but about the entire squad as they celebrated the goal. Through a release of tension, El Tri desperately needed this result ahead of the World Cup and above the criticism that has been placed upon them since struggling to recreate the magic of Martino's first couple of years in 2019 and 2020. In the postmatch news conference, Martino noted that the team is \"much more similar\" to the one that reached a perceived peak a couple years ago.\n\nIt's questionable to buy into the idea that Mexico are truly turning things around after a number of head-scratching performances over the last several months, but if they claimed another victory this Tuesday against Colombia at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium (which would mark just their second consecutive victory this year), there would be hope that Mexico's final two pre-World Cup friendlies could propel the team towards greater things at Qatar this November.\n\nThe idea of gradual changes and last-minute long shots might be unrealistic for their World Cup chances, but the same could be said of Lozano's lone attempt back in 2018 that shocked Germany in a 1-0 defeat during the World Cup.\n\nRegardless of injury problems across the squad and issues behind the scenes within the front office, Mexico can continue making small steps forward this month, with the help of an unlikely leader in Lozano and with the dreams of bigger and prominent steps this November.",
    "Paradise lost: Inside Peru's emergency zone": "One woman said she was 16 when she agreed to work at a bar in the area in August 2021 on the promise of making more money in a week than most make in a month. She said she had no idea that the job would involve sexually catering to men. She was ultimately paid $50 for sex, but also had to endure physical and psychological abuse from her boss and the boss’s children.\n\n“The entire time I worked there was absolute hell,” said the woman, who managed to escape in March after police raided the illicit establishment. “I would not want even one more woman to go through the same thing.”\n\nDiana Valencia, a prosecutor in Madre de Dios focused on human trafficking, said her office brought charges against 90 people in the first six months of this year.\n\nA young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado. A young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado.\n\nU.S. authorities and the Peruvian national police are now assisting local law enforcement in the region. In February, a U.S.-assisted operation led to the arrest of three trafficking suspects and the rescue of multiple victims.\n\n“Many of the victims are threatened,” Valencia said. “When they get to the place, they are deprived of their liberty, their ID is retained, so that they can’t leave.”\n\nGuadalupe eventually stopped traveling to the camps himself because of the various dangers and instead focused on expanding his network of collaborators. The local police started raiding the prosti-bars and bringing the young girls they rescued to Guadalupe’s shelter, where they would be provided with clothes, food, education and a bed.\n\nThe shelter also welcomed poor kids who moved to Mazuko to attend school but had no family in the area. Those rescued from the mines would join in on the lessons, Guadalupe said, providing a mental escape from the horrors they had endured.\n\nIn all, Guadalupe said more than 1,000 children had passed through his shelter until he closed it in 2019 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic. The local government had by then set up its own facility to house children trafficked to the mines.\n\n\n\nGuadalupe said the youngest boy he cared for was 8; the youngest girl was 9. Some of the children stayed for a couple of days, others for a couple of years.\n\nSome of them went on to become college students and parents themselves. One is now studying medicine in college in order to become a doctor.\n\n“I don’t think that I have done a great job,” Guadalupe said. “I just did what I had to do.”\n\nHe now travels the country educating people on the dangers of child trafficking. But there are some stories he cannot tell without breaking down.\n\nThe first girl he rescued was a 13-year-old who spoke no Spanish, only an Indigenous language. When Guadalupe found her, she was sick with an infection after being sexually abused by miners.\n\nGuadalupe brought her to a local clinic but they weren’t able to pursue her attackers because she didn’t know their names. At the time he still didn’t know that the men who abuse girls like her rarely face justice because the mines are so remote and catching them in the act is difficult.\n\nEven two decades later, he said he’s still haunted by what that young girl went through and the lack of accountability for her abusers.\n\n“When we remember it, we feel we haven’t done anything,” he said with tears in his eyes.",

    "Peru’s Troubles Go Well Beyond Castillo": "Peru’s economy was once dubbed a “miracle” by analysts who marveled at its stability despite years of political chaos. But now, it’s facing tough times.\n\nDespite a strong rebound in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic, Fitch Ratings has revised down its projections for GDP growth in 2022 from 2.5% to 2.3%. Similarly, the IMF has adjusted its projection from 3.3% to 2.8% and has announced that Colombia’s growth rate looks set to overtake Peru this year. Analysts have pointed to adverse global financial conditions, including high inflation and less demand from China, Peru’s main trade partner and the biggest consumer of its mineral exports.\n\nThere is no doubt that Peru is not performing as it once did. But what’s new is that the country’s economy is finally being affected negatively by political crises. A recent Reuters article noted that Peru’s central bank had recorded the lowest level of investor confidence since the 2008 recession, due to the series of corruption scandals and constant cabinet changes of Pedro Castillo’s government. According to Fitch, “politics and the economy can no longer be treated separately.”\n\nBut how fair is it to say that the Castillo administration is fully to blame for Peru’s economic woes? While the country’s governability has always been shaky, Castillo has taken this to new levels. Currently, the president is facing six criminal investigations that implicate him directly in bribery and other corruption schemes and include his wife and sister-in-law as well as several other close associates. He has reshuffled his cabinet 59 times in a year, which means that there has been a new minister every week on average. Congress is also not helping matters; so far it has tried twice to impeach Castillo and will likely try again. The general chaos prompted over 200 business organizations to sign an open letter in July condemning all the corruption allegations against the president and demanding that Congress remove him if these continue to appear.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Castillo is facing opposition from business groups, due to the alarm his presumed leftist agenda caused since the beginning of his presidency. But Peru’s economic troubles go beyond investor confidence. It was only a matter of time until the country’s economy could no longer solely rely on its solid macroeconomic policies. Previous governments, all very business-friendly, were able to keep politics divorced from economics mostly because in the 2000s and 2010s there was an appetite for Latin American resources not seen since the end of the Second World War. This commodity boom, driven by China’s rise, allowed Peru to accumulate high levels of reserves, grow almost 6% annually for years and reduce poverty to 20% from the 50% recorded in the early 2000s. It also let governments ignore repeated warnings that secondary reforms would be necessary to maintain economic performance.\n\nAlready by 2014, for example, the IMF and World Bank were stressing the need for Peru to have a broader tax base, to modernize its labor market in order to incorporate more workers into the formal sector, to invest in technology and to diversify its economy so that it reduced its reliance on mineral exports, which make up about 10% of the country’s GDP. None of these things occurred.\n\nNeither was any previous government able to provide a definitive solution to the social conflicts that have repeatedly arisen around mining projects in the last decade. Relationships between mining companies and the communities that live in their vicinity have become increasingly frayed. The Las Bambas copper mine, owned by MMG, was recently paralyzed for almost 50 days, despite the government’s several attempts at brokering talks between the population and the company. However, protests have been occurring since 2015, and in general, the inability to resolve the social conflict issue has now resulted in a smaller pipeline for mining investment in 2022.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Castillo’s new minister of Finance, Kurt Burneo, a well-known technocrat, has publicly recognized the need to recuperate investor confidence in order to foster economic growth. Two weeks ago, while presenting the budget for the next fiscal year, Burneo stressed that one of the government’s goals is to recover this confidence by promoting private investment through commissions that fast-track projects and government-to-government arrangements like the one with the United Kingdom for the 2019 Panamerican Games. Burneo has also stated that the ministry will not seek to increase taxes in a similar effort to reassure investors.\n\nThe Castillo government, thus far, has not proved to be the threat to the private sector that it was feared to be. In fact, it has largely maintained the same fiscal and macroeconomic management that’s been in place since the structural adjustment policies implemented in the 1990s.\n\nAnd yet, macroeconomic discipline alone cannot foster the conditions necessary for Peru’s development. Politics was eventually bound to catch up to the economy. Unfortunately, it has coincided with a highly incompetent president at the helm, adding fuel to the fire.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Moncada, a contributing columnist to Americas Quarterly, is a Peruvian journalist and political analyst currently based in the UK.

    "Remains of Sacrificed Children Uncovered in Peru": "Friday, September 23, 2022\n\nTRUJILLO, PERU—Andina News Agency reports that the remains of an additional 76 children have been found at the Chimu site of Pampa la Cruz, which is located near Peru’s northern coastline. Twenty-five of the graves were found in Mound I, while the other 51 were uncovered in Mound II. In all, the remains of 302 children have been unearthed in the area. Archaeologist Gabriel Prieto of the University of Florida said radiocarbon dating suggests that the children were killed in six sacrificial events between about A.D. 1050 and 1500. Another burial in Mound I held the remains of five women seated in a circle.

Household survey data indicates that recent decades of high output growth also witnessed a substantial narrowing of socioeconomic gaps among ethnicities. Most notably, the Mestizo ethnic group surpassed the White group in income per capita, and Native American also experienced a relative improvement. Mincerian regression analysis suggests that the main contributors to these developments were rural-to-urban migration and increased education. Based on our statistical findings, we propose enhancing education and other public services, increasing government revenues, lowering informality, and promoting competition as the main public policies that could accelerate the ongoing narrowing of ethnic gaps.",
    "Amid disgust over corruption, Peru regional elections spark little enthusiasm": "By Paula Bayarte\n\nLima, Sep 21 (EFE) – A deep cynicism reigns on the streets of Peru ahead of next month’s regional and municipal elections, with most people slamming the country’s political class as hopelessly corrupt and saying virtually no candidates deserve their support.\n\n“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for because there are no proper candidates,” Manuel, a street fruit vendor in a working-class Lima neighborhood, told Efe.\n\nAsked what he is looking for in the next mayor of this capital, he said “someone without a (criminal past) who has done something for his people would be enough,” though adding that none of the candidates are to his liking.\n\nRegional and municipal elections are scheduled to be held on Oct. 2.\n\nBut despite their proximity, there has been a striking lack of political rallies and a notable absence of headline-grabbing proposals by the candidates.\n\nThe only indication of the upcoming balloting is the presence of campaign signs, particularly in poorer neighborhoods and small municipalities, as well as some traffic-blocking public works projects.\n\nThose latter initiatives are also viewed cynically by a jaded electorate, who say they are a telltale sign that elections are around the corner.\n\nManuel’s sentiments are echoed by most other ordinary citizens, who say they assume all politicians are corrupt. Indeed, the level of distrust is so high that voter participation would inevitably be very low if the country did not have compulsory voting laws.\n\n“There will aways be corruption, whether the candidate is good or bad. The only way to vote for a non-corrupt candidate is to vote for the last one on the list,” Gamaliel joked while standing outside a shopping mall in this capital with his wife, who said she will vote for the current mayor of the Lima district of Chorrillos even though he is ineligible to run again.\n\nThe indifference of voters contrasts with an ongoing intense political crisis that is now the main focus of news coverage in Peru.\n\n“They’re all scoundrels. All my life they’ve done the same. I’ve lived here since 1952, and there hasn’t been one good candidate. They’re all thieves. It’s a shame. I won’t vote. I’m 81 years old and I’ve always gone (to cast a ballot), but I don’t need anyone anymore because I live happily with my work. A total change is needed,” one passer-by, Manuel Sialer, said.\n\nAnother woman riding in a combi (a small minibus) who preferred to remain anonymous said she will cast a blank ballot because “these mayors come in, steal and do nothing.”\n\nOne teenager Efe spoke to expressed similar disgust with the political class.\n\n“Young people aren’t very interested. They’re into their own things and vote just to vote,” Jair Manosalva, a 19-year-old from Peru’s northern coastal region, told Efe outside a Lima gym. “They’ve disappointed us too much. We don’t care about them anymore. So whoever wins is going to be the same as the next one or the one who just left.”\n\nThe front runners in Lima mayor’s race are Daniel Urresti, a retired army general and former interior minister; and Rafael Lopez Aliaga, a businessman and right-wing populist.\n\nBoth have pledged to battle corruption and crime if elected.\n\nAgustin Luyo, a shoe shiner in Villa Maria del Triunfo, says the fight against street crime is the top priority for residents of that low-income district on Lima’s south side.\n\nGuillermo, who spoke to Efe on the opposite side of the city, said he is voting for Lopez Aliaga because that candidate will “clean up corruption” and “improve public safety.” EFE\n\npbc/mc",
    "Mystery Diner in Peru: Riverfront Bar & Grill offers good food, late kitchen hours": "The Italian beef at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru was how I like it.\n\nStacks of well-seasoned beef and loads of mozzarella cheese in every bite filled a toasted, crispy bun. The sandwich also came with pepperoncini on top and au jus for dipping.\n\nThis was the perfect entree ($8.50) to take in a Sunday night football game.\n\nLocal options are limited on a Sunday evening, and Riverfront’s kitchen is open until 8 p.m. Sundays, meaning diners can get a full stomach by the second quarter.\n\nThe bar and grill has plenty of seating both indoors and on an outdoor patio – both with bars. There are several television sets at the bars and in the dining areas, and the audio of the game was featured on speakers throughout the building, making it a great place to watch.\n\nA trio of people played darts and another group hung out on the outside patio while I was there, but it’s pretty easy to stake out your own space and get comfortable.\n\nRiverfront Bar & Grill features cheese curds on its appetizer menu, offering them in regular and garlic flavors. (Mystery Diner)\n\nThe bar and grill has a full menu of appetizers: loaded nachos, cheese curds (regular or garlic), onion rings, pretzel sticks, fried pickles, mushrooms, cheese sticks, fried cauliflower, loaded fries and breaded mushrooms. I opted for the cheese curds ($7) and was pleased at the plentiful serving, acknowledging it could be shared pretty easily within a group of three.\n\nWings and football go hand-in-hand. An order of six, breaded chicken wings hot was my preference at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru. (Mystery Diner)\n\nWings and football go hand-in-hand, so I tried out an order of six ($7), breaded with hot sauce. Wings at Riverfront are served breaded or naked, and are flavored plain, barbecue, Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, sweet and sour, spicy sweet and sour, or hot. Additionally, the restaurant offers chicken strips and will flavor them how diners like them.\n\nThe menu also features all kinds of burgers, sandwiches (including breaded pork tenderloins), wraps, soups, salads, grilled pork chops, pasta and fried chicken/fish.\n\nWhile I chose to sit indoors, the outside patio offers a close view of the Illinois River. Patrons can eat a dinner or have drinks and watch barges float down the waterway.\n\nI’ve always loved the businesses and old buildings on Water Street in Peru, and that feeling of being below the Route 251 bridge reminds me of the riverside neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n\nRiverfront’s bar stays open until 2 a.m., but the restaurant closes at 8 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. They also offer carryouts, which were popular while I was dining.\n\nIf you find yourself in the predicament I often do – it’s getting later and later, beyond the normal dinner time, and your favorite restaurants are beginning to shut down their kitchens – think Riverfront. It is a great option for a late meal, and to take in a sports game. The food was good and the atmosphere was comfortable.\n\nThe outdoor patio with a bar at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru provides views of the river and a place to relax outdoors for a meal or drinks.

    "Peru State falls short against MidAmerica Nazarene": "(Peru, Neb.)—Peru State football's furious comeback in the second half was not enough to defeat MidAmerica Nazarene as they lost 21-19. The Bobcats are now 2-3 overall while the Pioneers are 3-2 overall.\n\n\n\nBelow is a breakdown of how tonight's loss went…\n\n\n\nThe Bobcats received the ball to start the game but a quick three-and-out had the Bobcats punting early in the game. The Pioneers on their first possession of the game would march down the field as two big pass plays set them up at the one-yard line as they would scamper in for a one-yard score.\n\n\n\nPeru State's offense was still trying to find its groove but their drive would stall out around the 50-yard line as they would have to punt. On the Pioneers next drive the Bobcats defense stepped up big as Abe Metelus (Naples, Fla.) intercepted the ball putting the 'Cats in great position to score.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, a five-play drive ended with the Pioneers intercepting the ball back. On the next Bobcat drive Desmond Sams (Mandeville, La.) provided a spark with an 18-yard run. Then a 25-yard pass to Jarrius Anderson (Cordova, Tenn.) from Will Mueller (Springdale, Ark.) put the 'Cats in the red zone.\n\n\n\nMack Boekhout (Elkhorn) would get the Bobcats on the board with three points. Peru State trailed MNU 7-3 at the end of the first quarter. The Pioneers would go on a 10 play 89-yard scoring drive to make the score 14-3 to open the second quarter.\n\n\n\nStacy Livingston (St. Louis, Mo.) would have a 27-yard run but the Bobcat drive would stall out and a six-yard punt would put the Pioneers in great field position. The Bobcat defense stepped up forcing a three-and-out.\n\n\n\nOn the next Bobcat possession, the Pioneers would pick off the ball on the first play. Then MNU would score immediately to make the score 21-3. The Pioneers would take the 18-point lead into the half.\n\n\n\nPeru State's defense forced a three-and-out in the first drive of the second half, the Bobcat offense was still stagnant and they would have to punt on their first possession of the half.\n\n\n\nThe Bobcat defense came up big on the ensuing drive as a strip sack by Devin Adams (Pembroke Pines, Fla) and a recovery by Gerald Smith (Baltimore, MD.) setup the 'Cats offense with great field position.\n\n\n\nPeru State decided to make a change at the quarterback position as Grant Gutschow (Elkhorn) came into the game and provided a spark. On a third down Gutschow hit Kaleb Herbel for a 21-yard touchdown strike as the 'Cats would have their first touchdown trailing 21-10.\n\n\n\nMNU was driving on the next possession but they would come up empty as a 40-yard field goal was missed wide left.\n\n\n\nIt had looked like another Bobcat drive had stalled in the beginning of the fourth quarter but the 'Cats dialed up a fake punt as Adams had a 31-yard rush on fourth down putting Peru State in MNU territory.\n\n\n\nBoekhout would hit a 27-yard field goal to make it a one possession game 21-13 with a little under ten minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. A three-and-out by the Pioneers would have the Bobcats in possession of the ball with a little more than halfway to go in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nThen another fake punt by Adams, this time a pass play to TJ Soules (Fort Worth, Texas) for a 36-yard gain had Peru State nearing the red zone. The Bobcats would turn the ball over on downs albeit a questionable spot on the fourth down play.\n\n\n\nPeru State had one more chance with the ball down eight with 1:30 to go. Gutschow started with a 13-yard gain. Then a 21-yard pass to Gregory Adams (Pembroke Pines, Fla.) had the 'Cats at the MNU 34-yard line.\n\n\n\nThen a nine-yard run by Gutschow had the Bobcats down to the four-yard line. Then after a penalty giving the Bobcats another first down after it looked like it was going to be fourth and goal, Gutschow scampered into the end zone for the score with nine seconds remaining.\n\n\n\nThe 'Cats now trailing by two 21-19, needing the two-point conversion, Unfortunately, Gutschow threw an interception. Peru State fell to MidAmerica Nazarene 21-19.\n\n\n\nMueller was 4-of-11 for 60 yards and two interceptions. Gutschow was 2-of-8 for 42 yards, he had a throwing and rushing touchdown.\n\n\n\nSams led the way in rushing with 13 carries for 60 yards. Soules led the way in receiving with one reception for 36 yards.\n\n\n\nDefensively Clayton Thrasher (Mandeville, La.) had led the way in tackles with nine. Adams, Ka'Von Lofton (Apopka, Fla.), Kolby Amman and Thrasher each had a sack. Smith had the lone fumble recovery after Adams forced it and Metelus had the lone interception.\n\n\n\nPeru State welcomes Evangel to the Oak Bowl next Saturday, October 1, at 2:00 p.m., for the homecoming game.",

    "1,300-Year-Old Tomb of the “Lord of Huarmey” Excavated in Peru": "Friday, September 23, 2022\n\nHUARMEY, PERU—Live Science reports that researchers led by Miłosz Giersz of the University of Warsaw discovered a 1,300-year-old Wari tomb in a necropolis on Peru’s North Coast known as El Castillo de Huarmey. The tomb is thought to have belonged to a man who has been dubbed the “Lord of Huarmey,” although the remains of six other people were included in the burial. They are thought to have been buried at another site before they were reinterred in this tomb. The grave also held an abundance of gold and silver jewelry in various stages of completion, bronze tools, knives, axes, baskets, woven textiles, materials for making baskets, and wood and leather items. Giersz suggests that the tomb’s occupants may have been skilled craftspeople in addition to being members of the Wari elite. This tomb is located on top of a larger tomb Giersz and his colleagues discovered in 2012, which contained the remains of three high-status Wari women and 58 other people, some of whom may have been sacrificed. Giersz thinks the Castillo de Huarmey may have been an administrative center for the Wari Empire and a place of ancestor worship.

Then, he led The Society expedition team to install the weather station, sample microplastics and water isotopes in the summit snowpack and make other atmospheric and glaciological observations.\n\nThe July 25 weather station installation was a significant milestone in the 2022 National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, a two-year exploration of the Amazon River Basin spanning the Andes to the Atlantic.\n\nDr. Baker Perry, National Geographic Explorer and professor in App State’s Department of Geography and Planning, co-led the July 2022 expedition to install the highest weather station in the Andes, near the peak of Nevado Ausangate.

Photo by Justen Bruns/National Geographic\n\n“Nevado Ausangate is one of the most critical mountains in the high Andes as it serves as the primary freshwater source for Andean and downstream ecosystems,” said Perry.\n\nThe new weather station, installed just below the summit at 20,830 feet (6,349 meters), collects meteorological data such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation and snow depth, all of which will aid local governments and the international scientific community in observing the impacts of climate change on critical water resources that affect local communities.\n\n“It is essential that we use weather observations from the highest peaks in the world to better understand the impacts that climate change is having on local and global communities. The changes happening on Ausangate are especially important in understanding the fluctuations and adaptations of the entire Amazon River watershed,” Perry added.\n\nApp State alumna Heather Guy ’18, who is pursuing her Ph.D. at the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, was another member of the expedition team. Guy — who has been working as a science technician at Summit Station in Greenland — and National Geographic Explorer and expedition co-leader Dr. Tom Matthews assisted Perry during the study abroad program as well.\n\nPerry, Matthews and Guy will analyze data from the Ausangate station, in cooperation with the National University of Saint Anthony the Abad in Cuzco (UNSAAC), the Higher University of San Andrés (UMSA) in Bolivia and the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service of Peru — all partners in the expedition.\n\nThe National Geographic Society team makes its way to high camp on Ausangate. Photo by Justen Bruns/National Geographic\n\n“By being involved in the research project through the study abroad experience, the students learn firsthand that it is not only academic knowledge that makes scientific research successful. Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital.” App State alumna Heather Guy ’18\n\nPerry said he incorporates all of his experiences as a National Geographic Explorer directly into the classroom at App State — both in lectures and in laboratory assignments — in his Global Climate Change course. “I anticipate our students will assist with the data analysis from the weather stations,” he shared.\n\n“By being involved in the research project through the study abroad experience, the students learn firsthand that it is not only academic knowledge that makes scientific research successful. Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital.” App State alumna Heather Guy ’18\n\nGuy, who served as Perry’s research assistant in 2018 while earning her Master of Arts in geography at App State, said learning about Perry’s cutting-edge research helps students understand the relevance of their studies beyond classrooms and exams.\n\n“By being involved in the research project through the study abroad experience, the students learn firsthand that it is not only academic knowledge that makes scientific research successful. Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital,” Guy said.\n\nThe new Ausangate station builds upon previous Perpetual Planet Expeditions to install weather stations in high mountain environments, including to the Tupungato volcano in Chile in 2021 as well as to Mount Everest in 2019 and 2022, all of which included Perry. Rolex supports these expeditions as part of its Perpetual Planet initiative.\n\nNicole Alexiev, vice president of science and innovation programs at The Society, said the goal of the work in the Amazon River Basin is to “illuminate the critically important role this region plays in stabilizing the health of the planet, to support scientific fieldwork to better understand how climate change and other environmental factors are affecting the region and, importantly, to invest in solutions to ensure its protection.”\n\nThe initiative combines photojournalism, scientific fieldwork and partnering with local communities to highlight the effects of climate and environmental change — and the people who are working to find solutions.\n\nA group of 12 App State students participated in a study abroad program in Peru in July 2022, where they learned about climate change, glaciers, water resources and the local culture. They are pictured at Machu Picchu in Peru. Photo submitted\n\nStudy abroad, plus a bonus\n\nDuring his time at App State, Perry has led 19 study abroad education and research expeditions to the Andes, with the opportunity for students to learn about climate change, glaciers, water resources and the local culture. Perry and local collaborators operate a weather station on the Quelccaya Ice Cap (elevation of 18,537 feet, or 5,650 meters) and students hike to the station to help maintain the station and gather ice samples.\n\nThe high elevation of the summit of the glacierized area — and the intensive climb to reach it — requires gradual acclimatization over several days, in order to minimize risk of altitude sickness. The Society’s expedition team accompanied the App State students during this summer’s study abroad program in order to acclimatize for their climb up Ausangate.\n\nThe students were able to interact with The Society’s expedition team’s climate scientists and media professionals. “It added so much to the students’ experience,” Perry said.\n\nAlex Moore, an App State junior from Watkinsville, Georgia, attended the university’s Peru: Climate Change in the Andes study abroad program in July. Moore, pictured second from right, extended his trip to assist Dr. Baker Perry, National Geographic Explorer and professor in App State’s Department of Geography and Planning, and the rest of the National Geographic Society expedition team on their expedition to install a weather station on top of Ausangate. Also pictured, from left to right, are Perry, App State alumna Heather Guy ’18 and Dr. Tom Matthews, all members of the expedition team. Photo submitted by Baker Perry\n\nAlex Moore, an App State junior from Watkinsville, Georgia, who is majoring in biology-ecology, evolution and environmental biology, attended the study abroad program and extended his trip to assist with the Ausangate expedition.\n\nMoore said he could “write a book” about all he learned concerning the culture of Peru, different scientific disciplines and working in high altitudes.\n\nPrior to his time in Peru, Moore said it was difficult for him to imagine what climate change and its impact look like.\n\n“It hits you like a train when you see pictures from 10 years ago versus what you are seeing right in front of you,” Moore said. “Walking up to a glacier early in the morning that, by afternoon, becomes a stream of water and slush makes an impression in the worst way possible.”\n\nDuring the Ausangate expedition, Moore assisted the media crew, carried sections of the weather station to the base of the glacier and labeled ice samples. Though he did not climb to the summit with the team to assemble the weather station, Perry said Moore was a “huge help,” particularly when one member of the media team had to return to Cusco with sickness prior to the completion of the expedition.\n\nFrom the film crew, to the researchers, to the climbing guides, Moore said he was exposed to people who were at the “top of their game” and valued the opportunity to learn from them.

A judge will decide if Paredes should be held in preventive detention for 36 months, as requested by the prosecution for her alleged participation in a corruption network. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia)\n\nLIMA, Peru (AP) — A Peruvian judge on Sunday ordered President Pedro Castillo’s sister-in-law to be held in prison up to 2.5 years while she is investigated for criminal association and corruption for her participation in an alleged money laundering scheme involving the president and first lady.\n\nAfter postponing his decision twice, judge Johnny Gómez said there was “a high probability of fleeing” for Yenifer Paredes, 26, and ordered her pretrial detention.\n\nParedes had been raised by Castillo and his spouse as their daughter after her mother died. It is the first time in Peru that a relative so close to a sitting president has been sent to prison.\n\nDefense lawyers said they would appeal the decision and Castillo has denied all the accusations against him.\n\nParedes had turned herself in to the prosecutor’s office on Aug. 10, a day after police went to the presidential palace to arrest her but failed to find her there. She had been serving 18 days while being questioned at a police station.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe prosecutor’s office asked a judge last week to impose a 3-year preventative sentence.\n\nCastillo has not commented on the detention of his relative. But at the time she turned herself in, he said “they will pull out all the stops to continue hitting my family, my parents, brothers, it is part of the struggle but they are not going to break me.”\n\nProsecutor’s have accused Castillo, several of his relatives, Transportation Minister Geiner Alvarado and a town mayor of being part of a criminal group that created front companies to launder money. The coordinator of the alleged group was the first lady and three relatives of the president, including Paredes, were figureheads.\n\nThe prosecution said Paredes helped the owner of one front company obtain a public works project despite not having the economic capacity or experience to guarantee its completion.\n\nDespite only a year in office, Peru’s president faces several criminal investigations, including for influence peddling and leading a criminal network.\n\nDespite being investigated, Castillo cannot be formally accused by a judge because Peru’s constitution says the president can only be accused of treason, dissolving congress without reason and for not allowing elections. Prosecutors must wait until Castillo leaves the presidency to formally present other charges against him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCastillo was a rural teacher before he shocked Peru’s political elite by winning election as president campaigning on promises to improve education, health care and other services. But the political neophyte’s first year has seen near constant turmoil, with Cabinet members changing multiple times and Castillo staving off two impeachment attempts.",
    "In Peru's Andes, farmers turn to pre-Hispanic dams to fight water scarcity": "Workers and archaeologists refurbish an old dam, in Pamparomas, Peru July 11, 2022. Instituto de las Culturas/Universidad de Buenos Aires/Handout via REUTERS\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSept 12 (Reuters) - Last year, Guillermo Palmadera, the mayor of a remote area in Peru's Andes, was growing increasingly worried that a harsh dry season could spoil his district's crops of barley, alfalfa and local tubers.\n\nThe Andes have an annual dry season between May and September, but farmers in his district of Pamparomas say rains have been particularly sparse in the past couple of years, amid global human-caused climate change that is exacerbating extreme weather patterns.\n\nAn extended dry season comes at a high cost. Keeping soil idle for more than half of the year hurts both income and what families can eat.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nPalmadera found a solution not with an engineer but with an archaeologist, who was surveying bits of an old stone wall in the high grounds of his district.\n\nKevin Lane, an archeologist at the University of Buenos Aires, had identified 18 abandoned dams built in Pamparomas before the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Lane proposed refurbishing an old dam.\n\n\"The problem of water scarcity is not new in Peru,\" Lane said.\n\nWater scarcity is so intertwined with Andean history, he added, that he believes water wars were fought there in the past.\n\n\"It's very dry, we've had few rains for the past two, three years,\" said Damian Quiroz, a farmer and father of eight in Pamparonas.\n\nWith financial support from Germany's Gerda Henkel Foundation, Lane and local farmers built a 3-meter high dam on top of old remains at 4,600 meters (15,092 feet) above sea level using stones, clay and modern materials such as geotextile.\n\nThose are easy to replace in an area prone to earthquakes and big temperature variations that can crack other materials like concrete.\n\nThe rehabilitation cost $100,000, while they estimate that building a concrete dam could have cost $1 million.\n\nWith the dam finished, 300 neighbors from the Pamparomas district are waiting for the rainy season to start.

    "Protection Monitoring Peru: Snapshot (July 2022) - Peru": "This snapshot summarizes the main findings of the Protection Monitoring conducted in Lima and Tacna, Peru in July 2022 as part of the humanitarian intervention of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and ENCUENTROS SJM in the country. This project is implemented with funding from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO).\n\nTo view the interactive Dashboard with the results from this period and from the beginning of the Protection Monitoring program, click here.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the course of July 2022, DRC and ENCUENTROS SJM interviewed 34 households accounting for a total of 129 persons. Since the beginning of the Protection Monitoring exercise in Peru in October 2020, 1,434 households have been interviewed reaching a total of 5,028 persons.\n\nANALYSIS OF THE PROTECTION SITUATION\n\nThe Peruvian Government proceeds with the extension of the Temporary Residence Permit up to two years, regulating the migratory situation and granting rights and duties for foreigners in Peru.\n\nIn July, the Peruvian Migration authorities made an important announcement in regards with the extension of the deadline to manage the Temporary Residence Permit Card (CPP), which grants rights and duties to foreigners and inserts them into Peruvian society for a period of 90 calendar days.\n\nAs announced, the interested individuals will be able to manage the document until October 2 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. All interested persons will be able to manage their documentation until October 2, 2022 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. However, the access to digital platforms, is a challenge that the population must also assume, since, due to the context of the health emergency, all these procedures are carried out through the digital platforms of Migration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a process that for most migrants and refugees is widely complicated, knowing their discontinuous access to the internet.\n\nLikewise, this document will now be valid for 2 years. This allows the regularization of persons in an irregular migratory situation who entered before October 20, 2020. Although the validity of this document will not exceed the duration of two years, it will potentially allow the renewal of the documentation to those persons whose residence permit granted by the Migration authorities has expired since October 2020, but who still remain in Peruvian territory. Additionally, this announcement intends to motivate people who entered the country without having carried out the migratory control to regularize their entry and residence in Peru.\n\nAlthough this measure allows extending the time for immigration regularization, the requirements of the process are not clear. On the one hand, there is no reference to the evidence necessary to demonstrate entry into the country before the deadline, which would imply an impediment for people who entered in an irregular manner without immigration control or who are without documentation. In the same way, there have been identified people who have independently managed such procedure, indicating a date of entry to Peru after October 20, 2020 and have been granted the CPP, so there are doubts as to whether such date is mandatory.\n\nThis announcement is expected to reduce a significant burden borne by Venezuelan migrants and refugees who were unable to cover the financial cost of fines imposed by the Migration authorities due to the expiration of their legal residence permits.\n\nTwo days before the announcement of the extension, more than 100,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees were called to pay costly fines imposed by the National Migration System, amounts they were unable to pay due to their limited economic resources, facing the fear of being forced to leave the country. In the case of people who have exceeded their time of stay, the cost of the fine is 4.60 soles per day (a little more than one dollar) and 46 soles per day in the case of people who did not make extensions on time. Knowing that DRC Monitoring shows that 76.6% of the people surveyed earn less than 900 soles per month, these fines are unaffordable for families already living in a precarious situation.\n\nDespite the fact that the migratory and refugee situation is crucial and affects different strata of the political and socioeconomic context of Peru; on July 28, during the presidential speech that is traditionally made in Congress, there was no mention of the expulsion of foreigners from Peru as had been stated in the inaugural speech of the previous year. Additionally, there was also no allusion to migration policy, nor to measures for the protection of the foreign population residing in the country. The absence of any relevant reference to migration policies suggests that no public policy decisions prioritizing complementary protection measures for refugees and migrantsin Peru are currently being foreseen.",

    "Rollin’ Down the River: Best Rafting Trips in Peru": "As more and more travelers seek outdoor experiences, Peru is the perfect destination for open-air adventures of every sort.\n\nAs more and more travelers seek outdoor experiences, Peru is the perfect destination for open-air adventures of every sort, especially river rafting. Whether you’re looking for thrills or a gentler ride, the country offers many rivers to raft on both sides of the Andes, including waters suitable for beginners, families with children, and experienced, expert rafters. Most trips include camping and cookouts on the riverbank and some feature a night or two in a lodge. For some of the best whitewater rafting, check out the Apurimac, Urubamba, Cotahuasi, Colca, Chili, Utcubamba, Marañón, Tambopata, Mayo, and Cañete rivers.\n\nHere are seven regions of the country where the rousing rafting vies with the stunning scenery for memorable experiences.\n\nCUSCO\n\nApurimac and Urubamba Rivers\n\nHead from the Incas’ former capital of Cusco to the Apurimac and Urubamba rivers for world-class thrills. The longest tributary of the Amazon and one of the 10 best rivers in the world for whitewater, the Apurimac River offers numerous short trips suitable for beginners and intermediates, ranging from one to six days. Most expeditions require a four- to five-hour drive over the Andes from Cusco to the Apurimac region. But some trips such as an easy one-day adventure through the river’s Black Canyon begin just southeast of Cusco and include pickup and drop-off at hotels. A bit more exciting for rafters 13 years and older with some experience, a two-day trip through the Apurimac’s Granite Canyon delivers Class II and III waters as a warmup for Class V rapids named Gates of Purgatory and Last Laugh.\n\nBest time: May and June.\n\nFor those short on time, Cusco puts you only 45 minutes from the Upper Urubamba River and an hour from the Sacred Valley. During the rainy season on this long stretch, the water level reaches its highest, hence there are more raftable segments appropriate for rafters with different skills. In the dry season, the Upper Urubamba remains tame, never wilder than Class III, and ideal for first timers. Short river trips start in the Sacred Valley, one from the former Inka town of Ollantaytambo, and any of these would make a good follow-up to a Machupicchu visit. On the Lower Urubamba, choose from one-, two-, and three-day river expeditions through rainforest with Class II, III, and IV rapids.\n\nBest time: May to December.\n\nAREQUIPA\n\nCotahuasi, Colca, and Chili Rivers\n\nThe two deepest whitewater canyons in the world, Cotahuasi and Colca, draw the most serious rafters to the Arequipa region. On the Cotahuasi River, experienced rafters looking for the ultimate challenge will paddle 100 miles over five or six days with 50 miles of nonstop Class IV and V rapids through the world’s deepest gorge. At 11,595 feet, Cotahuasi Canyon measures twice the depth of the Grand Canyon. Water is snowmelt, cold year-round, and the river runs progressively faster as the water level drops 60 feet deeper into the canyon every mile. The adventure begins with a full-day drive from Arequipa to the town of Cotahuasi. There is one raftable section that begins upstream from Cotahuasi and three start downriver.\n\nBest time: from April to September when water level is lower and weather is better.\n\nSome die-hards raft Cotahuasi and the Colca River, which tumbles through the world’s second deepest gorge at 10,225 feet. Colca Canyon is one of the most spectacular canyons on Earth with thundering waterfalls pouring into the river and Andean condors gliding effortlessly on strong winds. Most expeditions take six days, recommended only for river experts and gutsy adventurers. Rafters face 100 miles of Class IV and V rapids after the river’s confluence with the Mamacocha River where the volume of water doubles. But there’s also a one-day trip with enough excitement for beginners and intermediate rafters on Class II and III rapids.\n\nBest time: best weather and flow between March and December when the water level is highest; can be rafted year-round; condors most active between March and June.\n\nWith a starting point 20 minutes north of the historic center of Arequipa in the Chilina Valley, the Chili River is a great choice if you’re short of time and your group includes beginners and/or intermediate rafters (minimum age 8). You’ll paddle 4 miles of Class II and III rapids, plus one Class IV drop in less than an hour (or a bit longer between July and December), adding up to 3 hours total from pickup to drop-off at your hotel. But a single day on the river won’t shortchange you on majesty and a sense of history. Stunning landscapes, pre-Inca terraces, and towering canyon walls make for impressive views, plus the river runs between two snowcapped volcanoes, El Misti and Chachani — both summits are just under 20,000 feet high.\n\nBest time: best weather and water, April to December.\n\nCHACHAPOYAS\n\nUtcubamba River\n\nTravel to Chachapoyas and meet your outfitter for a 45-minute drive to the entry point on the fast-flowing, sometimes turbulent Utcubamba River, which runs from the central Andes and flows north to the Amazon. Full- and half-day tours are offered on 7.5 miles of Class II and III rapids that don’t require rafting experience, and on a rocky section that requires portage. While in Chachapoyas, make time for a side trip to Karajia (30 miles northwest) to see the life-sized sarcophagi that once held mummified remains of pre-Inca Chachapoya nobility and are perched on high cliffside ledges.\n\nBest time: for weather and water, May.\n\nTARAPOTO\n\nMayo River\n\nFor a smooth introduction to river rafting, consider the Mayo River near Tarapoto in northern Peru. Beginners and families with children 8 years and older will find their comfort zone with moderate and moderately difficult rapids and enjoy the chance at a few spots to jump off the raft with a life jacket on and free float in calm water for a while. The river runs through a beautiful valley that’s a mix of high jungle and farmland. Fifteen minutes from the end, there’s a beach where you can take a break, swing from a Tarzan-like rope, and make a big splash.\n\nBest time: Class II and III Rapids year-round.\n\nLUNAHUANA\n\nCañete River\n\nThree hours from Lima and 2 hours from coastal Paracas, the small town of Lunahuana is the jumping-off point for rafting the Cañete River. Waters here are Class II, III, and IV, a good fit for anyone from beginners (children 8 and older) to advanced rafters, on different sections of the river depending on their experience. For experienced rafters and athletic beginners 18 years and older, the most exciting section on the Cañete is Lunahuana Paullo, a rocky stretch with Class III and IV rapids. During the rainy season, rapids reach Class IV and above, and draw experienced rafters from around the world.\n\nBest time: Summer (December through March) when water level is highest due to rain in the Andes making its way downriver to sea level at the Pacific Ocean. April through November, rapids are calmer and just right for beginners, and trips are 2 hours or shorter.\n\nGetting There\n\nTo arrange transportation or tours, contact the official tourist information and assistance service at peru.travel/en/useful-data/iperu.",

    "Peru’s Congress investigating President Castillo’s empty promise to young cancer patients": "Peru’s Congressional Oversight Commission is investigating why a donation of more than USD $1 billion for the treatment and surgery of children with cancer, promised by President Pedro Castillo in May, was never delivered.\n\nThe first meeting of the investigative body of Congress, headed by deputy Héctor Ventura, will be held in the coming days and will include the testimony of the Minister of Economy, Kurt Burneo, and the Minister of Health, Jorge López. The commission could potentially request that Mr. Castillo himself testify.\n\n“I have called everyone who could be involved in these alleged irregular acts,” Mr. Ventura told the television program “Beto a Saber” on September 12.\n\n“Here we see how they are using children politically. They are making fun of the children, of the parents of the family, with the relatives who deal with this painful disease, ”she added.\n\nA promise to save lives\n\nOn May 12, during a ceremony held in the courtyard of the Presidential Palace, attended by dozens of children with cancer and their families, President Castillo and television host Andrés Hurtado delivered a check for more than S/ 4 billion soles (about USD $1 billion). The check was going to go to hospitals, hire staff and for equipment, and was going to be administered by the Ministry of Health.\n\nHowever, parents of patients and several cancer associations reported that as of September, they have not received any support.\n\n“The President used us. We feel hurt, wounded, especially for the lives of children,” María Lumbre Figueroa, president of the Association for the Rights of Children with Cancer, told RPP Noticias. The non-profit organization was founded in 2015 and supports the treatment of low-income children with cancer.\n\nKarina Pujar, spokeswoman for the NGO “Childhood Cancer Law,” said that in recent months they have had meetings with authorities to find out how the check could be cashed.\n\n“Four months have passed since the promise, but they always tell us the same thing: there is no budget,” she told RPP Noticias.\n\nMs. Pujar also revealed that more than half of the children with cancer who visited the president on May 12 have already died.\n\n“That day approximately 60 children attended. More than half have died. Among them was Jackdiel, one of the children who approached the president to hug him and ask for his help. The president told him that he is going to help him. He passed away in June,” said Ms. Pujar.\n\nAccording to the institution’s spokeswoman, approximately five children with cancer die daily in Peru’s hospitals.\n\nAn empty promise?\n\nCongresswoman Norma Yarrow revealed last week that the budget promised by Mr. Castillo did not exist. She said so after the Ministry of Economy sent her a detailed report about the money.\n\nAccording to the minister’s report, the entire announced budget is not currently available. The same report says that the National Cancer Law will cost the Peruvian State a total of S/5.4 billion soles (USD $1.4 billion), but it can only be implemented in a period of 10 years.\n\n“In the report of the Ministry of Economy it clearly says that in 10 years the promise will be fulfilled. The report clearly says that Mr. (Castillo) lied without shame,” said Ms Yarrow.\n\nOn September 19, the head of the Ministry of Health Jorge López said that the check offered by President Pedro Castillo is a long-term budget, reported RPP.\n\n“This year a lot of that total of 4 billion soles has been transferred. Next year we are going to have more than 1 billion soles transferred to cancer treatments,” he said.\n\nMother accuses Peru’s Government of using children without cancer as props for the Presidential Palace event\n\nPaola Palomino, the mother of a child with cancer and representative of the NGO “Childhood Cancer Law,” told ATV Noticias on September 7 that the day President Pedro Castillo hosted the children at the Presidential Palace, most of the kids actually did not have cancer.\n\n“They invited children with other illnesses to fill the space because not all the children could go,” she said.\n\nMs. Palomino said that, in order not to cancel the event, the organizers asked other parents to “cut their children’s hair” and to act like sick children.\n\n“They had to be bald, they had to be in treatment and bald,” she said.",
    "PAHO says Brazil, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Peru at very high risk for polio as vaccination dwindles": "MEXICO CITY, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on Wednesday said Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Peru are at very high risk for the reintroduction of polio, as dwindling vaccination rates during the coronavirus pandemic has led to historic lows in protection against the illness.\n\nRegional vaccine coverage for polio has fallen to about 79%, the lowest since 1994, PAHO said.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency in a bid to accelerate efforts to vaccinate residents against polio after the virus was detected in wastewater samples taken in four counties. Cases also have been detected in London and Jerusalem. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"Lets be very clear,\" PAHO director Carissa Etienne told reporters. \"Polio is not a treatable disease. Prevention is the only option, and prevention is only possible with vaccines.\"\n\nPolio can cause irreversible paralysis in some cases, but can be prevented by a vaccine first made available in 1955. While there is no known cure, three injections of the vaccine provide nearly 100% immunity.\n\nEtienne said dwindling vaccination caused by the coronavirus pandemic had left many unprotected from polio, after vaccines had eradicated the disease in the region 30 years earlier.\n\nShe added that Argentina, the Bahamas, Ecuador, Panama, Suriname and Venezuela also had been identified as high-risk countries, and that nearly all of South America currently has vaccine coverage below 80%.\n\nThere are currently no confirmed polio cases in Latin America and the Caribbean, but PAHO urged all countries in the region to strengthen surveillance and proactively reach unvaccinated communities.\n\n\"I really cannot state this strongly enough,\" Etienne said. \"As we saw in New York state, the polio virus can appear and spread quickly and quietly in communities with insufficient vaccine coverage.\"\n\nPolio terrified parents around the world for the first half of the 20th century. Affecting mainly children under five, it is often asymptomatic but can also cause symptoms including fever and vomiting. Around one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and among those patients, up to 10% die. read more\n\n(Add dropped words at end of first paragraph)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Sarah Morland; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Christian Plumb and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "It’s ‘impossible’ for Raúl Ruidíaz to leave early, Peru coach says": "Peru men’s national team head coach Juan Reynoso called it “impossible” for Raúl Ruidíaz to be available to the Seattle Sounders for Tuesday’s match against FC Cincinnati. Ruidíaz is currently with Peru ahead of a pair of international friendlies against Mexico (Saturday) and El Salvador (Tuesday), but Brian Schmetzer had expressed some hope the forward would be released after the first match.\n\nIt does not sound like that will happen.\n\n#Perú head coach Juan Reynoso dismissed the possibility of Raúl Ruidíaz heading back early to play with #Sounders\n\n\n\nHe calls it impossible. https://t.co/WmY9KKIuKQ — Niko Moreno (@ELROLONW) September 23, 2022\n\nWhile the Sounders are preparing for a match they almost certainly need to win in order to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, Peru is fresh off failing to qualify for the World Cup and won’t play another meaningful match until the 2024 Copa America.\n\nIn the wake of Peru’s failure to qualify for the World Cup, Reynoso was hired to replace Ricardo Gareca in August. Although Ruidíaz is 32 and had seemingly fallen out of favor with Peru — having not played for them in over a year — he does have a history with Reynoso, dating to their time together at Universitario. Reynoso had also reportedly tried to bring Ruidíaz to Cruz Azul as recently as last offseason.\n\nAlthough Ruidíaz could theoretically demand his release, Schmetzer indicated that in practice that only happens with a coach’s blessing.\n\n“The players have total control, but no player doesn’t want to play for their national team,” Schmetzer said earlier this week. “That’s the conundrum. Raul is very pleased about getting back with the new coach.\n\n“If you snub your nose at your national team, chances are you won’t make it back. Respectful conversions have to happen.”\n\nThe Sounders had also expressed some hope that Alex Roldán would be released by El Salvador, but there’s been no definitive word yet on his availability."
