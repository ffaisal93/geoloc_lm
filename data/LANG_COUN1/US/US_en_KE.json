That includes talks with the U.K., the EU and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership talks with Kenya.\n\nIn Kenya’s case, the country already has duty-free access to the United States for most of its goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But the Biden administration has not said yet whether it supports renewal of that legislation, which expires in 2025.\n\nSo, in comments filed with the USTR, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers requested that duty-free access be continued, either as part of a bilateral trade agreement or through renewal of the nearly quarter century old AGOA program.\n\n“With unemployment and under employment challenges in Kenya at a record high, the contribution of AGOA to creating job opportunities cannot be underestimated,” the group said.\n\nThe Corporate Council on Africa, a U.S. business group, also urged continuation of Kenya’s duty-free access, noting the West African country is “the largest AGOA exporter of apparel to the U.S., totaling $449 million in 2021 and accounting for some 50,000 direct jobs.”\n\nBut it’s “important that we have an agreement with Kenya that establishes a broader economic partnership that goes beyond AGOA’s unilateral preferences and addresses more than just tariffs and goods market access,” the CCA added.\n\nAdditional areas should include digital trade and financial services, as well as provisions that promote deeper foreign investment and protect investors from unfair treatment, the group said.\n\nTrade activists at Public Citizen approached the market access question from the other side, arguing that it’s hard to see how a bilateral agreement with the United States would be better for Kenya than a simple renewal of the AGOA program since “history has shown that countries signing trade agreements with the United States have to make major anti-development concessions.”\n\nThe group urged USTR not to negotiate a traditional free trade agreement with Kenya because that would have “catastrophic policy and political repercussions.”\n\nFIRST IN MORNING TRADE: The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act is being proposed by members of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, including Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Earl Blumenauer(D-Ore.), Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).\n\nIn July, those same lawmakers rallied broad bipartisan support for the Formula Act, a bill that temporarily lifted tariffs on imports of finished formula. U.S. formula companies lobbied heavily for base powder to be included in that earlier bill, but the provision was excluded amid concerns expressed by dairy producers.\n\nWhile shelves are better stocked today than over the summer, formula remains difficult for many families to come by. “The legislation I’m introducing today will build on that progress by helping increase domestic formula production,” DelBene said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that this bill can move with the same speed and bipartisan support that the previous legislation had.”\n\nG20 TRADE MINISTERS CLASH OVER RUSSIA: A meeting between trade ministers from the world’s leading economies in Bali, Indonesia, ended without a joint statement Friday after representatives disagreed over whether to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIndonesia was expected instead to issue “a chair’s statement” outlining the six priorities that lower level officials agreed on earlier in the week. Those include WTO reforms, a multilateral approach to industrialization, digital trade and the pandemic response, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe G-20 host issued a press release Friday that did not mention the minister’s failure to agree on a joint statement or include a link to a chair’s statement. G-20 finance ministers also failed to agree on a joint statement when they met in July.\n\nIndonesian softball: The European Union, which released its own readout of the gathering, said most countries agreed the conflict was the primary challenge for international trade and “condemned this gross violation of international law.”\n\nThe U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain objected to the statement produced by Indonesian Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan since it didn’t include explicit condemnation of Russia, according to international media reports.\n\n\"Of the 27 paragraphs of the joint statement, 26 were agreed, one was not. The paragraph that was not agreed upon was about geopolitical issues. There was no consensus,\" Hasan was quoted as saying.\n\nAgriculture is next: G-20 agriculture ministers will be in Bali later this week to discuss global food security, efforts to boost sustainability and related concerns.\n\nTai heads to Japan: Tai will be in Tokyo Tuesday to attend former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. The U.S. delegation is led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who also will visit South Korea on the trip.\n\n\n\nMENENDEZ HOLDS UP MCKALIP AG NOMINATION: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) has placed a hold on the nomination of Doug McKalip to be USTR’s chief agricultural negotiator until he receives assurances the agency will establish procedures for greater congressional oversight and transparency of U.S. trade policy, a spokesperson for the senator confirmed after Inside U.S. Trade reported the action last week.\n\n“As [Menendez] awaits commitments and specific actions to this end, he opposes confirmation of this nominee as a way to send the clearest signal that he firmly believes Americans deserve honest and transparent trade policy that prioritizes the economic interests of the country and cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nLong time coming: Menendez was one of six senators in May to sign a letter to Ambassador Katherine Tai that claimed the agency was not upholding its own transparency standards, and failed to properly consult Congress in dealings with the World Trade Organization involving intellectual property and Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFarm groups impatient: Last week, a coalition of 105 agriculture and food associations and companies sent a letter to Senate leaders urging a swift floor vote on McKalip’s nomination. The Senate Finance Committee voted 27-0 in favor of advancing the long-time government employee’s nomination two weeks ago, with Menendez abstaining.\n\nA BRIEF GLIMPSE OF U.S. IPEF GOALS: A USTR spokesperson called the short outline of the agency’s negotiating objectives \"a vision document that is guiding our conversations with IPEF partners and stakeholders.\" It runs just slightly more than two pages, although USTR said it could be updated at a later date.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration committed to following certain “Guidelines for Consultation and Engagement” developed by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nThose guidelines say “at least 30 days before initiating negotiations for a trade agreement, USTR will publish a detailed and comprehensive summary of the specific objectives with respect to the negotiations and a description of how the agreement, if successfully concluded, will further those objectives and benefit the United States.”\n\nThe guidelines also say USTR will hold a public hearing on the negotiating objectives. However, a USTR spokesperson said those transparency commitments that Tai reaffirmed do not apply to IPEF since it is an “executive” agreement not subject to congressional approval.\n\n\n\nCANADIAN DAIRY WAITING GAME: It’s been about 120 days since USTR initiated a second dairy dispute with Canada after its first effort failed to force Ottawa to open its market as much as U.S. industry believes it should be under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBy now, USTR is within its rights to request another dispute settlement panel to hear its complaint since no deal to resolve the disagreement has been announced. However, a USTR spokesperson on Friday provided little information on that. “We’re engaged with Canada on next steps, in close coordination with stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBecky Rasdall, vice president for trade policy and international affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association, said it has “been in communication with USTR about the substance of the second round of consultations and are working to support their efforts.”\n\nWhat’s next: Although timing is still uncertain, “we support proceeding with the second dispute when USTR is ready,” Rasdall said.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR SOME TRADE TALK? Unfortunately, we couldn’t get Hank Williams Jr. to kick off the WTO’s Public Forum this week, but I’ll try my best to pump you up about the annual gabfest. I mean, if four days of multi-room discussions on every conceivable trade topic is your idea of heaven, then Geneva is where you want to be this week.\n\nJust imagine being trapped in a building and every door you open is a different Washington International Trade Association event. It’ll be something like that. And to get the ball rolling, WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala will sit down Tuesday with CNN’s Business Editor-at-Large Richard Quest for a scene-setting chat.\n\nFor anyone who forgot to book a flight to Switzerland, you can watch select events on the web. For fans of the beautiful game, Okonjo-Iweala also will be talking Tuesday with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. I guess somebody’s ready for some football!

Now Congress has passed a groundbreaking package of investments and tax incentives that will dramatically expand domestic solar manufacturing going forward. Yet, the U.S. Commerce Department continues to consider solar tariffs that could be implemented after the President’s tariff moratorium has expired. If not stopped, these meritless tariffs would slam the brakes on solar deployment, undermining efforts by the President and Congress to promote clean energy jobs and address climate change.

    "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias": "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias\n\nAs he moves on from Africa to take up his next posting in Mexico, NPR's Eyder Peralta has one last love letter to a favorite part of Nairobi, Kenya: roadside plant nurseries.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFor the past six years, NPR international correspondent Eyder Peralta has taken us all around the African continent. He's now moving on to report for NPR from Mexico. But before leaving his post in Nairobi, Kenya, Eyder wrote a love letter to one of his favorite parts of the city - the roadside plant nurseries.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CARS HONKING)\n\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Nairobi tends to be a chaotic city.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN)\n\nPERALTA: It's a sprawling metropolis, so the streets are a jumble - people, buses, police, goats, cows. On the side of the road, you can buy anything from a samosa to furniture to a puppy. But my favorite thing is that on the side of almost every street, you find a nursery. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of Kenyans commandeer little strips of land, and they grow everything from roses to azaleas to delicate gardenias.\n\nGEORGE JENGA: I'm George Jenga. When you translate Jenga, it comes George builder.\n\nPERALTA: Nearly 20 years ago, unable to get a job, George went into the forests of the outskirts of Nairobi and started collecting seeds. Since then, he's turned this bit of roadside into paradise. He walks me through his garden, a smile on his face. He has learned as much as he can about all of his plants.\n\nJENGA: Like, this one is called Podocarpus falcatus. This one is good for timber.\n\nPERALTA: He picks a hard, round seed.\n\nJENGA: This pod, it germinate within one year and eight months.\n\nPERALTA: Most of the plant sellers in Nairobi sell flowers. They grow quick, and it is what people want, but not George. What George loves are indigenous trees. So he waits years for a pod to turn into a seedling to turn into a tree.\n\nJENGA: Our generation is not for the trees. They are going after quick money. And quick money, you cannot get it while you are in a garden.\n\nPERALTA: George moves fast past his flowers. They're just not his thing. But about trees, he can talk for days.\n\nJENGA: This is Vitex keniensis. In English, it is called Meru oak. This one, it is called Calodendrum capense. The seed has a lot of oil.\n\nPERALTA: For wrinkles, he says. He keeps calling out names and uses. But as we move away from the road, his nursery becomes an oasis. We start hearing birds. He dodges bamboo, skips over rocks, and suddenly, we hit a stream. This is the source of life for his plants.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)\n\nPERALTA: This is the most charming part of Nairobi, that in the middle of all the chaos, there is always beauty. It's a place where you discover that the aphids making your roses brown also attract hummingbirds, so you let them be.\n\nI can see why you like this.\n\nJENGA: You know, a wise scholar said when you treat the nature the well, the nature will reward you. I’ve been rewarded\n\nPERALTA: He's in good health. His kids have gone to school off these plants. And it's not lost on him that as Nairobi becomes a mega city and climate change ravages the Earth, at least hundreds of thousands of trees have passed through his hands. Sometimes, he says, he sees some of his seedlings around town.\n\nJENGA: I walk there. I see a tree. I laugh myself. This has come from my hand.\n\nPERALTA: (Laughter) So that's a good feeling.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I feel...\n\nPERALTA: Yeah.\n\nJENGA: Yes.\n\nPERALTA: Yeah. You're fulfilled.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I have done my part.\n\nPERALTA: He shakes his head. He didn't graduate high school, he tells me, but he has done his part. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "Kenya's 'Marathon King' Inspires Runners After Beating World Record": "Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge is spurring young athletes to follow in his footsteps after breaking his own world record Sunday in Berlin.\n\nCheers erupted from the crowd Sunday at Nairobi's Karura Forest as they watched Kipchoge race on TV. The watch party followed an amateur marathon organized by the Friends of Karura Forest to celebrate their 25th anniversary.\n\nKaranja Njoroge, a past chairman of the conservation group who serves on its board, called Kipchoge's win \"absolutely magnificent.\"\n\n\"Everybody went wild,\" Njoroge said of the crowd at the watch party. \"Seeing the guy was way ahead. Everybody felt so elated by the efforts of our king of athletics, Eliud Kipchoge.\"\n\nKipchoge's new record, 30 seconds faster than his previous world record set in Berlin in 2018, is now two hours, one minute and nine seconds. Njoroge called it an inspiration.\n\n\"I think it encourages people. Gives people hope. And even those who would never compete begin to believe, because this guy is 37 years old and he's breaking world records,\" Njoroge said.\n\nBarnabas Korir, an executive member of Athletics Kenya, the governing body for track and field sports, agreed.\n\n\"He's inspired the youth, but not only the youth but particularly all the athletes from Kenya,\" Korir said. \"You know Kipchoge is one of the few athletes who is completely determined. He's also very focused.\"\n\nKorir, who is also chairman of youth development at Athletics Kenya, said camps have been set up nationwide to encourage sports.\n\n\"We got the support from the government to do that and in the last 3 years, Eliud Kipchoge talk to the athletes when they were in the camps,\" Korir said. \"So, this is an opportunity for us now to give our athletes a symbol that they can do well if they remain focused, if they work hard.\"\n\nKipchoge has won 15 out of his 17 career marathons, including two Olympic gold medals.\n\nDaniel Schearf contributed to this report.\n\n",
    "What interactive maps and 3D digital models reveal about Mau Mau detention camps in Kenya": "In a new documentary released last month in the UK, Kenyan and British historians describe how Britain secretly used torture against prisoners in Mau Mau detention camps during the anti-colonial uprising movement in the 1950s. One of the Kenyans featured is historian and digital heritage scholar Chao Tayiana, the founder of the African Digital Heritage Project (ADHP), an organization focusing on the use of technology in preserving and sharing African heritage.\n\n“It really flipped the script as to who is uncivilized,” Tayiana says in the film, which reveals details from a secret archive known as the “Hanslope Disclosure” that remained hidden from public view for over 50 years. The archive contained damning evidence on Britain’s use of torture including murder, rape, and forced castrations against Mau Mau prisoners. Surviving veterans of this period are also featured in the film, and describe the appalling conditions they endured in detention.\n\n\n\n“Oral history is treated as second rate compared to written knowledge, and so it hasn’t mattered in many years that veterans and people who lived through this period have been saying that this happened,” Tayiana tells Quartz. “It was only until the disclosure of the archives proving that there was torture that people really started listening.”\n\n\n\nHistory of the Mau Mau uprising\n\nThe Mau Mau was an armed rebellion launched by the Kikuyu people demanding the return of stolen land from white British settlers as well as money for independence. The British declared a State of Emergency in 1952 to counter the uprising, with the executive order to put in detention camps anyone who opposed colonial rule. Unofficial figures estimate that tens of thousands of Kenyans were executed, tortured, or maimed during the crackdown, which lasted until 1960.\n\nHistorians estimate that more than 100 camps were set up during this period, yet remarkably little is known about their history in both Kenyan and British public spaces today.\n\nThe Mau Mau were eventually defeated, but the uprising is regarded as one of the most significant steps towards Kenyan independence in 1963.\n\nDigitizing Britain’s detention camps\n\nSince 2019, Tayiana has been working in collaboration with volunteers and colleagues in Kenya and the UK to document, digitally reconstruct, and curate an exhibition that sheds light on the Mau Mau detention camps that were built by the British in the early 1950s.\n\n“Visual language and imagery is very powerful in informing our understanding of the past but also helping us get a sense of where things are located in time and physically,” says Tayiana. “So [the ADHP] asks how this data can be communicated in multiple ways, through multiple mediums to audiences across the board.”\n\nThe ADHP works with museums, archives, and communities to document African histories through innovative technology that centers human experiences and oral histories. The project has so far created a number of open source digital assets including 3D digital models and interactive maps that show the detention camps were spread out all over the country, and included exile camps, detention camps, work camps and women and juvenile camps.\n\nThese digital reconstructions rely on extensive research and sources including oral and written testimonials, existing plans and 3D scans, as well as some physical remains from the campsites. The goal is to create a better representation of shared history and to make these assets more accessible to more people, regardless of their literacy levels or knowledge of English.\n\n“The biggest knowledge gap regarding that period is really around the human experience,” says Tayiana. “We are aware of the camps, we’re aware they existed, but we don’t really know much about what took place. The human experience is very abstracted from the nationalist story of how the Mau Mau fought and they got independence.”\n\nA ‘lifecycle’ between digital and physical work\n\nDespite the opportunities in using technology to reproduce cultural value and meaning, Tayiana says the ADHP faces limitations with resources and infrastructure to carry out its digitization efforts. Digital reach is also a factor, she says, as many target audiences in Kenya still do not have easy access to digital technologies.\n\n“We ended up reaching a very specific demographic, which is 18 to 34 year olds who are on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook,” she said. “One of the things we think of is how can this primary audience then reach another secondary audience, so maybe their grandparents or their parents. We try to create a lifecycle between digital work and physical work, because I don’t believe they should be separate.”\n\nTayiana acknowledges that digital reconstructions will never be completely accurate, and she says remaining open to feedback and input is crucial. Next year, the team will begin incorporating more assets and cultural context to the map, beyond the epicenter of the violence in central Kenya. They are also currently working on a physical exhibition in Kenya about the approximately 800 concentrated villages that were set aside for around 1 million women and children during the Mau Mau uprising.\n\nThese villages were managed by British officials and ‘home guards’—armed non-Mau Mau Africans that were falsely branded ‘loyalists’ by colonial rulers. Tayiana says women and children were subject to cruel treatment including forced curfews, and they were not allowed to grow their own food or manage their own land resources.\n\n“The exhibition really centers on what that did to the societal fabric of these villages … and how the officials treated women.”\n\nTayiana says the exhibition will include the physical remains of a trench that was dug around the village, as well as the archives and oral histories collected from survivors.\n\nDocumenting history before it’s too late\n\nTayiana’s work with the ADHP is mirrored by her other initiatives that center human experience and value oral histories. In 2018, she founded the Museum of British Colonialism—a digital platform which facilitates global conversations on Britain’s colonial legacies. She is also the founder of the Open Restitution Africa project which gathers data on current restitution processes across the African continent.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency in much of her work to document these histories before it is too late. This is particularly true for the Mau Mau detention camps, as there are fewer veterans alive today to tell their stories.\n\n“This history is not being taught to the extent to which it should be taught in Kenya,” she said. “There are still a lot of wounds and silences here in the country regarding this period. But what’s interesting about this history, I think, is that there are so many factors that are working against it. And so the very fact that it did make its way to light…is something we really need to pay attention to.”",
    "Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has hiked rates by 850 bps in the past year but that has not helped stop a slide in its currency which has been one of the worst performing emerging market currency, having lost over half its value this year.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.",
    "11 Killed by Cattle Rustlers in North Kenya": "At least 11 people, including eight police and a local chief, have been killed in drought-stricken northern Kenya by cattle rustlers whom they had been chasing, police said Sunday.\n\nThe theft of livestock or quarrels over grazing and water sources are common between cattle herding communities in northern Kenya.\n\nPolice said on Twitter that a \"criminal and cowardly ambush\" by cattle rustlers had taken place in Turkana county on Saturday.\n\nEight of the dead were police officers, two were civilians and one a local chief, they said.\n\nThe police who were killed had been pursuing members of the Pokot ethnic group who had attacked a village and fled with cattle.\n\nIn November 2012, more than 40 policemen were killed in an ambush as they pursued cattle thieves in Baragoi, a remote district in Kenya's arid north.\n\nAnd in August 2019, at least 12 people, including three children, were killed in two attacks in northern Kenya by cattle rustlers suspected to be from the Borana ethnic group.\n\nKenya, the most dynamic economy in East Africa, is in the grip of the worst drought in four decades after four failed rainy seasons wiped out livestock and crops",
    "How Kenya Became the World’s Geothermal Powerhouse": "Geophysicist Nicholas Mariita remembers when Kenya’s geothermal sector wasn’t the high-tech powerhouse it is today. In the early 1980s, he regularly joined teams of scientists on expeditions into the country’s Great Rift Valley to survey for potential sites where the Earth could be tapped for a prime subterranean energy source. They weren’t looking for oil or coal — they were looking for heat, the key resource in geothermal power.\n\nThe Great Rift Valley was still wild then, so dodging snakes and buffalo was part of the job. “One in a while, we’d be chased by a buffalo and have to climb into a tree, and if it was a clever one, it’d flick urine at you with its tail,” Mariita recalls. “Those were the kind of funny things we went through.”\n\nTheir risk has yielded results. In 2020 and 2021, some 48 percent of all electricity generated in Kenya came from geothermal — the highest share of any country. And as the world seeks to increase both the quantity and cleanliness of its electricity, it’s a cheap, bountiful and low-carbon option Kenya plans to increasingly rely on.\n\nRising megawatts\n\nThe idea of geothermal generation in the Olkaria Area — located 44 miles northwest of Nairobi in the Great Rift Valley — was first considered in the 1950s. A consortium of power companies, led by the East African Power and Lighting Company, drilled two test wells. But efforts to make power from them were stymied by technical problems. By the turn of the decade, the wells — and the dream of geothermal power — had largely been abandoned.\n\n“In those days, almost 90 percent of our electricity came from hydropower,” says Mariita, now the director of the Geothermal Training and Research Institute of the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, however, leaving geothermal resources untapped became untenable. A fickle hydroelectric grid and the global oil crisis left the country, then in its second decade of independence, starved for power. “To avoid power rationing,” says Mariita, “the government had to change its strategy.”\n\nWith assistance from the United Nations, the public-owned Kenya Power took charge of the effort in 1977.\n\nThe first geothermal plant in Africa came online in June 1981. Upon its inauguration, the Olkaria I plant comprised just one turbine with a generating capacity of 15 megawatts (roughly 2.7 percent of nationwide capacity at the time), but expansion followed. In 1982, Kenya’s parliament passed the Geothermal Resources Act, which established a formal legal framework for geothermal investment, siting and licensing. That same year, a second turbine, also 15 MW, was added to Olkaria I.\n\nIn 1997, Kenya Power Company became the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (known as KenGen), and investment ramped up significantly. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Kenya installed some 93 megawatts of generating capacity. In the first two decades of this century some 531 megawatts of capacity came online. With the July 2022 opening of Olkaria V and a sixth turbine added at Olkaria I came some 258 MW of new capacity — bringing the country’s total to some 882 MW.\n\nLooking forward, some 300 MW of capacity are expected to come online upon the completion of new projects both at Olkaria and beyond. By 2030, in line with the country’s green development goals, Kenya hopes to have 1,600 MW — almost double today’s total — up and running.\n\nThat energy is needed to achieve Kenya Vision 2030. The government plans rapid industrialization so the country can rise to middle-income status by the end of this decade.\n\nOf all renewables, geothermal energy is especially useful for industrialization, a goal shared by countries across Africa. For one, unlike sources such as wind and solar, it provides a reliable stream of power critical to energy-intensive industrial processes. Moreover, geothermal need not be converted to electricity at all: Direct applications — where geothermal steam itself is used — abound.\n\nAround the world, geothermal wells are used to heat buildings, can food and process textiles. In Kenya, the Naivasha-based Oserian Development Company has used geothermal steam to heat its flower-farm greenhouses, which are among the largest on Earth.\n\nHeat seeking\n\nGeothermal energy is not a green panacea, of course. For one, the construction of new wells, like any infrastructure, can encroach upon natural ecosystems and displace communities. The Olkaria plants, for instance, have forced hundreds of semi-nomadic Maasai families indigenous to the Great Rift Valley to relocate, though KenGen has made efforts to both employ Maasai people and mitigate the effects of displacement.\n\nMoreover, the geothermal potential of any given area is determined by immutable geologic characteristics.\n\nFor the last 20 million years or so, the Somali minor tectonic plate has been crawling southeast, shearing Africa’s westernmost edge from the rest of the continent, which sits on the northwest-bound African plate. Diverging plates form gaps in the Earth’s solid outermost layer, the lithosphere. From within those gaps seeps the layer beneath, the asthenosphere. Those bits of asthenosphere fill the void left by the parting plates, and a few millimeters — and million years — at a time, become a new crust.\n\nBut the patch job is not perfect. Just as tectonic collisions form mountains, divergence creates swaths of crust just a bit thinner and more porous than average. Those who live on that thin crust live closer to what’s underneath: heat.\n\nNot every country falls on a tectonic rift. However, massive amounts of geothermal potential remain untapped in the world.\n\nThis May, a group of Egyptian geologists — led by Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geologist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo — created a first of its kind analysis of high geothermal potential regions in Africa, using data on faults, heat levels and magnetic forces. They found 14 areas of interest, from Algeria to Namibia to Malawi, South Africa, Liberia and beyond. “Africa has very high potential,” says Zaher.\n\nGeothermal’s impact is not just measured in megawatts in Kenya today. When Nicholas Mariita began his career, its then-nascent geothermal sector relied on outside expertise. “In those days, we used consultants from the United States, Japan and New Zealand,” says Mariita.\n\nIn the 40 years since, Kenya has built not only world-leading physical geothermal infrastructure, but the human capital to support it. Through geothermal energy, Kenya has found an unshakeable source of power — in all its meanings.\n\n“Now, Kenyans actually do the exploration work, the impact assessment, the project planning, the design of the plants and so on,” says Mariita. “You go to one of our projects, and you see Kenyans are in charge.”",

    "Kenya dispatches its troops to end the Rwanda-Congo conflict once and for all": "Kenya’s president William Ruto has said that he will be sending troops to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to fight against the M23 Rebel group which operates in the eastern region of DRC and is being sent as well as backed by Rwanda. Dr Ruto said that as DRC is a part of the East African Community, it is the duty of every nation in the region to step in to put an end to the violence and terror perpetrated by the M23 rebels. He emphasised that just as the UN has a presence in DRC for mediation and military action, Kenya too will take an active role in ending the carnage. He added that there was no choice left and leaders cannot avoid these challenges as peace and stability are necessary because what is happening in DRC are Kenya’s problems too. Dr. Ruto called DRC an economic partner, recognizing the fact that a civil war stricken DRC, will have its ramifications on Kenya as well.\n\nFor years M23 has been operating in Eastern DRC. The M23 is a terrorist group which is infamous for its cruel and barbaric practices against civilians. This group has a long history of subjecting vulnerable poor people to unimaginable levels of torture and violence. M23’s involvement in dozens of war crimes, kidnappings, disappearances, massacres, assassinations, mass rapes etc make it one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in Africa.\n\nM23 is funded by Rwanda; it has the full backing of its government. Rwanda is actively involved in war crimes in eastern DRC, time and again the international community called on Rwanda to put an end to its activities in eastern DRC but nothing has happened. M23’s reason for being in eastern DRC is its mineral resources. DRC is rich in gold and cobalt which Rwanda is trying to get its hands on and M23 has managed to gain control over the resources in some areas. In fact, M23 has created a smuggling ring with local gangs dealing in gold and selling it to international companies and businessmen. The funds generated from sales are used in purchasing arms and weapons.\n\nRwanda voted in favour of Ukraine at the UN Security Council to appease its western masters. Despite committing acts of terror and promoting violence, the US and the EU are supporting it as they to eye the resources in eastern DRC. On the contrary, Democratic Republic of the Congo has good relations with Russia.\n\nRead More: Willliam Ruto’s ‘Kenya First’ initiative beats the living daylights out of UK\n\nRuto made a tough call\n\nIn these circumstances, the decision taken by Kenya’s president William Ruto is drastic. As leader of one of the important nations in the East African Community, he realises the significance of an African unity needed for economic development and growth. It won’t be wrong to imply, that in a political terrain such as that of the African continent, that problems of one country take no time to become the problems of another. Kenya in its far sightedness has realized this and is now taking steps to help DRC, which also is one of its major economic partners when it comes to earning revenue from the Mombasa port. In fact, DRC is the third largest market of the Mombasa port and Dr Ruto stressed that 50% of imports of DRC go through it.\n\nSeveral in western mainstream media have criticised him for taking a call to help DRC, they argue that Kenya has no business being in DRC and is interfering in its internal matters by deploying the Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF). However, such accusations are overshadowed by the commercial relationship between the two countries.\n\nKenya is taking a leadership role in the East Africa region. Ruto’s initiative is motivated by a longing for peace which is desired by most regimes and citizens in Africa. With the West now acknowledging the importance of Africa even more than before, the Kenyan leader understands that a peaceful environment is indispensable for a thriving economy, a successful democracy and rapid trade activity. And that peace can only be attained when tough calls are made. The decision to put Kenyan military in east DRC will not only help in preventing the suffering and violence that civilians are regularly subjected to at the hands of M23, but also in creating a conducive environment for an economy to thrive.\n\nUnfortunately, Ruto will not only have to deal with Rwanda but also the West which has supported it. It will try its best to put hurdles in the progress of this mission which Kenya has taken up unto itself. In the name of sanctions, withholding of any economic ties, diplomatic isolation to allegations of human rights violations, war crimes and genocide, the US and the EU will try to smear Kenya in its effort to bring peace.",
    "What Next for Kenya?": "On Monday, Kenya’s Supreme Court resoundingly rejected challenges to the August 9 election, affirming the victory of William Ruto and his United Democratic Alliance. Shortly thereafter, outgoing Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta broke his long silence about the electoral outcome. Although Ruto was Kenyatta’s Deputy President, Kenyatta had supported Raila Odinga for the presidency, and his displeasure with the electoral outcome was clear. Addressing Kenyans, he promised a smooth transfer of power, but repeatedly urged citizens to “scrutinize the coherence” of the truth presented by institutions like the judiciary.\n\nIt might have done Kenya’s democracy more good if Kenyatta had couched his vision of civic duty not in suspicion of a judiciary that appears to have made an unbiased decision based on the facts, but rather in a call for greater civic engagement committed to holding new leadership accountable for its actions, regardless of how one voted. The Kenyan election is decided, but the jury is still out on what Ruto’s victory will mean for Kenya’s fight against corruption, which lands second only to the economy on the list of priorities Kenyan citizens identified for Afrobarometer. Ruto cast himself as a champion of the working class interested in fighting “state capture,” but his history suggests he is an unlikely anti-corruption champion. His running mate, Deputy President-elect Rigathi Gachagua, has faced serious corruption charges, and was recently ordered to forfeit nearly $1.7 million dollars in what a court determined were ill-gotten gains. Equally unpredictable is just what a Ruto administration will mean for human rights and the rule of law. It’s worth remembering that the International Criminal Court (ICC) declined to acquit him on charges of crimes against humanity relating to the post-election violence of 2007 and 2008 when the case fell apart largely due to witness tampering.\n\nWhat is no longer in question is the frustration with the status quo on display in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent. Ruto was perceptive in harnessing popular dissatisfaction with Kenyatta’s government, emphasizing Odinga’s close association with the incumbent in this last electoral cycle to characterize himself as an outsider and his ascension from deputy president to president as a breath of fresh air. Across the region, demands for change are diminishing the advantages of incumbency and challenging conventional political wisdom. Even in Angola, a country in which it has long been difficult to distinguish between the ruling party and the state itself, last month’s elections were far closer than any the country has experienced before, despite the substantial capacity of the government to tilt the playing field to its advantage.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

But it will be equally important to continue supporting Kenya’s civil society, democratic resilience, and the connective tissue of accountability between the governing and the governed. The disappointing voter turnout numbers in Kenya suggest that many citizens simply did not believe that the electoral outcome mattered much, or that any of their choices offered a compelling vision for the country’s future. But democracies require constant vigilance. Should the new administration find it harder to deliver change than to promise it, it will take an organized and energized public to ensure the Kenyan people retain their capacity to choose leadership that meets the moment.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

    "Global economy a ‘two-lane highway’, says Kenyan President during UN speech": "Mr. Ruto warned that rising nationalism is undermining collective action and the ability of the international community to guarantee fundamental rights. He argued that, as a consequence, countries of the Global South are calling for global governance to be more democratic and inclusive, as they attempt to get their economies back on track.\n\nBuilding Back Better, from the Bottom\n\nInvoking the oft-heard phrase “Build Back Better”, Mr. Ruto added a new clause, calling for the global economic recovery to take place from the bottom upwards, by including the marginalised working majority in the economic mainstream.\n\n“The bottom billion,” he said, “relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a a crowded arena characterised by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence.”\n\nHe went on to praise the “hustlers” who survive against overwhelming odds, and urged for action to bring them into the mainstream.\n\nReacting to drought and famine\n\nTurning to the climate crisis, Mr. Ruto noted that droughts and heat waves in Kenya, the scale of which has not been seen in decades, have forced the country to put more focus on famine relief, education support, social protection, and health systems. 3.1 million people in the country are food insecure, he said, as water becomes more scarce, and food prices rise.\n\nMr. Ruto recalled that the Stockholm+50 meeting, which commemorated the anniversary of the first UN conference on the human environment in 1972, was co-hosted by Kenya.\n\nThe Kenyan President noted that, at that international meeting, there was consensus from States on the need to act urgently in addressing environmental impacts, yet “little progress has been made in respect of the needful actions”.\n\nKenya, he said, is responding to the climate emergency by investing in climate-resilient agriculture, as part of a 10-year strategy for growth in the agricultural sector, which will “continue to hold the key to the creation of equitable and sustainable growth” for the Kenyan people.\n\nThis sector, as with others including education and health, is increasingly reliant on digital access and, said Mr. Ruto, offer a “viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development”.\n\nThe President called for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructure in developing countries, in order to bridge the digital divide between the Global South and the rest of the world.\n\nContinued commitment to UN agencies\n\nKenya is the host nation to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and Mr. Ruto affirmed the “indispensable role” the agencies play in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, and in developing socially and environmentally sound and sustainable cities.\n\nMr. Ruto announced that his Government has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON), to facilitate the upgrading of its complex.\n\nThe Ocean and Blue Economy, declared the President, remain a development priority for Kenya, in the belief that significantly increased investment can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs, and spur economic growth.\n\nHe reported that Kenya is reviewing its National Blue Economy Strategy to strengthen community structures – in participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources, and ecosystems – and invited development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building capacity to sustainably utilise marine resources.\n\nWorking towards a national vision of the future\n\nOver the past decade, said Mr. Ruto, Kenya has implementing it’s National Vision 2030, a blueprint to transform the country into a “newly-industrialising, upper-middle-income country providing high quality of life to all its citizen in a clean and secure environment by 2030”.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the Government, he said, to intervene in the economy in new ways, such as the implementation of an Economic Stimulus Programme, a Covid-19 Economic Recovery Strategy and a Covid-19 Social Economic re-engineering Recovery Strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Ruto went on to point out that support will be necessary from the international community, without which Kenya risks losing its development gains. He asked for additional liquidity and a better “fiscal space,” to enable Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.\n\nIn addition, the President joined other leaders in calling on multilateral lenders to extend pandemic-related debt relief to the worst hit counties, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and COVID-19. He also urged the G20 group of leading economies to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.\n\n‘Reform the Security Council’\n\nSpeaking as the leader of a country that is a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Mr. Ruto declared that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means of achieving international peace and security.\n\n“We are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council”, he said, “and achieving a consensus driven, rule-based multilateral system.”\n\nHowever, he also noted that the Security Council needs to be reformed, to make it more democratic: “given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy in dealing with threats to international peace and security.”\n\nMr. Ruto went on to lament the failures of multilateralism, with regard to Africa, remarking that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conferences of 1884-1885 [which led to imperial European powers effectively divided up much of Africa between them].\n\n“We have an urgent moral duty to do better”, he continued, “and to right this wrong.”\n\nNevertheless, the President concluded that strengthening multilateralism is the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous world for all.\n\n“This is the imperative of our time”, he declared, “and the call of this moment. It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe”.\n\n",
    "Will U.S.-China Competition Shape Kenya’s Trade Trajectory?": "Kenya’s much anticipated presidential election recently concluded with the Supreme Court confirming President William Ruto’s victory. In the runup to this close contest, Kenya’s political discourse was for once focused on economic and policy concerns. As the new government takes up the reins of administration, trade will feature in the policy solutions to ongoing challenges like rising unemployment rates, Kenya’s large public sector debt, concerns around equitable taxation, and the residual effects of global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In charting the direction of the country’s post-election economic policy, trade will be important in various ways: its volume, bridging Kenya’s trade deficit, and the country’s external relations.\n\nA cursory look at Kenya’s international trade reveals some striking patterns (see figure 1). The country’s total merchandise trade volume in 2020 amounted to $21 billion or 21 percent of GDP. More than 16 percent of this total is from trade with China (the country’s top trading partner), followed by the EU ($2.9 billion), India ($1.8 billion), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ($1.2 billion). The United States (nearly $1.0 billion) is Kenya’s fifth-largest trade partner. Other major economic partners include Uganda and Tanzania, both in East Africa. These trade relationships with major external partners will shape the new Kenyan government’s policy objectives especially around increasing the productivity of agriculture, manufacturing, and small businesses.\n\nKenya’s international trade is also an area where great power competition could play out. The country’s main exports to the United States, in 2019, were fairly diversified and included woven apparel ($286 million); knit apparel ($168 million); edible fruit and nuts ($55 million); ores, slag, and ash ($52 million); and coffee, tea, and spice ($41 million). This trade was enabled in large part by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the preferential market access agreement for countries south of the Sahara. Meanwhile, Kenya imported aircraft ($59 million), plastics ($58 million), machinery ($41 million), and cereals ($30 million) from the United States.\n\nZainab Usman Zainab Usman is a senior fellow and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Her fields of expertise include institutions, economic policy, energy policy, and emerging economies in Africa. More >\n\nThere are ongoing discussions between the United States and Kenya for a free trade agreement as Kenya seeks to become a manufacturing hub for U.S. companies looking to diversify or relocate out of China. In the interim, the two countries signed the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) in July 2022, an agreement that identified areas around which to “develop an ambitious roadmap for enhanced cooperation with the goal of negotiating high-standard commitments in order to achieve economically meaningful outcomes.” The initial areas of collaboration include agriculture; digital trade; micro, small, and medium enterprises; supporting the participation of women, youth, and others in trade; collaboration on standards setting; and trade facilitation and customs procedures.\n\nThe U.S.-Kenya STIP was launched against the backdrop of China’s rapidly rising trade relationship with Kenya. Since 2000, China-Kenya trade has grown nearly thirty-fold, from $106 million to $3.5 billion in 2020. As these trade volumes have grown, so has Kenya’s trade deficit. The country’s total trade deficit as of 2020 stands at around $9.7 billion, and China ($3.3 billion) accounts for about one-third of this imbalance (see figure 2). Between 2015 and 2019, for instance, Kenya’s main exports to China were “titanium and zirconium ores and concentrates” (around 60 percent), vegetable textile fibers (4.9 percent), and petroleum oils (4.7 percent), among others. Its major imports are “electrical machinery and equipment (19 percent); nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and mechanical appliances and parts (18 percent); iron and steel (7 percent); and plastics (6 percent).”\n\nClosing this trade deficit is a salient topic that features regularly in diplomatic engagement between the two countries. Indeed, it was one of the announcements at the 2021 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. In January 2022, China and Kenya also signed six bilateral trade agreements that focused on removing tariffs and other trade and nontrade barriers. These agreements promised access to China’s large market for Kenyan exporters and included protocols to facilitate bilateral trade, especially exports of avocados and aquatic products. In August 2022, Kenya became the first African country to export fresh avocados to China.\n\nAline Abayo Aline Abayo is a James C. Gaither Junior Fellow in the Carnegie Africa Program.\n\nBeyond the United States and China, Kenya has strong and growing trade relations with other major countries. The UAE imports refined petroleum, tea, and meat from Kenya. In July 2022, the UAE and Kenya announced the start of trade negotiations to initiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement that aims to reduce trade barriers between the two countries. With this agreement, the UAE will invest in Kenya's vital economic sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, and boost non-oil trade and investment. Kenya also signed an economic partnership agreement with the UK in December 2020; the agreement provided quota-free and duty-free market access for all Kenyan products, including manufactured and processed ones. The agreement also guaranteed tariff-free access to Kenya’s market for UK suppliers of machinery, electronics, and technical equipment, among others.\n\nWithin Africa, Kenya is a critical actor driving some aspects of regional integration. With its 2021 GDP of $110.3 billion, it is the largest economy and major driver of rapid integration in the East African Community (EAC). It is no surprise, therefore, that Kenya ranked second on regional integration in Africa. The EAC ranks highest on the Africa Regional Integration Index, with the free movement of people as its most robust dimension. An Afrobarometer survey on East African integration shows that 52 percent of Kenyans approve of the free movement of goods, services, and labor. However, there is still a gap in public awareness and support for this integration.\n\nKenya’s notable progress in securing regional and international trade deals is positioning the country as an important trading economy. It will be crucial for Kenya to balance its overlapping and complicated relationships with the great powers, its trade ties with neighbors in the EAC, and its interest in advancing the African Continental Free Trade Area. As Kenya’s new president takes office, trade policy will be at the heart of the country’s plans to close its trade deficit, generate jobs, increase public revenues, and boost productivity.",

Scores of people were crushed and injured as they forced their way into the packed stadium. A medic said a fence fell down after people pushed it and about 60 were injured, though the number may rise.\n\n\"We had to treat some with minor injuries. Most of them were rushed to the main hospital in Nairobi,\" medic Peter Muiruri said.\n\nPeople tried to dodge baton-wielding security forces. Some failed. \"I was beaten by the police after trying to get inside,\" said a witness, Benson Kimutai.\n\nRuto is taking power in a country heavily burdened by debt that will challenge his efforts to fulfill sweeping campaign promises made to Kenya's poor, whom he has described as getting by on \"stubborn hope.\" In his speech, he acknowledged that \"clearly, we are living beyond our means.\"\n\nHe promised cheaper fertilizer as food prices rise and more affordable credit. He also vowed more money for the judiciary, financial independence for the national police from the presidency and efforts to fight a drought in Kenya's north that brings the threat of famine.\n\nRuto also asked Kenyatta to continue \"chairing discussions\" on the regional crises in neighboring Ethiopia, where the government is fighting Tigray forces, and in eastern Congo, where tensions exist with Rwanda. Kenyatta has accepted, the new president said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sayyid Abdul Azim/AP Sayyid Abdul Azim/AP\n\nWith the transition, Kenya's presidency moves from one leader indicted by the International Criminal Court to another. Both Kenyatta and Ruto were indicted over their roles in deadly 2007 post-election violence, but the cases were later closed amid allegations of witness intimidation.\n\nThe August election was calm in a country with a history of political violence. Chaos erupted only in the final minutes when the electoral commission publicly split and prominent Odinga supporters tried to physically stop the declaration of Ruto as the winner.\n\nRuto's campaign portrayed him as a \"hustler\" with a humble background of going barefoot and selling chickens by the roadside, a counterpoint to the political dynasties represented by Kenyatta and Odinga. His presidential flag features a wheelbarrow, the symbol of his campaign.\n\n\"A village boy has become the president of Kenya,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nBut Ruto received powerful political mentoring as a young man from former President Daniel arap Moi, who oversaw a one-party state for years before Kenyans successfully pushed for multiparty elections.\n\nRuto now speaks of democracy and has vowed there will be no retaliation against dissenting voices. \"I will work with all Kenyans irrespective of who they voted for,\" he said in his speech.\n\nBut in a warning sign for media, local broadcasters accused by Ruto of bias in the past were restricted in their coverage of the inauguration and forced to use a feed from a South African broadcaster in which Kenya's national broadcaster has a share.\n\nThe losing candidate, 77-year-old Odinga, is setting himself up to be a prominent opposition voice once again after being backed by former rival Kenyatta in the election. In a statement on Monday, he said he would skip the inauguration and later would \"announce next steps as we seek to deepen and strengthen our democracy.\"\n\nThough Odinga also asserted that \"the outcome of the election remains indeterminate,\" a spokesperson told The Associated Press it was \"highly unlikely\" he would seek to declare himself the \"people's president\" as he did after losing the 2017 election.",

    "Kenya needs to eliminate tariff, non-tariff barriers to U.S. pork": "In comments submitted recently to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the National Pork Producers Council urged U.S. trade negotiators to use the recently launched Strategic and Investment Partnership with Kenya to eliminate that country’s unjustified restrictions on U.S. pork imports.\n\nWith a population of more than 50 million, an expanding middle class — and relatively strong tourism-driven demand from the hotel, restaurant, and institutional food service sector — the African nation has the potential to be a significant export market for U.S. pork products, NPPC noted in its comments.\n\nBut Kenya has tariff — a 25% duty — and non-tariff barriers, including complex, opaque and costly requirements that limit U.S. pork imports. USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service reports that all imports of certain agricultural products, including meat, must be physically inspected and tested at the port of entry to ensure conformity with relevant Kenyan standards.\n\nIn the comments, NPPC pointed out there is no reason why Kenya should impose such onerous inspection and testing requirement on U.S. pork products that are accompanied by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service Certificate of Wholesomeness and meet other relevant import requirements.\n\nNPPC requested that Kenya eliminate its onerous testing and inspection requirements for U.S. pork, eliminate non-science-based sanitary and phytosanitary barriers, and recognize the equivalence of U.S. pork production practices and the U.S. food safety inspection and approval system for pork slaughter, processing and storage plants.\n\nSource: National Pork Producers Council, which is solely responsible for the information provided, and wholly owns the information.

    "Whatever happened to the Kenyan farmer who turned a dump into a garden of giveaways?": "Whatever happened to the Kenyan farmer who turned a dump into a garden of giveaways?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Bwire Thomas Bwire\n\nAbout This Series Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite Goats and Soda stories to see \"whatever happened to ...\"\n\nIn July 2020 NPR highlighted the work of Victor Edalia of Kenya, who turned a trash dump into an urban farm in Kibera, one of the world's largest slums, on the outskirts of Nairobi. When the 32-year-old part-time driver signed a deal with a local chief for a quarter acre of land to farm, he had planned to sell vegetables to hotels. But during the pandemic, he began supplying free produce to struggling families. We returned to the former dump to find out what's cropping up for the new farmer.\n\nOnce you open the brown rusted padlock, the inside of Edalia's former garbage dump now has the feel of a commercial farm. Rows of neatly organized greens sprout from hundreds of plastic cups on stacked plastic pipes. The farm has embraced a hydroponic system, a water-based method. Fresh collard greens, spinach, peppers and other vegetables are all mounted above the ground, putting on a show.\n\n\"I am still alive and kicking as you can see,\" Edalia says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Bwire Thomas Bwire\n\nSince we last visited two years ago Edalia has made some strategic alliances. In October 2021 an American nonprofit group called the Human Needs Project, reached out to Edalia when they were surveying small-scale urban farmers within Kibera.\n\nThey were impressed by what he had done so far, so the group arranged for Edalia and his team members to do a two-week training with the East African company Hydroponics Africa. They learned how to preserve vegetables after harvest and, crucially, how to increase the farm's yield in a small urban space.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Bwire Thomas Bwire\n\nBefore he revamped his farm Edalia supplied vegetables to about 20 people a month. Now he can supply about 250 families. With all this new produce to distribute, the American charity provided financial support to help him introduce a voucher system. Community mobilizers from the Human Needs Project identified vegetable vendors at strategic spots in Kibera, who collect vegetables from Edalia's farm and hand them out to eligible families who've obtained a voucher from the charity.\n\nThe World Food Programme and the Nairobi City County are official partners with the farm, too — plaques with their names are nailed to the corrugated metal walls.\n\nThere's even enough extra produce to sell kale, spinach, tomatoes, and lettuce to primary schools. The new income means Edalia and his team are finally earning money from the vegetables.\n\nBut the informal nature of veggie distribution that NPR saw in 2020 hasn't gone away either. If needy families don't want to use the voucher system they can still casually drop by the farm as they did before. \"Oh yes,\" Edalia says, \"That approach never died.\"\n\nOne of the new veggie beneficiaries is Soila Amboi, a 33-year-old clothes seller and a mother of three. She says the regular supply of the vegetables has become a relief.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Bwire Thomas Bwire\n\n\"You know times are tough, my friend, and having someone like Victor here, we call him 'olum' meaning the blessed one,\" she says in the Luo language, \"He is truly blessing us indeed.\"\n\nThomas Bwire is a digital and radio journalist from Kibera, Kenya.",
    "Blazing the Tech Trail in Kenya": "As well as being been named amongst the top 200 women in the Global FinTech Powerlist, Agnes Gathaiya has also recently appeared on lists honoring 10 Kenyan Women Doing Great in Tech Leadership (TechWeez) and the Top 25 Most Powerful Women in the C-Suite Impacting Business (East African publishing company The Knowledge Warehouse). Gathaiya is the country director for East Africa at Google, where she builds strategy for East Africa and is also tasked with building a culture where all can thrive and work to their full potential. She told us what it means to her to appear on those lists, and how she found her place in the tech space.\n\nGetting on the Lists\n\nIf I was in a different field, I would have cringed a little bit, but I think it's great to be recognized for the work that we do. I don't think anywhere in the world has been able to quite transcend how male-dominated the tech space is. So, anything that creates visibility, that shows women that yes, you can actually do this, you can walk into this space and do amazingly well and get on many lists, I completely welcome.\n\nThe Leadership Gap\n\nCurrently about 48% of people graduating with technology degrees in Kenya are women. It took a long time to get there. But still, these women are not making it into leadership positions. At some point, they are dropping off before they get into managerial spaces.\n\nAs women, we can do it all. We can work, we can get married, we can have children. However, if the work is very rigid in how it's structured, as is the case with many tech jobs, that makes it difficult. In Kenya, we are very proud of the women we have in tech, and I think every single American company represented in Kenya currently has a woman leader—Microsoft, MasterCard, Google, Meta. All of them are led by women. But still it's a problem because you are by yourself and the 10 ranks below you are all male.\n\nBryn Mawr to Google\n\nWhen I graduated from Bryn Mawr I had the option to stay and work on Wall Street or go home. I chose to go home immediately, much to the shock of my friends. I got a job at Citi and then at Deloitte Consulting, where I got to work in several different areas—strategy and operations, human capital consulting, government consulting.\n\nWhen I was about to make director, I realized I needed to make a decision. Did I want to do this for the rest of my life, or did I want to explore something else? One day I woke up and resigned. I jumped off the ledge with a brand-new baby and a mortgage and no job in sight, and I went out into the world to see what else there was. I had done everything in consulting except tech. I got approached by SAP, and they asked me to run their commercial sites. From then on, I've been in tech, and it has been an amazing journey.",
    "Kenya quashes order on compulsory use of SGR for cargo transport": "By ANTHONY KITIMO More by this Author\n\nTraders can now clear their cargo at the Port of Mombasa and choose the mode of transport to Nairobi and the hinterlands after Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reverted custom services to the coastal city in line with a presidential decree.\n\nKPA has issued a notice to quash a 2018 notification banning the nomination of cargo to Mombasa and compulsory use of the standard gauge railway (SGR) for ferrying cargo.\n\n“This is, therefore, to notify all shipping lines that importers’ documentation of place of clearance and mode of transport for their goods shall be at their choice,” acting KPA Managing Director John Mwangemi said in the notice on Monday.\n\n“Shipping lines are hereby advised to facilitate importers’ nomination of place of clearance, including port clearance, Kenya Revenue Authority’s licensed container freight stations (CFSs) and KPA’s inland container depots (ICDs). This notice supersedes the notice of 6th June 2018 on similar subject,” KPA said.\n\nShippers’ take\n\nThe Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) chief executive Gilbert Lagat said the notice has ended confusion on the implementation of the presidential directive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is very clear. We are happy with the directive. The place and choice of mode and place of clearance rest with the shipper. This is what we had been pushing for to allow cargo clearance and delivery to compete on efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness,” said Mr Lagat.\n\nHe added, “rail, road, port, CFSs and ICDs will compete on level ground. We expect the cost to respond to market dynamics as it is a win-win for all.”\n\nPresident William Ruto issued a directive a fortnight ago ordering that all cargo clearance be reverted to Mombasa port.\n\nCargo transporters had been protesting the directive by former President Uhuru Kenyatta to ferry their goods to Nairobi or Naivasha via the SGR for onward clearance, saying it had raised the cost of doing business, with the costs passed on to consumers.\n\nKenya Transport Association chairman Newton Wang’oo said SGR should compete with roads on an equal opportunity basis, which will ultimately lower the cost of transport and improve services.\n\n“This is a positive move. We have been fighting against forced railage. Let us looks out for the implementation of the directive on the ground,” said Mr Wang’oo.",

    "Rotary Trio in Mississippi Sees Poverty in Kenya Firsthand": "By JESSICA LINDSEY, The Commercial Dispatch\n\nCOLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) — In a small village about an hour drive from Nairobi, Kenya, a mother pretends to begin preparations for dinner and prays for her children to fall asleep early before noticing they had no food.\n\nThis is the scene Lucy Walker set for the Columbus Rotary Club at Lion Hills recently as she recounted a summer mission trip to Kenya.\n\n“There was a mom, and she had three small children,” Walker said. “They had no food, and they were starving. She said she’d put rocks in boiling water at night hoping they would fall asleep before they realized they were not getting any food. That’s the impact this club made at that time. … Through the gift that this club made, they fed hundreds of starving people during COVID.”\n\nWalker was accompanied by her husband, Bill, and former superintendent of the Columbus Municipal School District Cherie Labat to Kenya through Global Connections, an organization which seeks to help those in poverty around the world.\n\nPolitical Cartoons View All 676 Images\n\nWalker said the Rotary Club’s donation this year helped a children’s center in Limuru, Kenya, receive necessary supplies such as vitamins for the children for a year.\n\nLabat said she got involved with Global Connections about a year ago when she and her husband adopted a family in Africa. She said one of the most eye-opening experiences to her this summer was visiting the slums in Kenya.\n\n“I’m very intrigued by poverty issues, and it’s my heart’s work outside of student education,” Labat said. “My first visit to the slums when I arrived in Kenya, I think my mouth was open the whole time because you think you understand poverty to this degree, but I think actually seeing it and seeing children and people without shoes (makes) a different impact on you.”\n\nIn Labat’s time there, she saw many of the people lean on their Christian faith to help get through the tough times. She said the people embraced loving their neighbor as they love themselves and sharing what little resources they did have.\n\n“Even when they have a little, they give a lot,” Labat said. “It’s a very special community within a community to be a part of and to see. Even in our giving in the slums, they would always give to someone else or find the opportunity to give to someone else.”\n\nIn their travels across the east African nation, Labat said there were three foundational needs of every community they visited: clean water, school and the church. She said she learned more about the importance of water quality and the science behind how it works in rural villages.\n\n“You think about here (in Mississippi) and what makes a great community,” Labat said. “It is a school, a church, and we’ve learned now that it’s clean water in the state.”\n\nShe said she was intrigued by the national curriculum, which focuses on love and character then the core subjects like math, reading and science.\n\nWith the great sense of community and the impact the team made together, Labat said the trip changed her definition of family.\n\n“We often define family in the scope of our perspective,” Labat said. “I think there was a family among us from Global Connections, and I watched families from grandmothers and aunts raising kids to mothers raising kids to mothers and fathers trying to do the best for their children in a very dire situation. It was a beautiful experience.”",
    "Uhuru Kenyatta failed to turn Kenya into as big an international player as he could – here’s why": "One of the notable achievements of Uhuru Kenyatta’s nine-year tenure as president was that he invigorated Kenya’s foreign policy.\n\nA year after his 2013 inauguration, his government launched a document that outlined Kenya’s diplomatic engagements and foreign relations. It was the country’s first written foreign policy since independence.\n\nIts themes can be distilled into four objectives and practices: regional and continental cooperation; promoting Kenya’s economic interests; revival of pan-Africanism; and an aggressive approach to foreign policy, including a plethora of high-level visits.\n\nIt was indeed a dynamic performance.\n\nNevertheless, in my view, based on the country’s mixed outcomes and foreign policy losses, it’s evident that the Kenyatta government’s foreign policy was not focused, consistent or effectively coordinated. Consequently, it failed to create a regional balance of power favourable to Kenya’s interests.\n\nAnd while the country became more visible globally and actively engaged in international matters, the returns from this visibility have been dismal – save for an increased debt burden.\n\nRegional and continental cooperation\n\nIn the 2014 Kenya Foreign Policy document, Kenyatta affirmed that Kenya would seek to promote sub-regional and regional integration.\n\nIn his inauguration speech in 2013, he said his government would strengthen regional ties through the free movement of people, goods and investment. He underscored the importance of deepening relations with the East African Community and Africa as a whole to:\n\ndeliver on the promise of independence and liberation from our colonial past.\n\nHowever, critics faulted Kenyatta for using a pan-African approach to overcome the initial global isolation and non-receptiveness Kenya faced from traditional allies like Britain and the US. This chilly reception from the UK and US followed Kenyatta’s election as president despite his facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) case.\n\nAs a result, the president’s policy on global politics retracted to operating through the continental body, the African Union.\n\nKenya became an active contributor to the union’s programmes. In 2014, the country gave US$1.1 million to support the African World Heritage Fund.\n\nIn 2015, Kenyatta was elected the chairperson of the African Peer Review Mechanism. This is a voluntary assessment and monitoring system that evaluates and advises African Union member states on their progress in achieving good governance.\n\nMoreover, Kenya was among the countries that contributed troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia.\n\nDespite all this activity, Kenyatta failed to effectively exert influence and drive regional integration to Kenya’s advantage.\n\nPan-Africanism\n\nA notable element in Kenya’s foreign policy under Kenyatta was the renaissance of pan-Africanism. In his first address to the African Union Summit in 2013, he said:\n\nPan-Africanism has sparked a Kenyan renaissance.\n\nThe president said he had received tutelage on pan-Africanism from his father, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya’s first president.\n\nArguably, this pan-African reinvigoration into Kenya’s foreign policy was motivated by the existential threats of global sanctions that the regime faced. Yet, Kenyatta’s election against the backdrop of the cases at The Hague turned Kenya into an icon of resistance following what was perceived as the unfair targeting of Africa by the ICC.\n\nDuring Kenyatta’s inauguration, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni praised Kenyans for rejecting western neo-colonialism. This was in reference to calls by diplomats that Kenyans should not elect people with cases to answer at the ICC.\n\nThe African Union convened an extraordinary summit that declared support for Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, who was also facing charges at The Hague.\n\nEconomic interests\n\nKenyatta’s foreign policy of economic prosperity was pursued and achieved via a triple approach.\n\nFirst was through encouraging trade ties with traditional allies like the UK, US and some countries in western Europe. Second was through a diversification of economic relations to include new markets in the form of a “look east” policy.\n\nThird was through emphasising intra-African trade. Kenya signed trade agreements with states not considered traditional allies, such as Nigeria and Ghana. Additionally, the country quickly signed the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement in March 2018.\n\nBut questions have arisen on whether Kenya has the financial capacity to meet present and future economic obligations.\n\nAssertive foreign policy\n\nKenya hosted a wide range of high-level international meetings. Subjects ranged from climate change to trade. Kenyatta also received high-level delegations reminiscent of former president Daniel Moi’s era. His guests included the pope and leaders of India, Israel, US, UK, China and Japan.\n\nFrom Africa, Kenyatta hosted leaders from Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Rwanda, among many others.\n\nBy July 2022, a month to the election that would end his term in office, Kenyatta had made 158 official foreign trips. In contrast, his predecessor Mwai Kibaki made just 33 foreign trips over 10 years of leadership.\n\nThe country’s foreign policy during Kenyatta’s second term, which began in 2017, is what I would describe as aggressive or assertive. The country took advantage of any international opportunity that arose to make its mark.\n\nIn February 2022, Kenya addressed a UN Security Council meeting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its envoy to the UN, Martin Kimani, came out strongly in defence of Ukraine. He stated that the Charter of the United Nations was fading due to “the relentless assault of the powerful”. Kimani compared Ukraine’s plight to Africa’s colonial legacy.\n\nKenya’s aggressive foreign policy direction earned Kenya a seat at the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.\n\nBut this aggressive foreign policy also portrayed Kenya as a nation that “wants everything”. This earned it some opposition regionally. For instance, states like Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti and Tanzania didn’t vote for Kenya in its bid to chair the African Union Commission.\n\nKenyatta should have streamlined his priorities and made his foreign objectives sharper so as not to appear to be a “Jack of all trades” in foreign affairs. Many foreign interests were projected with little coordination; few were accomplished.\n\nIn some cases, the country’s goodwill was squandered in the pursuit of self-interest.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe post-Kenyatta government needs to fast-track the realisation of East African Community objectives. It needs to support South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s active participation in regional integration. The new Ruto regime should also maintain a non-disruptive relationship with Rwanda and Tanzania.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, Kenya needs to diplomatically endeavour to reduce Ethiopia’s growing influence in the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\n\nUnder Kenyatta, Kenya’s foreign policy practice within the African Union was more “lone ranger”. The Ruto regime will need to forge closer ties with regional powers like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa to make it easier for Kenya to push through its agenda at the African Union.\n\nIt will also need to renegotiate its foreign debts and re-examine Kenya-China agreements to re-organise debt repayments.",
    "Why US tech billionaire took up job as ambassador to Kenya": "By Mike Owuor More by this Author\n\nBy Elvis Ondieki More by this Author\n\nWhen United States President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Margaret “Meg” Whitman as the Ambassador to Kenya last December, one question must have lingered in many minds across the world: why would a Silicon Valley billionaire with a storied career as a corporate executive and board member of some of the world’s top multinationals take up this role?\n\nIt was an inevitable introductory question as the Sunday Nation team settled down for an exclusive interview with Ms Whitman—the first since her arrival last month—at the American embassy in Nairobi.\n\nPerhaps undergirded by decades of experience as a corporate leader and awareness of her new role as a diplomat, 66-year-old Ms Whitman calmly tackles even the most uncomfortable of questions and has a vivid recollection of events, people and places. She speaks with authority and dresses the part.\n\nHer real-time net worth on Forbes is indicated as $3.1 billion (Sh373 billion), ranking her among the richest women in the United States.\n\nForbes data indicate that in 2021, the year she was nominated to be the ambassador to Kenya, her peak net worth was $5.8 billion. This usually fluctuates depending on various factors, including stock markets.\n\nBack to the question: What convinced the billionaire, most known for steering multinational e-Commerce giant eBay to astronomical growth and for leading Hewlett-Packard among other high-profile corporate positions, to take up a US government job in Nairobi?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfluential global role\n\n“So, I was called by the President of the United States (President Joe Biden) and he asked whether I would be willing to be an ambassador. And the next sentence was, ‘We want you to go to Kenya.’ And I said, ‘Okay, tell me why. Tell me more’,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman says that in her conversation with President Biden, he explained the influential global role Africa would play in the next decades, especially given its burgeoning population.\n\n“And he said, ‘Kenya is one of the most important countries in Africa, and so I’d really like you to take up a post there. The other thing that I think would be a good fit for you and the United States is that Kenya is the East Africa leader in technology; with Safaricom, M-Pesa (a mobile money service) and the start-up community’,” says Ms Whitman, who has been inducted to the US Business Hall of Fame.\n\nIn picking her, the president believed that having an American ambassador with such vast experience, especially in technology—given Kenya’s prominent role on the continent—would be important.\n\nShe told the President: “Okay, I’m game.”\n\nBut being a daughter, wife, mother and grandmother, it was not a decision she would make on her own. So, what did those closest to her think about this? Throughout the interview, the significance of her family, especially in some of the most important decisions in her personal and professional career, stands out.\n\nHer two sons—Griff Harsh and Will Harsh —encouraged her to take up the ambassadorial job because “life is about experiences and we think it would be a great experience.” It did not matter that she had never been a diplomat before and her husband, Dr Griffith R Harsh, a renowned neurosurgeon in the United States, decided to come with her to Nairobi.\n\n“As it turns out, American medical licences are good in just three countries outside the US. Kenya is one of them. And so, he is now trying to decide what he will do as he gets settled in Kenya,” she tells Sunday Nation about a man whose unwavering support alongside that of her mother is acknowledged throughout Ms Whitman’s book, The Power of Many.\n\nShe goes on: “It turns out that households don’t run themselves. And so, just getting the household set up, learning how to use M-Pesa, understanding how we get around and where to go, I have had no time. So, that has fallen to him.”\n\nBesides, Ms Whitman had to resign from the board of General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Teach for America among others, to satisfy the requirements for her appointment. Ambassadorial duties, she says, require the relinquishing of all such positions.\n\nRead: Joe Biden nominates ex-HP boss as US ambassador to Kenya\n\nEven though she had been to Kenya before in 2018 during a two-week visit that also included travelling to Tanzania as a member of the board of trustees of The Nature Conservancy, a US-headquartered global environmental organisation, this time it was different.\n\nMs Whitman’s nomination was considered by the US Senate and confirmed on July 14 this year. She came to Kenya on August 1 to take over from Kyle McCarter. It was not until August 5 that President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose term ended this month, received her credentials. Significantly, it was just four days to one of Kenya’s most closely contested elections.\n\nTake on general election\n\nWith that, she was thrust headlong into the General Election. She admits that she had been researching a lot about Kenyan politics, but a lot was new. Ms Whitman’s conclusion is that the election was “remarkable”.\n\n“Democracy has prevailed here,” she says. “The outcome was ultimately contested, but in an appropriate, non-violent way—right to the Supreme Court that adjudicated and the candidates accepted the results. And I think it was a shining moment for Kenya.”\n\nShe goes on: “Kenyans should be very proud of the process that took place here. It was, I think, a model even for East Africa and all of Africa and, frankly, a model for the world.”\n\nShe was an observer on Election Day and her experience at Nairobi Primary School is stuck in her mind. She marvelled at the calmness and organisation of the voting—though she thought the ballot papers were “very long and many ”.\n\nMs Whitman says that the US had no preferred candidate in the election: “The US was very clear that this was a Kenyan election by Kenyans for Kenyans. We are here only to be supportive if we can be in terms of transparency and as election observers. But we did not have a preferred candidate.”\n\nNonetheless, there appear to have been shuttle diplomacy by Western envoys during the post-election period. On August 18, for example, Ms Whitman was in a team that included Delaware Senator Chris Coons, which separately met with Mr Kenyatta, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s William Ruto (then President-elect) and Mr Raila Odinga of Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party.\n\nWhat was this all about? She says Mr Coons was the reason the meetings happened.\n\n“As you probably know, Senator Coons has a long history with Africa and a long history in Kenya. He did his first year of college at the University of Nairobi. And he speaks quite fluent Swahili.\n\n“So, he knew all three (Mr Kenyatta, Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga) and he actually arranged these meetings. They (the neetings) were really about checking in with his friends and talking about where we were in the election and encouraging what was already underway—which was a peaceful resolution to the challenge at the Supreme Court,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nBut did the US and other global powers fear Mr Kenyatta would cling to power and frustrate a peaceful transition? The envoy says she never had such doubts, given her interactions with him.\n\n“I would say we were quite confident,” she says. “When I met with President Kenyatta as I presented my credentials, I said, ‘I have every confidence that this election will go as you all hope it will: violence-free, a peaceful transfer of power.’ And that’s exactly what happened. And I, in the US embassy, had confidence that this would go smoothly. And it did.”\n\nVisa backlog\n\nMs Whitman’s management style celebrates competence and teamwork. Early in her tenure, she has had to confront some long-standing challenges at the embassy that she says she is confident she will resolve.\n\nThe backlog in handling visa applications of Kenyans has resulted in long waiting times, and has been top on her agenda after complaints from those who had been forced to reschedule or cancel their travel plans.\n\nAs part of the efforts to streamline operations, the American embassy recently waived interview requirements for some categories of visa renewal applications. She says she recently spent a few hours working with the teams processing the visas and, after some training, helped to take applicants’ fingerprints.\n\n“I’m not trained to do the interviews (like the consular officials) but anyone can do finger-printing,” she says, laughing.\n\nThe embassy now has a new “very experienced” consul-general, she says, and the ambassador hopes that the appointment, plus the recent repeal of a requirement for visa interviews for some categories, will eventually help clear the backlog and improve the US visa application experience.\n\nIf she still sticks to her worldview when she wrote her 2010 book, The Power of Many, she will be slow on parties and showy treats for embassy staff. While emerging tech companies indulged in parties, she writes, eBay was focused on spending only on the necessities and paying its staff well.\n\n“Beyond vetoing fluff and excess, I was determined to make sure eBay remained a lean, efficient company in other ways, too,” she wrote.\n\nSo what drove her as a pioneer woman corporate executive often breaking the proverbial glass ceiling?\n\nBecause of her career choices, Ms Whitman has at times worked in set-ups where she was the only woman in the room, but she is grateful for the mentorship from her mother and her early workplace influences for building in her the spirit to fight on.\n\n“From the earliest day, my mother told my brother, my sister and me: ‘You can do anything you want.’ And I amazingly believed her. There was no reason to believe her, but she was very persuasive and confident. And she said, ‘Don’t let people tell you you can’t do it. You figure it out,’” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds; “I landed the US ambassador job. I’m not a career diplomat. I’ve never done this before. So, at first, you’re thinking, ‘Hmm, how am I going to do this?’ And then you figure it out. And so, my advice to men and women is: Give yourself a little latitude to figure it out.”\n\nAmerica has previously sent some colourful and controversial envoys to Nairobi, so what should Kenya expect during her term? She says democracy and transparency remain important and she will also focus on economic development—particularly small and medium enterprises.\n\n“How to take this digital environment and make it work for small- to medium businesses is a real passion of mine,” she says, saluting President Ruto for also focusing on enterprise in his manifesto.\n\n“What Kenyans have to build on are things like the penetration of M-Pesa. I’m not sure that Kenyans realise how impressive this is. In Silicon Valley, we all knew about M-Pesa and were amazed at the penetration and how it had lifted people out of poverty and now everyone in Kenya is banked,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nHer assessment of Kenya’s technology scene is that it is at its infancy but has tremendous potential.\n\n“I think it’s very vibrant, but maybe at the beginning of the cycle,” she says. “What you need to create an even more vibrant tech scene is some large companies: Safaricom, now Google is here, Microsoft,among others. What they are doing is bringing in young tech workers and training them.”\n\nSuch an environment with many skilled people helps create start-ups.\n\n“Then you need an investment community: venture capital. And venture capital is alive and well in Kenya. In fact, if you adjust for the size of GDP of the country, Kenya has the biggest venture capital sector on the continent of Africa,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman emphasises the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) for long-term gains.\n\n“You need some very good universities who are training computer scientists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers in Stem. I would encourage the leading universities here to think about investing in training more Stem students,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman, who is often listed as one of the most influential women in the world, particularly points out that “unless girls major in Stem and go through high school with a good maths and science background, you’re not going to have the women to take the jobs in technology.”\n\nFood security\n\nDuring her tenure in Kenya, she says she will also focus on food security. Ms Whitman is perturbed by the humanitarian crisis caused by the drought in north-eastern Kenya and the Horn of Africa that is “perhaps the largest in the world right now”.\n\nShe says she will also put emphasis on conservation.\n\n“What Kenya has done around community conservancies is extraordinary. You know, the national parks, I think, comprise around two to three per cent of Kenyan lands. If you add all the community conservancies, it could go up to 12 per cent of Kenya—and I am being conservative. And, obviously, tourism is a big source of foreign exchange and a big part of the economy,” she says.\n\nSpeaking of the economy, it is widely acknowledged that Kenya-US trade relations are lopsided in favour of the superpower. The trade window facilitated by Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) has been among the key areas to bridge that gap. It first opened in 2000 and extended in 2015, but stares at an uncertain future when it expires in 2025.\n\n“Kenya has benefitted, I think quite dramatically, under Agoa. They are one of the biggest beneficiaries of Agoa, particularly in apparel exports. We have seen apparel exports from Kenya to the US go up dramatically in the context of Agoa,” she says, hoping that there will be conversations about maintaining this momentum.\n\nInvestment Partnership\n\nThere is also the USA-Kenya Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that started during the tenure of former President Donald Trump. Ms Whitman says the FTA has been binned by the Biden administration in favour of the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) launched in July.\n\nWhile Mr Trump wanted to negotiate a bilateral trade deal, the STIP was described as “the new roadmap” to support African regional economic integration.\n\n“When new administrations come in, sometimes policies change. And so, what we now have in place is the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership that was negotiated by our United States trade representative and (Trade Cabinet Secretary) Betty Maina in the Kenyan government. And this is an important first step to ultimately perhaps even more cooperation,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds: “One of the things that I’d very much like to see is exports from Kenya to the US improve significantly. It’s important for Kenya because of the foreign exchange reserves and the opportunity for American companies to import to Kenya.”\n\nDuring Mr Kenyatta’s administration from 2013, and his predecessor Mwai Kibaki since 2003, there has been a rise in Chinese investments and trade with the Asian giant. Chinese firms, mostly state-backed, have been involved in various mega projects, including construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway. Is the US worried about China’s growing influence?\n\n“Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken was very clear when he was here in October 2021 that we didn’t want to say to Kenyans ‘you can’t do business with China’ but give Kenyans an opportunity to do more business with Americans. And so, we definitely are interested in making sure there is a level playing field for American companies and making sure that American companies understand the opportunity in Kenya,’” she says.\n\nMs Whitman notes: “I was the CEO of a Fortune 50 company. And I think many big American companies don’t understand the opportunity in Kenya. When you sit in America, you are thinking about Asia, Europe, Latin America – because they are so close to us – but the opportunity in Africa and in Kenya is great.”\n\nThe American embassy has also been under fire for its travel advisories over the years. Under Ms Whitman, two that warned American citizens against travelling to Kisumu on key dates around the presidential election—the announcement of the results and the Supreme Court verdict—have stirred debate.\n\n“Our first job as the embassy and [for me] as the US ambassador is to make sure that Americans and embassy personnel are safe. And this is true not only for Kenya but for every country in the world: safety of Americans and embassy personnel is number one. We had no information that you didn’t have, but our second biggest installation outside of Nairobi is Kisumu,” she says, adding that the precaution could have been informed by “some violence in previous elections”.\n\nSays Ms Whitman: “I have no real latitude about whether to issue those warnings or not. They are really required by the United States government in these kinds of circumstances. Fortunately, Kisumu was perfect. There was no violence there, and so we were happy about that.”\n\nUS Supreme Court\n\nShe explains that even though she did not have a lot of latitude on the decision to issue those warnings, “as we go forward, we’ll try to think about these as carefully as we can.”\n\nWe held the interview three months after the US Supreme Court overturned the Roe v Wade judgment, effectively removing many liberties for women on abortion. Will that affect the US government’s funding of reproductive health rights in Kenya? Ms Whitman says a categorical “no”.\n\n“President Biden has been very clear that in the US, he will continue to support women’s rights to choose,” says Ms Whitman. “The State Department and the mission in Nairobi will not change policies on that.”\n\nPresidential ambition?\n\nHaving been previously listed by some publications as one of the people most likely to be America’s first woman president, she is categorical during our interview that she would not consider getting into the race for the White House.\n\n“I ran for governor of California (in 2010). As you know, I lost [to Jerry Brown]. And I sort of did my turn at elective politics. So, you will not see me run again,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman has visited a few places outside Nairobi, most recently Kisumu, but hopes to travel more. And true to her love for the outdoors, she has already been to Ngong Hills and Mt Longonot for a hike. She has also visited the Amboseli National Park and the Maasai Mara.\n\n“But that’s just the beginning of my travel. I want to get out to places beyond Nairobi. Nairobi is very important, but I want to make sure I get out to towns and villages across Kenya.”\n\nWe had to wind up our interview exactly when our scheduled hour with her ran out. She was rushing to address a gathering of women in technology hosted by the embassy.\n\nDorcas Odumbe contributed to this article with additional interview questions\n\n[email protected]",

    "‘Restoring the river’: why Kenyans are returning to precolonial spirituality": "Wairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture earlier this year. Within months, the 26-year-old had gained more than 60,000 followers and received at least 1m views of her videos, where she talks about her ethnic group’s traditional practices and beliefs on topics such as mental health and sex.\n\nMukuru, a Kikuyu language teacher, is one of a small but growing number of Kenyans from the country’s largest ethnic group, the Agīkūyū, who are trying to revive precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. The belief systems were suppressed and marginalised during British colonial rule in the 19th century, and as Christianity became more entrenched.\n\nWairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture this year. Photograph: TikTok\n\n“Westernisation was entangled with Christianity,” says King’ori wa Kanyi, a member of the Agīkūyū Council of Elders. “A good African convert had to take a European name, dress like a European and visit the clinic instead of the herbalist.”\n\nAbout 85% of Kenyans identify as Christians and the religion has become an entrenched part of the country’s political and cultural fabric, marking naming, birth, marriage and political ceremonies.\n\n“There’s a new kind of Pentecostalism that has consumed much of how we understand ourselves,” says Kamau Wairuri, a socio-political researcher at the Edinburgh University. “Since people are not familiar with other alternatives, those looking to practise a different kind of spirituality might not know where to begin.”\n\nAdherents of Kikuyu spirituality say it is inseparable from their culture and is treated as a way of life. During colonial rule, the community fought to retain their spiritual systems but the practices were labelled as “savage” pagan religions and ultimately pushed to the margins.\n\n“Colonialism destroyed indigenous African religions, labelling them primitive and not good for the modern age,” said Jacob Olupona, a professor of African religious traditions at Harvard divinity school. “With time, Africans stopped seeing something good in their own traditions. Those belief systems became so marginalised that some have become like secret societies.”\n\nToday, less than 2% of Kenyans practise traditional beliefs. But experts say accurate estimates are elusive because many practise indigenous belief systems alongside mainstream religions such as Christianity and Islam.\n\nAlthough the numbers are fairly low across Africa, and many of those who do practise traditional religions are seen as outliers, some Kikuyu elders say that there has been a slow but gradual shift in attitudes within the community.\n\n“Many people are now rejecting European imposed religious and cultural identities,” says Kanyi, adding that among the Agīkūyū, there is a term for the efforts to revive indigenous beliefs, which translates as “restoring the river to its original course”.\n\nKikuyu girls in 1936-37 at a Church of Scotland mission school in Kenya, where they were dressed in European clothes and taught domestic skills. Photograph: Universal Images/Alamy\n\nExperts say interest has grown as a rising number of the African diaspora returned to the continent over the past decade, in search of their ancestral traditions. “It has emboldened those who are practising it at home,” says Olupona.\n\nObservers say renewed reckonings over the legacies of colonialism may also prompt greater interest in precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. Nevertheless, those looking to reclaim their heritage face challenges. Most African spiritual belief systems are an oral tradition and are not recorded in writing.\n\n“There’s a lot that has been washed away,” says Mukuru, who has been exploring the Kikuyu cultural and spiritual history for several years.\n\nIf we lose these religions ... we would have lost an entire civilisation Jacob Olupona\n\nSome accounts on the Agīkūyū way of life were written by the Kikuyu historian Godfrey Muriuki and Louis Leakey, a Kenyan-British archaeologist who lived among the community for most of his life. Mukuru says a lot of the history can also be found in the community’s language, sayings, songs and stories by Kikuyu writers such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.\n\nTraditional religions are also fiercely guarded by community elders and practitioners, say experts, adding that their oral form has allowed religions to evolve and incorporate beliefs from other religions.\n\nBut the efforts to revive traditional beliefs have not been welcomed in all quarters. Some members of the community, especially those over 50, strongly oppose the revival, says Mukuru’s teacher and spiritual guide, Kariithi wa Njenga. Many have embraced Christianity.\n\nKikuyu men and women dancing in traditional dress in Kenya’s former Central province, the Kikuyu heartland. Photograph: Images of Africa Photobank/Alamy\n\nThose who try to re-engage with the traditions, like Mukuru, also face some pressure to adopt it wholesale. She does not agree with some old Kikuyu traditions, such as female genital mutilation, for example. But she says the traditions entail a wide range of beliefs, including many that are progressive.\n\nUnder Kikuyu cultural practice, women had control over agricultural production, the community’s main source of livelihood. Mukuru says she was surprised to discover that the culture was also matrilineal and sexually liberal. “Sensual dances were used as a way to gauge sexual synergy with the opposite sex,” she says.\n\nEnvironmental protection was also an important part of the culture. “Treating animals and plants with respect is a mark of spiritual maturity among the Agīkūyū,” says Kanyi, adding that the community attached spiritual significance to mountains and trees, and observed a mainly plant-based diet.\n\nSuch spiritual practices are only held sacred by the community’s few practitioners. Experts say they have become custodians of an important history and culture. “If we lose these religions, it would be a big loss for the world,” says Olupona. “We would have lost an entire civilisation.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Is Kenya ready to reintroduce the Shamba System?": "A view of Mt Elgon Forest. [Caroline Chebet, Standard]\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua's proposal to revert to the Shamba system has sparked debate on whether Kenya is ready for the re-introduction of the system that was banned twice by different regimes.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, in Baringo County, Gachagua hinted that the government has plans to allow peasant farmers to carry out farming in forests to boost food production in the country.\n\n\"There was Shamba System where locals could plant maize until the trees grow. This government is yours, we have made an order for Wananchi to be given an opportunity to cultivate in the forest to have more food,\" Gachagua said.\n\nHow the Shamba system worked\n\nThe agroforestry approach started way back in 1910 under tolonial rule to promote sustained and optimum production of food crops while assisting forest conservation. Under the system, agricultural crops are grown together with the forest trees.\n\nDuring the Moi administration, the system was aligned and locals would cooperate with officials from the Kenya Forest Service in matters allocation of land (mostly not more than an acre for each family).\n\nAfter allocation, the had grown after around three years, the beneficiaries would hand back the land to the Kenya Forest officials.\n\nBack then, the main aim was to afforest land where exotic trees had been cut for timber and as well as boost the food supply chain across the country.\n\nAmong the crops that were grown included; maize, beans, groundnuts, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. At the same time, those allocated the land would be allowed to harvest firewood, forest fruits and even keep beehives.\n\nWhy it was successful\n\nFrom the onset, the Shamba System was successful because at its introduction stage, the government through the Kenya Forest docket had designated personnel who worked hand in hand with farmers on a weekly basis.\n\nWith this in place, the farmer could be guided on what to plant and what not to during what season plus kinds of trees to plant and when to harvest.\n\nThe officers were also in charge of plot acquisition hence ensuring that only those with good intentions were vetted and allocated.\n\nHowever, it was later banned under the late Mwai Kibaki;s era, after it emerged that most farmers refused to move out of their allocated plots after the three-year period given elapsed and had cut down the trees.\n\nAnother major reason that led to the Kibaki-led government to abolish the Shamba System was logging, where rogue millers would collaborate with some Kenya Forest Service officials to cut trees for personal benefits.",
    "DARIUS OKOLLA - The Myth That Is Plastic Waste Recycling in Kenya": "Brexit Britain’s dismal plan to export its “immigration problem” to Rwanda through the forced deportation of asylum seekers is in some ways redolent of how, more than a century earlier, Kenya Colony dealt with its “native question”. That centred upon how to control the “natives” in a white European colony.\n\nSome of the same buzzwords can be heard again this time around. Morality, betterment, economics, labour, containment, segregation and deterrence. Africans (and migrants of other ethnicities) must be contained in the equivalent of “native” reserves so that states can better control them. Moving them into reserves (aka migrant hostels, barracks, camps or detention centres) is for their own good. They will learn to give up whatever they were doing and labour for the white man (or in Rwanda’s case, industrious black and brown people). They will learn by example to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as if they had never worked hard before. They will be mighty grateful for the opportunities offered – or they damn well ought to be. Saviours, of whatever colour, will save the lazy “natives” from themselves – or in the case of cross-Channel migrants, from people smugglers. Morally, it is the right thing to do. Civilisation will rub off on them. But whether the deported migrants will be treated as citizens or subjects in their new “home” remains unclear.\n\nWriting in The Times in April, the then Home Secretary Priti Patel, chief architect of the UK-Rwanda deportation scheme, said, “We can provide legal, safe, orderly and controlled ways for people to better their lives, flee oppression, persecution or conflict and enjoy new opportunities” (emphasis mine). This ignores the fact that forced deportation is itself oppressive, and a form of trafficking. The “best interests” argument was regularly used by colonial administrators, in Kenya and in other British colonies, to justify forced removals and other oppressive measures against Africans, such as the Maasai removals and the Talai resettlement (discussed below).\n\nContinuities in the colonial treatment of mobile Africans, and the modern-day treatment of refugees and asylum seekers (both African and other non-whites), are plain to see. Scholars Hanna Brankamp and Patricia Daley write of labourers, migrants and refugees, then and now: “Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”. Discussing both colonial migrant labourers and post-colonial refugees and migrants, and historical trajectories of migration control, their term “racialized subjects in need of spatial fixation” is a useful one. They draw parallels between measures of regulation, control and containment that are still in vogue today.\n\nThe role of Brexit\n\nThe goal of ending unfettered immigration to Britain lay at the heart of the Brexit vote in 2016, when a slim majority of British people voted to leave the European Union (EU). Those voters, known as Brexiteers, seem to forget that 47.5 million people did not vote to leave. Though this figure includes 13 million people who did not vote at all, those who voted to stay in the EU are called Remainers. The country formally left the EU in January 2020. But Brexiteers are furious that Brexit has not delivered what they expected, or were promised. In particular, they rage at what they see as out-of-control immigration, and the spectre of “hordes” of young men “of fighting age” from Africa and the Middle East arriving on our beaches. The majority are wrongly assumed to be Muslims, who are believed, in the wake of several terrorist attacks by young Muslim men living in Britain, to pose a terror threat. Immigration, especially by cross-Channel dinghy from France, aided by people smugglers, has soared under successive Tory governments; 28,500 migrants crossed the Channel this way in the past year, treble the figure for the previous 12 months. More than 20,000 people have crossed since the start of 2022. Crossings have continued since the Home Office announced its deportation plan, which indicates that it is not a deterrent. Some 1295 people crossed in one day (22 August), a record for 2022 so far. The fact that the migrants are escorted ashore by Border Force officials, housed in hotels, fed and watered, and “paid” £39 a week, all at taxpayers’ expense, only infuriates Brexiteers more.\n\n“Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”.\n\nGloating over this fiasco is the divisive figure of Nigel Farage, an éminence grise obsessed with immigration and the EU, who has never managed to get elected to the British parliament, despite seven attempts. He was, nonetheless, the driving force behind Brexit, when leader of the fringe UKIP (UK Independence Party) and Brexit Party. Farage continues to whip up anti-migrant sentiment on right-wing broadcast channels such as GB News, but also in the pages of serious national newspapers. If one person is single-handedly responsible for the anti-migrant rhetoric, it is Farage. Shamefully, the two final candidates who fought to succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, parroted Farage in their frantic attempt to appeal to Tory Party members who chose the new PM. As predicted, Truss won. (The British electorate as a whole was not allowed to vote.) At an earlier stage of the contest, all the candidates said they supported the Rwanda deportation plan – despite the fact that several of them are, like Patel and Sunak, the children of immigrants to the UK. (Sunak’s parents were born in Kenya and Tanganyika, Patel’s are from Uganda.)\n\nFear of a mass invasion by Africans features in much of this rhetoric. Online comments contain hysterical claims that “the whole continent” is headed for Europe. “Most of Africa would prefer to live in Britain”, posted a reader at the Daily Telegraph on 22 June, one example that stands for many. In fact, the top countries of migrants’ origin include non-African countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago. In 2012, the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a strategy aimed at tackling “illegal” immigration by making life so unbearable for certain migrants they would voluntarily choose to leave. May herself used the words “a really hostile environment”. (Ironically, she now criticises the Rwanda deportation policy.) However, the opposition Labour Party first coined the expression in 2007. The then Labour immigration minister Liam Byrne referred to the desirability of creating a “hostile environment” in a consultation document that year, although the policy was not implemented. He has angrily denied May’s claims that Labour invented it.\n\nMigration within colonial Kenya\n\nSwitching my focus to Kenya and the deeper historical context of forced migration, many of the internal relocations that took place in colonial Kenya (and the British protectorate that preceded it, before 1920) involved coercing Africans into leaving home to labour for white settlers. They moved seasonally in large numbers. “Squatters had not looked for work; [Lord Delamere] had sent for them, fetching their families and flocks by train”, writes historian John Lonsdale. However, not all displacement was coerced; this denies African and Asian agency, and overlooks all the other reasons why men, and women (often ignored in migration studies), moved as individuals in search of work.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago.\n\nNorman Leys (a medical doctor and rights activist) reported how many colonial district officers initially refused to comply with demands from settlers and other private employers to use their influence and procure labourers. “Then an agitation began in Nairobi and in London. As a result of that agitation instructions were sent to district officers that, while no compulsion was to be used, ‘moral suasion’ was to be resorted to, chiefs were to be ‘encouraged’ to persuade their people to leave home to work for Europeans.” Then as now, Anglican bishops issued a statement condemning the plan. “We believe that ideally all labour should be voluntary. We recognise that, at present, this is impossible … [But] we are of the opinion that compulsory labour, so long as it is clearly necessary, should be definitely legalised.”\n\nUnder colonial vagrancy laws, it even became impossible for Africans who were not in employment to move around the country. The raising of the hut and poll tax also “encouraged” (Leys’ word, he was being ironic) Africans to seek wage labour outside their home areas. Settler estates depended on African labour to function, but recruitment proved difficult. Some settlers resorted to “exceptional violence” in order to get labour, in the words of scholars Bruce Berman and John Lonsdale. “The ferocity and unpredictability of the settler assault on the African population threatened to undermine the whole apparatus of colonial control”. The state had to step in to control labour supply, and did so after World War I when mass forced conscription into the Carrier Corps was seen to have been a “success”. (Some success; 95,000 African porters died.) It was a matter of carrots but more often sticks, as this appalling statement exemplifies:\n\nI always treat my natives the same as I treat my children, I try to be kind to them, and to advise and direct them, but when kindness has no effect you have to do the same as they do in the public schools at home and throughout the empire – cane them. (Lt. Col. J.G. Kirkwood, Legislative Council member, Legco debate, 28 November 1941).\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nAlthough the state, including the railway, was the largest single employer in the country at this point, thousands of men moved seasonally between the settler estates and African reserves, where their families tended to remain on the land. But over time, whole families moved to live on settler estates as squatters, and were initially allowed to bring their cattle with them. They grew subsistence crops, while women and children also provided labour to settlers during peak harvest and planting times. By 1931, the number of squatters in the highlands had risen to 113,176, the majority Kikuyu. They occupied one million acres of settler land, some of it land that the Maasai had formerly occupied. Although this arrangement brought some benefits for squatters (for one, it allowed them to expand beyond crowded Kikuyuland, creating a toe-hold that lasts to this day), harsh new laws forced African compliance with government. One of the most hated was the Registration of Natives Ordinance of 1915, which forced all males over the age of 15 to carry a form of identity called the kipande.\n\nOver time, settlers became alarmed about the large number of squatter stock on their land, and fearing the diseases that this stock allegedly carried, began forcing squatters and their stock off farms. Resentment at this was among the issues that sowed the seeds of Mau Mau (aka the Land and Freedom Army). “The squatters saw their economic deprivation as linked to their political subordination and it was these two problems that they hoped to eradicate when they took the oath and swore to support the Mau Mau movement,” wrote Tabitha Kanogo in her ground-breaking book Squatters and the Roots of Mau Mau.\n\nMaasai and other forced moves\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya. The most infamous forced migrations were the Maasai moves following two treaties or “agreements” made between Maasai leaders and British protectorate officials in 1904 and 1911. The moves were ordered to make way for white settlement, first in the central Rift Valley, later in the highlands of Laikipia. Maasai from certain socio-territorial sections (not the Maasai as a whole) were initially moved into two reserves, one in the north, the other in the south on the border with German territory (later Tanganyika and Tanzania). In 1904, the British promised the Maasai they could keep Laikipia for ever. But only seven years later, under pressure from settlers, they broke their pledge and moved the Maasai again, this time at gunpoint, into an enlarged southern reserve in what is now Narok County.\n\nIt is estimated that the Maasai lost up to at least 50 per cent of the territory they had once used, but the figure could be nearer 70 per cent. The losses did not just involve land, but included the loss of good grazing, access to water sources and sacred sites, and the fatal exposure of both humans and livestock to diseases like East Coast fever and malaria, which were unknown in Laikipia in those days. The ripple effects of these events continue to the present day, in agitation by Maasai for the return of lost land or compensation. Neither is likely to materialise, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nFears about Maasai warriors and the assumed threat they posed to Europeans in the early years of colonial rule were remarkably similar to the current rhetoric in Britain, centred on the irrational fear of “hordes of young men of fighting age” arriving on our shores. Not only is their potential (but unproven) violence feared, but also their perceived sexuality – “Lock up your daughters!” is the cry of the anti-migrant Tory right. This is obviously part of a larger racist trope, referred to as the “black peril” in the scholarship on settler colonies, but also prevalent in the USA, especially in the formerly segregated Deep South.\n\nBritish administrators saw the warriors as a dangerous standing army, which could let rip at any moment. In a discussion of the merits of confining the Maasai to reserves, Protectorate Commissioner Sir Charles Eliot (the equivalent of a governor) wrote to the Foreign Office in 1903: “[Maasai] simplicity, loyalty, and soldierlike qualities inspire a sympathy which makes people forget that a race which regards fighting and raiding as the only occupations for a young man of honour can never be anything but a dangerous race.” He also condemned the warriors’ alleged “immorality”. In fact, as other officials who knew the Maasai better than Eliot were constantly telling him, they had never attacked Europeans and posed no danger. “And they are not likely to,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Frederick Jackson, “so long as they are treated fairly”. On the contrary, several administrators sympathetic to the Maasai feared that racist South African settlers in the Rift Valley might attack the Maasai if they were not physically separated. For these and other reasons, they were forced into reserves.\n\nToday, the Maasai are not alone in their grievance with historical injustices. The Talai clan of Kericho County, part of the Kipsigis community, has for years sought reparations for forced resettlement. The British evicted them in 1934-36 from the Kipsigis Reserve to an allegedly mosquito-infested valley at Gwassi near Lake Victoria, where they stayed, under supervision, until the mid-1950s. They claim to have been moved to make way for tea plantations, some of which are still owned by UK-based multinationals. A group of Talai wrote to Prince William (elder son of King Charles III) in May this year seeking an apology and his support for reparations. The letter says: “We inherited the pain, you inherited the profit.” They hoped for sympathy from Will “because Kenya is special to him”. Earlier appeals to the British government appear to have received no reply.\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya.\n\nHistorians who have researched Talai history, most particularly the role of ritual leaders or orkoiik, say there is in fact no evidence that the Talai were evicted from land that became tea estates. But they were certainly evicted under colonial laws, said one leading scholar, and “unquestionably have a case”. UN human rights rapporteurs investigated the case and found for the Talai in 2021, which the community hailed as a great victory. However, the UN may have “ordered” the British government to apologise and pay compensation, but that does not mean anything will happen. The Tory government has been a tad preoccupied since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted, and a bitter struggle ensued to replace him. And since Prince William has no political power or influence, all he can say is pole sana.\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is becoming more bogged down by the day. It recently emerged that British ministers who backed the plan were warned months ago, by the government’s own advisor, that Rwanda tortures and kills political opponents. The government wants to keep these comments in a Foreign Office report secret, partly in order not to offend Rwanda. Media houses, including the BBC, are challenging this. The doomed flights are postponed until after a judicial review of the policy at the High Court, London, which began on 5 September and is expected to last five days. President Paul Kagame has also thrown a spanner in the works by announcing, after pocketing the £120 million down-payment, that Rwanda will only take 200 migrants – a drop in the ocean. Patel and the Home Office she previously headed (she resigned on Monday 5 September, hours after Truss’s victory) made a major mistake by not specifying, in the MoU with Rwanda, how many migrants Britain planned to deport. Some of us suspect that our government never intended to carry out the policy in the first place. It was simply red meat thrown to Brexit voters.\n\n–\n\nThis article is part of a series on migration and displacement in and from Africa, co-produced by the Elephant and the Heinrich Boll Foundation’s African Migration Hub, which is housed at its new Horn of Africa Office in Nairobi.",
    "Kenya's women leaders look to new president to keep his promises": "NAIROBI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Kenyan President William Ruto, who was sworn into office on Tuesday, is taking power at a time when the country has the largest number of elected female representatives in history - and they want him to keep his promise of getting more women into politics.\n\n\"A significant dividend of our electoral and democratic process is the tremendous achievement we made in breaking the glass ceiling by enhancing the participation of women in leadership,\" he told a cheering crowed at his inauguration.\n\nRuto promised on the campaign trail to uphold a 2010 constitutional clause that says no more than two-thirds of any elected body can be comprised of one gender, and promised to ensure government hiring bodies observe the rule as well. This clause has never been fulfilled and many women politicians say it must be.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nRecord numbers of Kenyan women were elected in August.

Female parliamentarians are a slightly larger proportion, at about 23%.\n\nOne reason: Female candidates face abuse and physical assault, deterring many women from running.

    "When Kenya's Treasury had Sh24m cash 111 years ago": "DP Rigathi Gachagua in Kisumu for the National Music Festivals. [DPPS]\n\nWhen the new regime of President William Ruto took office this month, Kenyans’ jaws dropped when they heard that the country’s coffers were empty.\n\nIn the words of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, by the time they were sworn in on September 13, the coffers at Central Bank had just Sh93 million.\n\nAlthough experts have tried to explain that this does not necessarily mean the heavily indebted country is broke, the current circumstances bring back memories of where Kenya was at a time like this in September 1911, exactly 111 years ago.\n\nThe state of the economy then was not rosy and although it was not incumbent on politicians then to expose the nakedness of their motherland, the official statement issued then was quite enlightening.\n\nAccording to a statement by the man in charge of Treasury, H A Smallwood, as at September 30, 1911, the East African Protectorate had £322,922 in various accounts. This by the current exchange rate of Sh136 to translates to about Sh43.9 million.\n\nThere was only £177,349 (about Sh24 million) in cash while the government had £1,036 in suspense account amounts which was at the time classified as a liability.\n\nOther liabilities of the protectorate then were listed as £45,362 while nickels and aluminum coinage accounted for £1,870\n\nAlthough the East African Protectorate morphed into the Kenya colony in 1920, and later became a republic in 1963, the country’s economy is not what it was a century ago.\n\nFrom a country whose capital city, Nairobi started off as a tin shack, the economy, going by the Kenya Economic survey 2022 is now valued at Sh12 trillion.\n\nDespite the expansion, the country in some areas is still grappling with adverse effects of drought as happened shortly before the coming of the colonialists.\n\nThe question of where the next meal will come from still dominates homesteads today, just as it did a century ago.\n\nWhile Kenyans in urban areas are crying out to the government to lower the price of unga, in the remote areas millions are thirsting for a few drops of water to quench their thirst and any kind of pasture for their emaciated animals being wiped out by drought at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Lunatic Express (Uganda Railway) has since given birth to Standard Gauge Railway but most of the lines where the old trains used to ferry passengers and goods have since ceased operations.\n\nYet, although so much has changed in 111 years, some regions have been caught in a time warp and Kenya now just like then is in desperate need of injection of capital.",

    "Kenya App Allows Users to Help Track Rare Mammals": "Kenya's wildlife authorities have launched a free mobile phone app that allows users to track sightings of rare mammals to help authorities protect them.\n\nThe Mammal Atlas Kenya, or Makenya, allows any user who spots a wild mammal to identify it and log the location.\n\nKenya is home to nearly 400 species of mammals, 22 of them natives to regions of Kenya, according to national figures. Authorities say it is getting more difficult to protect them, as climate change and human activities take a toll on their natural habitats.\n\nSo the National Museums of Kenya, the Mammal Committee of Nature Kenya and partners designed the mobile app, which also provides a way to upload photographs and details, such as the number of mammals sighted and their exact locations.\n\n\"You can also add the behavior,\" said Dr. Simon Musila, a researcher at the National Museums of Kenya. \"When you see this animal, what are they doing? Are they resting? Are they running away? Are they feeding? What are they doing at the moment you see them?”\n\nMusila said it’s important to engage the public using technology to help the country’s limited number of mammal specialists. Wildlife authorities said staff would keep records of the animals’ changing environment and survival conditions.\n\nThere's a need \"to bring in many people who can contribute a lot of data,\" he said. \"These are people like safari guides. These are people like students, tourists, people who go out and come across animals and will be willing to submit data.\"\n\nSamson Onyuok uses the Makenya app. Users like him have reported more than 2,500 mammal sightings since the app launched in August.\n\n\"First, I think I take pride in contributing to conservation initiatives in the country,\" he said. \"I think as a Kenyan, that is my little way of contributing to the conservation initiatives. So, yes, there is a fulfillment that comes with that.\"\n\nExperts say Africa contributes minimally to climate change but is bearing the brunt of its consequences. Dr. Philip Muruthi, vice president of the African Wildlife Foundation, told VOA that reproduction of the rare mammals and the survival rate of young ones are dropping.\n\n\"It is very hard to benefit or manage what you don't know,\" he said. \"That is why this is so important. It is going to tell us which species we have, where they are, and maybe which ones are highly endangered, what we need to do about them. And especially not just the big things but also the small things, like the bats.\"\n\nWildlife officials say Kenya is a habitat to at least a third of mammal species in Africa and are hopeful app users will boost efforts to protect them.",

Backstory: In July, Kenya’s Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) got a court order to freeze 56 bank accounts which seven companies had used to launder Ksh 7 billion (~ $59.2 million). Of the seven companies, Flutterwave had about Ksh 6.7 billion frozen in 52 accounts from several banks including Guarantee Trust Bank, EcoBank, and Equity Bank. Later in August, the ARA received another order to freeze more accounts belonging to the fintech. The court froze funds worth Ksh 400.6 million ($3.3 million) across three banks including UBA, Access Bank, and Safaricom M-Pesa. And now? Well, about 2,468 investors say their money is part of the money frozen by the ARA in its pursuit of Flutterwave. Spokesperson Morris Ebitimi Joseph explained to Business Daily that they invested in a company called 86 Football Technology—also known as 86FB, 86Z, or 86W. The investors made deposits for an investment scheme that promised better returns which did not come to fruition. Investigations by the investors led them to believe that they had been swindled to the tune of Ksh 1.44 billion ($11 million) by a dubious person via transactions on Flutterwave. Now, they want Kenyan courts to separate Ksh 1.44 billion out of the frozen Ksh 6.7 billion released to them. “I believe that the issuance of an order compelling Guarantee Trust Bank, Equity Bank and Ecobank to deposit the sums excluded in the bank accounts of our advocates, justice shall be served to the 2,468 interested parties who were swindled of their hard-earned money through the scheme,” Ebitimi said. Zoom out: While the Central Bank of Kenya has accused Flutterwave of operating without a license, the fintech has maintained that it submitted an application for licensing back in 2019, citing the country’s notoriously long licensing process. Meanwhile, the ARA’s freeze order is valid only for 90 days as it gears up for its case against Flutterwave which is set to appear in court in November.\n\n\n\nSEND BY FLUTTERWAVE Don’t just send money, send money fast.

Last week, the DStv parent company announced its acquisition of Namola, an on-demand emergency response app. So, more choices for MultiChoice? Yup. MultiChoice South Africa CEO, Nyiko Shiburi, said “Namola is part of our strategy to expand our ecosystem beyond entertainment and to offer a suite of consumer services that meet the needs of our customers.” Namola describes itself as South Africa’s leading response solution “that allows all citizens get help fast”. On the app, users can get access to the public emergency services in South Africa including the police, fire service, ambulance and other community services. Its premium plan, Namola Plus, even allows users opt-in to receive help in emergency situations where they can’t reach or answer their phones. Namola’s individual plan costs R29 (2$) per month, the couples plan is R59 ($3.30), and the family package is R99 ($5.6) monthly. With MultiChoice’s acquisition, Namola will now be available to all DStv users—at extra cost, of course. From October 26, South African users can add the service to their bill. Big picture: MultiChoice has big plans for its future. Other than its recent acquisition of Namola, it also recently launched an internet service called DStv Internet, and it’s planning to launch its own smart TV called DStv Glass. MultiChoice Group CEO, Calvo Mawela, also announced last week that the company is looking to foray into fintech, although we might not be seeing that for a while.\n\n\n\nBAMBOO EXPANDS INTO GHANA Bamboo, one of Nigeria’s leading online brokerage firms, has expanded into Ghana, making it the first trans-national West African brokerage app. Through a partnership with 10th Capital Investments, a licensed Ghanaian firm, the more-than-50,000 users on Bamboo Ghana’s waitlist will now be able to buy and invest in stocks from US companies like Apple Inc and Tesla. When Bamboo raised a $15 million Series A round in January, its CEO announced that Ghana’s market was the company’s next frontier. Nine months and another $17.4 million raise later, the Ghana plans have become a reality. In a statement shared with TechCabal, Bamboo said it recently received a No Objection Letter from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate in the country, enabling it to launch successfully. “We believe strongly that all Africans should earn a return on their investments and build intergenerational wealth. That’s why we created Bamboo: we wanted to create an easy and secure way for everyday Africans to invest in the US stock market, and eventually, in all types of asset classes,” said Richmond Bassey, Bamboo CEO and co-founder. Since its 2019 launch, Bamboo and other retail investment apps providing access to foreign securities like Chaka, Trove and Rise have had to deal with harsh regulatory conditions in their home country, Nigeria. In April last year, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labelled this category of companies as illegal and warned operators in the capital market to desist from operating with them. This was followed by Nigeria’s central bank describing Bamboo as unlicensed and freezing its bank accounts for a while. Despite the struggles, Bamboo has maintained its resolve to work “very closely with regulators in Nigeria” to ensure mutual satisfaction from both parties. Now in Ghana, Bamboo has committed to working with the country’s SEC on an ongoing basis to develop a standard regulatory framework for the retail investment industry Bamboo is pioneering. Through Bamboo’s US digital investing partner, DriveWealth LLC, the Nigeria-born company assures users that all accounts can claim insurance of up to $500,000 via the US Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). With regulations and insurance in place, Bamboo is ready to make retail investment a norm in Ghana. Albert Asiamah, 10th Capital Investments COO, was effusive about the performance of Bamboo’s product in Nigeria, describing the investment as ideal and beneficial. “We’re thrilled to work with [the Bamboo team] to bring Ghanaians the opportunity to invest in the US and eventually the local stock market. Their impeccable track record in Nigeria, stellar product and educational tools make them an ideal collaborator,” he said. “Together with Bamboo, we’ve been able to provide investors across Africa with affordable access to the US markets. Today, we’re thrilled to extend that same access to the people of Ghana,” said John Shammas, head of technical sales at DriveWealth. “As we continue our international expansion, we look forward to empowering more customers with the tools they need to improve their financial well-being and engage with the markets,” he added.\n\n\n\nSELL MORE WITH PAYSTACK Increase your online sales with a Paystack Storefront – a free, beautiful seller page that helps you bring creative ideas to life. 👉🏾 Learn more at paystack.com/storefront.

In Africa, its importance is extra critical as activities ranging from financial services to social commerce depend on its availability. Yet, internet speeds across many African countries are far below the global average. At 68.9 megabits per second (mbps), South Africa leads the continent in terms of internet speed, though it fell short of the 77.7mbps global average according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. The effects are dire as it restricts young Africans from harnessing more opportunities in the global digital economy where reliable and fast internet remain key. While 3G and 4G internet services are largely available across the continent, they pale in comparison to the speed 5G internet brings. Currently, about 13 nations are testing 5G networks, with over 40 nations yet to lay down a foundation for the creation of 5G spectrums. The impact of the 5G internet is already obvious on the continent. According to Sylwia Kechiche, principal industry analyst, enterprise at Ookla, MTNSouth Africa performed better than its competitors on the continent as a result of the 5G technology. “We can clearly see the impact that 5G has on overall performance as South African operators came first thanks to having 5G networks in place. MTN South Africa was well ahead of the rest of operators, despite facing challenges with load shedding, with a median download speed of 65.95 mbps If we take 5G out of the equation, Safaricom Kenya was the fastest operator among the analyzed operators,” he said. While analysts predict that 5G will add $2.2 trillion to Africa’s economy by 2034, the transition doesn’t seem so smooth. Existing challenges include spectrum regulation clarity, commercial viability, deployment deadlines, and low citizen purchasing power of 5G enabled smartphones and expensive internet. To accelerate adoption of 5G technologies in Africa, African countries must develop clear and comprehensive frameworks for infrastructure deployment, use, regulation, and management. Spectrum pooling should be implemented to optimise the benefits of available spectrum and increase available bandwidths for mobile operators. Furthermore, spectrum trading should be pursued to enable cost-effective and efficient spectrum use to optimise the transfer of spectrum rights to users who require the 5G network spectrum the most, thereby lowering auction spectrum prices.

    "The Kenyan Presidential Election Is Over. The Conversation......": "William Ruto sees the hand of God in Kenya’s presidential election results.\n\n“We have worked hard,” the outgoing deputy president told his supporters after the Supreme Court ruled he won the presidency, defeating five-time challenger Raila Odinga. “But as the Bible teaches us … some trust in chariots, some trust in horses, but we trust in God.”\n\nIn another victory speech, Ruto credited the many pastors who opened their pulpits to him, accepted donations from his campaign, and urged their congregations to pray for his electoral triumph.\n\n“I have been prayed into victory,” Ruto said.\n\nBut as the nation wrestles with the results of the contested election and fallout from the monthlong dispute over the legitimacy of the results, Christians in Kenya are left reflecting on the role believers should have in the fraught political system. Christians make up nearly 90 percent of the population. How should they push for their preferred policies, participate in the political jostle of a campaign, and work to prevent the violence that has too often followed national elections?\n\nFew spoke out against one-party rule\n\nChurch leaders, like the rest of Kenya, are still adjusting to a multiple-party system. The nation achieved independence from Great Britain in 1963. But before the decade was out, all political power had been consolidated into a single party. The second president, Daniel arap Moi, stayed in power for nearly 25 years. He has been praised by some—including Ruto—for providing stability, but also accused of human rights violations and called a dictator.\n\nChristians occasionally criticized Moi during his long presidency, but their voices were generally muted. Most supported Moi, even when they disagreed with particular decisions.\n\n“The president was perceived as a benevolent friend of the church, himself being a committed member of one of the larger mainstream denominations—the African Inland Church,” said Wilson Kiuna, who heads a leadership program at Hesabika Trust, an organization supporting Christians in public service.\n\nA few Christian leaders took strong stands against Moi. That agitation came at a cost, and Christians in Kenya are still divided over what to think about their examples.\n\n“The suppression against these voices was so intense that those who engaged in the fight were few and pronounced,” said George Ogalo, the chief operating officer at International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES). “Church leaders who confronted the government of the day were considered by the majority of Christians as being too political and deviating from their core mission as shepherds of the church.”\n\nSince Moi left office in 2002, Christians have gotten more involved in the day-to-day debates over politics and policy. Many were drawn into political debates by a constitutional referendum in 2005—when two of Kenya’s largest Christian groups focused on different priorities and ended up on opposing sides.\n\nThe next year, a group of evangelical and Protestant leaders came together and launched their own party, the Agano Party, demonstrating that at least some Christians were interested in a new approach to politics in Kenya. Not many, though. In this year’s election, David Mwaure, the Agano candidate, only earned 0.2 percent of the vote. (Another Christian, gospel musician Reuben Kigame, submitted presidential nomination papers but did not make it on the ballot.)\n\nThen in 2007, Odinga lost his second bid for the presidency but claimed the election was unfair. He made allegations of fraud and called for nationwide protests. His aggrieved supporters clashed with police and paramilitary forces, and more than 1,000 people were killed. Four churches were destroyed in the riots—including one in an attack that killed 50 people—but many in Kenya placed the blame on the pastors themselves.\n\nResponsibility for catalyzing violence is disputed, but there’s no question that the crisis hurt the witness of many Kenyan Christians. The churches, at minimum, were unable to overcome ethnic divisions or prevent believers from attacking other believers.\n\n“At first, leaders spoke like there was nothing wrong,” said one church leader in the Nyanza province who asked not to be named for his own safety. “When they should have spoken the truth, they kept silent, and some of them spoke too late.”\n\n“I remember meeting Peter Mwangi, a young man from my neighborhood, whose family was affected by violence,” said William Kiptoo, the peacebuilding coordinator for Mennonite Central Committee in Kenya and Tanzania. “He told me that he was changing his faith because he saw Christians burning other Christians’ homes.”\n\nEthnic divisions trouble church\n\nThe divisions, of course, did not emerge suddenly in the crisis. Abraham Rugo Muriu, who leads International Budget Partnership Kenya’s office, says they can be traced back to Kenya’s colonial history, and the way people were separated and organized against each other to benefit British rule. The effects linger on.\n\n“We don’t trust people who don’t speak our language, do not live in our areas, to speak for us,” he said. “Ethnicity has been quite divisive, because then it means that even when you have people who have fairly good standing, the fact that they don't belong to that ethnic group, or there seem to be ‘others,’ becomes a problem.”\n\nEthnicity also limits who receives presidential consideration in the first place, says Nelson Makanda, the general secretary at the Evangelical Alliance of Kenya (EAK).\n\n“It remains more likely that a presidential candidate from any of the big five communities, Kikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, Luo and Kamba, will be elected president just because of their ethnic identity rather than any other factor,” he said.\n\nGoing into the 2022 election, many church leaders were still concerned about these internal divisions. They have an impact on national politics and limit Christians’ potential influence over the nation.\n\n“The church in Kenya is split along ethnic lines,” Rugo Muriu said. “Faith and church seem to be sacrificed on the altar of ethnicity.”\n\nAs the candidates started campaigning in earnest, though, the pressing question for most churches was whether they would invite the presidential contenders to speak from the pulpit. A number of denominations—reflecting concerns about the past relationship between church and state—felt that having politicians speak in a service was a problem.\n\nAnglicans, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, and some evangelicals banned candidates from their pulpits.\n\n“Christians from traditional denominations espouse more the popular theology of politics as a ‘dirty game,’” said Kiuna, with the Hesabika Trust, “and thus maintain a certain aloofness in matters of public and political engagement.”\n\nOne notable exception was the Methodist Church in Kenya, which decided that congregations could, if they wanted, invite presidential candidates to speak.\n\n“The church is for all people,” said Joseph Ntombura, presiding bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya. “Human beings are political, so there is nothing wrong with inviting the politicians in church.”\n\nQuestions about corruption\n\nMany of the Kenya’s Pentecostal and charismatic churches also welcomed presidential contenders. Odinga visited a convention for the Akorino church, one of the largest of what are called the African Instituted Churches. He sat next to the church president and made a donation.\n\nDespite his coziness with some church leaders, Odinga’s attempts to court conservative Christians didn’t always go well.\n\n“Odinga and his running mate have made some damning statements that have rubbed evangelical Christians the wrong way—such as stating that small churches should be closed, that Christianity’s dominance in Kenya is a colonial legacy that needs to be brought down—and made promises to the Muslims to rectify this,” said Rachel Kitonyo, a Christian lawyer.\n\nRuto did better at reaching out to churches, she said. He repeatedly expressed his support for Christians and donated money to congregations and said his faith shaped his beliefs on homosexuality. He quoted Bible verses and talked about working together with Christian leaders, which resonated especially with Pentecostal Christians.\n\nThe candidates’ efforts to court Christians raised questions, for some Christian leaders, about the ideal relationship between pastors and politicians. Should churches be accepting money from political campaigns? For some, the donations raised the specter of corruption.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Kenyans (68 percent) think at least some religious leaders are corrupt. Kenya ranks 128th out of 180 nations in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.\n\n“It is not a secret that the matrix of money, power, ethnicity, and religion can create more hostility and relegate the values the nation has always aspired for,” said Ogalo.\n\nRuto “has projected himself as a genuine believer only interested in advancing the kingdom of God,” said Lucas Owako, an Anglican priest in Nairobi. “While some have argued that the millions given every week in such fundraisers are obviously proceeds of corruption and should therefore not be accepted in church.”\n\nOwako finds it worrying that in his eyes the Kenyan church often only seems to speak with a collective political voice when it comes to abortion, LGBTQ issues, or religious freedom.\n\n“Christians tend to feel that these issues directly concern them as compared to, say, issues of declining economy, national debt, corruption, or dysfunctional health systems,” he said. “That is why we all stood up to be counted during the campaigns for the 2010 constitution, which we opposed, but are muted, ambivalent or disjointed in confronting the latter issues, which are also real in the country.”\n\nOrganizing against postelection violence\n\nOne common point of consensus on Christian witness going into the 2022 election was that Christians could be—and should be—a voice for peace. Many viewed violence as a top concern and saw a role for Christian leaders. Churches came together and organized with the aim of preventing the riots that happened in 2008 and the violence that marred the 2013 and 2017 elections as well.\n\nIn an attempt to be proactive, several Christian groups organized a church and politics summit in 2021 and later released a Bible study guide based on the event.\n\nThe Association of Evangelicals in Africa’s (AEA) Msafara wa Upendo—a Kiswahili phrase that translates to Caravan of Love—pulled together groups in Garissa, Lamu, Isiolo, and Nairobi counties, all of which have seen conflict in past elections. Pastors and imams were asked to preach about peace inside and outside their houses of worship.\n\nSome ministers affiliated with the AEA also served as election observers accredited by Kenya ’s Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and worked in five different counties.\n\n“Be patriotic enough to accept the outcome,” said the AEA’s general secretary, Master Matlhaope, in a statement released on Election Day. “A peaceful election largely depends on the loser’s maturity and the winner’s magnanimity.”\n\nRuto declared himself the victory shortly after the August 9 election, with about 50.5 percent of the vote. As the challenge from Odinga made its way through the courts, the EAK called for peace and asked its members to pray for guidance for the judges. The organization also posted a hotline on their social media pages asking people to report any incidents.\n\nThese efforts came on the heels of another EAK program which had paired Christian leaders with presidential candidates, asking the former to pray for, encourage, and visit with these leaders.\n\n“To a great success, these are the leaders that eventually became a bridge for/in mediation and peace building initiatives in the post-election season,” said Makanda.\n\nTo some observers, this seemed like an important step in Christians’ view of their political responsibilities in Kenya.\n\n“Christian leaders’ understanding of the nexus between faith and politics is expanding, so many of them are taking their roles seriously as mediators, reconcilers, healers, advisers, and peacemakers,” said MCC’s Kiptoo. “There are many Christian leaders that organized prayer sessions for the country and for candidate and these help the congregants to take their roles seriously.”\n\nThere was little violence in the month of simmering tension as the challenge to the election results went to the Supreme Court. Christians, like their new president, are thanking God for that, as they continue to figure out their role in public life going forward.",
    "#EOF2022: Kenya Bamboo ambassador works for sustainable housing": "A young Kenyan conservationist shares her work with bamboo restoration at the Economy of Francis, where she hopes to find ways to collaborate and create sustainable housing around her country.\n\nBy Francesca Merlo\n\nAttending the Economy of Francesco is Wendy Omanga, who works in environment conservation. As a bamboo ambassador in Kenya, she works in land restoration by replanting bamboo, especially by her country's rivers.\n\nShe notes that most people do not understand the technical knowledge that many environmentalists use, and for this reason the bamboo they plant is used in nature trails which, mainly tourists, undertake. Tourism is relevant in this case also because hotels and lodges are built along the rivers and wetlands in Kenya, and these are the stakeholders that they have chosen to use as their partners in their restoration projects.\n\nIn their search for a sustainable solution for houseing, along with Kenya's Ministry of Housing, Wendy's organisation is bringing a new technology through bamboo, which can be used to produce sustainable housing in Kenya.\n\nThere is a lot of land in Africa, but it is hard to raise capita. The Economy of Francesco opens a channel of collaboration and partnership whislt still having things to offer to Europe through any potential collaborations.",
    "Kenya's Tourism Earnings More Than Double in 2022": "Kenya's tourism income soared from about $689 million in the first eight months of 2021 to over $1.38 billion in the same period this year.\n\nReleasing the country's Tourism Sector Performance Report January - August 2022, the East African nation's tourism minister Najib Balala said revenues had more than doubled from 83 billion Kenyan shillings in that time span in 2021 to 167 billion shillings this year.\n\n\"Lifting of containment measures and travel restrictions as well as enhanced vaccination has boosted tourism recovery,\" Balala said, adding that from January to August 2022, the country had received 924,812 foreign visitors compared to 369,738 in the same period last year -- a year-on-year rise of 91%.\n\nKenya received the most tourists this year from the US, Uganda, UK, Tanzania, India, and Germany, he said, praising his country's improved security environment as a factor in the increase in tourist arrivals.\n\nSince 2013, Kenya's tourism industry has faced turbulence with mass cancellations due to attacks against foreigners by the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab terror group from neighboring Somalia.\n\nMany hotels along the Kenyan coast have closed due to low tourist numbers in previous years.\n\nSource: AA",
    "‘People should be who they are’: Kenyans embrace genderless fashion": "A growing number of Kenyan labels are embracing genderless fashion, as a younger, more vocal generation calls for greater inclusivity and creativity in clothing designs.\n\nIn July, fashion brand Vivo and Bold Network Africa released a vibrant gender-inclusive collection called Zoya X Bold. It is one of a new crop of collaborations showcasing androgynous fashion. Nairobi designer Jamie Bryan Kimani, who launched his brand Sevaria in 2018, exclusively creates genderfluid clothing.\n\nLGBTQ+ activist Chris “Makena Njeri” Muriithi, CEO of Bold Network Africa, which describes itself as a queer storytelling platform, says that fashion needs to be more inclusive. “For the longest time, I had to go to the men’s section to even buy a shirt,” says Muriithi, who is non-binary.\n\nColourful fashion from Bold Network Africa and Vivo. Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\nDressing across genders is common practice in Kenyan comedy, but those who do so outside that sphere face severe backlash.\n\n“I was bullied on social media for how I used to dress just because it did not conform with what society has shown people to be the norm,” says Muriithi.\n\nGuys should be able to rock hot pink and not be questioned about what their sexual preferences are Ashton Laurence\n\nThe Zoya x Bold collection features striking fabrics, colours and prints designed to work with all body types.\n\n“The clothing that’s available on the market assumes a very binary world,” says Wandia Gichuru, CEO of Vivo. Many businesses are hesitant to take a stand on sexual and gender inclusivity for fear of losing custom, she says. But times are changing, she adds, and businesses have room to take more risk.\n\nZoya targets a younger, daring and less apologetic demographic, which Gichuru believes leans more towards inclusivity and self-expression than previous generations. “The younger generation is more values-driven than my generation was,” she says, pointing to the growing interest in locally made and environmentally sustainable products. “Being exclusive or outrightly prejudiced might hurt you in the long run.”\n\nAshton Laurence, 23, who modelled the new line, says traditional binaries stifle creativity. “Growing up, I was very bored seeing how men would dress for red carpets on TV. It would be the same thing – black tux, white shirt – and yet women would have so many different [clothing] expressions.”\n\nChris Muriithi: ‘For the longest time, I had to go to the men’s section to even buy a shirt.’ Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\nKenya’s queer community has been increasingly visible over the past few years, after a number of prominent Kenyans came out publicly. Celebrities such as Willis Chimano of Afropop band Sauti Sol, challenge traditional gender dressing with crop tops, low V-necks, bare backs and bodysuits. Popular lifestyle YouTuber Jayson Wamae also embraces fashion fluidity, dressing in anything from sheer tops and silk jumpsuits to neck scarves.\n\nMuriithi says: “People need to be able to be who they are without having to be afraid.”\n\nBut LGBTQ+ people face systemic discrimination and violence in Kenya, and gender non-conforming people face heightened threats. In April, a 25-year-old non-binary lesbian was murdered in a suspected hate crime. The following month, a 50-year-old intersex person was raped and killed. Figures by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission suggest that these are not isolated incidents.\n\nLaurence faces harassment daily but does not shy away from growing out his hair, wearing eyeliner and mesh vests. It is an ode to his younger self, who he describes as a feminine boy.\n\n“I didn’t see a lot of people like me growing up in Nairobi, so I want to be that person for others,” says Laurence.\n\n“Guys should be able to rock hot pink and not be questioned about what their sexual preferences are,” says Laurence. The Zoya X Bold collection experiments with fabrics often associated with women, such as silk, in its designs. “That kind of visibility in fashion is changing the game,” he says.\n\nAshton Laurence: ‘I didn’t see a lot of people like me growing up in Nairobi.’ Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\n“There is still very little visibility for those people that do not conform to the dominant gender,” says Letoya Johnstone, a transgender fashion icon, who has worked in the industry for nearly a decade. When she started, designers wouldn’t cast her as a model.\n\n“People would ask why I couldn’t just dress like a man,” says Johnstone, who quit a job after a designer tried to force her to do so.\n\nIf there were more genderless fashion lines, Johnstone says the start to her career might have been easier. “I wouldn’t have had to make so much enmity, as I was kicking doors down.”\n\nBut fashion movements can ring a bit hollow for transgender women like Johnstone, who are often targeted and face a high risk of violence regardless of what they wear.\n\n“Genderless fashion is not always put in the context of other people who are not cisgender,” says Johnstone, who has been attacked for the way she dresses. “It is easier for a woman to dress like a man, but would be much harder for a transgender woman,” she says. “The police don’t know about gender fluidity in fashion.”\n\nGlobally, such lines have been criticised for failing to accommodate trans people in their fit and function.\n\nKenya’s new president William Ruto recently termed LGBTQ+ issues a non-issue, giving a nod to similar sentiments by his predecessor, president Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\n“We are making some progress but still have some way to go,” says Johnstone.\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks",

    "Athletics Kenya, Senegalese Athletics Federation and CAA join efforts for climate action": "As the world prepares for November's COP27 in Egypt, Athletics Kenya has been advocating for increased transboundary cooperation for climate action. Working with athletes who have become climate action ambassadors, the governing body continues to seize strategic opportunities to spread the message.\n\nSince August 2021 when it signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Athletics Kenya in cooperation with the Stockholm Environment Institute and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has installed four air quality sensors in the Kasarani Stadium, Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi National Park and Nakuru Athletics Club, with more to come.\n\nAthletics Kenya President Jackson Tuwei recently travelled to Dakar, Senegal, with Kenya’s 1992 Olympic 800m gold medallist William Tanui and Maxwell Nyamu, sustainability and communications officer. There they marked the third International Day of Clean Air for blue skies and participated in the 18th Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), organised by the UNEP Regional Office for Africa and the Government of Senegal under the theme 'Securing people's well-being and ensuring environmental sustainability in Africa'.\n\n“Athletes need a good environment and clean air to train optimally and to enable them to give good performances in competitions,” said Tanui.\n\nHis local counterpart, 1988 Olympic 400m hurdles silver medallist Amadou Dia Ba, who serves as director of the African Athletics Development Centre, said: “I am ready to work with Athletics Kenya on climate action.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSenegal’s Amadou Dia Ba and Kenya’s William Tanui in Dakar (© Athletics Kenya)\n\nAir quality sensor installed at venue of 2026 Youth Olympic Games\n\nThe week-long activities demonstrated cooperation between Athletics Kenya, the Senegalese Athletics Federation and the African Athletics Confederation. On the eve of the AMCEN meeting, an air quality device was installed at Diamniadio Stadium in Dakar, venue of the 2026 Youth Olympic Games. That was followed by a symbolic tree planting ceremony attended by dignitaries and schoolchildren.\n\n“A clean environment is important around stadiums,” said Senegalese Athletics Federation President Sara Oualy. “We will work to inspire athletes by connecting them with African athletes who are leading, like William Tanui. We are happy and will work for fruitful collaboration between Senegal Athletics and Athletics Kenya.”\n\nEach year, Africa records more than one million premature deaths associated with air pollution - indoors and outdoors. In fact, the continent faces a double burden of worsening air quality and climate vulnerability, which need to be addressed together.\n\n37 measures for Africa identified\n\nA report presented at the AMCEN conference, Integrated Assessment of Air Pollution and Climate Change for Sustainable Development in Africa, was prepared by the African Union Commission, the UNEP Regional Office for Africa, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and the Stockholm Environment Institute. It has identified 37 measures that, if implemented, provide a tailored package of solutions for achieving clean air while also enabling African countries to meet climate obligations contained in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The report states that most measures are already being implemented in parts of Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Nzuve, Ngongang Wandji Danube Kirt, Maxwell Nyamu, Aminata Mbow Diokhane, Baba Drame and Issa Mboup at Diamniadio Stadium (© Athletics Kenya)\n\nIn 2022, for example, 19 African countries have established Ambient Air Quality Standards and another 17 have developed or are in the process of developing national action plans to reduce emission of short-lived climate pollutants. In addition, regional framework agreements for air pollution are in place for eastern, southern, west and central African regions. The Assessment concludes that it will take “integrated approaches” and proposes “the establishment of an Africa Clean Air Programme as a continent-wide platform for partnership to facilitate data collection and action at national, regional and continental levels.”\n\n“It is very important to develop this partnership between Athletics Kenya and Senegal Athletics because Senegal is preparing for a very important event – the Youth Olympics in 2026,” emphasised Cheikh Fofana, Deputy Director of Environment in the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Government of Senegal.\n\nA press conference on the topic ‘Connecting sports to Climate and Air Quality in Africa’ was held alongside the AMCEN meeting. The objectives of the conference were to:\n\nPresent and share the status of air quality and climate change in Senegal and the implications for sports,\n\nHighlight the actions by sports organisations and federations to address air quality and climate action, including examples from Kenya and Senegal, and wider actions across Africa,\n\nGive a platform for leading athletes and sportspeople from Senegal and Kenya to share their experiences on implications of climate and air pollution on sports, and the role of athletes in raising awareness about these challenges.\n\n“We look forward to sharing the experiences and pathway on Sports for Climate Action with Athletics Senegal and for consideration by other sister federations in Africa through the Confederation of African Athletics,” said President Tuwei. “We hope the African Union will assist us in championing this important venture.”\n\nLooking to the future, he noted: “We will be seeking to work with the Confederation of African Athletics and our partners (UNEP and Stockholm Environment Institute) in enhancing and scaling up the training to other federations on Sports for Climate Action.”\n\nCAA for environment and climate action\n\nRepresenting the CAA, Director General Lamine Faty said: “Sport is one of the good ways to communicate environment protection and climate change. Air quality is important for athletes and more awareness activities will be organised with the expert knowledge of Athletics Kenya.”\n\nWith these key bodies united for climate action, the week’s activities were an important milestone for athletics and the environment in the African continent that will soon be hosting COP27.\n\nAlice Annibali for World Athletics\n\n\n\n",
