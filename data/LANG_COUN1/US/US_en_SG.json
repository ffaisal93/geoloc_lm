    "Singapore's Temasek leads a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup": "In just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Ina Fassbender | Afp | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — Singapore state investment firm Temasek is leading a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup despite a dry spell of deals in the country. The startup, Well-Link Technologies, counts Chinese tech company Xiaomi and Chinese gaming star miHoYo as investors, according to business database Tianyancha. The $40 million deal announced Monday is an early-stage, or B2 round, led by Temasek and includes existing shareholders Future Capital and CDH Venture and Growth Capital. Temasek confirmed the deal in an email. The Singapore firm's publicly disclosed exposure to China has declined over the last two years, from 29% in 2020 to 22% as of this March. As of last week, Temasek had only participated in eight China financing deals, down from 41 last year, according to Dealogic.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Cloud rendering uses multiple servers on the cloud, rather than a single computer, to make the computations necessary for creating images such as animations and movies. Cloud gaming requires fast processing speed since it relies on remote servers and an internet connection to offer people a smooth gaming experience with just a small file download. For example, the cloud version of Genshin Impact is just 78.5 megabytes on Apple's App Store in China, versus the exponentially larger 3.7 gigabytes for the non-cloud version.\n\nSoaring revenue\n\nWell-Link claims its revenue for each of the last two years has grown by a whopping 400% or more, putting the company on track for revenue of several hundred million yuan — the equivalent of tens of millions of U.S. dollars. CEO Guo Jianjun told reporters the valuation that Temasek offered wasn't the highest one the startup received. But he said the latest financing round is part of the company's plans to expand its business overseas. It was difficult to raise funds during the pandemic, and the startup still has a lot of money, Guo said. But he added that he's confident in Well-Link's future development and wants to stick to its fundraising plan. One of Well-Link's next steps is encouraging more developers to create games that originate in the cloud. The company is also exploring how its real-time cloud rendering tech can help with the development of virtual reality and other technologies of the future.",
    "Singapore Seeks To Transform Industries As World Enters New Era Of Global Trade: DPM Lawrence Wong": "Singapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong speaking at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in ... [+] Singapore. Forbes Asia\n\nSingapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state is constantly reinventing itself to remain relevant as the world enters a new era of global trade.\n\n“We do not take things for granted,” Wong, who is also the country’s finance minister, said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore. “We are always paranoid that somebody else will take our lunch.” Wong made his remarks during a key note address at the event.\n\nWong said the government is pushing ahead to expand the capacity of its airport and seaport to accommodate increasing trade flows, while at the same time encouraging the adoption of digital technologies in the finance industry to bolster the country’s position as an Asian financial hub.\n\nEarlier this year, Singapore said it’s forging ahead with a S$20 billion ($14 billion) project to build the world’s biggest port by 2040. At the same time, it plans to build a fifth passenger terminal at Changi Airport that will be mostly automated and capable of handling an additional 50 million travelers a year. “We want to make sure that capacity is in place to meet increased demand,” he said.\n\nThe investments will help Singapore retain its key position as a reliable and trusted node in the global supply chain, Wong said. “We are entering a new era of global order,” Wong said. “There are tremendous uncertainties all around us.”\n\nApart from the disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic and deteriorating relations between China and the U.S., the world has been grappling with surging inflation and rising interest rates. “Geopolitics will drive trade and investment,” Wong said. “It will lead us to a more dangerous and fragmented world.”\n\nWong—who is largely anticipated to become Singapore’s next prime minister to replace Lee Hsien Loong—said no decision has been made as to when the transition will happen. He stressed that the government is focused first on addressing rising inflation and cushioning the impact of the potential economic slowdown next year.“We will do it when we’re ready,” he said.",

    "Why a good night's sleep is not just a Singapore GP issue": "Listen to this article\n\nSince the first night race back in 2008, F1 folk have grown used to adjusting to the schedule by staying up until dawn and sleeping until the early afternoon in an attempt to stay on European time. Against the backdrop of the inevitable jet lag on arrival, it's never an easy thing to manage.\n\nThe reality is that while good sleep becomes a topic of paddock conversation around the Singapore GP, it makes a crucial contribution to mental and physical fitness at any time. For F1 drivers and team members facing a hectic calendar with more night events and more travel, it's becoming an increasingly important issue.\n\nThat's why teams are now looking at ways of improving the quality of sleep of drivers and crew members.\n\n\"Sleep is the foundation of everything else that we try to do in terms of well-being,\" says Mercedes team physician Dr Luke Bennett.\n\n\"You can train hard, you can train well, you can eat right, you can do all of those things properly. But if you're not sleeping well, then you're not going to get the impact that you need.\n\n\"And that goes as much for the race team members as it does for the drivers or any other athlete.\"\n\nFormerly a trauma specialist in Australia, Bennett volunteered at grands prix in Melbourne and Korea before joining Hintsa Performance, the organisation whose physios work with many drivers and teams across at the grid.\n\nOver the past decade, he's played an important, if largely unheralded role in helping Mercedes to achieve so much success.\n\nMechanics in the garage with George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images\n\n\"In our sport, where the technology is such a focus, I think human performance and well-being is genuinely valued by the teams,\" says Bennett. \"But it can often slip as a priority.\n\n\"The budget cap has changed that. And there's a real emphasis now on extracting the maximum from the human beings who travel the planet, operating this race team.\n\n\"And that's gained even further urgency with a calendar like the one that we're going to have next year, where the number of races is increasing. And the geographical complexity of the calendar makes something like sleep just an absolutely key part of the performance of not just the drivers, but the whole race team.\"\n\nKeeping drivers mentally fit over a gruelling grand prix weekend is a top priority for the people around them, notably their physios.\n\n\"I think most people appreciate that driving that car for up to two hours is an extraordinarily physical experience,\" says Bennett.\n\n\"But across the race weekend, there's also a huge cognitive demand for a driver. That steering wheel has 20 to 30 buttons and menus and sub-menus, which they're navigating sometimes even from corner to corner.\n\n\"The drivers sit through something like seven hours of engineering meetings across a race weekend, and then other countless hours of marketing and media duties, as well as the travel.\n\n\"You can quickly understand why sleep is not just a very important part of making sure that their physical preparation is consolidated. But it's also about making sure that they can still hit that apex millimetre to millimetre lap after lap on a Sunday afternoon when they've been through an extraordinarily demanding weekend even up to that point.\"\n\nWhen it first arrived on the schedule Singapore presented some special challenges for team doctors and physios. Over the years they have learned how to keep the drivers in tip-top condition.\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF90, and Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W10, lead the field away at the start Photo by: Joe Portlock / Motorsport Images\n\n\"There's some very unique sleep and physiological stresses about that event,\" says Bennett. \"It's notionally conducted on European time, but we have all of this incredibly bright artificial lighting. We have mid-afternoon wake-ups, we have a couple of finishes after sunrise. So it's not as simple as staying on European time.\n\n\"It's an incredibly disruptive week for sleep. We then have a one-day turnaround and a flight to Japan, where we go immediately onto a day schedule. It's easily the most brutal back-to-back that we see on the calendar.\n\n\"And in previous years I guess it's fair to say it's been a survival exercise for most people. We now have ways to not necessarily optimise but to manage this stress at a time of the season where championships are often being decided.\n\n\"It starts ideally with preparation before travel. Looking at the daily schedule, you want the driver to maybe shift a couple of hours, and they can do that effectively in the few days before they travel.\n\n\"You want to select the flight appropriately, depending on what time of day they want to arrive and what their commitments will be. I've heard it said that you can drill down to selecting which side of the aircraft you sit on, in terms of light exposure through different parts of the aircraft.\n\n\"We'll then be talking about precisely when to be exposed to light, when to maximise light exposure, when to seek darkness or a heavily shaded room, when to wear sunglasses in the later part of the day, Melatonin supplements, and then timing of exercise and meals. All those variables go into the mix of a really good jet lag plan.\"\n\nAt the heart of it all is getting some decent sleep when the driver finally gets back to his hotel room.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"Sleep has probably had a popular renaissance over the last few years,\" says Bennett. \"I think there's an appreciation that it's not just the part of your day that gives way to all other activities. It's so important for consolidating all of the other important physiology that you have.\n\n\"But it's not just sleep. As a broad concept, I think everybody understands how important that is. But I would say even over the last year the physiology of temperature around sleep is really becoming recognised as probably as important as things like light and dark manipulation, which were traditionally considered to be the most important variables around sleep.\n\n\"The physiology about how temperature affects the depth of your sleep, phases of your sleep, the healthy phases of REM and deep sleep, and then how that affects your performance, both physically and mentally the following day. It's all logged pretty closely to temperature, and I think it's a pretty exciting field.\"\n\nThis year Mercedes has taken an interesting step in exploring the subject further by partnering with Eight Sleep, a company whose products focus on how temperature impacts sleep, and how it can be used to improve it.\n\nThe Eight Sleep \"pod\" comes in two forms, either as a complete mattress or as a mattress cover that can also potentially be transported. It works in conjunction with box that sits next to the bed, and a phone app.\n\n\"It's essentially a sensor layer, a mattress pad that you can install onto any mattress,\" says Eight Sleep co-founder Matteo Franceschetti.\n\n\"It will do a couple of different things. First of all, it's like sleeping on a stethoscope. There are sensors embedded that you don't feel that are able to track everything about your heart rate, your respiration and your sleep quality.\n\n\"And we are reaching medical grade accuracy in a couple of these dimensions, meaning that your bed is comparable to a medical grade device.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"But the key difference between us and a wearable is that the wearable tracks the data and reports the data to you. But it doesn't do much more than that. In our case, we use the data to then adjust the temperature and control your body temperature.\"\n\nThat's the key to how the Eight Sleep pod improves your sleep, as Franceschetti notes: \"The bottom line is each side of the bed can have a different temperature, and the temperature will change during the night to optimise your recovery.\n\n\"We didn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that there is already plenty of medical evidence that temperature at night can improve your sleep performance and your body temperature changes. When you hear people saying, 'You should sleep at 68degF (20degC) the whole night,' that is wrong.\n\n\"And the reason is 68degF could work for one hour out of the eight hours. But for the other seven hours, you need a different temperature. And that is what our device does.\"\n\nFranceschetti stresses that the idea is to promote what the company calls sleep fitness.\n\n\"Everything started at first from a certain vision that we had internally,\" he says. \"Most of the time when you think of bedding companies you think about comfort and cosiness. Our approach has always been different, because I used to be an athlete.\n\n\"And I always thought of sleep not just as relaxation, but also recovery. And that is how we came up with this concept of sleep fitness, which means you need to put the work in, you need to put the effort and the hours in when you go to bed, as you will do in the gym. But then you wake up fully refreshed, energised and healthier.\"\n\nSo what are the tangible benefits of better sleep for an athlete like a racing driver, or indeed for anybody else?\n\n\"There are some ways that are more obvious,\" says Franceschetti. \"Like reaction time, mental clarity, cognitive performance and focus, which are pretty obvious.\n\n\"But then there are also I would say almost second order effects that are effects on your own health. So lower heart rate and higher HRV [heart race variability], which is another proxy for physical stress and recovery, overall better health. By being more energised, you will likely eat better and avoid junk food, probably you will be in a better mood.\n\n\"At the end of the day health is based on three pillars, one is sleep, one is nutrition, and one is fitness. But sleep is really the foundational part because if you sleep two hours per night for five nights in a row, I can tell you, you will eat very shitty food, and you will not be able to train!\n\nScenic view Photo by: Lionel Ng / Motorsport Images\n\n\"Other second-order effects are injuries. By recovering properly and sleeping properly, you will avoid injuries, which for athletes is a major factor.\"\n\nThe Mercedes drivers and key team members have been using Eight Sleep products in their homes this season, providing useful benefits before and after travel to races.\n\nThe next step is to have the portable mattress cover version transported around and installed in hotel rooms at each event, to ensure that those benefits fully carry over to race weekends.\n\n\"We are talking to one of the drivers to see if we can have the pod installed in his hotel in all the remaining races of the season,\" says Franceschetti. \"For sure, some races will be really easy, and a no-brainer to make it happen. Some others may be harder.\n\n\"But the idea is over time as the relationship between Eight Sleep and Mercedes develops is how can we expand this programme and make sure that the drivers and all the engineers have it in every single race of the year?\"\n\nIn a sport where marginal gains count, Mercedes may have found a useful extra edge over rivals.\n\n\"When we say we can improve your sleep quality by 30%, imagine if I could tell you I can improve your strength by 30%,\" says Franceschetti. \"If you use the same framework for energy, clarity, reaction time, then everything being improved by 30% is a big deal.\"",

    "In a Complete Reversal, Singapore Foundation Apologizes for Seeking Court Order to Block KAWS Exhibition": "Ending a months-long legal battle, the Ryan Foundation in Singapore, which threatened to shut down a traveling public art show by KAWS in the Asian city state, has apologized for the “embarrassment and/or distress” inflicted on the exhibition’s organizers, Hong Kong agency AllRightsReserved (ARR), as part of an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThe drama started last November, when the foundation’s directors—Ryan Su, a lawyer and art collector in Singapore, and Adrian Chan—obtained an interim injunction against ARR to block “KAWS: Holiday Singapore,” from opening at The Float at Marina Bay. The wildly popular free show featured a 140-foot inflatable Companion sculpture by the famed Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, also known as KAWS.\n\nThe non-profit claimed it was involved in the initial planning for the show, and accusing ARR of breaching its intellectual property rights and misusing confidential information. In addition to stopping the exhibition, the injunction also hit pause on the sale and distribution of related merchandise, as well as promotional activities.\n\nBut now, in a letter obtained by Artnet News, Su and Chan now say the allegations they made against ARR, including the misuse of confidential information and copyright infringement, were incorrect.\n\n“ARR had the right to organize and conduct the Exhibition in Singapore,” the statement read. “We apologise for any embarrassment and/or distress that the Allegations have caused to ARR and its officers.”\n\nThe apology comes months after the courts sided with ARR, which has been organizing the “Holiday” world tour since 2018 in Seoul. Two days after issuing the injunction, the court reversed it after hearing arguments from ARR’s legal team, and the show was back on track on November 15. The court also ordered the Ryan Foundation to pay the Hong Kong agency’s legal costs.\n\nBut the foundation did not back down, vowing to proceed with a full trial. The legal disputes between the Ryan Foundation and ARR continued to escalate, with ARR countersuing the foundation and its directors for defamation. A settlement was finally reached during a mediation that took place on September 21—exactly 10 months after the Singapore exhibition concluded. As part of the deal, ARR has dropped its defamation charges against the foundation.\n\n“We would like to thank our long-time collaborator, acclaimed contemporary artist KAWS, partners and friends who have remained steadfast in their support of us throughout,” ARR said in a statement. “We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and colossal support for the Exhibition from the most affectionate Singaporeans. We hope to return to the city and meet you all very soon.”\n\nBeyond the public apology, no further details, including whether the Ryan Foundation will still have to pay ARR’s legal costs, have been disclosed.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:",
    "Singapore warns of U.S.-China ‘escalatory spiral’": "A continued lack of strategic trust between the US and China could create an “escalatory spiral” that leads to a potential mishap between the two nations at a time when tensions are flaring over Taiwan, according to Singapore’s foreign minister.\n\n“The key missing ingredient in this relationship, from the perspective of a dispassionate third country, is that there is a lack of strategic trust between the United States and China,” Vivian Balakrishnan said Friday in New York at an event hosted by the Asia Society, according to prepared remarks. “I think the ultimate focal point for this is the Taiwan Straits, which is the reddest of red lines for Beijing.”Singapore warns of U.S.-China ‘escalatory spiral’ amid ‘lack of strategic trust’\n\nBalakrishnan said he’s observed on four separate trips to China in the past year that “attitudes have become more assertive” there, with a strong and growing nationalism and more “muscular” actions to defend international interests.\n\n“As China’s strategic and economic influence has grown, so has their sense of vulnerability,” given that Communist regimes must respond to “the anxieties and the zeitgeist of their own societies,” he said.\n\nOther highlights from Balakrishnan’s speech:",
    "Shifting financial centres sees Singapore overtake Hong Kong": "Hong Kong’s long-standing reign as the world’s third most important city for global finance, and Asia’s top financial hub, is over – for now.\n\nThe city has handed its financial centre crown to Singapore, which finally overtakes it to become Asia’s top financial hub and the third worldwide.\n\nSingapore moved up three places to third place in the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) of the world’s leading international financial centres, behind New York and London, while Hong Kong slipped to fourth place.\n\nHong Kong battered by strict Covid-19 restrictions\n\nThis comes as Hong Kong struggles to revive its role as a global finance centre, following a ‘zero Covid’ policy the city has had in place for more than two years, requiring visitors to spend as much as 21 days in a hotel or quarantine facility upon arrival.\n\nThese measures have weighed on the city’s economy over the last year, with the city seeing an exodus of top financial talent to Singapore with the Lion City reaping the benefits.\n\nAccording to the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao, around 10% of EU citizens living in Hong Kong have left the city, and rising numbers of employees have asked to be relocated. Citigroup quietly moved a half a dozen equities bankers to Singapore and other markets, while a similar number of MDs at JPMorgan also left earlier this year.\n\nIn August, the city’s government revised downward its growth forecast for the economy to -0.5% to 0.5%, citing worse-than-expected economic performance in the first half.\n\nA similar fate has befallen Japan, whose Covid-19 measures have been similarly restrictive with Tokyo plunging by seven spots in the latest GFCI rankings to 16th place.\n\n“Continuing travel restrictions in places like Hong Kong and Tokyo affect their ability to conduct normal levels of business,” the report’s authors said.\n\nThat said, the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen all maintain spots in the GFCI’s top 10, despite equally crippling Covid-19 mitigation measures that have almost cut off China from the rest of the world.",
    "Why the Singapore Grand Prix is so extreme for F1 drivers": "After a COVID-19 forced hiatus, Formula 1 finally returns to the streets of Marina Bay this weekend for the Singapore Grand Prix. F1's original night race, Singapore has firmly become a fan and driver favourite, snaking through the city and under motorways as locals continue on with their daily lives. It has created some memorable moments down the years, from the inaugural race in 2008 - the 800th World Championship event - to the famous start line collision in 2017 between Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen. However, the Singapore Grand Prix is also famous as one of the toughest events of the entire season, with drivers modifying their training regimen to adapt to the unique demands of the track. But why is Singapore so demanding?\n\nHumidity the main factor Logic would dictate that a night race is cooler as the Sun is not up - but Singapore is about 85 miles from the equator, meaning humidity is high. In September, when the race is usually run (it is on October 2nd this year), humidity in the day is about 96%. That's ok for teams and drivers as they stay on European time, meaning they are asleep during the daylight hours, with Singapore seven hours ahead of Great Britain. At night, when all the sessions are run, humidity falls slightly to 80% or so. Throw in the air temperature, and being surrounded by multiple levels of fireproof Nomex, in a confined space with all sorts of electrical gubbins behind you, and it can get rather toasty in the cockpit, with temperatures rising to around 60 degrees Celsius.\n\n© XPBimages\n\nThe very nature of the race At 3.146 miles, Marina Bay is quite a long track, with 23 corners from start to finish. However, the longest straight is just 800m long down Raffles Boulevard - the run from Turns 5-7 - meaning there is little time for the drivers to rest on the straights. The Turn 7 left-hander at the end of Raffles is also the prime overtaking spot on the circuit, meaning a driver has to be careful not to be mugged on the brakes. At 61 laps, the race often passes close to the two-hour time limit for Grands Prix, meaning drivers know they are in for the long haul. In 2013, the famous 'Singapore Sling' chicane was removed, thus making the track faster through its replacement - a fast left-hander.\n\nViewed by others: Interview Jacques Villeneuve Villeneuve aiming for NASCAR but still hopes for legendary record\n\nWhat the drivers say Mercedes released a video of George Russell preparing for his second race in Singapore, showing the British driver cycling in sweat catching gear, looking rather tired. Pierre Gasly spoke about his \"love\" for the \"extreme conditions\" found in Singapore - which is unique now on the F1 calendar after Malaysia fell away in 2017. However, drivers are fearful of the physical battering they are going to take over the bumps, especially with the new breed of car. \"It's going to be very bumpy, and a big challenge for us. [It will be] very physical,\" said Esteban Ocon. \"I love Singapore, but the track itself is not my favourite, I have to say.\"",
    "Opinion | I Have Worked, Played and Loved in Other Countries Because I Can’t at Home": "The idea of reducing that children’s book and its gentle cartoon penguins to pulp felt deeply personal, a reminder of how vulnerable we are to the cruel impulses of our fellow citizens.\n\nSingapore wasn’t always so suffocating.\n\nThe city’s Bugis Street nightlife district was notorious in the 1950s and 1960s for the foreign visitors who cavorted with transgender prostitutes and attended bawdy cabarets. Most other expressions of queer desire were relegated to dark alleys and toilets, but law enforcement largely left people alone.\n\nBut in the 1980s and 1990s, the state began actively policing homosexuality. Police lured gay men with handsome undercover officers and arrested them. Twelve men were arrested in a raid in 1993 and sentenced to jail time and strokes by the rattan cane.\n\nThis has stopped, but that virulent homophobia lingers in our psyche. In the mid-2000s, I was active on a gay forum called SGBOY, where teenagers like me would flirt and gossip. One day, a private message from a stranger in his 40s warned me: “Be careful. It’s not safe to be so ‘out.’”\n\nThat seemed melodramatic. Only much later, when I learned about previous police raids, did I understand his message of care and wisdom. I often think about this man. Had he only ever known desire in the context of shame and danger? Had he lost friends, seen lovers brutalized?\n\nSingapore queers today are heirs to his shame, especially those who still hide their faces on apps, who don’t meet my eyes when we hook up for sex. Many couples are still anxious about public displays of affection even after years of being together.",
    "Google wants to help Singapore firms tap data, AI responsibly": "Google wants to provide Singapore organisations with the cloud tools and skills they need to tap data for greater efficiencies and better service delivery. It also hopes to help them leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and to do so responsibly, based on its own set of best practices and principles.\n\nWith organisations worldwide digitally transforming their business, including those in Singapore and Malaysia, the US cloud vendor is keen to figure out how its technology and infrastructure can facilitate their efforts.\n\nData, specifically, will prove critical in enabling companies to tap new opportunities in a digital economy, said Google Cloud's Singapore and Malaysia country director, Sherie Ng, in an interview with ZDNET.\n\nShe said businesses would need to figure out how to leverage data to better understand and serve customers as well as to reduce inefficiencies and improve work processes. The ability to generate insights from the right data also would be essential for companies to not only birth new businesses and products and services, but also identify ways to measure and reduce their energy consumption and costs, Ng said.\n\nThis meant building digital infrastructures that were global in scale and able to support real-time access to data, she noted. She added that organisations in some markets such as Singapore now were looking to gain more value from their cloud adoption as they moved up the model.\n\n\"They're interested not just in moving workloads to the cloud. We're seeing customers that want to be truly cloud-native,\" she said. These organisations were building their DevOps teams and deploying cloud-native technologies, such as containers and Kubernetes, Ng added.\n\nIn doing so, however, they faced challenges in finding the right talent and skillsets to help them transform into cloud-native environments, she said. This was an area Google hoped to address through schemes such as the Skills Ignition SG training programme, which was introduced in 2020, and developer hubs for startups, she noted.\n\nGoogle also aimed to offer the technology that could establish the transparency businesses needed, for instance, in measuring their carbon footprint, she said, adding that an organisation's entire ecosystem should be sustainable, including its core infrastructure and supply chain.\n\nNg, who took on her current role in December 2021 from Microsoft where she was public sector general manager, said her top priority for the next couple of years was to enable companies in the two Asian markets to transform not just digitally, but also to do so on a green and sustainable foundation.\n\nIn Singapore, this encompassed working with the government on AI research and competency building, where Google would offer training resources and certification schemes to build proficiencies in AI and machine learning amongst local public-sector officers.\n\nIn addition, the cloud vendor would support the government's initiatives in driving AI governance and ethics in sectors such as finance. Google had contributed to Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework and self-assessment guide for businesses, and sat on the country's Advisory Council of the Ethical Use of AI.\n\nNg noted that AI was an important technology, but needed effective regulation to ensure it was used for good. Echoing the Singapore government's call for \"guard rails\", she said these were necessary to instil responsible use of AI.\n\n\"And there will be conversations about what works for Singapore as a country...every country will have its nuances,\" she said, adding that Google was keen to share its own AI best practices and principles that it had adopted globally. Data that it uses, for instance, must be inclusive to mitigate the risk of bias. Humans also are involved in final decisions to establish accountability.\n\nGoogle itself had to deal with some controversy involving its ethical AI unit, when it fired a team member last year due to--the company said--violations of its code of conduct and security policies. Reports suggested the move was related to another researcher's departure over her criticism Google was \"silencing marginalised voices\" and she had co-authored a research paper urging tech giants to ensure AI language systems did not promote gender bias.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE",
    "Singapore strives to remain relevant amid regulatory tightening for retail investors": "Singapore's largest bank, DBS, has announced another move to expand its crypto services while remaining cautious in complying with the financial authorities' view that crypto assets are not suitable for retail investors in the country.\n\nOn Friday, the bank disclosed its decision to expand crypto trading services on its digital exchange (DDEx) to approximately 100,000 \"wealth clients who are accredited investors.\" Investors who are considered accredited must meet certain criteria regarding their income, net worth, qualifications and understanding of financial markets.\n\nCaroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis, noted:\n\n\"Singapore has long indicated that it views most crypto assets as volatile and as a result, not well-suited to retail investors. At the same time though, it continues to indicate its support for DLT-based innovation, such as in the area of asset tokenization.\"\n\nPreviously, the DDEx was only available to corporate and institutional investors, family offices and DBS Private Bank and Treasures Private Client customers. DBS is also a trust anchor for the pilot Project Guardian in Singapore, a blockchain-based liquidity pool of tokenized bonds and deposits for borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nThe move comes after dramatic months for the crypto space in the country that was once ranked as the most crypto-friendly in the world due to its positive legislative environment. In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)’s chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, said in an interview that “if somebody has done a bad thing [in the cryptocurrency industry], we are brutal and unrelentingly hard.”\n\nAnother chapter in the regulatory tightening came weeks later, as the authority sent detailed questionnaires to some applicants and holders of the MAS’ Digital Payment Token licenses, reportedly seeking “highly granular information” about business activities. The questions included top tokens owned and staked via DeFi protocols and aimed to intensify the spotlight on crypto firms amid upcoming regulations.\n\nThe new framework responds to issues with liquidity and withdrawals that have occurred with firms in the country this year. During this crypto winter, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) went bankrupt after failing to meet margin calls in mid-June.\n\n\"After recent events, from the Terra-Luna crash, to 3AC, and also the Hodlnaut exchange collapse, I expect we will see more such measures, aimed at further protecting consumers in the crypto asset market, in the future.\"\n\nThe updated regulatory approach does not seem sufficient to keep crypto firms out of the country. RRMine Global, a Filecoin service provider, recently announced that it has shut down business operations in mainland China and is relocating its headquarters to Singapore after Chinese restrictions narrowed operations for Web3 companies.\n\nNext week, Singapore will host Token2049, an industry conference that was held in Hong Kong before the pandemic. The event is expected to receive over 5,000 attendees, according to its organization.",

It was the first football match between the two sides in 10 years.\n\nBoth teams enjoyed equal possession in the opening 15 minutes without any meaningful openings.\n\nIndia, ranked 104 in world football, was quicker on the flanks, but world No. 159 Singapore occasionally relied on aerial balls to pierce the Indian defence.\n\nIndia began to look more threatening as the match progressed, earning back-to-back corners in the 31st minute. However, both the chances were snuffed out by the resilient Singaporean backline.\n\nSingapore won a free-kick just outside the box following a clumsy challenge by India's Ashique Kuruniyan in the 37th minute.\n\nThe powerful strike from Singapore forward Ikshan Fandi took a heavy deflection from India's three-member wall, eventually beating goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to give Singapore a 1-0 lead.\n\nIndia responded with three minutes to play in the first half through Ashique Kuruniyan's clinical low shot from inside the box. The assist came from Indian captain Sunil Chhetri, who beat two Singapore defenders to provide Kuruniyan with a perfect pass.\n\nThere was nothing to separate the two sides in terms of possession at the end of the first half. India, however, had more shots on target compared to Singapore.\n\nIndia began the second half well but Singapore goalkeeper Hassan Sunny pulled off two crucial saves in the first five minutes.\n\nSunil Chhetri too stepped up with a header from the corner but Sunny was at the right spot to keep Singapore in the game.\n\nSingapore made a double change in the 59th minute but Indian attacks kept on coming.\n\nIndia squandered multiple chances in the remainder of the second half to go 2-1 up.\n\nRoshan failed to convert Liston Colaco’s short free-kick pass into a goal in the 65th minute.\n\nTen minutes later, Liston Colaco’s powerful shot from the left aimed at the Singapore goal-keeper’s near-post missed the target by inches.\n\nForward Ishan Pandita, who replaced Sunil Chhetri, too couldn’t find the net from the centre of the box in the 86th minute.\n\nThis was India’s first international match since winning matches against Cambodia, Afghanistan and Hong Kong at the AFC Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers back in June. Singapore, meanwhile, came into the match losing 4-0 to Vietnam on Wednesday.\n\nIndia next play Vietnam at the same venue on Tuesday.",

    "Williams F1 decision on Nyck De Vries Singapore drive | thejudge13": "The Williams Formula One team have provisionally decided to give Nyck de Vries a second F1 drive in Singapore. In the period since Alex Albon posted his twitter update 10 days ago revealing he was taking his first steps after his appendectomy, the team Albon and De Vries have been silent over whether the British-Thai driver will be fit enough to drive in Singapore this weekend.\n\nThe Singapore circuit is one of the most physical tests the F1 drivers face each season as Albon revealed in his tweet.\n\n“The goal is to be ready for Singapore, which is going to be tough.”\n\n“Its one of the toughest races that we go to. Its not an easy one but lets aim high and see what happens.”\n\nThe physicality the drivers face this year at the Asian circuit will be tougher than ever due to the new F1 car design regulations. The new cars now use aerodynamic under the floor ground effect to create downforce which has seen some teams run their cars lower than before to the track surface\n\nSingapore F1 circuit similar to Baku\n\nThe track surface is similar in nature to Baku and so the effect of the bumps will be greater than ever at the Marina Bay track.\n\nLewis Hamilton struggled to get out of his car following the Baku race and despite the FIA issuing at technical directive to reduce the vertical oscillations facade by the driers since Azerbaijan, the modified cars have not really faced a proper test of how much better the ride is.\n\nIt could be even though they have been modified, they react in a similar fashion to the way the handled in Baku.\n\nWilliams F1 hand forced\n\nWilliams have been forced to make an early decision on Albon because if Nyck De Vries were to substitute for him again, he will need all the track time available to him starting with FP1.\n\nJust waiting to see how Albon gets on in FP1 was not really an option if the team wish to maximise their potential in the GP.\n\nSingapore4 is a real opportunity for the Williams car which was much better suited than others to the Baku race surface, with Albon finishing P12 and Latifi P15.\n\nThe team have not yet formally announced De Vries as Albon’s substitute because the young Dutchman himself needed to get fitter since Monza.\n\nDe Vries not F1 fit\n\nFollowing. The chequered flag last time out in Italy, De Vries reported over team radio, “My shoulders are dead. I’m struggling to even…Can someone help me or am I alone in Parc Ferme? I can literally not even lift my arms anymore.”\n\nAlpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly came to over to check. On him.\n\nF1 drivers regularly face G-Forces of 5g when braking, 2g under acceleration and up to 6g when cornering. They also lose up to 3kg in weight during some races and by comparison Monza with its long straights is benign when compared to the up coming street circuit in Singapore.\n\nAlbon would have stood no chance of returning to the car had the original race calendar stood, because the Russian GP was originally slated in the intervening days following his surgery.\n\nAlex innate level of fitness will not have dropped, but concerns over the bumpy nature of the Singapore track and whether his wound could be reopened will have surely affected Williams decision on substituting him with Nyck de Vries.\n\nNyck’s preparation for Singapore hampered\n\nEven with the extra physical training the young Dutchman has had his preparations for Singapore hampered because of new travel laws from Europe to the UK.\n\nNyck took to instagram saying he had been unable to travel to the Williams factory in Grove because he only had his EU ID card and not his passport. He returned home until the matter was revolved.\n\nAs much as F1 fans appear to support Alex Allbon after his traumas racing for Red Bull, there will be many excited to see what F1’s next big thing has to offer at one of the most demanding circuits on the Formula One calendar.\n\nREAD MORE: Haas F1 criticise Mick Schumacher’s attitude",
    "House of the year, Singapore: OCBC": "OCBC Bank has again demonstrated its preeminence among Singapore banks this past year, through leadership in the local interest rate benchmark transition, market-leading ESG (environment, social and governance) investment offerings, and innovative digital solutions for its foreign exchange clients.\n\n\n\nAt a time when the market was awaiting the outcome of a consultation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on the adjustment spreads for the transition of legacy swap offered rate (SOR) contracts in the wholesale market, OCBC, together with another commercial bank, completed a 30-year overnight indexed swap (OIS) derivatives transaction in July this year using the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (Sora) as the interest rate benchmark. The bank believes it to be the first long-tenor Sora OIS trade in the city-state.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge, according to Wee Wei Min, global head of sales and structuring, global treasury at OCBC Bank, lies in the long tenor of the transaction because of a dearth of liquidity on that part of the Sora curve. Wee says OCBC overcame this challenge by marrying its corporate and institutional clients to create liquidity.\n\n“OCBC was able to transit a long-dated overnight indexed swap, amortising SOR-based interest rate swap into Sora with our client. OCBC was able to break down the trade into the various tenor buckets against the offsetting flows from our network of clients. This solution worked successfully and sets the precedent in the collaboration process across teams for other long-dated deals to be transited,” she says.\n\n\n\nWee says the fact the bank had senior leaders sitting on the legacy contract conversion sub-committee and the trading sub-committee of the Steering Committee for SOR and Sibor transition to Sora has not only helped the industry make the transition, but also the bank.\n\nOCBC has a long history of leadership in Singapore’s local benchmark transition. In 2019, for instance, OCBC and another commercial bank traded Singapore’s first OIS derivatives transaction using Sora.\n\nOCBC has also executed a number of sustainable finance transactions in the past 12 months, further cementing its title as a frontrunner in the ESG space. One example was a transaction for a real estate investment trust, First REIT. The bank also priced the Housing Development Board’s first green bond and a repeat sustainability-linked issuance for Sembcorp.\n\n“As ESG bonds have a scarcity factor in the Singapore dollar market, we envisioned that investor demand for such instruments will be forthcoming and we lead-managed the market’s first social bond for First REIT, an SGX-listed healthcare-focused REIT. The transaction was aligned with the REIT’s newly established social finance framework, which ties in with the United Nations’ sustainability development goals. In helping these issuers, we created a meaningful platform to further ESG bond issuances, deepening the ESG footprint in the Singapore bond market.”\n\n\n\nLike all banks, OCBC is also very much in the throes of its digital journey. One of its key initiatives – FX Online – the bank’s digital FX platform, which was launched in 2020, has seen further improvements in the past year. These improvements have included leveraging machine learning and robotic process automation, as well as deeper cooperation among the departments within the bank, to offer solutions that are directly relevant to clients’ financing needs instead of overwhelming them with information.\n\n\n\nBy leveraging machine learning and robotic process automation on FX Online, the bank is able to prompt its customers while on the go about FX exposures that need to be managed through its Business Mobile Banking app.\n\n“We are not going to sit and tell them that this is only for a certain kind of deals. Our game, perhaps the end state could be that as long as you want to hedge or invest, you can do so regardless of the channels and where you are. You could be at the airport waiting to catch a plane, and when prompted by OCBC that this is the best time to hedge your Singapore dollar exposure, you are able to do so,” says Gerard Tan, managing director and head of digital market strategy, global treasury at OCBC.\n\n\n\nThe bank’s strategy in offering solutions that seek to add value is also palpable in the market insight it provides its clients for their currency needs. Tan says the bank seeks to ensure the information it provides is relevant to clients and offers advisory on how best to capture opportunities and market dislocation rather than overloading them with information.",

    "Jihan Wu-Backed Crypto Miner Bitdeer Acquires 'Singapore’s Fort Knox' for $28.4 Million – Bitcoin News": "Jihan Wu-Backed Crypto Miner Bitdeer Acquires 'Singapore’s Fort Knox' for $28.4 Million\n\nSources have disclosed that the digital currency mining operation, Bitdeer Technologies, has purchased a high-security storage and display facility in Singapore called Le Freeport for $28.4 million. Bitdeer’s chairman, Jihan Wu, confirmed the vault acquisition via a text message following the reports that revealed the mining firm purchased Le Freeport.\n\nBitdeer Purchases Maximum Security Vault Le Freeport From Yves Bouvier, DBS\n\nAfter the co-founder of Bitmain Technologies Jihan Wu left the company, he co-founded a firm called Matrixport and he’s also the chairman of Bitdeer Technologies. According to a report published by Bloomberg, that cites sources familiar with the matter, Bitdeer paid S$40 million ($28.4 million) for the maximum security vault known as Le Freeport.\n\nThe vault was originally constructed to be similar to the high-security storage vaults located in Luxembourg and Geneva. Freeport has also been dubbed “Singapore’s Fort Knox for fine art and collectibles.” Freeport was originally built for S$100 million and the latest acquisition by Bitdeer paid off a significant amount of debt to creditors like DBS and the vaults former owner Yves Bouvier.\n\nThe vault has been for sale since 2017, and the high-security storage facility has had a large number of well known corporate clients. Before 2018, the luxury auction house Christie’s once rented more than a third of Freeport’s storage space. Deutsche Bank once leveraged Freeport to house more than $8.9 billion in gold bullion.\n\nBloomberg’s Ranjeetha Pakiam, Chanyaporn Chanjaroen, and Zheping Huang detail that Bouvier and Freeport’s other shareholders “received about S$5 million from the sale.” However, the sources do not disclose what Bitdeer aims to do with the facility, but following the initial report, Jihan Wu confirmed the Freeport purchase with the Bloomberg authors via text.\n\nDuring the last year, Bitdeer has been making a number of business moves like investing $25 million into a facility based in Texas in May 2021. Five days later, Bitdeer announced cloud hosting, which allows “retail miners to generate revenue with 1 mining machine.”\n\nAt the end of June 2021, Bitdeer revealed the company’s Antbox products and last October, the company introduced Filecoin mining services. The sources who disclosed the latest acquisition of Freeport in Singapore, also detailed that Bitdeer is researching going public through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deal via a blank check company.\n\nBitdeer is not the only crypto firm to purchase a high-security vault or bunker system. Xapo’s bunker in the Swiss mountains is just as extravagant and reportedly millionaires stored their bitcoins there. Last week, reports indicated that the bitcoin mining operation Arsenal Digital Holdings (OTCMKTS: ADHI) acquired an underground data center outside Houston. Some people suspect it’s Westland Oil’s infamous two-story subterranean campus fallout bunker.\n\nWhat do you think about Bitdeer acquiring ‘Singapore’s Fort Knox’ otherwise known as Le Freeport?

Register Now\n\nThere is currently a variety of carbon registries, established by both international organizations and government bodies of different nations. A key challenge is how to consolidate information from all these domestic and international registries regarding carbon credit issuance, trading and retirement.\n\nThe platform, to be established under the World Bank's Climate Warehouse Initiative, is designed to consolidate different registries' carbon data to create a transparent marketplace on a global scale.\n\n\"It [Climate Warehouse Initiative] helps prevent double issuance and claiming of the same carbon credit in multiple registries by different actors,\" Low said in her speech.\n\nOnce the infrastructure is launched, Singapore will become the data backbone of the global carbon market, which will also promote carbon trading and carbon services in this city state and the ASEAN region.\n\nLow said there has already been growth in demand for carbon services in Singapore, and the government has devoted efforts to nurture more carbon professionals.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's website, the data infrastructure is expected to support services in both public and private sectors, providing aids to compliance reporting, carbon credit transactions and benchmarking services.\n\n\"Many companies continue to view Singapore as the commodity trading hub of choice,\" Low said in the speech, adding that besides trading of conventional commodities, more companies were starting to look at new areas like carbon and biofuels.\n\n\"We aim to nurture strong partnerships between global energy companies, including players like S&P Global Commodity Insights, providing transparency, pricing insights, and also the startup ecosystem to innovate, to co-create novel energy solutions,\" Low said.\n\nAt the APPEC Conference, Felipe Bayon, CEO of Ecopetrol, the largest and primary petroleum company in Colombia, said Ecopetrol established its first international trading office in Singapore this year and has plans for carbon trading in the city-state alongside its conventional trading activities.\n\nSing Fuels, a Singapore home-grown international trading company, is currently exploring plans to launch new desk in several areas including biofuels, fuel oil, LPG and carbon management services, Low said in the speech.\n\nFor access to latest carbon credit prices, commentaries and heards, visit PlattsLIVE.",
    "Ocon: 2022 F1 cars like ‘go karts on kerbs’ in Singapore": "Listen to this article\n\nThe new cars have been already proved to be tricky at similar temporary venues such as Montreal and Baku earlier this season.\n\nWhile bouncing has to some degree been dialled out at recent events, it is expected to be more prominent once again in Singapore, which F1 will visit next weekend for the first time since 2019.\n\n\"It's going to be very bumpy,” said Ocon. “A big challenge I think for us, very physical. I love Singapore. But the track itself is not my favourite. They are go-karts on kerbs, it's going to be a tricky one.\n\n\"It's not going to be fun. But we're up for the challenge. And I think it's going to be interesting also to see who chooses what, in terms of set-up. If you go for the car that rides well, or the car that has grip.\"\n\nAsked if it might be the worst track of year, he said: \"I think Canada has been pretty bad. But probably it will be one of the worst ones. It always is, it's not news.\"\n\nGeorge Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nMercedes believes that Singapore track will be more suited to the W13 than other recent venues, but George Russell acknowledged that the bumpy layout could be an issue for the team.\n\n“I think, on paper, Singapore should suit our car,” said Russell. “But when we look back at the street circuits of Monaco and Azerbaijan, our car doesn't fare too well over the bumps.\n\n“So, we're not too sure how it will fall out. But we need to keep on pushing, keep on improving the car and I'm pleased that we've got a clear direction we need to go now.”\n\nMercedes technical director Mike Elliott agreed that Singapore should be good for the W13.\n\n“I think when you look back at the learning we have gathered over the season I think we expect that Singapore will be a bit more like we’ve seen in Budapest and Zandvoort,” he said.\n\n“It’s a bumpy circuit which is going to provide its challenges, but in terms of the nature of the corners we think it could be a bit better for our car. So, hopefully we will have a good result there.\n\n“As always with all the pre-simulation work we need to do, we will maximise our learning in the practice sessions and hopefully we turn that into a good result over the weekend.\"",
    "Singapore tops financial inclusivity rankings": "Singapore ranks number one globally for financial inclusivity, according to the inaugural Global Financial Inclusion Index, published by investment management and insurance company Principal Financial Group and UK-based think tank the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion is defined as individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. The UN identifies financial inclusion as an enabler for economic growth as well as a key component in several of its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe index examined 42 markets globally, ranking them for financial inclusivity based on three pillars – government support, financial system support and employer support – and looking at the extent to which each of these pillars enables a market’s population to achieve financial inclusivity.\n\nGovernment support rates, among other things, the existence and coverage of deposit schemes and the scope of consumer protection, while financial system support looks at use of real-time payments, fintech developments and access to credit and bank accounts. Employer support examines employee pension contributions and employee insurance programmes.\n\nSingapore topped the index largely due to strong scores in the government and financial system support pillars, ranking first and third respectively. It fared less well in the employer support pillar, where it finished 14th.\n\nIts high score in the government support pillar was largely due to its streamlined corporate tax system, while it also had a strong showing in the education and employment indicators. It performed less well for the availability of government-provided financial education and deposit protection scheme indicators.\n\nIts high ranking in financial system support was largely due to the relative ease of access to credit, a high percentage of the population having access to bank accounts and the strength of its fintech sector. It scored less well for enabling SME growth.\n\nIn employer support, it ranked sixth for employee pension contributions but lower for the rest of the pillar’s indicators.\n\nHong Kong ranked fourth overall in the financial inclusivity index and was the only market to rank in the top 10 across all three pillars.",

    "Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan's National Statement at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 24 September 2022": "Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivered Singapore’s national statement at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on 24 September 2022.\n\n\n\nMinister Balakrishnan underscored the urgent need for concerted global cooperation in the face of multiple concurrent crises. Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold multilateralism, the UN Charter and international law. Multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Countries should collectively strengthen the UN and the multilateral system to address these new challenges and opportunities.\n\n\n\nMinister Balakrishnan outlined three areas in the global commons where there is an urgent need to enhance resilience – climate change and food insecurity; global health and pandemic preparedness; and digital transformation and cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nThe transcript of Minister Balakrishnan’s national statement is appended.\n\n\n\n. . . . .\n\n\n\n\n\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n25 SEPTEMBER 2022\n\n\n\nNATIONAL STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, NEW YORK, 24 SEPTEMBER 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nMultilateralism and International Law for a World in Crisis\n\n\n\n\n\nMr President, Excellencies,\n\nLet me first congratulate His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi on assuming the Presidency of the 77th session of the General Assembly. I also commend His Excellency Abdulla Shahid for his stalwart leadership of the 76th session during what was a most challenging year.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 This (General) Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple concurrent crises. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international law and the UN Charter and undermines the rules-based order. We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of even more Ukrainian territory. The multilateral system, which has contributed so greatly to global peace and security, is now being severely tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 At the same time, superpower rivalry continues to sharpen. As we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year, the risks of accidents, miscalculations, confrontation, and even outright conflict have escalated. The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation to resort to unilateralism has become even stronger. But the need for global cooperation has never been greater or more urgent, given the range of transnational challenges that all of us confront today.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Our recovery from COVID-19 remains uneven and fragile. The risk of a future and even more deadly pandemic has risen.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 The global economy is entering a period characterised by higher and prolonged inflation, and we see high interest rates all over the world. Energy prices have soared. It will become harder to generate the resources all of us need in order to address these long-term problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Societies everywhere will have to grapple with greater internal division, disruption, and polarisation. Without that sense of cohesion, unity, trust, or even an ability to agree on facts, the will and unity needed for societies to confront these existential challenges will be undermined considerably.\n\n\n\n\n\n7 The climate crisis is a clear and present threat. Our global commons including water and biodiversity are also deteriorating rapidly. Our global food supply is at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n8 To make things worse, all these threats and crises are occurring concurrently; interacting with and compounding each other in a vicious circle. For instance, the Secretary-General has spoken of a triple crisis (of) food, fuel, and finance. The impact of these simultaneous crises on ordinary people and on our livelihoods has been severe, and all the more so in developing countries. We see this in the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan and in parts of Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n9 The post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity has unfortunately come to an end. A new world order is being born and any obstetrician here will tell you the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous. Will we have a more divided, less prosperous, and less peaceful world? Or instead, can we strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future, uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system, and jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies, including digital technology, synthetic biology and customised healthcare, and renewable energy. If we can do this, we can then create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\n11 This is also why we have worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States (FOSS). We did so in 1992. We started small with only 16 countries. This year, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of FOSS. We now have a 108 countries – a majority at the UN – we are all proud members. FOSS has always been a champion of the UN and rules-based multilateralism. It gives us a collective stake and voice in the global commons, a means to safeguard our interests, and a system where we have sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully in accordance with international law.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Indeed, the profound importance of multilateralism and international law is precisely why Singapore condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The security and even existence of Singapore – and many other countries, and especially small states – depends on the international community upholding the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n13 If we do not protect these principles, there is then no basis for countries – big and small – to cooperate on an equal footing. Small states especially must not allow the world to regress to one where ‘might is right’.\n\n\n\n\n\n14 While the rules-based multilateral system is not perfect, it is by far our best option in addressing transnational challenges and managing the global commons. This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 40 years ago. It brought order and predictability to the governance of the oceans and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together.\n\n\n\n\n\n15 The geopolitical reality today makes it harder to forge consensus on such a framework. But as our experience with COVID-19 has shown, multilateral cooperation is the only way forward. Ultimately, we share one planet. Despite all our differences, our destinies are inter-woven, and no one is safe until all of us are safe. This applies for pandemics, it also applies for climate change, the conservation of the oceans, and all our other shared challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Singapore will do our part. We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee serves as the President of the BBNJ Conference (Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction), which is currently negotiating a treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We call on all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust and future-proof BBNJ treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\n17 There is much more that we can do to re-energise and transform the UN-based multilateral system to new realities and challenges. I commend the leadership of the Secretary-General in putting forth a bold and ambitious “Common Agenda” to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Let me focus on just three areas in our global commons where there is an urgent need to build resilience: climate change and food insecurity, global health and pandemic preparedness, and digital transformation and cybersecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Food Insecurity\n\n\n\n19 Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting humanity today, as we have seen from the more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and the devastation that they have wrought world over.\n\n\n\n\n\n20 We need a sustained and ambitious global response. Continued commitment by all countries to the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact – that is absolutely critical. We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero. This will be the biggest socio-economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. Both will require considerable economic restructuring, technological breakthroughs, investments, and behavioural changes. The UN-led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n21 Singapore, as a small, low-lying, alternative-energy disadvantaged island nation, is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea-levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n22 Singapore’s impact on global emissions is infinitely small, but we take our climate change action obligations very seriously. We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. A comprehensive strategy to green our economy is taking shape, and we will raise carbon taxes progressively from 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n23 We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero. We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia. We are also building capabilities in environmental risk management in the financial sector and providing grants to defray the costs of green and sustainability-linked loans and bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n24 An adjacent issue is food insecurity. Climate change, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat to our food security. According to a UN report, as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger last year — that is 46 million more than 2020 and 150 million more than 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n25 We must reverse this negative trend. First, we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly. Second, we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges. For example, working together to develop climate-resilient food systems, whilst developing the necessary precautions for food safety. There is much scope for multilateral cooperation on capacity-building and the development of global norms and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Health Architecture and Pandemic Preparedness\n\n\n\n26 Next — it is essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect our future generations. After COVID-19, there will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. In my view, COVID-19 was perhaps a full dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n27 We must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess, and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion in (the) future. We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding under-investment in pandemic preparedness, amongst other global public goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n28 Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen the global health security system. We will continue to support the COVAX Facility, and we have contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response hosted by the World Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation and Cybersecurity\n\n\n\n29 Lastly, we must enhance international cooperation to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n30 Digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum. It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues — geopolitical tensions, technological bifurcation, cybersecurity threats, and the digital divide.\n\n\n\n\n\n31 The world has made significant progress by developing based on a single shared technology stack. Interconnectedness (and) interoperability has brought us together, lowered costs, (and) spurred innovation and competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas. But if we fracture our world and our technology stack, all that good work and that speed of progress and innovation will be slowed down significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n32 We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and optimise the opportunities of digital transformation, while effectively addressing all its challenges. A zero-sum, exclusionary, bifurcated approach benefits no one. An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyber threats and malicious cyber activities. We must also ensure that all States, particularly small states, developing and least developed countries benefit from the digital revolution and not be left behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n33 Singapore fully supports the Secretary-General’s proposal for a Global Digital Compact, which has received strong support from Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n34 We are honoured that Ambassador Burhan Gafoor serves as Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. The consensus adoption of the Working Group’s first Annual Progress Report in July is a welcome sign that multilateralism is alive and well, and can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons even in these difficult times.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr President, Excellencies,\n\n\n\n\n\n35 To conclude — this is a moment where multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism, including especially adherence to the UN Charter and international law.\n\n\n\n\n\n36 I remain an optimist in these difficult times and I believe that we are actually on the cusp of an era of profound technological breakthroughs, one that will equip humanity with unimaginably powerful new tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n37 It is in the world’s interest – and in our own national long-term interest – to set aside our differences, address the challenges of the global commons, and to harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n38 Ultimately, as Member States, we have as much responsibility to each other and to our citizens: to work together, to improve, adapt, and strengthen the multilateral system that we have built so painstakingly over the past 77 years, so that our people – all people – can lead better, more secure, more peaceful, and happier lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n39 Thank you Mr President, Excellencies.\n\n. . . . .\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore’s National Statement at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 24 September 2022\n\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore’s National Statement at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 24 September 2022\n\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore",
    "Hafnia taps F-drones for deliveries in Singapore": "Singapore shipowner Hafnia has entered into an agreement with compatriot autonomous drone startup F-drones to use drones for deliveries to its Singapore-based vessels.\n\nThe Oslo-listed product tanker unit of BW Group said the move would enable the company to rely less on the use of boats to deliver smaller loads to vessels and thereby reduce CO2 emissions with every trip.\n\nHafnia carried out a successful test of using drones to deliver small payloads to its vessels in Singapore in June 2020. Further tests were conducted in 2022 with F-drones with a higher range, leading to an official deal for drone deliveries to vessels anchored in Singapore “depending on the right circumstances”.\n\nSingapore has been trialing drone deliveries for quite some time. In 2020, F-drones was the first company in Singapore to receive authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to conduct beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone deliveries to ships in Singapore, with Eastern Pacific Shipping as its first paying customer. The company in March teamed up with fellow offshore vessel owner and operator Marco Polo Marine to co-develop what are claimed to be the world’s first large-scale, electric aerial delivery drones for offshore wind farms.\n\nAlso earlier this year, Singapore’s sole multipurpose port, Jurong, joined forces with advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure developer and drone operator Skyports to explore the development of ship-to-shore infrastructure.",
    "Singapore Has Announced Ambitious Plans to Greenify the City-State by 2030": "Paid Partnership with Delta\n\nSingapore, with nearly half of its land allocated to parks and gardens, is often touted as one of the greenest cities in the world. From a distance, the wild vertical gardens climbing up buildings and the miles of leafy corridors connecting major parks look effortless, like nature has been allowed to just do its thing. But as any Singaporean will tell you, nothing on this small, densely populated island can be attributed to chance.\n\nIndeed, Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister, launched the idea of Singapore as a garden city back in 1967. The initiative started as a tree-planting drive, but by 1992 it had taken the form of a sustainability blueprint called the Singapore Green Plan (SGP), which last year was updated as SGP 2030.\n\nOrganized around five pillars of improvement for the next decade, SGP 2030 aims to promote development of the city while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing public adoption of cleaner forms of energy, such as solar.\n\nRead more about the Future of Travel here.\n\nThese lofty ambitions are supported by hyper detailed, concrete targets that touch on nearly every aspect of life. There are laudable short-term goals, like developing more than 300 acres of new parks and ensuring that every household is within a 10-minute walk of a green space; tripling the amount of cycling trails; developing a circular economy (like turning ash from trash incinerators into a sand alternative used for concrete); and requiring all new car registrations to be clean-energy vehicles.\n\nWhat's more impressive is the long-term investment that the plan sets out, like funding training programs for future jobs in sustainable building, solar technology, and green finance. It's a tall order, but if any nation can meet these goals by 2030, it's the one that went from a colony to a global financial, shipping, and shopping juggernaut in a single generation.\n\nThis article appeared in the September/October 2022 issue of Condé Nast Traveler.

    "17 in Singapore fined $114,500 in total for selling e-vaporisers": "More than $170,000 worth of e-vaporisers and related components were seized from the 17 offenders. (PHOTO: HSA)\n\nSINGAPORE — Seventeen people, aged between 20 and 39, have been fined a total of $114,500 for selling e-vaporisers and related components in Singapore, said the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Monday (26 September).\n\nFive of them also received jail terms of 10 to 26 days, while three were sentenced to 12 to 24 months' probation. All of them were convicted in court between February and August, HSA said in a press release.\n\nThe offenders had bought the illegal products from overseas and sold them on local social media and e-commerce platforms, HSA said. More than $170,000 worth of the products were seized.\n\nAmong the 17 offenders, the highest fine of $23,000 was given to Chelsea Tan Yan Qi, 24, who served 50 days’ jail as she could not pay the fine, it added.\n\nTan received help from her husband and an employee to smuggle the products from Johor Bahru into Singapore, which she sold on Telegram. She and her accomplices would use a rented car to transport her supplies.\n\nOn a few occasions, an e-vaporiser supplier in Johor Bahru had helped Tan to hide the illegal products in the door panels of the car to evade detection, said HSA. Tan's accomplices have been dealt with separately.\n\nOne of the 17 convicted, Yang Jing Tao, 21, is a repeat offender who was earlier caught selling e-vaporisers on Carousell in 2018. He was then issued with a conditional warning, under which he was not allowed to be involved in any criminal conduct for 24 months.\n\nBetween August and September 2019, Yang committed new offences by importing e-vaporiser components. He was placed under supervised probation of 12 months for his offences, HSA said.\n\n\"HSA conducts active online surveillance and will continue to take strong enforcement actions against those selling e-vaporisers and related components. We also work closely with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority to monitor and stop illegal imports of e-vaporisers and related components,\" it added.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, 70 people were prosecuted for selling e-vaporisers and their related components, said HSA. The highest fine meted out so far for such offences was $99,000.\n\nFrom 1 February 2018 to 31 December 2021, 6,842 people were caught for the possession and use of e-vaporisers and their related components.\n\nSome 12,300 e-vaporisers, around 4,500 e-liquids and about 175,000 pods and components – with a total street value of about $1.9 million – were destroyed by authorities last year.\n\nFor selling, possessing for sale, importing or distributing e-vaporisers and their related components, offenders can be fined up to $10,000, or jailed up to six months or both for the first offence.\n\nRepeat offenders can face a fine of up to $20,000 or up to 12 months' jail or both.\n\nSince 1 February 2018, those who possess, purchase or use e-vaporisers and their related components can be fined up to $2,000 per offence.\n\nMembers of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale, or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can submit a report at go.gov.sg/reporttobaccooffences.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "How I Spent Less Than S$200 on a Trip to Singapore and Johor Bahru": "Throwback to the year 2019 when I was still a university student in Perak, Malaysia, I was lucky enough to have visited Singapore and Johor Bahru on an extremely budget trip. Frankly, it was quite a spontaneous one. My coursemate Fye (pseudonym) lives in JB and frequently travels to Singapore, so I did not need to worry about the itinerary, as she planned it out for me. I am also grateful to this day that she let me stay over at her house in Gelang Patah. (Kudos to Fye!)\n\nOf course, I don’t want this article to be merely “clickbait.” Thus, to clarify, one of the biggest reasons for me to be able to travel with such a limited budget is that I stayed over at my coursemate’s house in Johor, instead of staying overnight in Singapore.\n\nLet’s catch a glimpse of what could I do with only S$200 on my budget trip to Singapore and Johor Bahru!\n\nDisclaimer: Some prices may have increased over the years, especially during the pandemic.\n\nAlso read: Everything That Went Wrong During My First Trip to Japan and South Korea\n\nMy three-day Johor Bahru and Singapore itinerary\n\nDay 1: Entering Singapore by bus from Johor\n\nI travelled from Perak to Johor Bahru by bus and stayed one night before departing for Singapore the next day. We had to wake up very early to take the bus from Gelang Patah to Singapore. It took a lot of walking and waiting, and because it was a Thursday, we could see many Malaysians travelling by bus to Singapore from JB for work.\n\nAfter going through customs, we took another bus from the bus terminal to Jurong East. Although Singapore and Malaysia are literally next to each other and share similar cultures, I knew I was in another country the moment I saw the English road sign (in Malaysia, road signs are written in Malay).\n\nThe first thing we did once we arrived was to purchase a prepaid mobile data plan and an EZ-link card. During the trip, we neither drove nor took a taxi at all, because all attractions can be easily reached by MRT or by foot. Each MRT station here is connected to a mall, which is super cool and convenient. The Lion City truly gives off urban vibes, with majestic buildings and unique sculptures almost everywhere.\n\nOur first stop was, obviously, Merlion Park. Because, have you really been to Singapore if you haven’t taken a quirky picture with the iconic merlion statue? This famous landmark was packed with many tourists, so we had to queue for a while to get the perfect Instagrammable shot!\n\nWe then walked along the Cavenagh Bridge and took pictures of the statues. Lunch was jawa mee at a random mall because it was the cheapest and most valuable meal we could find (RIP, Malaysia’s currency).\n\nAfter lunch, we visited Saint Andrew’s Cathedral and Singapore’s National Gallery. For a better picture-taking spot, I would recommend the latter, since it has amazing interior and exterior design, as well as gorgeous artwork. I was strangely attracted to a particular art piece (pictured above) made out of what looked like a bunch of chewing gums.\n\nFye knows I love taking pictures, so the rest of the trip were us visiting a lot of famous, Instagramable hotspots. I loved wandering around the city and just capturing moments everywhere. She brought me to the Old Hill Street Police Station, a stunning historical building with colourfully painted windows that was previously a police station.\n\nWe then arrived at Haji Lane, one of the most vibrant streets I have been to. This place reminded me of Ipoh’s Concubine Lane and Penang’s street murals. If you love colourful things, then I promise you that you’ll love Haji Lane. Of course, it is not only rainbowy but also has many bars that make it a great hangout spot.\n\nWe had our dinner in a rather old mall in Bugis. Unfortunately, Fye and I already forgot the name of the mall; the only thing we could recall is that there is a Guan Yin temple nearby.\n\nThis dumpling noodle soup from a Chinese shop was so delicious and authentic, I even ordered an additional plate of dumplings. Surprisingly, dinner was cheaper than I expected. Then, we took the bus back to JB — and that concludes the first day of the Johor Bahru and Singapore trip.\n\nAlso read: A Shopping Paradise: The Best Malls in Singapore to Shop Till You Drop\n\nDay 2: A trip to Johor Bahru\n\nInstead of going to Singapore, Fye brought me on a stroll around Johor Bahru. We had breakfast at V Spice Cafe & Restaurant, a North Indian restaurant in Tun Aminah, sadly this restaurant seems to be permanently closed during the pandemic. Then, we went to Sutera Mall — one of the city’s most popular malls — by bus and had a simple vegetarian meal for lunch.\n\nIt was almost Deepavali (also known as Diwali) during this time. So, I bought a beautiful saree at a Deepavali event at the mall. I was delighted as that was my first time trying one on. I chose between two sarees that were on discount, and the stall owner said that I looked pretty on this specific red and gold saree. (Now you know what my Day 3 outfit would be!)\n\nIn the evening, we took a Grab to Puteri Harbour. Like many other couples there, we sat beside the harbour, enjoying the serene atmosphere while the sky slowly got darker. We also visited a DC Comics Superheroes store that had some cool merchandise. (Unfortunately, this one has permanently closed down.) And then for dinner, Fye’s mother prepared us a simple home-cooked meal. That sums up my little trip to Johor Bahru.\n\nAlso read: 5 Things That Are Cheaper in Johor Bahru Than in Singapore\n\nDay 3: Celebrating my birthday in Singapore\n\nOn the third day, we followed the same steps as the first day and travelled from Johor Bahru to Singapore by bus from Gelang Patah. Our first stop was Singapore Botanic Gardens. This place is full of tropical flora and fauna, as well as large areas for outdoor activities like jogging. Truthfully, I wasn’t much impressed with it because Malaysia has many similar gardens, especially around the Klang Valley.\n\nI was extremely excited when Fye said that she was bringing me to Jewel Changi Airport. At that time (October 2019), Jewel Changi Airport was still a pretty new tourist attraction. We had bibimmyeon and jajangmyeon at JINJJA Chicken. This restaurant had a very edgy design and colourful lights, which I quite liked.\n\nWe took mandatory tourist pictures in front of Jewel Changi’s magnificent Rain Fortex. Afterwards, I bought a t-shirt and some notebooks from Muji that were on sale, and then satisfied my sweet tooth at the Candy Empire. I tried to collect all colours of the Jellybeans and got my favourite M&M candies. I also got my little brother a set of adorable-looking erasers as souvenirs from Tokyu Hands.\n\nThen, Fye brought me to Earle Swensen’s, where she treated me to ice cream as my birthday gift. (Honestly, I didn’t really care if it was my birthday or not, because the rest of the day was just me immersing in the beauty of the Lion City and trying to get the whole of it!)\n\nHow frugal can someone get? Well, look at me. Fye said it’s not that worth it to visit the Gardens by the Bay during the daytime (since the gorgeous lights are only on at night, but we weren’t staying so late). Therefore, we just went to the park outside of the garden and took pictures with the attraction from afar! Here, you can even get a photo of the famous and splendid five-star hotel, Marina Bay Sands.\n\nIn the evening, we had a “fancy” dinner: a bowl of Hong Kong-style luncheon meat and egg soup noodles at Xin Wang Hong Kong Cafe. As much as I don’t want to leave this charming city, it was time for us to go back to Malaysia. Singapore was amazing, and to be able to travel here under budget was just icing on the cake.\n\nAlso read: I Survived 24 Hours in Changi Airport: My Essential Tips for Crazy Flight Cancellations\n\nCost breakdown on my super budget trip to Singapore and Johor Bahru\n\nMy little tips and tricks on saving money during the trip to Singapore, firstly, travel by the MRT if not by foot. Singapore is small enough, so it’s definitely not necessary to take a car or taxi. Besides, the country’s MRT system is quite efficient, which makes going from one place to another a lot easier. Apparently, there’s also a Singapore Tourist Pass, a special version of the EZ-link card that offers unlimited travel.\n\nIf this is your first time going to Singapore, try visiting places or attractions that have free entry. Surprisingly, there are tons of fun things to do and places to go in Singapore without having to spend a penny.\n\nLastly, and I know this is quite hard for most people, but if you don’t mind the hassle, travel back and forth between the two countries and just book a place in Johor instead. Nevertheless, I do not recommend this if your budget is enough, since travelling to and fro from Johor Bahru to Singapore and vice versa might be too exhausting for some.\n\nBelow is my daily cost breakdown for this trip. Again, do note that some prices may have increased since 2019, and that the breakdown below is just an approximate reference.\n\nDay one\n\nBus from Kampar to Johor Bahru: RM58 (S$18)\n\nBus from Gelang Patah to Jurong East: RM8 (S$2.50)\n\nMRT’s EZ-link card: RM38 (with RM22 credit) (S$12)\n\nPrepaid mobile sim card: RM25 (S$8)\n\nJawa Mee: RM10 (S$3)\n\nDumplings and noodles: RM30 (RM15 per person) (S$4.50)\n\nBus from Jurong East to Gelang Patah: RM8 (S$2.50)\n\nDay two\n\nGelang Patah to Sutera Mall: RM4 (S$1.25)\n\nVegetarian meal: RM15 (S$4.25)\n\nSaree: RM50 (S$15.5)\n\nGrab from Sutera Mall to Puteri Harbour: RM 20 (RM10 per person) (S$3)\n\nGrab from Puteri Harbour back to Gelang Patah: RM15 (RM7.50 per person) (S$2.30)\n\nDay three\n\nBus from Gelang Patah to Jurong East: RM8 (S$2.50)\n\nBibimbap noodles ( bibimmyeon ): RM25 (S$8)\n\nMuji: RM25 (S$8)\n\nCandy Empire: RM18 (S$5.50)\n\nTokyu Hands: RM10 (S$3)\n\nTop up EZ-link card: RM15 (S$5)\n\nLuncheon meat and egg soup noodles: RM36 (S$11.45)\n\nBus from Jurong East to Gelang Patah: RM8 (S$2.50)\n\nBus from Johor Bahru to Kampar: RM58 (S$18)\n\nTotal: RM451.5 (S$ 140.75)\n\nAlso read: Singapore Souvenirs: 27 Unique Things to Bring Home\n\nFrankly, if it weren’t for the pictures, I could only remember bits and pieces of this trip to Singapore and Johor Bahru. I guess those years under lockdown have really taken a toll on my memory. Now that more countries around the world are loosening entry restrictions, I guess it is time for us to finally travel again.\n\nI can’t wait to go back to Singapore and visit attractions that I haven’t been to, like the Universal Studios, Marina Bay Sands SkyPark, Singapore Cable Car, and more! And perhaps the next time around, I wouldn’t mind splurging a little more, since I am already a working adult!\n\nAll images are credited to Cecelia Chang, unless stated otherwise.",
    "Recent and Upcoming Enhancements to Singapore's Work Pass Framework": "Singapore Labor, Employment, and Workplace Safety Alert\n\nOn 29 August 2022, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Trade and Industry, and Ministry of Communications and Information announced four key enhancements to Singapore’s work pass framework, namely:\n\nIntroduction of a new Overseas Networks & Expertise Work Pass (ONEWP) for talents comparable to the top 5% of Employment Pass (EP) holders. Introduction of a new public benchmark for exemption from some existing work pass requirements. Changes to existing EP application processes. Option of a five-year EP for qualified tech professionals.\n\nThe purpose of these enhancements is to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent.\n\nIntroduction of New Overseas Networks & Expertise Work Pass\n\nThe ONEWP is a personalised five-year work pass that allows holders to start, operate, and work for multiple companies in Singapore at the same time. Applications for the new ONEWP will open on 1 January 2023. The MOM has announced that there will be a few application routes, although it is not yet clear what the different application routes or process will be. Nevertheless, it has been established that applicants will typically need to have earned a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 within the last year or will earn a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 under their future employer based in Singapore. As an exception, candidates with outstanding achievements across the arts and culture, sports, science and technology, and research and academia may qualify for an ONEWP even if they do not meet the S$30,000 minimum salary requirement.\n\nOther key features of the ONEWP, as compared to an EP, are briefly summarized below:\n\nONEWP EP Concurrent Employment Permitted. ONEWP holders may start, operate, and work for multiple companies in Singapore. Not permitted. EP holders can only work in Singapore for the employer who has sponsored their EP. Letter of Consent for Spouses to Work Permitted. Not permitted. Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Job Advertising Requirement Not permitted. Required. Before an employer can submit an EP application, it must first advertise the vacancy on MyCareersFuture for at least 14 days. Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) Not applicable. Applicable for new EP applications from 1 September 2023 and renewal EP applications from 1 September 2024. Annual Notification to MOM of Professional Activities Required. ONEWP holders will be required to notify the MOM annually of their professional activities so as to ensure that they are using the flexibility afforded to them under the ONEWP to contribute meaningfully. Not required.\n\nIntroduction of a New Public Benchmark for Exemption From Some Existing Work Pass Requirements\n\nPresently, EP holders who earn fixed monthly salaries of S$20,000 and above are exempted from the FCF job advertising requirement and the upcoming COMPASS. Individuals who fall under this category of EP holders are also eligible for the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), as an alternative to the EP. From 1 September 2023, to provide greater clarity on the MOM’s work pass framework for talent, the MOM will implement a new public benchmark for such candidates, namely:\n\nThe exemption bar for the FCF job advertising requirement and COMPASS will be raised from S$20,000 to S$22,500; and\n\nThe minimum salary criteria for the PEP will be raised from S$18,000 for overseas foreign professionals and S$12,000 for existing EP holders to S$22,500 for all PEP applicants.\n\nChanges to Existing EP Application Processes\n\nTo enable employers to be more responsive to business needs, the MOM has implemented the following changes:\n\nFrom 1 September 2022, the FCF job advertising requirement duration has been reduced from 28 days to 14 days.\n\nWith immediate effect, the MOM will improve processing time for all EP applications such that EP applications will be processed, or an update provided to employers, within 10 business days.\n\nOption of a Five-Year EP for Qualified Tech Professionals\n\nPresently, EPs may be granted for durations of up to two years for first-time candidates and up to three years for renewal candidates. From 1 September 2023, in order to allow Singapore to anchor tech capabilities and develop Singapore’s local pipeline, the MOM will offer the option of a five-year EP to candidates who:\n\nare experienced professionals filling specific tech occupations on the COMPASS Shortage Occupation List (which will be announced in March 2023);\n\nearn a fixed monthly salary of at least S$10,500 (with older candidates commanding higher salaries); and\n\npass COMPASS and score at least 10 points on the COMPASS Diversity criterion.\n\nWhat This Means for Employers in Singapore\n\nIn view of the recent and upcoming changes discussed above, it is expected that employers in Singapore will be provided with more options in order to be responsive to their workforce needs, enhance workforce planning, and to better tap into the global talent pool.\n\nWhat We Can Do to Assist\n\nWe can assist with advising on the details of the changes to Singapore’s work pass regime, as well as assisting employers with the relevant work pass applications.",
    "Singapore’s manufacturing output growth further slows down in August": "SINGAPORE: The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) said on Monday that the country’s manufacturing output increased 0.5 percent year-on-year in August, compared to a revised 0.8-percent increase in July and a 2.6-percent gain in June, reported Yonhap.\n\nExcluding biomedical manufacturing, the output declined 1.2 percent year-on-year in August, compared to a 3.1-percent increase in July and a 4.9-percent increase in June.\n\nOn a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, Singapore’s manufacturing output rose 2 percent in August. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output declined 2.9 percent.\n\nAs for the performance of different clusters, the electronics cluster’s output declined 7.8 percent year-on-year in August, with all segments recording a decline in output on the back of softening demand. Meanwhile, the chemicals cluster saw its output decreased 11.2 percent.\n\nThe biomedical manufacturing cluster’s output grew 11.1 percent in August.

    "The Big Read: Amid intensifying global talent war, Singapore faces juggling act in hunt for world's best and brightest": "Ethos BeathChapman's Mr Kochar pointed out that \"when it comes to starting something new that has not been done before by the firm, it cannot be done by just one top executive\".\n\nHe said: \"They would need their own ‘army’, if not 100 per cent at least 20 or 30 per cent (of a team).\"\n\nBut he added: \"(The rollout of) ONE Pass is also about saying … we have a working army, now we’re getting a leader to lead the army.”\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF WOOING ELITE GLOBAL TALENTS\n\nEarlier this month, Dr Tan said in Parliament that as part of Singapore's global talent \"offensive\", agencies such as the National Arts Council and Ministry of Education will help identify not just high-earners but \"exceptional talent\" in fields such as the arts, sports and science,\n\nThese high-achievers will not need to meet the S$30,000 monthly salary criterion for ONE Pass, and will help push Singapore to “new frontiers, draw in greater investments … (and) create a very diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans”, said the Manpower Minister.\n\nMr Song of CIMB bank said this signals Singapore’s effort to support the growth of non-business fields, given that their top talents will be accorded similar treatment with business leaders in terms of work passes.\n\nHowever, there are concerns from some of those interviewed about potential side effects of Singapore's targeted strategy of going after top-tier talents, be in business or other fields.\n\n“I would argue that by setting it up as some sort of ‘platinum card’ may cause envy and resentment down the line,” said Mr Black of Blackbox.\n\n“Even if the numbers accepted are relatively small, talented (locals) may feel, rightly or wrongly, that such a scheme means they will be overlooked for top jobs in favour of a foreigner,” he said.\n\nMr Black's views were echoed by sociologists interviewed.\n\nAssociate Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Social Sciences said that the ONE Pass initiative may inadvertently \"be seen as creating a two-tiered workforce, even among foreign skilled professionals working here\".\n\nShe also expressed concern that it may lead to a situation where a company would lean towards parachuting readily available top talents from elsewhere to take up apex roles, instead of investing time and resources in training Singaporeans to move up the ladder.\n\nDr Rebecca Grace Tan from National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Humanities and Sciences said that while the ONE Pass is currently “quite restrictive” in terms of qualification criteria and validity period, “it is not clear that the incentives for foreigners will stop here”, as Singapore continues to be in a “global talent arms race”.\n\n“This is especially so given the hypermobility of the super-rich. For example, James Dyson moved to Singapore in 2019 and returned back to the United Kingdom in 2021,” she said.\n\n“Instead, we are likely to see more and more incentives rolled out to attract and retain foreign talent, much like what we saw in Europe which accumulated in the provision of permanent residency based on how much migrants invested.\"\n\nQuestions on ensuring skills transfer have also been raised in Parliament, with MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asking if such training requirements can be codified into law, while other MPs suggested time-limited EPs to ensure skills transfer.\n\nIn response, Dr Tan cautioned “against too deterministic an approach” as skills transfer is not a simple or linear process.\n\nOver the years, government leaders have repeatedly stressed that developing local talents remains a priority, even as it taps on the global skilled workforce to help drive the economy.\n\nMost recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that investing heavily in human capital locally “has and will continue to be a cornerstone\" of the Government's development strategy.\n\nMr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, was speaking last week at the launch of the financial services sector's second industry transformation map. At the launch, it was also announced that S$400 million has been committed to developing local professionals as part of the sector's five-year blueprint.\n\nMeanwhile, a constant bugbear when it comes to discussing the presence of foreign talents here is the concern over housing and rental prices.\n\nProperty analysts cautioned that the push to attract global talents, especially the top tier ones, would drive up demand for housing in Singapore.\n\nMs Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, expects the rental market to feel the impact first, “especially for the luxury segment given (the top global talents') high salaries and expat packages”.\n\nAgreeing, Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director for research at Huttons Asia, said that rentals for other market segments will probably rise as well, albeit to a lesser degree than luxury homes.\n\nMr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA, said it might be too early to talk about the impact of the ONE Pass initiative on the property market. Nevertheless, he noted that foreign buyers “are already active in buying and selling high-end residential properties”.\n\n\n\nMr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Group, cited official data which showed that 180 new homes were bought by foreigners in the second quarter of this year. “This was the highest number of units purchased by foreigners since the third quarter of 2019, when there were a total of 182 units transacted,” he added."
