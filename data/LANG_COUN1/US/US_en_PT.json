(AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)\n\nMADRID (AP) — Coach Luis Enrique tried to stay optimistic about Spain’s chances of advancing in the Nations League following a disappointing home loss to Switzerland.\n\nAfter all, La Roja can still secure a spot in the finals with a win in Portugal on Tuesday.\n\n“We see it as a final,” Luis Enrique said Monday, two days after the 2-1 loss to Switzerland dropped Spain from first to second in Group A2 ahead of the decisive match in Braga. “It’s positive to arrive in the last round with a possibility to win the group.”\n\nBut beating Portugal isn’t something Spain has been able to do recently. The Iberian neighbors have drawn their last four matches including friendlies, and Spain has not won at Portugal in nearly two decades.\n\nIts last victory against Portugal came in a penalty shootout in the semifinals of the 2012 European Championship, and before that it won in the round of 16 of the 2010 World Cup in a match where Portugal complained of an offside on David Villa’s winning goal in the second half.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Portugal, Spain is winless since a 3-0 victory in a friendly in 2003, when Fernando Torres made his national debut with Spain, and not long after Cristiano Ronaldo began playing for Portugal.\n\n“It’s all part of soccer. We have three recent matches in which we played well but didn’t win and they ended in draws,” Luis Enrique said.\n\nThe teams have drawn four straight since coach Fernando Santos took over Portugal after the 2014 World Cup, including a thrilling 3-3 game to open their campaigns in the group stage of the 2018 World Cup.\n\n“We just have to focus on winning rather than reaching the final four,” Santos said on Monday. “I want the players to face Spain on their merit, as they do all opponents. Do that and we will always be closer to getting where we want to go.”\n\nSpain needs the victory after seeing its 22-game unbeaten run at home ended by Switzerland on Saturday. Portugal won 4-0 at the Czech Republic to take first place and earn a chance to advance with a draw on Tuesday.\n\nOnly the group winners advance to the final four next June. Portugal has 10 points, two more than Spain. Switzerland has six points, two more than the Czech Republic ahead of their match in Switzerland to try to avoid relegation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpain is looking for its second consecutive appearance in the final four after finishing runner-up to France last year. At that time, it also needed a last-day victory to advance to the final four, and it did it by shocking Germany 6-0 at home.\n\nLuis Enrique said he didn’t expect many changes in the squad for the match against Portugal despite the loss on Saturday, though he admitted the team had to improve its defending of set pieces, which is how Switzerland scored both of its goals.\n\nPortugal, the winner of the inaugural edition of the Nations League in 2019, may see the return of forward João Félix, who was not available for the match against the Czech Republic because of an injury. He rejoined his teammates in training on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni",

    "Portugal’s president receives warm welcome in Gustine. ‘This will go down in history’": "Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was given an enthusiastic welcome to Gustine on Sunday, where he met with community members and local dignitaries as part of his trip to California.\n\nGustine Mayor Pat Nagy presented Rebelo de Sousa with a key to the city, saying the moment will be remembered for years to come.\n\n“This will go down in history, you can believe it,” Nagy told the audience gathered at Gustine Pentecostal Society Portuguese Hall. “You will forever be welcome here, and you will be in our hearts.”\n\nRebelo de Sousa told the Sun-Star he had planned on coming to Gustine in 2020, but that visit was postponed by the COVID pandemic.\n\nRebelo de Sousa explained while there are many stops on his trip, when talking about Gustine he said, “But this one is even more special. No other Portuguese president has been here. So many Portuguese have been working here. I had to come.”\n\nHe called the United States an ally and “a very old friend,” saying Portuguese Americans remain “resilient” and determined to succeed.\n\n“(The Valley) is a place where Portuguese have been for 150 years,” he told reporters gathered for the event. “It’s a lifetime. Several generations.”\n\nGustine has one of the highest concentrations of Americans with Portuguese heritage in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Many of those local folks trace their ancestry back to the Azores, as well as Portugal itself.\n\nThe city is steeped in Portuguese history and longtime traditions that continue to this day, like its annual festa, which began in the 1930s.\n\nWhen given the key to the city by Nagy, Rebelo de Sousa joked, “Now I feel like a citizen. I don’t know if you thought about it before offering it ... I feel good here, I may be back several times.”\n\nRebelo de Sousa presented a merit medal to local dairy farmer Joao Pires while addressing the group in Gustine. Pires, who is originally from Azores, was moved to tears as he accepted the medal.\n\nGustine Pentecost Society President Manuel Siqueiros said it meant so much to the people of Gustine for Rebelo de Sousa to take the time to visit.\n\n“Just the fact that he recognizes this Portuguese community and to come out here and celebrate this day and express his happiness with the people of Gustine, it’s amazing,” Siqueiros said. “You don’t get a foreign president visiting a lot of places let alone Gustine, California.”\n\nOther scheduled stops on Rebelo de Sousa’s California trip include throwing the first pitch at the San Francisco Giants-Colorado Rockies game Tuesday in celebration of Portuguese Heritage Night.\n\nHe was scheduled to appear at Stanford University on Monday for a panel discussion titled “Sustainable Solutions for Portugal and California.”\n\n“(Portugal has) 60% of our energy sources coming from renewable (energy),” Rebelo de Sousa said Sunday, saying that number is expected to increase to 80% by 2030.\n\nHe also mentioned Portugal’s efforts to embrace the digital revolution, particularly with many young entrepreneurs spearheading startups and technological innovations.\n\n“(That) is something that makes California and Portugal very much alike. It’s very good,” he said. “We are far away, but we are very close, facing these new challenges. “\n\nGustine Mayor Pat Nagy, center, is shown presenting Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa with a key to the city on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2022.

    "Portugal's mysterious 'birthing stones'": "The wind whipped across my face as I stood on the edge of a vast plateau in remote northern Portugal. Lavender-blue haze stretched across the horizon, and I could just make out the outline of a steep waterfall as it cascaded down the mountain below. Delicate yellow flowers created swathes of colour in the otherwise murky landscape. Looking down on the mountains spread out before me like an undulating carpet, I felt as if I was standing at the edge of the world, and I could see why these were called the Montanhas Mágicas (Magic Mountains).\n\nI was in the Arouca Unesco Global Geopark, an open-air geological museum that has long been an attraction for the scientific community due to the sheer number of geological marvels it contains: 41 separate geosites in total. These include some of the world's biggest trilobite fossils – arthropods that lived more than 500 million years ago – as well as geological fault lines and otherworldly rock formations sculpted by water over millions of years.\n\nBut I had not come to see any of these – admittedly interesting – natural exhibits. I had come for something even more fascinating: one of the world's most baffling geological phenomena.\n\nPulling myself away from the mountain view, I continued towards my destination: the tiny village of Castanheira. Nestled into the side of the Freita Mountain (one of the Magic Mountains located within the geopark), the village is home to the Pedras Parideiras, or \"Birthing Stones\" in English – 300-million-year-old rocks that seem to \"give birth\" to smaller \"baby\" stones. They are unlike any other rock on the planet.",

    "How Portugal cruised to 4-0 Nations League victory against Czech Republic with Diogo Dalot scoring double": "Portugal comfortably beat Czech Republic 4-0 in Prague to move to first place in their Nations League group ahead of the final matchday.\n\nFernando Santos' men found the back of the net twice in the first half, with Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes getting on the score sheet. Czech Republic had a golden opportunity to cut their deficit to one goal in first-half injury time as they were awarded a penalty for a handball by Cristiano Ronaldo, but Patrik Schick blazed his attempt well over the crossbar.\n\nPortugal added two more goals in the second half to complete the rout: Dalot scored again, and Diogo Jota scored for the first time for club or country since April. The result flattered Portugal a bit, as the Czechs perhaps deserved at least one goal on the night. The result marks the first loss on home soil for Czech Republic in over two years, ending an 11-game unbeaten run over that time.\n\nWith Switzerland beating Spain 2-1 today, the group looks ahead to two great fixtures on Tuesday: Portugal vs Spain will be a direct play-off for the spot in the finals, and Switzerland vs Czech Republic will be a direct battle to avoid relegation.\n\nGroup table:\n\nPortugal: 10 pts\n\nSpain: 8 pts\n\nSwitzerland: 6 pts\n\nCzech Republic: 4 pts\n\nFinal group fixtures - Tuesday:\n\nPortugal vs Spain at Estadio Municipal de Braga\n\nSwitzerland vs Czech Republic at the Kybunpark\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)",

Friday’s stunning 2-0 defeat from Japan shows the injury-laden Americans have ways to go before thinking their floor is higher than other nations’ ceilings.\n\nThe lone MLS tilt this week is a big one.\n\n\n\nThe Seattle Sounders are next on the Western Conference’s cutting board in terms of playoff elimination, but it still feels odd to think they’re incapable of pulling a rabbit out of the hat and surging back up. They host FC Cincinnati on Wednesday, and the Orange and Blue are on the opposite end of the momentum spectrum as they are one of the teams on the cusp of clinching an Eastern Conference playoff ticket.\n\nIf you haven’t yet, be sure to sign up for your free trials of ESPN+ and Paramount+ for all your soccer streaming needs.

Firstly, Portugal doesn’t really have one climate but many. While people in the south of Portugal might be basking in the sun during winter, people in the north might be experiencing a damp, grey winter that’s similar to that found in Northern Europe. Also, regardless of where you are in the country, it’s quite possible that your property isn’t insulated which means that even if it’s warm outside, the property could be cold inside.\n\nWish moving to Portugal was a little more simple? Now it can be. Get the book Moving to Portugal Made Simple from Amazon.\n\nSummers can be hot too, especially if you live inland in somewhere like the Alentejo. But the incredibly hot weather usually only lasts a few months and there are plenty of things that you can do to keep cool (even if you don’t have air con).\n\nA Feeling of Safety\n\nThere’s some debate as to how accurate the oft-quoted statistic of Portugal being the third safest country in the world is, but the reality is Portugal feels incredibly safe – especially when compared to the US, Latin America, and parts of the UK. It’s somewhere where children, the elderly, and women typically feel comfortable walking alone, even late at night.\n\nIn fact, Portuguese culture is incredibly family-friendly: children are adored and the elderly are treated with respect.\n\nHigh Speed Internet\n\nIf you plan on working from home in Portugal (or gaming or keeping in touch with friends over Zoom and WhatsApp), the good news is that it’s possible to get high-speed internet in Portugal.\n\nThat said, you should check what internet options are available before buying or renting a property. It’s not unusual for fibre internet to be available in a town or city, but to not be available just a few kilometres outside, leaving rural residents to rely on mobile and satellite internet. Online internet checkers that just use your postal code are often incorrect so don’t rely on them: use our human-powered internet options checker instead.\n\nLower Cost of living\n\nThis is a slightly trickier one, but for the most part, Portugal has a lower cost of living. Of course, it depends on where you’re coming from and what you’re buying. If you’re moving from New York or San Francisco to Portugal, you’ll notice a considerably lower cost of living. However, if you’re moving from the North of England or Spain, you won’t see a major difference and you might think Portugal is more expensive.\n\nPortugal is cheap for some things and expensive for others. It’s cheap for eating out, for example, where a meal in a three-course lunch menu can cost you less than €10. However, other things like cars, utilities, and fuel are typically more expensive.\n\nAgain, it depends where you’re coming from. Americans typically find groceries and cell phone plans considerably cheaper than the US while many Europeans don’t notice a difference or find them more expensive.\n\nOf course, it’s not just about price but the lifestyle you get for that price. There are few places where you can live close to the beach, enjoy fantastic weather, and eat out regularly for the cost of living that’s found in Portugal.\n\nInviting Beaches\n\nPortuguese beaches, particularly those in the Algarve, have been voted as some of the best in the world. So if your dream is to spend your time soaking up the sunshine and listening to the waves, this is definitely the country for you.\n\nAs well as great beaches, Portugal also has several great surfing hubs such as Sagres, Ericeira, Nazaré, and Costa da Caparica.\n\nIf you’re planning on living inland, you don’t be disappointed either. Whether it’s the Douro, Gerês, Azores, Madeira, or Serra de Arrábida, Portugal has plenty of areas of natural beauty for you to enjoy.\n\nAffordable Healthcare\n\nParticularly for Americans and those outside of Europe, Portugal’s tax-funded healthcare system is a big attraction. There’s no need to worry about having the right insurance when you go to the hospital: access to public healthcare is considered a right.\n\nFor Europeans, Portugal’s healthcare system is less of a novelty and in reality it suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries: emergency healthcare is good, but waiting lists for non-urgent treatment can be long – sometimes more than a year or two.\n\nHowever, one area in which Portugal trumps many other European countries is in the cost of private healthcare. Health insurance and the cost of paying out of pocket are much lower than in many other European countries, and many expats are able to use the private system for the majority of their needs, which often allows them to access better quality healthcare than they would elsewhere.\n\nA large expat community\n\nHaving a large expat community has its downsides – as it means people tend to integrate more into expat communities than local communities – but it’s definitely a pro when you first move. You’ll instantly be able to get to know other people, people in the same boat as you, and it’ll be easy to get answers to questions you have about settling in Portugal.\n\nExcellent level of English\n\nEnglish is widely spoken in Portugal, particularly in the Algarve, Lisbon, Porto, and Madeira. In other parts of Portugal, English is less widely spoken but it still won’t take long to find someone that speaks English.\n\nAlthough your intention might be to learn Portuguese, and to learn it to a fluent level, knowing that other people are likely to speak English is very reassuring – particularly when you’re speaking to a doctor, for example.\n\nHowever, if you want to integrate even a little, you should definitely make an effort to learn Portuguese.\n\nEase of obtaining Portuguese citizenship\n\nAfter living in Portugal for five years, you’ll be able to apply for Portuguese citizenship. This is much faster than in many other European countries. You need to have lived for 10 years in Spain, for example, before you’re able to apply for Spanish citizenship.\n\nFantastic Food & Drink\n\nAt any Portuguese market, you’ll find a great variety of fish and seafood and excellent fruit and vegetables. Most large supermarkets, similarly, will also have a large fish counter. Price-wise fruit and veg is much cheaper than the US, and the quality is better. By European standards, it isn’t particularly cheaper but the quality is better than in many Northern European countries.\n\nEating out in traditional Portuguese restaurants is also extremely affordable, particularly at lunchtime. Here €10-15 can get you a 3-course meal complete with coffee and wine. International restaurants are more expensive and often non-existent in more rural parts of Portugal,\n\nLess variety and imported products are more expensive, but Great fruit and veg at the markets. Lots of great seafood and fish.\n\nPrices are considerably less than they are in the US but similar to other European countries.\n\nLess variety in terms of restaurants, but Portuguese restaurants are affordable. Also where there are foreign restaurants, e.g. Lisbon, great vegan and international restaurants\n\nCompelling Tax Schemes\n\nPortugal isn’t normally known for being a low-tax country, but in some cases it can be preferable to be a tax resident here. The most common is if you stand to benefit from Portugal’s NHR tax regime, which is a special tax regime aimed at newcomers and those returning to Portugal. It is particularly beneficial if you’re a high earner or have a particularly large pension but to be certain that you would benefit from it, you should speak to an accountant.\n\nAnother reason Portugal is considered attractive is its lack of a wealth tax, something which neighbouring Spain has and which can deter high net worth individuals from moving there.\n\nObtainable Residency Visas\n\nIf you don’t have an “EU Passport” and need a visa to move to a European country, Portugal can be very appealing for a number of reasons. Firstly, the visas are considered more attainable than other European countries: the D7, for example, requires you to have a regular income that’s at least more than €705 per month – an achievable amount for many people while the D2, or entrepreneurship visa, doesn’t specify a minimum investment amount.\n\nFor those that have cash to spend, the golden visa can be particularly appealing because it only requires you to spend an average of 7 days per year in Portugal in order to meet your residency requirements.\n\nFor many people, these attainable visas make Portugal a very attractive country as Portugal offers an easy route into Europe.\n\nShare this article\n\n0 shares Share\n\nTweet\n\nPinterest",

    "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal": "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal\n\nWidely considered to be the fourth club in a country dominated by ‘The Big Three’, SC Braga might just be on the cusp of breaking the hegemony in Portuguese football. Their excellent start to 2022-23 certainly has fans on the edge of their seats…\n\nSC Braga, under the tutelage of their new manager Artur Jorge, have started the season in spectacular form, both domestically and in European competition. Since drawing on the opening day of the Primeira Liga season at home to Sporting CP, Braga have gone on to win every single match – six in league, two in UEFA Europa League, scoring goals aplenty and attracting plaudits both in Portugal and across Europe for their breathtaking performances.\n\nPortugal’s Fourth Club\n\nBraga, particularly in the 21st century, have established themselves as Portugal’s fourth club. A club which strives to fight at the top of Portuguese football, battling to break through the glass ceiling to reach Os Tres Grandes or The Big Three, consisting of SL Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting CP. The last time they finished in the top three wasn’t too long ago, finishing third in 2019-20; a season where they took advantage of a Sporting CP that were seemingly in free-fall both off and on the pitch.\n\nBack in 2009-10, Braga recorded their best league campaign, finishing second under Domingos Paciência, picking up a fantastic 71 points and losing just three games all season. A year later, Braga managed to reach the UEFA Europa League final in Dublin, eventually losing to FC Porto 1-0 before Paciência was nabbed by Sporting CP in the summer. By and large though, Braga are usually found sitting just outside the top three, occupying fourth position. In fact, they’ve finished fourth in seven of the last 10 Portuguese top-flight seasons.\n\n2011 UEFA Europa League Final between Braga and Porto\n\nTheir electric start to 2022-23, however, has indicated that they may well be gunning to add another top-three finish to their record books. A key difference (and incentive) to note between the last time they went one further than the top three and finished second, is that due to Portugal’s coefficient ranking, Braga had to play UEFA Champions League qualifiers the following campaign in order to secure group stage football. This season however, a second-place finish would guarantee group stage football in Europe’s elite footballing competition, and third place would see them enter the qualifying rounds.\n\nNew Manager, New Ideas\n\nWhen Carlos Carvalhal, a manager who led Braga to a Taça de Portugal victory, consecutive fourth place finishes and to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals, left the club at the end of last season to “embrace a new project”, Braga didn’t look to replace him with a manager of similar profile and experience, but instead opted to hand the reigns to one of their own, in the form of Artur Jorge.\n\nJorge, an ex-Braga player, has spent the majority of his coaching career working at the club in one capacity or another, whether it be as working as manager of Braga B, with the club’s U23 side or working with the youth teams at the club’s academy, as well as experiencing a month in charge of the first team as caretaker manager in 2020.\n\nThis season, Jorge has moved Braga away from the 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 formation that they often utilised under Carvalhal and before that, Rúben Amorim. The Braga boss has instead opted for a more traditional 4-4-2, allowing Simon Banza and either Abel Ruiz or Vitinha to work off one another up top.\n\nInterestingly, Artur Jorge’s approach this season hasn’t been to try and emulate Benfica, Porto and Sporting, instead they’re playing their own brand of more direct football, and it’s working.\n\nBraga have had the joint most shots (19) and scored the most goals (5) from high turnovers in Portugal so far this season. They don’t press as high up the pitch as the big three, but they time their press to perfection and only seem to press the opponent in their defensive third when they think that they’ll get a shooting opportunity from doing so.\n\nField tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the field tilt numbers in the Primeira Liga this season, the stark difference between Braga and the big three becomes even clearer. Benfica are currently averaging 84.6%, Sporting CP 77.1% and FC Porto slightly less with 71.9%, Braga however are currently averaging only 57.5%, taking fewer touches in the opposition third and completing fewer passes in the opposition third, yet they lead the league for goals scored (23).\n\nAs the graphic above shows, Braga are averaging less passes per sequence than the big three. In fact, Braga’s 3.4 passes per open play sequence actually means they are currently closer to promoted Casa Pia and Rio Ave (3.1 and 3.0 pps respectively) in that regard than to Benfica and Sporting (4.4 and 4.3 pps).\n\nThis directness from Braga starts at the first whistle and is a key reason why they’ve often started games on the front foot. 26.% of Braga’s goals so far this season in the Primeira Liga have been scored inside the first 15 minutes. In the match against Famalicão, Braga effectively killed the game off after 18 minutes, scoring twice and then managing the game brilliantly, allowing Famalicão to have possession in safe areas and then intelligently choosing when to hunt the ball back without leaving themselves exposed.\n\nAs the numbers indicate, Braga’s efficiency so far this season has been a key reason for their success. In front of goal, they have been ruthless. In the space of just over two weeks, Braga beat Famalicão 3-0, Marítimo 5-0 and Arouca 6-0 – 14 goals from 28 shots on target, meaning half their shots on target were hitting the back of the net.\n\nSC Braga players have scored 23 goals (excluding own goals) from an expected goals total of just 15.1 – a league-high overperformance of 7.9.\n\nOf course, it helps considerably when your top players are creating chances and firing on all cylinders when in front of goal. In Braga’s case, Ricardo Horta and Simon Banza, as well as several others, have started the season in emphatic fashion for Artur Jorge’s side.\n\nBanza’s exploits last season at Famalicão (18 goals and seven assists) were enough for Braga to bring him to the Estádio Municipal and give the Frenchman a platform to perform at the top end of the table and so far, he hasn’t disappointed. In his first five games of the season, he scored five goals and provided one assist for Braga.\n\nAnother talented forward that Braga have at their disposal is the exciting 22-year-old striker Vitinha, who himself has three goals and one assist in just six starts. Vitinha is generally very involved in the game for a traditional striker, averaging a healthy 31.7 touches per game, putting in 1.6 tackles per game and making 1.1 clearances per game. It was Vitinha’s smart rebound against Bundesliga leaders Union Berlin which gave Braga all three points away from home in the UEFA Europa League, a goal that epitomised his striker’s instinct.\n\nWhilst Braga will be delighted at both Banza and the rest of the teams’ goalscoring exploits, they will undoubtedly be aware that their potency in front of goal will not last forever. Their xG overperformance of 7.9 is probably not sustainable in the long term, thus they will be expecting a bit of a crash in front of goal soon. For further comparison, the biggest overperformance of xG across the whole of last season in Portugal was 5.3 by Tondela, while Benfica followed with 3.7 goals more than their xG total.\n\nKeeping Hold of Ricardo Horta\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Braga’s superb start to the season without analysing their key man, the club’s all-time top scorer, the magnificent Ricardo Horta.\n\nThroughout the transfer window, Horta was the subject of a very publicised transfer saga linking him with a move to Lisbon giants SL Benfica, with The Eagles’ president Rui Costa admitting on several occasions that the club were very keen on signing the 28-year-old Portugal international. The interest in him was expected, Horta was hot off scoring 23 goals and providing 10 assists across all competitions, seeing him named in the Liga Portugal Team of the Season.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best players in the division, it seemed almost inevitable at times that Horta would depart, and Braga would have to pick up the pieces to begin a search for a solution to the gaping hole their most influential player exiting would leave behind.\n\nHowever, when the transfer window slammed shut, Horta was still a Braga player. The club and its passionate supporters breathed a collective sigh of relief.\n\nIf you thought for a moment that this very public courting of Horta would in any way affect his morale and his performances going forward for Braga, you would be sorely mistaken. He has started the season in simply electric form. Some players can either create chances or take chances, Horta does both consistently with equal efficiency. His 56 attacking sequence involvements puts him second in the league behind Enzo Fernandéz, but what is remarkable about Horta’s numbers is how evenly distributed they are, 16 involvements in the build-up to shot, 18 chances created, and 22 shots shows that Horta isn’t currently excelling in just one particular area, but instead he’s doing it across the board. In terms of solely chances created, no player has created more than Horta so far this season (20) and only two players have created more from open play than he has (16).\n\nHorta’s consistency and efficiency when creating and taking chances means he is currently the league leader for combined goals and assists with seven, consisting of four goals (second most in the league) and three assists (most in the league).\n\nHis importance to Braga becomes even more obvious when his numbers are compared to the rest of his Braga team-mates. He is their key man and if they are to remain on their upward trajectory and potentially fight for a top three position, keeping Horta fit and firing will undoubtedly be key.\n\nA Brilliant Start, but That’s All It Is\n\nArtur Jorge’s side displayed character and heart on the opening day against Sporting, coming back from behind three times to take a well-earned point. Another test came in the form of their Minho rivals Vitória SC. This was a big test for Braga, who at this point had won three successive matches without conceding a goal but wary that on derby day, form can go out of the proverbial window. The result? Braga won 1-0 courtesy of a Vítor Tormena winner in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time, which was nearly the final act of the match, with their rivals barely having time to kick-off. The best possible way to beat your fiercest rivals and maintain your winning streak.\n\nFast forward a few weeks to today and Braga remain unbeaten both domestically and in Europe, but they will not be getting carried away. A brilliant start is great, but it’s exactly that, a start. Their next match after the international break is a huge test of their credentials, a trip to the Estádio do Dragão to face defending champions FC Porto.\n\nSérgio Conceição’s men come into this one in poor form and lacking confidence, having won just twice in their last six matches in all competitions. On one hand, Braga will feel like it’s a great time to take on the Dragons, but on the other hand, this is a Porto side that will need no motivation, who know that defeat on the day will see them fall six points behind Braga.\n\nIf Braga are serious about usurping one of the big three, if only for this season, then it is in matches like this one that their credentials will really be examined. Lose and it’s not the end of the world, win and Braga fans will be in dreamland for yet another week.\n\nEnjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.",
    "Americans Moving To Europe: Portugal Still Top Place For Expats Despite Restrictions": "Portugal, a favorite among expats getty\n\nHousing prices, political divisions, high cost of living, the rise of remote work, crime rates in some U.S. cities, a strong dollar now at parity with the euro for the first time in more than 20 years — these are among the reasons experts mention to explain the wave of Americans relocating to Europe, or planning to do so in the near future.\n\nSome have other, more personal reasons such as love for the European way of life, the food, wine, a job or following family members who have already moved to the old continent.\n\nIn a recent article entitled “Americans Who Can’t Afford Homes Are Moving to Europe Instead,” Bloomberg writes that the traditional trends of retirees and the wealthy as the prime American buyers of real estate in Europe have changed: “Relatively cheap housing — particularly in smaller cities and towns — and the rise of remote work have made the continent alluring to a wider range of people, including those who are younger and find themselves priced out of the housing market at home.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Why Are Vienna And Six Other European Cities The Best In The World To Live In?\n\nAmericans’ high demand for houses in Europe\n\nDigital nomad working from a beach terrace getty\n\nInternational real estate businesses release data every day showing a growing interest from American buyers, particularly concerning Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, among others, that offer special deals for golden visas, digital-nomad visas, green visas and lower-cost housing.\n\nIn the past few years, Portugal appears at the top of most of the lists of places recommended for expats and retired people to enjoy a good life and its golden visa program is one of the most popular in the world.

    "The Argument for an Off-Season Portugal Trip": "7 items in this article 1 item on sale! Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Ariel Arce\n\nEveryone knows that person who spends weeks sniffing around travel blogs, going deep into Tripadvisor rabbit holes, collecting Google docs from friends of friends, and creating A Beautiful Mind–style spreadsheets to come up with the best vacations and itineraries possible. In this recurring series, we find those people who’ve done all the work for you and have them walk us through a particularly wonderful, especially well-thought-out vacation they took that you can actually steal.\n\nAriel Arce, owner of Tokyo Record Bar and Niche Niche, prefers to visit southern Europe during the off-season. She and her best friend (and partner in the founding of CaviAIR), Michelle Double, like to take easygoing road trips through seaside towns when they’re not mobbed by tourists. This past March, the pair headed to Portugal, during which they slowly meandered from Lisbon to the southern reaches of the country. Arce admits that her vacations “end up being these crazy drudges” of nonstop activities — filled with cave exploring, cliffside rock scrambling, and scootering around — which is why she highly recommends renting a boat for a day in the Algarve.\n\nDay 1\n\n11 a.m.: Scoot around Lisbon\n\nWe flew on a red-eye from New York and upon landing in Lisbon headed straight to the Hertz counter to pick up our car rental for the week: a gunmetal Mercedes convertible. Michelle and I love driving. Give us a fast luxury car, throw us the keys, and see ya! But because it was still quite early in the day, we decided to explore Lisbon for a few hours before our drive south. We hit up the legendary seafood restaurant Ramiro (Av. Alm. Reis 1 H, 1150-007) and ordered a massive plate of prawns, some crusty bread to dip into the garlicky sauce they’re cooked in, and a couple of beers.\n\nWe wanted to work off the beer so we rented scooters from the Uber app and giggled our way around Lisbon. We toured along the water promenade all the way out to the western district of Alcantara to check out LxFactory (R. Rodrigues de Faria 103, 1300-501), a modern outdoor food and shopping complex under one of the city’s many bridges. And then for absolutely conflicting vibes, we zoomed our way back into downtown Lisbon and up the steep cobblestone streets of Alfama, where we grabbed a caffeine pick-me-up at Copenhagen Coffee Lab (Escolas Gerais 34, 1100-213).\n\n5 p.m.: Settle into your eco villa and order pizza\n\nBy the time we reached our hotel for the night, it had been a long day so we decided to take it easy, and Villa Epicurea (R. do Casalinho 5A, 2970-052) — a 45-minute drive south of Lisbon — was the ideal place to do that. The property is tucked away into a forest that overlooks the water, and we stayed in one of their minimally decorated one-bedroom houses. We aren’t really “shared space” gals, but it was nice to see like-minded travelers at the pool or in the main house where you can cook a meal together. If you don’t want to make your own food (we didn’t), what’s cool about the Villa Epicurea is they have a board filled with places you can get delivery from. We ordered two pies from a local pizza place: Both had a super crispy thin crust, but one was a margherita and the other was a white pie with arugula and pistachio, which was pretty incredible.\n\nDay 2\n\n12 p.m.: Eat ceviche at a beach club in Comporta\n\nBefore we set off for the Algarve, we stopped by Comporta, a chic little beach town with waterfront restaurants and hotels, and an adorable downtown. It’s got a rustic vibe, too, because of the rice fields that surround all the development.\n\nWe had lunch at Sublime Comporta Beach Club (Praia do Carvalhal, 7570-782). The seafood on the menu was just exquisite. We gorged ourselves on ruby red tiger shrimp, oysters, and whatever ceviche they were serving at the time (with fish sourced from the Azores). In between dishes, we would walk around the sand and dip our toes in the water. (It was cold Atlantic water, but a few moments doesn’t hurt.) Everyone here is an angel. As soon as our waiter found out that I love spicy things, I had three different hot sauces in front of me, including the chef’s personal stash from Nepal.\n\n3 p.m.: Take coastal routes to the Algarve\n\nThe drive down to our resort in the Algarve should have taken about two hours if we stuck to the most straightforward route per Google Maps, but we tried to take as many coastal roads as possible, avoiding highways whenever we could so it took closer to three hours. But we also found ourselves driving through these stunning, dense forest roads that feel the way islands do when they’re by the water; there’s lots of sand, very tropical-esque foliage, and a quickly changing terrain. Everything looked wild and beautiful. It was definitely more of a casual drive. We were in no rush.\n\n6 p.m.: Check into a massive resort\n\nVila Vita Parc Resort & Spa (R. Anneliese Pohl, 8400-450) is a sprawling compound centered around a private beach, pools, a few restaurants, sports complexes, and a wellness center. For girls from a big city, a resort vacation wasn’t what we came for, but frankly, we didn’t want to leave. It was pretty stunning. We booked an apartment-style condo, which is a bit farther away from the main hub of the resort. This was the first time on our trip — after flying, driving, exploring — when we really started to relax.\n\nTo close out the day, we didn’t want to have a crazy dinner, but we did go to the main bar of the resort to indulge in a few too many gin-and-tonics by the fireplace.\n\nDay 3\n\n12 p.m.: Explore the seaside towns of the Algarve\n\nWe had a late start to the day, but that’s just the vibe down here in the Algarve, which isn’t very big so you can accomplish a lot of sightseeing in a short amount of time. Our first stop was Sagres, which is stuffed into the southwest corner of Portugal. It’s a very windy area and known for some of the best surfing in the world. We drove to Fortaleza de Sagres, which really feels like the end of the earth. All you see is water. We walked the coastline watching a bunch of people hit the waves.\n\nThere is a killer restaurant on the ocean called Boia Bar (R. dos Pescadores 101, 8650-199), in the tiny town of Budens, which is just 15 minutes east of Sagres. We ordered a massive bowl of razor clams and their famed Portuguese shrimp, cooked in chili, garlic, and olive oil galore (kind of like a piri-piri sauce).\n\n3 p.m.: Pick up ceramics and straw bags in Lagos\n\nLagos is one of the larger small towns and is far less sleepy than most of the other spots we hit on this adventure. It was great to walk around and get a taste for the colorful tile buildings that you won’t ever tire of when you’re in Portugal.\n\nThere’s some shopping to be had, too, and I ended up getting seduced into buying what looked like Ugg knockoffs at this cute store called Tamar (R. António Barbosa Viana 14 16, 8600-677), which stocks a ton of locally made merch like straw bags and ceramic housewares. Then, our next stop was just outside town: Ponta de Piedade, these golden rock formations jutting out of the water. We did attempt to scamper around some of them. It got a bit wild so I would suggest wearing sturdy, comfortable shoes.\n\nIf you don’t want to stay at a big resort like we did, I would recommend the stylish Casa Māe (R. do Jogo da Bola 41, 8600-712) here in Lagos.\n\n8 p.m.: Order a local fish platter\n\nVila Vita’s Japanese restaurant had a platter of different types of local fish, most of it was white fish, but they also had salmon and tuna that were sourced from the Azores. The chef even showed us the tags of the fish. We tossed these back with vodka martinis.\n\nDay 4\n\n10 a.m.: Sail around the Algarve\n\nWhen we were figuring out what we wanted to do on this trip, we knew we really wanted to rent a boat, and that’s one of the main reasons we booked Vila Vita; they have a yacht. The rate is around $1,000 for a full day, and you can have up to 8 people on the boat.\n\nOur captains were spectacular. They’ve been doing this for 30 years. But in addition to all that experience, they had such a great sense of humor. They were telling us all these crazy stories about the people they’ve taken on tours — including some pretty famous names. We had a couple of bottles of white wine, some grilled veggies, and, of course, pasteis de nata, the iconic egg custards. And then for several hours, we sailed around the coast visiting some of the Algarve’s most jaw-dropping spots.\n\nWe stopped at a bunch of different places: Praia de Carvoeiro, Marinha Beach, Arco Natural. But the best part was touring the 50-odd caves that are just outside the fishing village of Benagil. Our captains threw us into this dingy, and from there we just went exploring. It was kind of intense to see them maneuver this little thing in and out of tiny spaces as the tide was coming up and down, and you really think you’re going to run into these caves. And some of the caves would be totally pitch black while others would be bright and blue and there was one with a giant hole that looked up to the sky.\n\nYou can drive to all these different sights, of course, but the perspective you get from the water is just unbelievable. It was one of the highlights of our trip. I’ll never forget it.\n\n5 p.m.: Arrive at a fancy farm hotel\n\nAfter a full day out at sea, we couldn’t wait to retreat to our next hotel, Vila Monte Farm House (Calicos Site, 8700-069), which is located in the eastern half of the Algarve. Very close to the border with Spain, this part of the country is entirely less manicured than the western side, which is where a lot of the big luxury resorts are. But Vila Monte is just fabulous. The property, which is surrounded by fragrant olive groves, citrus trees, and the shocking pink of bougainvillea, is mostly white with these stunning pops of blues and greens. It’s very serene and rustic-chic. The pools were beautiful, too. It really looked like it was plucked out of Ojai.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to stay at the hotel. We ordered some beautifully grilled fish, and they also had fantastic pizza. Plus, you can drink your cocktails out on the lawn — paradise for two New Yorkers.\n\nDay 5\n\n9 a.m.: Stretch before breakfast\n\nThe hotel offers a lot of daily activities. So we woke up early to take Pilates and then enjoyed a lovely breakfast of local Portuguese fruits, charcuterie, some fantastic bread, and every nut milk you can imagine.\n\n1 p.m.: People-watch in the plaza\n\nIt takes less than two hours to drive the entire width of Portugal’s southern coast, but there are so many adorable places to visit. We started as far east as possible in Vila Real de Santo António, which is right on the border of Spain. It’s designed like a mini Lisbon and has this beautiful plaza that’s perfect for people-watching. We strolled around, marveling at the collection of buildings covered in gorgeous tiles of blues and greens. We popped into A Loja da Maria (Rua Jornal do Algarve 63), a home decor shop where we found ceramics that looked almost spotted in a cool tie-dye way. Then we drove to Altura, which reminded us a bit of a sleepy Jersey Shore town: It’s a very chill place, great for walking along the beach picking up seashells along the way.\n\n4 p.m.: Snack on French cheese and Portuguese wine\n\nOur last stop was Tavira, which is one of the more popular towns in eastern Algarve. The waterside promenade and beautifully manicured gardens make Tavira stand out from neighboring towns; they make it feel bigger, grander than a beach town, like you’re in a small-but-historic European city.\n\nWe were just scoping out the scene on foot, and Tchin-Cheese (R. da Liberdade 24, 8800-329) caught our eye. It’s a cute little wine-and-cheese shop (maybe four tables) from a French expat. It felt so different from any other restaurant that we had eaten at in Portugal up to that point. We got to chatting with the owner, who picked out a cheese platter and some natural local wines for us to try. Yes, a cheese-and-wine pairing is so trite, but it’s my favorite thing in the world, and we really vibed with the owner, whose taste is out of this world. We sat with him outside for longer than we expected. But when he recommended O Tonel (R. Dr. Augusto da Silva Carvalho 6, 8800-650) for a dinner of simply prepared octopus and more Portuguese white wine, we happily obliged.\n\nAriel’s Portugal packing list\n\nNike Air Force 1 ‘07 From $90 From $90 In this modern day, you can wear a pair of white Air Force 1s to dinner or when you’re out scaling rock formations in southern Portugal.

    "Portugal on a budget – Lonely Planet": "Portugal once had a sterling reputation as one of Europe’s most affordable destinations. Although prices have been on the rise in recent years (thanks in part to the nation’s growing popularity), you can still travel inexpensively here.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nPortugal’s parks and nature reserves are all free to visit, as is the wide array of trails and greenways. Starting the day with a bica (espresso) and a creamy pastel de nata (custard tart) will only set you back a few euros. The country also has many free museums and inexpensive attractions, from medieval architecture to cutting-edge contemporary art. If you’re thrifty, you can get by on as little as 50 euros a day.\n\nHere are some other key ways to cut costs while traveling in Portugal.\n\nFigure out the cheapest way to reach Portugal\n\nPortugal has international airports in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. Be sure to check prices at each before booking, as you may find better deals arriving in one or the other. If you’re considering combining a trip to Portugal with Spain, you might find cheaper rates flying into Madrid or even Sevilla, which is a two-hour train ride away from Tavira in southern Portugal.\n\nTake public transportation from the airport\n\nWhether you arrive in Lisbon, Porto or Faro, you can start your trip right by foregoing a pricey taxi ride and taking a bus or the metro to your destination. Handy metro service runs to city centers from Lisbon (red line) or Porto (violet line E). Faro’s airport has a quality bus service operated by Vamus Algarve. The Aerobus runs into Faro and also to Albufeira, Portimão and Lagos.\n\nInstead of using a rental car, opt to take the train or bus © Andrei Bortnikau / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDitch the car and get around by train or bus\n\nThe high cost of rental cars coupled with soaring fuel prices can make for a pricey trip to Portugal. You can save money and lower your carbon footprint by traveling the country by train and bus. Portugal’s rail line connects major cities from Valença in the north down to Faro in the south, running through Porto, Coimbra and Lisbon. Portugal’s bus network helps fill in the gaps and connects smaller towns.\n\nTicket prices are reasonable. For instance, the second-class train fare from Lisbon to Lagos (a 4.5-hour journey) is around €25, which is not much more than the price you’d pay on tolls alone by taking the A2 to get there.\n\nVisit from October to April to save on lodging\n\nIn spring and autumn, you’ll generally find pleasant weather in Portugal, with blooming wildflowers in March and April and changing leaves in October in some parts of the country. You’ll also notice thinner crowds and lower rates when it comes to accommodation. Prices are typically around 25% off high season rates.\n\nYou can save even more by visiting from November to February. This is the cheapest time of the year to visit Portugal, and many hotels slash their rates by 50% or more. Just be sure to pack for the weather adequately. Bring a rain jacket, scarf and warm layers for Porto and other destinations in the north. In the south, you’ll still find plenty of sunshine in the Algarve, with mild temperatures for outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\n\nMake lunch your biggest meal\n\nMany restaurants in Portugal offer good-value lunch specials. Always ask if there's a menu do dia (fixed menu) or prato do dia (daily special). Even high-end restaurants typically have lower-priced lunch menus.\n\nIn the evening, you can forego conventional dining for a picnic in the park, at a viewpoint or overlooking the seaside. A loaf of fresh bread, cheese, olives and a bottle of wine makes the perfect accompaniment to watching the sunset.\n\nConsider staying in a hostel\n\nPortugal has many of Europe’s most stylish hostels, some of which are set in historic buildings and feature upscale amenities like roof terraces, art-filled lounges or swimming pools. Rates start at around €22 per night ­– big savings over a traditional hotel. Many hostels also offer budget-friendly activities, like free walking tours or pub crawls and free or low-cost rentals of bikes, surfboards and other gear. Some even host communal dinners, which are a great way to meet other people while saving money in the process.\n\nEven beach destinations like the Algarve have fabulous deals © wundervisuals / Getty Images\n\nPlan your itinerary around less expensive destinations\n\nDon’t rule out visiting Portugal’s most appealing cities. Places like Lisbon and Porto have a wide range of accommodations, and you can find excellent prices if you’re willing to stay outside the center (or in a more centrally located hostel). You can also find inexpensive activities (free museums, neighborhood exploring), and you won’t spend much on transportation.\n\nThe Algarve also has good deals if you know where to look. If you don’t want to stay in a hostel, you’ll find some of the best prices in Faro and Portimão. The Algarve is also among the best places for budget-friendly activities: scenic walks along headland trails above the beach and frolicking in the waves won’t cost you anything.\n\nDine in a tasca, adega and other local haunts\n\nNo matter where you roam, you can eat well in Portugal without breaking the bank if you know where to look. Among the key places to seek out is the tasca, an old-fashioned eatery (often with a loyal local following) that serves up excellent daily specials (which are not always listed on the menu) as well as classic staples like bacalhau (codfish) dished up many different ways. Slightly more convivial are adegas, usually decorated with wine casks and serving up hearty, inexpensive meals along with carafes of very affordable wine.\n\nPicnicking with ingredients from a local market is a must in Portugal – and also a cheaper alternative to a restaurant © T.W. van Urk / Shutterstock\n\nBecome a picnic expert\n\nSprinkled throughout Portugal, you’ll find mercados (markets), where you can browse for cheeses, charcuterie, baked goods and other fare. When no market is near, head to the nearest supermarket, where you can also score Portuguese produce at rock-bottom prices. With a bit of strategic planning, you can make a fun day out of your food shopping and sightseeing, stopping at a scenic spot for a picnic along the way.\n\nPlan your days around free and low-cost activities\n\nSome of the best things to do in Portugal won’t set you back much. A trip on a tram around Lisbon or Porto offers a great view of dynamic neighborhoods without the cost or hassle of taking a guided tour. Many churches are free to visit, as are parks and miradouros (viewpoints). Be sure to budget in downtime at cafes, where you can linger over inexpensive drinks while making plans for the day or evening ahead.\n\nIn the Algarve, you can design a day of beach hopping, followed by sunset viewing at one of the region's fabled overlooks (like the Cabo de São Vicente). You can also explore the islands of the eastern Algarve, reachable by inexpensive ferries from Faro, Olhão and Tavira.\n\nAt some restaurants in Portugal, a glass of wine can cost as much as a bottle of water © Alexander Spatari / Getty Images\n\nOrder the house wine\n\nPortugal has some excellent, affordable wines you can enjoy over dinner by ordering the house wine (vinho da casa). You can order by the glass or a carafe (jarro), ranging in size from 0.25 liters (around two glasses) to 0.75 liters. At many family-run eateries, a glass of house wine costs about the same as a bottle of water.\n\nTake a walk\n\nMountains and rugged coastlines make a memorable backdrop to one of Portugal’s greatest free outings: hitting the trail. You can plan your whole trip around a famous multi-day walk – like the Rota Vicentina that passes along sea cliffs and over deserted beaches on Portugal’s southwest coast. Or you can base near one of Portugal’s nature reserves and go on a day hike over craggy hillsides, beneath medieval ruins and through old stone villages – all features you’ll find in the Parque Nacional Peneda-Gerês in Portugal’s northeast.\n\nDaily costs\n\nHostel room: €22-35\n\nBasic room for two: €50-80\n\nSelf-catering apartment (including Airbnb): from €80\n\nLisbon metro ticket: €1.50\n\nMeia de leite (café latte): €2-3\n\nBifana (pork cutlet sandwich): €3-5\n\nDinner for two: from €30\n\nBeer at the bar: €2-4.50",
    "Portugal’s Next Great Beach Vacation Destination: Ericeira": "The new Aethos Ericeira hotel Francisco Nogueira\n\nTo be fair, Portugal’s Ericeira, about an hour northwest of Lisbon, isn’t exactly some brand new discovery. It’s been on the radar for a while now—at least for surfers. Its waves are more accessible than the gigantic ones up the coast at Nazaré, but reliably interesting for a range of skill levels, which is why it’s Europe’s only “surf reserve.” But while the town itself retains a lot of the charm of the fishing village that it once was, its services have tended toward hostels, surf schools and cafés serving açaí and quinoa bowls.\n\nThat changed this summer with the opening of two new five-star hotels in the general surroundings of the town—not walking distance but within easy reach if you come with a car. (Call them Ericeir-ish.) Surfers are still more than welcome of course, but they also offer quite a lot to people who don’t care about chasing waves. And, joining with the existing hotel You and the Sea, they’re set to change the appeal and perception of Ericeira.\n\nTo be sure, Ericeira is unlikely to become the new Comporta, at least not anytime soon. But now it’s turning into a place that promises its own brand of slow travel. It’s a destination for people who appreciate nature (not just beaches), stylish design, quality materials and good food, but without the glamour or the need to see and be seen.\n\nImmerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe first hotel to change the perception and position of Ericeira is Immerso (as in “immersion in nature”), which opened earlier, and which is built into a hillside to help it blend into its surroundings and to ensure that each of the 37 rooms has an excellent ocean view, especially at sunset. In fact, the television is to the side of the bed, making it a bit awkward to watch—the idea is to look straight ahead, out the window, instead.\n\nThe design, by Portuguese architect Tiago Silva Dias and designers Alexandra Almeida d’Eca (one of the founders of the hotel) and Bárbara Neto, is simple, with concrete floors, woven rugs in natural colors, organic shapes, artisan furnishings and textures from the land and sea. They worked a number of artists on items for the rooms, indoor lounge, long terrace and pool deck and fire pit.\n\nThe spa is more ambitious than it needs to be, with heat and wet areas, three treatment rooms and a menu of services based on the vegan, natural skincare brand Vinoble Cosmetics. The massage list ranges from Japanese shiatsu to hot stones to Ayurveda.\n\nEmme restaurant at Immerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe restaurant, Emme, also takes its cues from the hotel owners’ conscious, local and natural philosophy. Dogma aside, its quite good, with a brief but tasty menu, a lively relaxed dining room and snappy service. The consulting chef is Alexandre Silva, who holds a Michelin star at his Lisbon restaurant Loco and earned a reputation for his excellent cooking with fire at Lisbon’s Fogo and the Alentejo’s Craveiral FarmTable.\n\nExecuted here by resident chef Paulo Pedro (ex-Fortaleza do Guincho), the menu is strong on local fish and seafood—the trio of oysters is an excellent starter, and the simple main courses are tasty—with some vegetables from the organic kitchen garden and saline-tasting plants from the sea mixed in. The spread for the breakfast buffet is well above average. When it opens later this autumn, Emme on Fire will be an outdoor, communal dining experience based on food cooked over an open fire—what they’re calling a “medievally festive” experience.\n\nBy coincidence, Immerso was joined last week by Aethos Ericeira, an unrelated hotel that also happens to prioritize consciousness, nature, community, wellness and design. On top of a 130-foot-high cliff in a nature reserve, it has spectacular natural light and lovely views over the Atlantic. It’s part of the the Aethos group (after the Greek “ethos,” or characteristic spirit of a culture), a collection of members clubs and boutique hotels in Europe that was founded by a pair of international serial entrepreneurs who want to create a “global family of conscious explorers.”\n\nThe lounge at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAt the Ericeira hotel, which was designed by the Barcelona studio Astet and Portuguese architect Luís Pedra Silva, that means 50 suites and rooms that blend natural tones, materials and textures with the clean lines and soft simplicity of modernist design. The premium rooms have glorious views over the ocean, sometimes with private terraces.\n\nAt the restaurant, Onda (“wave”), chef Afonso Blazquez and his team focus on shareable, sustainable fish and seafood from the surrounding coast, with plenty of vegetables in the mix. The dinner menu includes dishes like asparagus with fresh green curry, bergamot gel and sourdough croutons, and squid “noodles” with pickled mushrooms and dashi. The oysters here are excellent as well.\n\nIn line with the Aethos philosophy, there’s a strong wellness component, including a spa that uses organic products from Sweden’s Under the Skin brand, a gym with expert trainers, yoga classes with world-class instructors, a meditation deck overlooking the Atlantic and a stone-trimmed saltwater pool. But this Ericeira—and surfing checks quite a few of those same wellness boxes. (I dare you to think about anything other than surfing when you’re doing it.)\n\nA guest room at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAnd Aethos being a five-star hotel, it has its own luxury take on the sport. It has a dedicated surf concierge, onsite storage facilities for boards and wetsuits, and onsite rentals. It also has a relationship with Joana Andrade, Portugal’s first female big wave surfer and champion several times over. She also started Portugal’s first female surf school in 1998, and continues to coach professionals as well as beginners.\n\nAethos guests of any skill level can book a private session with her and accomplish quite a lot in terms of skills and especially confidence in a short time. It’s a luxury version of surfing for sure, and also very much in line with the new direction of Ericeira.",
    "This Coastal Town in Portugal Is a Hidden Gem — With Scenic Beaches, Beautiful Architecture, and Few Crowds": "When you hear about Portugal, popular cities like Lisbon and Porto or the beautiful beaches of the Algarve region likely come up. However, the country known for its spectacular seafood, award-winning wines, and milder temperatures is also full of natural, cultural, and historical wonders.\n\nLocated under an hour from Lisbon, Azenhas do Mar is a stunning coastal town with just about 800 inhabitants. It's situated on top of a cliff by the sea, with white houses that exude a Greek feel.\n\nHenrique Feliciano Photography/Getty Images\n\nBefore entering the village, stop at the lookout opposite to observe the Portuguese jewel. If the day is warm and the sea calm, it can be a tempting invitation to bathe in the natural pool at the base of the rocky wall, allegedly carved in the mid-20th century. When the tide is high, the pool becomes invisible, and you'll see only the waves crashing against the immense cliff.\n\nthenorthernmonkey/Getty Images\n\nThe origin of the village is not fully known, but it is linked to the several water mills called azenhas, which gave the place its name; it is speculated the first water mills here were from the Arab occupation period. The local tradition had agriculture, milling, fishing, and shellfish gathering as its main activities, and its development as a seaside resort only happened in the mid-1930s, when the Sintra tramway was inaugurated. If you're in the historical center (Sintra), a trip to Azenhas will take between 15 and 20 minutes by bus; it's also possible to visit the famous Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point in continental Europe, on the same day.\n\nAndré Aram\n\nIn addition to admiring the scenery, visitors can taste regional delicacies during their trip. Next to the ocean pool lies a popular restaurant set into the rock with several seating options, one of them open with a view of the sea. Besides the beach, it's fascinating to walk around the village, observing the buildings that follow a \"soft Portuguese\" trend, a local architectural style.\n\nOverall, Azenhas do Mar is a picturesque place, ideal for relaxing, enjoying the beautiful vistas, appreciating the silence, and visiting without haste. It's even possible to stay overnight in one of the houses in the village, available on specific sites for seasonal rentals.\n\nAndré Aram\n\nThe Azenhas do Mar landscape is like a postcard, still unknown to many foreigners and popular among the Portuguese, so much so that it has served as inspiration for renowned writers like José Saramago, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The place is perfect for a relaxing getaway, to feel and listen to the energy of the sea, away from the crowds.",

The placards read \"Lithium Not\". REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nLISBON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Portugal will not commit to setting a new date for a long-awaited auction of lithium mining licences as it awaits the conclusion of ongoing environmental impact studies at two sites, Energy Secretary Joao Galamba said on Wednesday.\n\nThe southern European nation, which has 60,000 tonnes of known lithium reserves, is central to Europe's bid to secure more of the battery value chain and cut reliance on imports.

    "Fernandes unleashed! Portugal winners, losers and ratings as Man Utd star makes up for Ronaldo disasterclass": "Winner: Bruno Fernandes\n\nWhat a performance! Truly unleashed by the midfield duo behind him, Fernandes roamed to all the right spots with Portugal in possession, posing constant danger with his movement and passing vision.\n\nRonaldo wasted two would-be assists in the first half, but no worries, Fernandes scored himself after a dart towards goal that Mario Rui picked out with a well-timed cross and contributed to the build-up on Dalot's opener, before assisting him for another goal in the second half.\n\nWinner: Diogo Dalot\n\nA second strong showing from a Manchester United player here, and one that cements his place as a starting line-up contender who could allow Joao Cancelo to play on the left side.\n\nDalot did the hard work on his first goal, carrying the ball from the midfield into the attacking third before making a smart run into the box to finish Leao's cut-back pass. His second strike was even better. He dribbled neatly in traffic onto his left foot and swung a long shot around the goalkeeper.\n\nPortugal's big hope at the World Cup is for their individual dynamism to create chances against even the strongest of defences. Dalot has been overlooked as a player who can contribute to those moments of magic, but he's demonstrated he has that ability in him.\n\nWinner: Rafael Leao\n\nGetting the start was a big confidence lift, and he didn't let his manager down.\n\nLeao is in a tough fight for a starting spot in the attack, battling Diogo Jota for the position and perhaps behind in the pecking order entering Saturday's match. He made a decent argument that he deserves the role - even though he is still without a senior goal in his Portugal career.\n\nThe AC Milan star sent Fernandes into open space with a nice first-half pass, the move ultimately leading to a goalscoring chance for Ronaldo. He then assisted Dalot after a sprint to collect the ball before it rolled past the byline.\n\nYes, he was sloppy at times, and yes, Jota did score off the bench. But Leao looks better now than he did at the very start of his career under Santos, and his manager clearly wants to give him every opportunity to succeed.",

Here’s one from a more leftfield team, promising unique country-in-the-city ambiance: Hotel das Amoreiras, on one of the most photogenic squares in the (already pretty ready for its close-up) enclave of Príncipe Real. Pedro Oliveira and Alicia Valero brought experience in private banking and luxury marketing respectively to their dream of opening a very small, special hotel. In 2016, returning home after stints in London and Switzerland, they found just the site: two adjoining townhouses for sale on the garden Oliveira had grown up playing in.\n\nThe façade of the Hotel das Amoreiras © Francisco Nogueira (2) ...and its bar and restaurant\n\nBesides the two huge suites that take up the entire joined third floor of the hotel, 17 further rooms fill the first and second ones.

In June, Immerso opened here, bringing a high-bar hospitality that privileges wellness and local experiences (artisan visits and, yes, surf lessons) to the enclave. Now it’s the turn of Aethos, a hotel/nomadic traveller-private members’ club concept based in Milan that also has small boutique hotels in Umbria and Corsica (and will soon add Lisbon and Mallorca to the portfolio as well).\n\nThe ocean suite at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nOnda restaurant at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nThe 46 rooms and four suites at Aethos Ericeira hover cliffside in a sleek three-storey building some 40m above the ocean.

There, on behalf of those hundreds of people, dedicated Church members went through the sacred ceremonies that the Church of Jesus Christ believes will unite families forever.\n\nThis, the Apostle said, shows the big heart of the Portuguese people.\n\n“They are open to help and support each other,” he said. “This man came to me without any request but trying to share his love with me through his work on family history. … That was one of the great miracles that we experienced here in this country.”\n\nElder Soares said his grandparents brought their Portuguese traditions with them when they immigrated to Brazil. One of those traditions was gathering frequently with family on any occasions.\n\nSoares-Portugal-Ministry-Visit Elder Ulisses Soares of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles greets a young girl at a special stake conference in Lisbon, Portugal on Sunday, September 11, 2022. 2022 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

And that’s how I grew up. That’s how I was raised by my parents that brought that piece of culture of my grandparents to me.”\n\nElder Soares’ parents joined the Church of Jesus Christ in 1965, when he was 6. Without his grandparents’ move to Brazil, Elder Soares may not have encountered the Church until at least 1975, when the Church was established in Portugal.\n\nElder Soares credits his maternal grandparents, Christians of another faith, for cultivating his mother’s own believing heart that prepared her to become a Latter-day Saint.\n\n“And now I am here, back in this beautiful country where my grandfather was born, sharing my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ with this marvelous people,” he said.\n\nOn this meaningful ministry visit, the Soareses, accompanied by other Church leaders, touched the hearts of many Latter-day Saints and friends of the faith in special meetings with young single adults and missionaries.\n\n“We connected with our family roots here; our grandparents on both sides, on my side and on my wife’s side, were Portuguese,” Elder Soares explained to the group of young people. In a spirit of a worldwide culture unity, Elder Soares said smiling: “You can now say that one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ is Portuguese because I received my Portuguese citizenship three years ago. So, now I’m a real Portuguese.”\n\nIn a concluding meeting that was broadcast to congregations across the country and to the island nation of Cabo Verde, Elder Soares taught, “With all of our preoccupations, with all the challenges, with all the attacks by the adversary, how is it possible that we can survive all this, overcome our challenges and be happy? Brothers and sisters, the Savior’s invitation to us is to turn our hearts to Him. That is the way to find happiness in this life. ”\n\nElder and Sister Soares said they were moved by the warm welcome home they received and gratified by the strength and faith they witnessed among their Portuguese brothers and sisters.\n\n“[We] always pray that the gospel will go everywhere on this earth,” Sister Soares said. “I always pray that it really reaches all parts of Portugal so that all people have the same privilege that we have to hear and feel the beauty of the gospel. We have a temple in Portugal, and this is one of the greatest blessings we can have.”"
