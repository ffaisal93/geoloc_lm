    "As wildfires grow, militaries are torn between combat, climate change": "Climate & Environment As wildfires grow, militaries are torn between combat, climate change Militaries around the world are fighting a new enemy: wildfires, floods and extreme heat. A Slovenian Army helicopter carries water with a bambi bucket to the wildfire near Debni Vrh in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Aug. 18. (Špela Škulj for The Washington Post)\n\nListen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nKOSTANJEVICA NA KRASU, Slovenia — The wildfire was exploding across Slovenia’s dry mountainsides, burning up pine trees and blotting out both the sun and the ground. Lieutenant Colonel Aleš Ogrinc needed to call on all his military training as he steered his combat helicopter toward the flames to drop a payload of water.\n\nIn his 30-year career, he had deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo. This time the enemy was Slovenia’s largest-ever blaze, during the hottest European summer on record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You have different motivations,” Ogrinc said. “If you’re in Afghanistan or Iraq, that’s a common goal, but here you are fighting for your home, for your country.”\n\nEuropean militaries are fighting fires this summer that are burning with ever greater scope and intensity, battling record blazes across a continent that is also seized by war in Ukraine and the need to defend against an increasingly dangerous Kremlin. From the high cliffs of Portugal to the stony mountains of Greece, militaries have been the wildfire responders of last resort, bringing air resources and logistical capabilities that far outmuscle their civilian counterparts.\n\nThe twin problem — the war in Ukraine and natural disasters tied to global warming — underscores how climate change can weaken social stability, even when challenges at first glance appear unrelated. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is making it harder for European militaries to fight wildfires — and the worsening wildfires are making it harder for the militaries to respond to the Kremlin.\n\n“In this situation with Ukraine and wildfires, we are in a dilemma how to balance,” Major General Robert Glavaš, the commander of Slovenia’s military forces, said in an interview. “At one point you need to decide what is important, this or that.”\n\nThe challenge is also increasing in the United States, where National Guard members devoted more than 172,000 personnel days to fighting fires last year, compared to 18,000 in 2019, according to U.S. Army figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the task is especially pressing in Europe, where militaries shrank for years following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Now they are scrambling to expand to counter the threat of a possible Russian invasion and to rush aid to Ukraine to keep it in the fight. Some generals say that in a warming world, militaries will increasingly have to go beyond their traditional combat-focused operations to face climate-driven demands, such as responding to fires and floods.\n\n“The role of the military will not just be about fighting future enemies, but also about supporting civil authorities in dealing with the effects of climate change,” said Tom Middendorp, a former top commander of the Dutch military who is now chairman of the International Military Council on Climate and Security, a research group that focuses on the security consequences of global warming.\n\nSlovenian defense leaders decided this month to cancel a $343 million purchase of armored troop carriers as they contemplate buying more aircraft that could be used to fight fires. The discussions aren’t directly connected, but policymakers also say they need to make the best use of limited resources. The country donated 35 Yugoslav-era infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine in June.\n\nSlovenian leaders say they need to prepare their military for a future in which there are more intense wildfires. They want to make it easier for the armed forces to get involved in disaster deployments. And they want to invest in military equipment that can also be used for firefighting.\n\nSlovenia’s defense spending is among the lowest in the NATO security alliance, at 1.22 percent of gross domestic product annually. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Slovenian policymakers pledged to reach the NATO guideline, 2 percent, by 2030. They say they need to be ready for wildfires and to increase conventional combat preparedness at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There will be these disasters of fires or floods. It will be more and more common,” Defense Minister Marjan Šarec said in an interview. “We must spend our money for everything that is needed. Because safety has no price.”\n\n“It’s not a dilemma of cannons or butter,” said Šarec, who has also been a volunteer firefighter. “As a serious country we must do both.”\n\nBut military leaders say the dual-headed challenge can sometimes be significant, and even contradictory.\n\n“Our training is going on in a military way. Exercises. How to use military equipment, how to fight, how to protect. How to defend,” said Glavaš, the head of Slovenia’s military command. “When you stop this training and you go to civilian tasks you need to focus your mind from fighting to something else. It’s very hard sometimes.”\n\nHe said that fighting fires “definitely” had an impact on combat readiness.\n\nSo far this year, wildfires have consumed almost 3,000 square miles of territory in the 27 nations that make up the European Union — far outpacing the previous maximum of 2,300 square miles as of Sept. 17. Europe began collecting wildfire data in 2006.\n\nThis year’s wildfires are nearly three times bigger than the average between 2006 and 2021. For weeks from June through August, heat domes settled across Europe, snapping temperature records, causing droughts and turning the continent’s forests into kindling.\n\n“We have witnessed this summer an alarming acceleration and spread of wildfires,” Janez Lenarčič, the European Union’s top official for crisis management, told top European policymakers this month. He has pushed to expand the pool of E.U.-funded planes available for firefighting. “All these disasters are reinforced by the new reality of climate change, and we need to tackle that jointly.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fire in Slovenia started July 17 in the mountains that push up against the village of Kostanjevica na Krasu, a settlement of about 300 people who live around a few winding streets. The town is perched in the Karst region, which borders Italy. The area is forbidding. Its dry rocky soil makes farming a challenge. The wind blows so fiercely that locals must weigh down their clay-tiled roofs with rocks to keep them from tumbling away. And locals know not to stray too far from established trails because fighting in World War I was so fierce that the hills there are still peppered with unexploded ordinance.\n\n“It was obvious it was going to be a hard summer, fire-wise, but we were not prepared for this,” said Boris Budal, the deputy commander of the fire brigade in nearby Sezana, which helped battle back the flames. “This outgrew our capabilities.”\n\nThis year the pine forests were dry and the underbrush was unkempt, perfect fuel for a fire that quickly gusted out of control. At night, the wind whipped the fire in one direction. Once the sun rose, the air started going another way, helping to spread it across the mountainsides. Immature pine cones heated up and popped open with flames. And on the ground, the leftover munitions kept exploding, making it impossible for firefighters to enter the forests by foot.\n\nThe fire needed to be fought from the sky — so the military was called in to supplement civilian firefighting aircraft with helicopters and heat-imaging drones. In the end, seven nations deployed their militaries to help Slovenia, including three that border Ukraine and have been nervous about the war spilling over their borders. Slovakia sent a Black Hawk military helicopter. Romania sent three air force planes. Hungary sent two combat helicopters with a crew of 13 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA helicopter crew “just departed to #sLOVEnia to help our allies and close friends to fight huge #wildfires #StrongerTogether #WeAreNato,” Slovakian Defense Minister Jaro Nad tweeted at the time.\n\nOn the ground, soldiers organized many of the firefighting logistics, including driving tankers of water close to the front lines and cooking meals for civilian firefighters and displaced residents. More than 200 members of Slovenia’s armed forces were deployed on the ground, of a total military force of about 5,900.\n\n“The whole cooperation with the military was larger than ever before,” said Budal, who has been a firefighter for 40 years.\n\nNo one died in the fire, but it consumed 15 square miles of forest in Italy and Slovenia. On the Slovenian side, it was triple the size of the previous record.\n\n“A neighbor called me to say, ‘The fire is approaching the village, you should come right away. But I can’t guarantee your house will still be there,’ ” said Marjana Lavrič, a local journalist who lives in Brestovica pri Komnu, a valley village just over a mile from the Italian border. From the garden where she grows grapes, lavender and rosemary, the charred trees are less a hundred yards up steep, rocky hills.\n\nShe said that even after the immediate threat of the fire had passed, it was still possible to see the trees smoldering as she watched from her house, a 19th-century former seminary, at night. Weeks later, among the charred trees, plants had already begun to sprout, including spindly green stalks of wild asparagus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResidents said they appreciated the help from the military — even if some of them said they were skeptical of military spending more broadly.\n\n“We really thought the village was going to burn down,” said Maja Visenjak Limon, a freelance translator who lives in Hudi Log, a settlement of a few houses at the summit of a steep, switchback road, which was completely enveloped by flames. “I was told they were going to try to wet around the house with the water they had left.”\n\nShe and her husband were told to evacuate three times. Each time, they thought they might never see their home again. They could see a military helicopter making runs out their back windows. But in the end, they — and their possessions — survived.\n\n“A lot of people say, ‘Do we really need a military force? It can’t be big enough to do any damage,’ ” Visenjak Limon said. “People were saying, at last they’re finally doing something.”\n\nSecurity policymakers say they recognize the growing challenge of responding both to traditional threats, such as Russia, and faceless ones, such as climate change. NATO has made climate change an increasingly central part of its discussions in recent years at the same time it has been scrambling to respond to the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Climate change poses a serious risk to countries in the alliance, and we need to use our collective power to address that risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, a former top U.S. intelligence official focused on climate change who is now the director of the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington-based research center. “I think that does create some debate or tension between countries in NATO as they work it out.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis summer, Sikorsky started keeping a record on Twitter of countries that deployed their militaries to fight fires, floods or other climate-related natural disasters. Her list, so far, is 49 emergencies long, from Argentina to Pakistan to Bulgaria to Jackson, Miss.\n\n“You’re seeing it more and more in all different parts of the world,” Sikorsky said.\n\nSome experts warn that if militaries are increasingly getting pulled into natural disasters, they need to do more planning.\n\n“It’s really a question of organization. Are we going to use the military as a backup? Some people think that’s wise,” said Alice Hill, who worked on climate change and resilience on the Obama-era National Security Council and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If you’re using that as a backup, what happens if those needs grow exponentially, as they are doing?”\n\nNejc Trušnovec contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Slovenia to scrap Boxer deal, seek other armored vehicles": "WARSAW, Poland — The Slovenian Ministry of Defence has announced the country’s government will cancel a deal to purchase 45 Boxer armored vehicles with related equipment and services for a total of €343.4 million ($343 million) from the intergovernmental Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).\n\nLjubljana instead intends to seek other options to acquire eight-wheel-drive vehicles for its land forces, according to officials.\n\n“By the end of the year, the ministry will prepare a solution to develop the capabilities of a medium battalion battle group and a medium combat reconnaissance battalion,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe latest decision is based on the findings of an internal audit commissioned by Defense Minister Marjan Šarec last June after a new government took over power in Ljubljana.\n\n“There is a trend to buy off-the-shelf vehicles, when you buy a vehicle, you put it on the road and drive it. You don’t buy a vehicle and have to buy this and that,” the minister told local broadcaster RTV Slovenija.\n\nŠarec was referring to the Boxer’s selected specification which did not include all of the equipment required by the ministry in the vehicle’s tag price, according to the internal audit’s findings.\n\nIf Slovenia were to proceed with the purchase of 45 Boxers, the ministry would be forced to buy at least 24 more armored vehicles to ensure sufficient capacities for a medium battalion battle group, the defense minister said.\n\nSlovenia’s 2020 defense white paper states that, under the country’s commitments to NATO, the first battalion battle group is to be established by 2027, and the second one by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry’s decision has been criticized by Matej Tonin, Šarec’s predecessor and currently an opposition lawmaker. Tonin tweeted on Sept. 18 “the Slovenian military has confirmed all the tactical-technical characteristics and configurations of the vehicle” selected by the previous Cabinet.\n\nSimilarly to a number of Eastern European allies, Slovenia accelerated its efforts to purchase new armored vehicles for its military following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which began on Feb. 24.\n\nJaroslaw Adamowski is the Poland correspondent for Defense News.",

    "Slovenia Is Giving Ukraine Some Very Old Tanks. But Age Can Be Deceiving.": "M-55S. Via Globalsecurity.org\n\nSlovenia has announced it’s sending to Ukraine some very old tanks. As in, 70 years old, if you’re simply dating the original design.\n\nBut age might be deceiving in this case. The soon-to-be-ex-Slovenian tanks aren’t half-bad—especially compared to some of the museum pieces the Kremlin has sent to its own forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe tank is the M-55S. It’s a 1950s-vintage Soviet T-55 with upgrades. Lots of upgrades. Slovenian prime minister Robert Golob in a telephone conversation with German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday hammered out a deal whereby Germany would give Slovenia 40 military transport vehicles—and Slovenia in turn would supply 28 M-55Ss to Ukraine.\n\nThe M-55S is not the Slovenian army’s main tank. That would be the much newer M-84. The M-55Ss are in reserve.\n\nOn paper, a T-55—any T-55—is a hopelessly obsolete tank. While still popular in the developing world, the T-55 long ago disappeared from front-line units in reasonably modern armies.\n\nBut it’s a cheap and reliable platform. And a solid foundation for ambitious upgrades—few more ambitious than the M-55S. In the late 1990s, the Slovenian army paid Israeli firm Elbit and STO RAVNE in Slovenia to modify 30 T-55s. The companies delivered the last example in 1999.\n\nThe M-55S has a stabilized, British-made L7 105-millimeter main gun in place of the original Soviet 100-millimeter gun. The British gun is compatible with a wide range of modern ammunition, including armor-piercing sabot rounds that can penetrate the armor of a modern-ish T-72.\n\nTo point the gun, Elbit installed a new fire-control computer that allows the M-55S to shoot while moving. A T-55 normally stops before firing.\n\nA T-55 has four crew—a commander, gunner, loader and driver. Only the gunner can aim the gun. The M-55S adds an independent sight for the commander so they can aim the gun, too.\n\nFor protection, the M-55S adds a laser-warning system that alerts the crew and deploys smoke grenades when an anti-tank missile is incoming. The Slovenian tank also has a new armor mix—explosive reactive blocks on top of passive armor.\n\nFinally, a new engine with 600 horsepower, giving the 36-ton tank roughly the same mobility as a T-72. All that is to say, the M-55S isn’t really a T-55. It’s the bones of a T-55 with a new brain, new muscles and new skin.\n\nAnd it should be a match for many of the Russian tanks in Ukraine—especially older T-72s as well as the T-62s the Kremlin pulled out of storage this summer to try to make good some of its losses.\n\nTwenty-eight M-55Ss are enough for one battalion. It’s unclear when the ex-Slovenian tanks might arrive in Ukraine, and how quickly Ukrainian crews can train on their new-old tanks.",

I’ve already written two articles about our amazing bike tour through Slovenia, Austria, and Italy (one about biking in the pouring rain and one about biking three countries in a single morning). But, my heart will always be tender for one special night that combined local stories and customs with the unbridled joy of someone who felt like everyone’s long-lost Slovenian grandmother.\n\nMy husband Dean and I love to bike, and we signed up for VBT’s seven-day guided bike tour through Slovenia, Austria, and Italy.

With guidance, we took a piece of bread, dipped it in the salt, and ate it. This greeting meant that a friendship had been forged between us, but at the time, I had no idea how deep and lasting these feelings would be.\n\nOur VBT guide, Ajda, greeted the little grandma with a kiss on the cheek. They must be good friends; they were so kind to each other. It was endearing.\n\nNote that I’m just going to refer to this darling older woman as Grandma. I assure you, I mean it affectionately. She was a delight.\n\nAfter our salt greeting, we went into the old Slovenian house — now a museum. Grandma welcomed us in Slovenian, the only language she spoke (although I think she was fluent in kindness and hospitality), and Ajda easily translated. Grandma exuded so much love and joy as she proudly told us about her country and heritage.\n\nGetting the dumpling dough just right Photo credit: Matt Thompson / VBT\n\n3. Helping To Prepare Slovenian Dumplings\n\nThrough Ajda’s translation, Grandma talked about making a traditional Slovenian dumpling with cheese inside. Then, she asked us to come up, one at a time, and “help” her make it (I’m sure she could make it in her sleep). The tender dough was eventually shaped into half moons, and the tops were crimped like pie crust.\n\n4. The House/Museum Tour\n\nAfter the cooking demonstration, an older man took us room by room and explained the history of the home, the families who lived there, and their way of life. We went into a small room that had been used for smoking and drying meats — it had a very black ceiling, with thick sausages hanging from the beams.\n\nThe mythical Krampus Photo credit: Joan Sherman\n\nKrampus\n\nIn the corner of one room, I couldn’t help but notice a rather stuffed, rather scary looking creature. According to Slovenian custom, Krampus is a horned, half-goat, half-devil figure. As the legend goes, at Christmastime, he punishes children who have misbehaved. I guess he’s the alter-ego to good old St. Nick!\n\nSlovenika sign Photo credit: Joan Sherman\n\n5. The Barn\n\nNext, we were led to a small barn on the property. It was a big, open room with wooden benches along the sides and a large floor in the middle (suitable for music and merry-making, games, jigs, and come what may).\n\nThe Cowbells\n\nWe were each handed a large or small cowbell decorated in alpine flowers and patterns. Accompanied by the accordion player, Grandma led us in song and actions. When she raised her right hand, those with large cowbells rang them. When she raised her left hand, those with small cowbells rang those. Chaos? No, it was wonderful!\n\nThe men getting competitive in the Slovenian hat game Photo credit: Joan Sherman\n\nThe Hat Game\n\nOur other VBT biking guide, Matija, invited the men to play a hat game. Four volunteers stepped forward: Dean and Kevin were brothers in a competitive game — what could go wrong? George from California and Scott from Connecticut participated as well.\n\nMatija passed out black hats, and he explained how the game was played. The men stood in a circle — their left arm on the shoulder of the man to their left. As the accordion player provided music, they reached over with their right hand to remove the hat from the man to their right and put it on their own head.\n\nLike musical chairs, when the music stopped, the man with no hat on his head was out. As the game progressed, Scott, George, and Matija were out.\n\nThen there were two: the competitive brothers! The accordion player started to play, and there may or may not have been a brotherly shove and a desperate grab at a brother’s hat. The music stopped and somehow, Dean had two hats on his head and Kevin had none. They announced Dean as the winner. Grandma stepped up, Dean kissed her hand, and they did a little jig together. Adorable!\n\nThe National Anthem And Firewater\n\nA little background: we started this vacation with a pre-trip in Ljubljana, which included a tour by VBT guide, Samo. During that tour, someone asked him if he’d sing the Slovenian national anthem for us. He suggested we ask our biking guides (Ajda and Matija) whom we would meet when the cycling portion of the trip began (I think, in a good-natured way, he was setting them up).\n\nThroughout the trip, we had asked Ajda about singing the national anthem, and she said she would. Now, the time had come. As part of this salute, we were offered a shot of strong liquor — another Slovenian hospitality. We held the shot glasses while they sang and would toast at the end.\n\nThe accordion player played the music, and Ajda and Grandma sang their national anthem for us. Their eyes were shining, and they sang out strong and true. Don’t tell anyone, but I’m pretty sure I saw Matija, as he stood in the doorway, singing too. They are proud of this country they call home, and it was heart-warming.\n\nWhen they finished singing, we lifted our shot glasses. The Slovenian word for cheers is živjo or na zdravje. What was this liquor? Firewater! It burned on the way down. Thanks to a web search, I’d guess it was slivovka.\n\nSlovenian blintzes make a great dessert Photo credit: Joan Sherman\n\n6. A Slovenian Feast\n\nThen it was time to eat! We walked to a nearby restaurant and the first course was soup — a beef soup with thin noodles and garlic soup. The main course included kielbasa, chicken, beef, onions and mushrooms, bread, buckwheat salad, cheesy potatoes, and a green salad. The food was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed light and dark blintzes, one filled with cheese and the other with a hazelnut spread, served with a big wave of whipped cream and jams on either side. Very sweet and very good!\n\nThe town square in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia Photo credit: Joan Sherman\n\nFriends, Family, And The People I Met Along The Way\n\nOf course, by now it’s obvious that the biggest reason this was my favorite excursion was the special people I shared it with. My wonderful husband, Dean. Our always-up-for-adventure relatives, Kevin and Cheryl. Our 14 fellow bikers who chose a cycling vacation over all the other options available, and the quick comradery that formed when we spent a week together. Our impeccable VBT guides who seemed to genuinely love what they did and were good at it. The delightful accordion player and especially, a priceless little Slovenian grandma with sparkling eyes who shared her hospitality and heart with us. In my mind, she’ll be eternally young.\n\nDean and I have had many wonderful domestic and international vacations and many wonderful moments along the way, big and small, but this special night in Slovenia — this little slice of culture and laughter and love — will forever be etched in my heart.",
    "Slovenia's Ljubljana Airport Gears Up For A Busy Winter": "Slovenians will have more options to escape the cold this winter, with various carriers adding extra services from Ljubljana Airport.\n\nSlovenia's main airport in Ljubljana will get a boost this winter, with various airlines planning on increasing services to the country's capital city. Airlines across Europe and the Middle East have reaffirmed their commitment to the airport with recent schedule announcements.\n\nThis is good news for the airport and commercial aviation in Slovenia, which has been in the doldrums since the demise of Adria Airways three years ago. Adding to the burden has been the pandemic, and with no domestically-based airline, Slovenia was described as Europe's worst performing aviation market. Last winter, there were days without a single flight in or out of Slovenia, and by July 2021, the country had less than 9% of its July 2019 traffic.\n\nSix airlines are boosting winter flights\n\nFrom that low point, it's easy to see why these increased commitments for Winter 2022/23 are so important for the community and the airport. Exyuaviation.com reported that six airlines, Turkish Airlines, SWISS, Brussels Airlines, Air Serbia, Air Cairo and flydubai, are planning to increase services over winter. The extra flight activity at Ljubljana Joze Pucnik Airport (LJU) will be welcomed, with the airport handling just 431,000 passengers in 2021.\n\nStarting in February, Turkish Airlines (Turkish) is introducing an additional two weekly flights between Istanbul and Ljubljana. This means there will be 12 flights per week, one every morning and five times a week in the evening, with most of the flights operated with an Airbus A321. Turkish has a fleet of 388 aircraft, and ch-aviation.com data shows it has 66 A321-200s and 36 A321-200neos, with another 54 of the neos on order. Adding to its narrowbody capacity are 27 Boeing B737 MAX 8s and 92 B737-800s.\n\nSWISS is adding more short-haul services to Ljubljana, going to nine flights a week this winter. Photo: SWISS\n\nSWISS is also adding two new services from Zurich Airport (ZRH), increasing to nine weekly flights from October 30. The new services will be on Monday and Friday, adding to the existing daily flight between Ljubljana and Zurich. Lufthansa Group airlines have been loyal operators to the region, and Brussels Airlines will maintain its schedule with what it has flown this summer. The Belgium-based airline will run Airbus A319 flights each Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, whereas last winter, it operated the route twice weekly during winter. Brussels Airlines has a fleet of 15 A319-100s and 17 A320-200, both types with an average age of more than 17 years. The only other type it operates is the A330-300, with three in the fleet.\n\nDiscover more aviation news here!\n\nAir Serbia is going to double daily services to Ljubljana this winter. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nAir Serbia, whose main hub is at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport (BEG), currently has twelve weekly services to Ljubljana, and from the start of winter, that will increase to double daily frequency.\n\nRoutes to Egypt and the UAE\n\nEgyptian airline Air Cairo is launching a once-weekly rotation from Hurghada International Airport (HRG), Egypt's second busiest airport after Cairo and the gateway to the popular Red Sea coast. The flight will operate as Hurghada to Ljubljana via Skopje, although the inbound rotation will operate nonstop.\n\nflydubai has an all-Boeing B737 fleet, including the B737-800 and B737 MAX versions. Photo: flydubai\n\nThere is more good news from the Middle East, with United Arab Emirates airline flydubai building on its success since launching flights to Slovenia twelve months ago. On December 22, the airline will launch daily flights with that frequency scheduled to run throughout the summer of 2023. Until the switch to daily services, flydubai will maintain between three and five weekly flights to Ljubljana from Dubai.\n\nWith these airlines adding more winter capacity, has Slovenia lost its title as Europe's worst performing aviation market?\n\nSource: exyuaviation.com",

    "Illegal Migration Causes Political Furore in Slovenia": "It could cost Slovenia’s pro-migration interior minister her seat that her country is dismantling its border fence modeled on the Hungarian one. Illegal migration is on the rise this year, with the country turning into a migrant corridor.\n\nThe opposition Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), led by former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, has tabled a motion of censure against Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar over the increase in migration in Slovenia, according to MTI. SDS MP Branko Grims said at a press conference that the motion was tabled because of the removal of a fence on the Croatian-Slovenian border, which had security and political consequences.\n\n“By the end of August, the police had dealt with more border violations than in the whole of last year,” Grims explained, adding that the number of applications for international protection was also expected to quadruple. “Slovenia is becoming a destination country for illegal migrants,” he noted.\n\nRobert Golob’s pro-migration government, which was elected this spring, announced back in June that it would completely remove the fence on its border with Croatia by the end of the year, which began construction in 2015 in order to protect Slovenia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nRelated article Migration on the Rise in Neighboring Slovenia The Hungarian government decided to set up border hunter units, in collaboration with the police. Continue reading\n\nAccording to the Slovenian interior ministry, in the first eight months of the year, authorities arrested 11,409 border crossers in Slovenia, 93 percent more than in the same period last year, and the number of people applying for international protection increased. Some 90 percent of the apprehended illegal immigrants applied for protection in Slovenia. However, most of them leave the country before the end of the asylum procedure to go to Western Europe.\n\nOne reason why illegal migrants choose to cross through Slovenia is that since 2015, Hungary’s southern border has been protected by a fence. The situation in Slovenia has not gone unnoticed in Hungarian politics. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán called migration one of the main challenges of Europe in his speech at the 31st Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp in August. Without explicitly naming Slovenia, Viktor Orbán said: “there is a country where the Left has won, and where one of its first measures has been to dismantle its border fence.” The previous Slovenian government was led by the center-right Janez Jansa, who formed an alliance with Viktor Orbán to curb illegal migration. Before the elections, he warned that Robert Golob would dismantle the fence.\n\nFeatured photo: The construction of the Slovenian border fence in 2015, photo by MTI/Varga György",
    "Next to Nice: A tale of two Slovenian cryptocurrency sponsorships": "A handful of times a year, the pro road cyclists of the world compete in their national kits rather than their trade team ones. In the case of Slovenia’s Tadej ‘Tufts’ Pogačar, that means that for the duration of his time in Wollongong he’s swapped the white, black and red of UAE Team Emirates for a lime green Slovenian kit.\n\nAlthough the riders aren’t repping their usual sponsors, that doesn’t mean their Worlds kits are a sponsor-free zone. National federations often have their own crop of backers, and in the case of Slovenia – in pride of place across their riders’ chests and backsides – is the name ‘NiceHash’, a cryptocurrency platform which is officially headquartered in the British Virgin Islands but in practical terms based in Slovenia.\n\nIf a Slovenian crypto sponsor is ringing some bells for you, it’s probably because of an ill-fated WorldTour sponsorship from the second half of the 2022 season. Do not fear: that was NextHash, and this is NiceHash.\n\nBut the two are connected.\n\nTadej Pogačar of Slovenia pops a wheelie at the men’s elite road race start. (Photo by Tim de Waele/Getty Images)\n\nAs CyclingTips reported earlier this year, NextHash founder Ana Benčič was at one point a 35% shareholder in the soundalike, NiceHash. The latter company was facing ruin after having US$80 million of bitcoin stolen by a team of North Korean military hackers – just the tip of the crazy iceberg that is that story – and they accepted Benčič’s offer of investment to help right the ship.\n\nWhen it became clear that Benčič did not actually have the investment lined up, NiceHash sued her and her affiliates leading to their removal from the company. Benčič had caught the crypto bug, however, and went on to establish the similarly-named NextHash soon after. “Even the choice of name for her company is a bit funny to say the least, and her published materials are very similar to NiceHash,” NiceHash CMO Joe Downie told CyclingTips. “We just hope people do not confuse us [for NextHash], as we are running a profoundly different kind of business.”\n\nSlovenia is a small country with disproportionate clout in the cryptocurrency sector, so despite NextHash’s unfortunate legacy in the sport, NiceHash was not put off. The company signed up as a major sponsor of the Slovenian Cycling Federation earlier this year, placing their brand name prominently across all disciplines of the sport for an initial term of one year. “We have been a smaller sponsor of Slovenian cycling events for a few years, and this opportunity was the next logical step,” Downie told CyclingTips.\n\nThe sponsorship involves the jersey placements, banners and flags on race routes, and “video time with Roglič and Pogačar for a few media campaigns.”\n\n“The goals are mutually beneficial, since we are promoting both some of Slovenia’s best athletes (on their side) and one of the biggest Slovenian crypto companies (on our side), and to show that crypto is no longer in the shadows, but receives legitimate, mainstream attention and is beneficial to everyone,” Downie said.\n\nPogačar takes a break during training. Photo: Slovenian Cycling Federation Facebook\n\nWhile NiceHash’s partnership with the Slovenian Cycling Federation appears to be going off without a hitch, NextHash’s legacy in the sport is far more mixed. The Team Qhubeka-NextHash team it sponsored folded at the end of 2021, with team boss Doug Ryder currently working on a return to the upper divisions of the sport. Of NextHash’s missing sponsorship payments, Ryder told CyclingTips today that “we are trying to resolve things and have had contact.”\n\nRecent reports in Slovenian media indicate that Benčič has been charged with misuse of company funds, and could face up to eight years’ jail time.\n\nSo, as you watch the men’s World Championships road race and see Tadej Pogačar animating things with a crypto brand splashed across his kit – remember, that’s NiceHash, not NextHash. For the sake of all involved, hopefully this one works out.",
    "Slovenia calls for suggestions for draft climate change law": "Slovenia is drafting the Climate Change Act to create a legal framework for implementing climate policy and reporting on all its aspects. The goal is to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning has started to prepare the draft for a law on climate change. It invited all stakeholders to submit proposals by October 21.\n\nThe aim is to create a legal framework in Slovenia for implementing climate policy and reporting on all its aspects. The proposal will be developed in accordance with the Long-term Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia until 2050, the ministry said. The document sets the path for the country to achieve carbon neutrality by the middle of the century.\n\nLegislators from numerous areas will participate in the production of the draft, due to the horizontal and cross-sectoral nature of climate change\n\nThe draft Climate Change Act is envisaged to provide solutions for meeting the goals of international treaties like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, the ministry said. It will transpose the European Union’s legislation into Slovenia’s legal system and regulate cooperation with stakeholders, according to the public call.\n\nThe new law will include the climate provisions that are currently part of the Environmental Protection Act, the ministry added. Legislators from areas like education, healthcare, spatial planning, building construction, agriculture, and transportation will be involved in drafting the bill, due to the horizontal and cross-sectoral nature of climate change, the announcement revealed.\n\nThe future climate change law needs to be aligned with the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) and other strategic documents and action plans at the municipal level. The ministry pointed out that the draft would include provisions related to the operation of the climate change fund.",
    "Slovenia passes an emergency energy package": "A package of three laws designed to ensure a stable supply of electricity and gas this winter, the latest in a long series of measures to address the energy crisis, was passed by the Slovenian parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThe linchpin of the package is a law on measures to control crises in energy supply which will allow the government to order state-owned companies to secure a reliable energy supply.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the management and coordination of individual parts of the system would be entrusted to the national grid operator, ELES.\n\nThe government will be able to declare a high-risk situation during which power plants and co-generation installations would be able to change their fuel, for example, switch from natural gas to diesel, without the need for a new environmental permit.\n\nIt also provides the legal basis for the government to prescribe the maximum or minimum temperature in public buildings and lighting.\n\nChanges to the gas supply act will ensure that no consumer will be left without gas in the event their supplier closes shop, according to Infrastructure Minister Bojan Kumer.\n\nApart from households, preschools, elementary schools and health centres, other so-called protected users will almost automatically be taken over by substitute suppliers in the event their original supplier goes belly up.\n\nThe third part of the package is a guarantee scheme for state-owned electricity producers GEN Energija and HSE, and the gas distributor Geoplin.\n\nThe guarantees will cover gas and electricity purchases outside the EU, with HSE’s guarantees capped at €800 million in principal and GEN Energija and Geoplin at €400 million each.\n\nWhile the legislation was passed without dissenting votes, some of the opposition abstained on the grounds that broader measures should be implemented.\n\nOne opposition party tabled an amendment that would require domestic power producers to sell 90% of their output to Slovenian consumers at just above production price. This idea was dismissed by the coalition as a violation of EU free market rules.\n\n(Sebastijan R. Maček | sta.si)",

    "Doncic pours in 35 to pace Slovenia to 88-72 triumph over Belgium": "The Belgium Lions saw themselves in prime position to pull off a major upset. But Luka Doncic and Slovenia had other ideas.\n\nLed by 35 points, five rebounds and five assists from Doncic, Slovenia went on a late 19-1 run en route to holding off Belgium and upending the pesky Lions, 88-72, Saturday in Berlin in the knockout round of the EuroBasket tournament. With the win, Slovenia advances to the quarterfinals of this prestigious tournament.\n\nUkraine will play Poland on Sunday, and that winner will face Slovenia on Wednesday.\n\nOther than Doncic, Slovenia got 13 points from Klemen Prepelic, 12 points and six rebounds from Mike Tobey, and 11 points and two steals from Goran Dragic. Doncic was 11-of-25 from the field — 4-of-10 from beyond the three-point arc – and 9-of-10 from the charity stripe in delivering yet another impressive performance.\n\nThe Lions were led by Emmanuel Lecomte (16 points) and Pierre-Antoine Gillet (15 points, 10 boards).\n\nThe scrappy Belgium squad took its only lead of the day at 64-63 with 9:09 remaining in the game, capping a brisk 14-6 run. But that seemed to anger Doncic and Slovenia, who quickly took control of the game and kept alive their chances of repeating as EuroBasket champions.\n\n“Belgium was playing great basketball,” Doncic said. “We knew it was going to be a hard game.\n\n“They were fighting until the end, but in the end I think we played a little better.”\n\nDoncic scored five straight points that put Slovenia ahead, 68-65, including on a nifty spin move in the paint and a free throw after he was fouled on the play. Shortly thereafter, the Dallas Mavericks’ superstar point guard fed Prepelic for a three-pointer and a 73-65 lead.\n\nLater on, three free throws from Prepelic and a pair of charity tosses from Doncic padded Slovenia’s lead to 80-65. And a lob-dunk by Tobey put the finishing touches on that massive 19-1 run as Slovenia built an insurmountable 82-65 lead with just 4:02 left in the game.\n\nDoncic entered this contest after scoring 36 points last Tuesday against Germany and a whopping 47 points last Wednesday against France. He now is the first player in the last 30 years to score at least 30 points in three consecutive EuroBasket games as he continues to make a strong case of being the best basketball player in the world.\n\nSlovenia jumped out to a 16-5 lead with 5:50 left in the first quarter on the strength on some serious long-distance shot-making by Doncic. Roaming around the perimeter and showing off his skills from behind the three-point line, Doncic drained his first three three-pointers less than four minutes into the game as Slovenia got a quick grip on this game.\n\nTobey added a pair of free throws and a dunk as Slovenia immediately took control of the game while letting Belgium know they were going to be in for a long day. Tobey was back in the lineup after missing the game against France with a sprained ankle which occurred on the opening jump ball of the contest against Germany when he inadvertently stepped on the foot of one of the referees.\n\nThe Lions remained within striking distance of Slovenia and only trailed, 24-19, after a first quarter that saw Doncic tally 11 points. With Doncic on the bench, Slovenia negotiated a 8-0 run and bolted ahead, 37-27, with 4:33 to go before halftime.\n\nBut Belgium wouldn’t go away as they crawled to within 44-41 of Slovenia at intermission.\n\n“Every time we made a run, they came back – mostly because of our mistakes,” Slovenia coach Aleksander Sekelic said. “We have to give credit to them. Also, they shot the ball well.\n\n“I think in the second half we made some adjustments, especially the defense was much better and also they missed some open shots. So it gave us the boost and the lead to finish the game peacefully.”\n\nDoncic came out of the halftime dressing room intent on getting some separation between Slovenia and Belgium. Showing why he’s one of the leading candidates to win the Most Valuable Player award in the upcoming NBA season, Doncic opened the third quarter with a steal and an uncontested fast break layup.\n\nDoncic then powered his way inside for a basket, drained a couple of free throws, bullied his way near the rim for another basket, showed off his defensive prowess by taking a charge, and added a free throw to complete a personal 7-0 run which put Slovenia out front, 56-50, with 3:17 remaining in the third quarter. After Belgium narrowed the deficit to one point, Doncic scored again as Slovenia took a 63-60 lead into the fourth quarter when the contest got completely out of hand thanks to that game-changing 19-1 run.\n\n“We had a great run in the fourth and congrats to Belgium on the game they did,” Doncic said. “They were fighting great but you know it was a hard game and we won.”\n\nTwitter: @DwainPrice",

    "Poland delivers major upset, shocking Slovenia, 90-87, in EuroBasket": "Luka Doncic and Slovenia didn’t have much energy in the first half Wednesday, and they paid dearly for it in the second half as they were eliminated from the EuroBasket tournament in stunning fashion.\n\nIn a very physical game played in Berlin, up-and-coming Poland shocked Slovenia, 90-87, in the quarterfinals of the EuroBasket tournament. For Poland, the victory sent shock waves throughout the international basketball world as it built a 23-point lead in the first half and went on to derail the defending champions.\n\nIt was one of the biggest surprises in the modern EuroBasket era, as practically no one gave Poland any chance of upsetting Slovenia, who advanced to the bronze medal game in the Olympics last year.\n\nPoland will now play France in one semifinal game on Friday, and Germany will face Spain in Friday’s other semifinal. The winners will square off Sunday in the championship game.\n\n“First, congratulations to Poland,” said Doncic, who finished with 14 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, six turnovers and a technical foul. “They played an amazing game from the first minute to the end.\n\n“It was a big achievement for them. And for us, we didn’t go into the game like we wanted to. The energy wasn’t there, but then we came back. But Poland was still fighting, so congrats to Poland.”\n\nThe game took a physical toll on Doncic, who was knocked to the floor several times and was limping on various occasions before fouling out with 3:02 left and Slovenia trailing, 80-76. Doncic said he probably was not 100 percent — he wound up converting just 5-of-15 shots – and was occasionally seen holding his lower back.\n\n“I received an injection in the third quarter,” the Dallas Mavericks’ superstar point guard said. “I’ve been dealing with a lot this EuroBasket, but that’s not the reason (Slovenia lost).\n\n“Today I played terrible. I let my team down, I let the whole country who was supporting us down, and that’s on me. I’ve got to look back on this game and be better.”\n\nBehind some terrific shooting from beyond the three-point line and a 12-2 advantage in fast break points, Poland broke out to a 54-31 lead late in the second quarter and led 58-39 at intermission. Most of the damage by Poland came from Mateusz Ponitka, who scored 16 first-half points and finished with 26 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nIt was just the third triple-double in the history of the EuroBasket tournament.\n\n“He had an amazing game,” Doncic said. “I’m not surprised. I played a couple of times against him.\n\n“He’s a great player, a great leader. Probably, he is an NBA-type player. I’m not the GM. I’m the player.”\n\nSlovenia hustled back into the game with some solid defense and also by outscoring Poland, 24-6, in the third quarter. Poland toted a slim, 64-63, lead into the final period, and a jumper by Goran Dragic inched Slovenia ahead, 65-64, at the outset of the fourth quarter.\n\nBut after Doncic fouled out, Ponitka nailed a pair of free throws, A. J. Slaughter scored inside, and Ponitka added a three-pointer and two charity tosses as Poland mounted an 89-80 lead with 1:01 to go.\n\nHowever, Slovenia didn’t go away quietly as two charity tosses from Klemen Prepelic, a three-pointer by Edo Muric, and a layup from Dragic sliced Poland’s deficit to 90-87 with 31 seconds remaining. But Prepelic missed badly on a game-tying three-point attempt near midcourt with two seconds to go, and the celebration started for Poland.\n\n“Especially in that second quarter, we had bad offense, and from bad on the offensive end to bad defense, it was going in a bad direction,” Slovenia coach Aleksander Sekulic said. “But give credit also to our guys. They fought in the second half.\n\n“The third quarter was just amazing. We left everything we had on the court. We just fought our way back. We made some crucial mistakes and they made some big shots and they deserved to win. We lost the game in the first half. That’s the bottom line.”\n\nIn addition to Doncic, Slovenia got 21 points from Vlatka Cancar, 17 points and seven rebounds from Dragic, and 13 points and five boards from Jaka Blazic.\n\nBesides Ponitka, Poland received ample support from Slaughter (16 points, six rebounds, three steals), Michael Sokolowski (16 points, five rebounds), Jaroslaw Zyskowski (14 points) and Aleksander Balcerowski (11 points).\n\n“Give credit to Poland,” Doncic said. “Most had us as favorites, but Poland has a great team.\n\n“This EuroBasket was amazing to see. I’m sad that we couldn’t get through, but I think this EuroBasket was something else. There were a lot of amazing and great teams.”\n\nOne of those up-and-coming teams — Poland — caught lightning in a bottle and shocked another one of those great teams — Slovenia — on Wednesday.\n\nTwitter: @DwainPrice",

    "Slovenia's economic growth to slow in Q3 - c-bank": "LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), September 9 (SeeNews) - Slovenia's economic growth is expected to slow down to 0.3% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter of 2022 following a 0.9% expansion in April-June, due to the continuing Russian war on Ukraine and the resulting international sanctions, Slovenia's central bank said.\n\n\"A slowdown is suggested in particular by the economic sentiment indicator, which remained negative in August, where the most notable factors were consumer reluctance to make major purchases and a decline in the assessment of order books in manufacturing,\" the central bank said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nIt also noted that employment remains at record-high levels and firms are largely hiring foreign workers, while wage growth remains moderate.\n\n\"High growth in exports of travel services has seen the deterioration in the current account balance come to an end in recent months. Nominal growth in merchandise exports remained high, with positive developments in all the main categories. Developments on the import side were even stronger, most notably merchandise imports from Russia, which in June were ten times higher than the monthly average over the 20 years before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, as a result of surging energy prices,\" the central bank said.\n\nThe consolidated general government deficit over the first seven months of the year was down significantly in year-on-year terms at 300 million euro ($303 million), as revenues recorded high growth and expenditure declined as payments related to the pandemic fell.\n\nThe main risks over the following months and next year are a deterioration in the economic situation and potential new measures for mitigating the impact of the energy crisis, according to the central bank.\n\nSlovenia's economic output rose by a real 8.2% year-on-year and by 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period of 2022, according to data from the country's statistical office.\n\n($ = 0.989814 euro)",
    "Luka, Slovenia dealt their first loss at EuroBasket": "The breezy stroll Luka Dončić was taking through the EuroBasket tournament turned into an arduous trek on Sunday.\n\nHaving won their first two games convincingly, the Slovenians ran into a hot-shooting opponent and a cold game of their own from 3-point range and suffered their first defeat in EuroBasket in seven years.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina rode the remarkable 3-point shooting of John Roberson (a Plano High School and Texas Tech product) to score a 97-93 upset of Dončić and Slovenia.\n\nIt dropped Slovenia to 2-1 in Group B play – with two very challenging games upcoming before the knockout rounds begin.\n\nThis marks the first time that the Mavericks’ superstar point guard has not been atop the EuroBasket. In his first appearance in 2017, the Slovenians swept their way to the championship, winning all nine games. They opened this tournament as defending champions by winning against Lithuania and Hungary.\n\nBut it was much tougher, literally, against Bosnia and Herzegovina. With Portland Trail Blazers’ center Jusuf Nurkic leading the way, the Bosnians used a bigger lineup to make life tough on Dončić and his teammates.\n\nLuka managed just 16 points to go with eight rebounds, eight assists and fours steals. But he did not make a 3-pointer on eight tries.\n\nMeanwhile, Roberson canned 7-of-13 3-pointers on his way to 23 points to lead the winners, who also outrebounded the Slovenians 45-38.\n\nIt was a struggle from the start for Luka and Co., falling behind 8-0 early and trailing much of the way. They were tied at 86 with under 4 minutes to play, but Nurkic hit two free throws and Bosnia and Herzegovina soon went up 93-89 with under a minute left.\n\nSlovenia could not secure a defensive rebound after forcing a missed shot and resorted to fouling and Bosnia and Herzegovina made its free throws down the stretch.\n\nThe loss for Slovenia makes the final two games in the group phase far more important. And the level of competition in what they call the “group of death” is significant.\n\nAnd it comes in a demanding four-game, five-night stretch in which they will face Germany, which now is alone atop Group 5 at 3-0 after beating Lithuania 109-107 in double overtime on Sunday, awaits on Tuesday. Slovenia then finishes group play on Wednesday against France.\n\nThose teams are considered to be tougher tests than Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nTwitter: @Esefko",

    "Record expenditure planned in Slovenia’s revised budget": "The Slovenian government has adopted a revised budget for 2022 as it increased revenue by about a billion euros to €12.54 billion and expenditure by around €600 million to a record €14.6 billion.\n\nDespite the higher outlays, the budget deficit is now budgeted at 3.6% of GDP, down from the initially projected 4.4%, as revenue remains robust due to high prices and the resulting tax windfall.\n\nFinance Minister Klemen Boštjančič said the revision was urgent since the budget in its current form, which was adopted last year, was untenable due to additional liabilities stemming from COVID-19 stimulus measures that the previous government had not appropriately budgeted.\n\nThe revision also responds to the unpredictable economic and fiscal circumstances created by the fallout from the war in Ukraine and includes additional spending to address the cost-of-living crisis. The ministries of health, finance, and labour account for the bulk of the spending increase.\n\nThe supplementary budget comes amidst criticism by the Fiscal Council, which monitors compliance with the fiscal rule and recently said that the revenue windfall should be used to pay down debt instead of financing spending.\n\nIt also said the adjustments could be made with a reallocation of appropriations, as it warned that the revision was a continuation of the practice over the past two years “when budget planning in times of extraordinary circumstances was not transparent or credible.”",
    "Morning Headlines for Slovenia: Wednesday, 31 August 2022": "Šarec for thorough reflection on EU mission for Ukraine\n\nPRAGUE, Czech Republic - Defence Minister Marjan Šarec welcomed a proposal for a potential EU training mission for Ukraine as part of the bloc's ongoing support for the country, as he attended an informal meeting of EU defence ministers in Prague. However, he also stressed the need for \"thorough reflection and an in-depth discussion\" before the EU would take the final decision, the Defence Ministry said. The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after the meeting that the ministers agreed to launch the necessary preparations to define the legal and operative basis of a potential new mission, which would then serve to take the final decision.\n\nRuling party's candidate for president withdraws her bid\n\nLJUBLJANA - Marta Kos, the ruling party's presidential candidate, withdrew her bid for the 23 October election, citing \"change of circumstances out of personal reasons\". The Freedom Movement will discuss further steps in the coming days, the party said, adding it would focus on the November local elections. Kos, a former diplomat whom polls suggest does not have a chance to win the election, indicated she would continue to serve as a vice-chair of the Freedom Movement. Political analyst Andraž Zorko said Kos's move came as a disappointment to an important part of the electorate, wondering whether the largest coalition party can afford not to have its own candidate. He believes the votes that would go to Kos are now more likely to go to ex-Information Commissioner Nataša Pirc Musar than to ex-FM Anže Logar.\n\nSlovenia promoting bid for UN Security Council at BSF\n\nBLED - Slovenia has used the opportunity of the 17th Bled Strategic Forum to promote its bid to win a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2024-2025, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told the press on the last day of the BSF after meeting several Asian and African ambassadors at the UN earlier in the day.

The current high representative in Bosnia, Christian Schmidt, added the EU needed to do everything to accelerate the EU integration of the Western Balkans.

Maja Pak, head of the Slovenian Tourist Board, noted that as the industry recovers from Covid, it needs to be bolder, more innovative and more inclusive. It must leverage new technologies and be mindful of environmental and social sustainability. Economy Minister Matjaž Han said that Slovenia was aware of the challenges and the new seven-year tourism strategy paved the way for a more sustainable tourism.\n\nAmCham Bled debate highlights pivotal role of ESG\n\nBLED - Sustainability criteria enshrined in the concept of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) are a tool for a safer and better future, stressed the participants of the AmCham business breakfast at the Bled Strategic Forum.

    "Now Slovenia refuses to fight NATO’s war against Russia": "US and NATO pushed a fragile Ukraine into war against Russia. As a result, Ukraine now has lost one-fifth of its territory in the war. NATO now has taken another evil objective in hand. It is arming European countries to fight its war against Russia. However, Slovenia has realised NATO and US’ objectives. It has shown NATO its digitus medius and denied compromising its sovereignty.\n\nIn June, NATO admitted how it aspired a war against Russia since 2014. According to Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, increases in military spending and force deployments in Eastern Europe since 2014 have been made in preparation for a confrontation with Russia. An explicit admission that, even before the takeover of Crimea, NATO had been hatching exploitation strategies to trap Russia.\n\nHe had said, “The reality is also that we have been preparing for this since 2014. That is the reason why we have increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance, why NATO allies have started to invest more in defense, and why we have increased [our] readiness.”\n\nNATO wants Europeans to fight its war\n\nThe United States State Department commented last week that it wants Congress to authorise funding for nations that border Ukraine and “may be vulnerable to Russian aggression in the future.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the money will be given to 18 countries that border Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the $2.2 billion package, which needs to be approved by Congress, would give about $1 billion to Ukraine and the rest to nations like the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, and Lithuania. Slovakia, Poland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Moldova, and Slovenia would also get money.\n\nNATO has already declared that it would put 300,000 troops at Russian borders. And the recent step to send money to 18 European countries reeks of the erstwhile heinous plot of the Cold war, that gave rise to regional conflicts known as proxy wars.\n\nAlso Read: NATO is dead, and no one knows it better than its founding member\n\nSlovenia refuses to fight NATO’s war\n\nHowever, a tiny European country has taken a stern stance against NATO. Slovenia refuses to aid NATO in its wicked and monstrous ploy. The present Slovenia government has terminated an agreement worth €281 million with the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to buy 45 Boxer armoured personnel carriers.\n\nIn accordance with Slovenia’s obligations to NATO, the Boxers were to serve as the foundation of a medium-sized battalion battlegroup. The ministry has been entrusted with coming up with a different solution before the end of the year, according to Defence Minister Marjan Arec.\n\nSlovenia took a jibe at the deal to cancel it. Prime Minister Robert Golob said, “Our objective is to satisfy NATO requirements regarding the capabilities of our battlegroups, but not at any cost and most certainly not with prototypes.”\n\nHe added, “What we’re going to be looking for in the future is how to secure these capabilities much more efficiently and cheaply and as compliant as possible with what the Slovenian army already has.”\n\nThis step by a petite country will impact the whole of Europe. Slovenia has shown the light. It has chosen its sovereignty over the game of global superpowers. Other “bigger” nations need to learn from Slovenia and stop being a puppet of NATO.\n\nNATO with its ‘Cold War 2.0’ mentality is committing an inexcusable sin against humanity. This latest trick could leverage the economic disparities and vulnerable psyche that has already been spreading across the Europe terrain. The fag end will be a new cold war led by NATO not just against Russia but against humanity. In this, Slovenia has presented as an example for European countries to deny being a junior partner to the US as it comes with a terrible price that Ukraine is already facing.",

    "Silver Belt Series Tournament will take place in Slovenia": "IBA World Boxing Tour event, Silver Belt Series Tournament will take place in Maribor on October 19-29. The tournament in Slovenia will become the first event of the World Boxing Tour, the brand-new competition launched by IBA. The World Boxing Tour (WBT) consists of a series of events that are classified into four categories: the Diamond Belt, Golden Belt, Silver Belt and Bronze Belt tournaments.\n\nThe event in Slovenia will have a Silver category and will welcome boxers all over the world. The WBT tournaments will allow boxers to compete against their counterparts from different continents more regularly, enhancing and improving their skills and overall experience.\n\nThe WBT tournaments will contribute to the new IBA ranking system, which will allow boxers to collect valuable points in each tournament. These points will help define not only the most successful boxers at the end of the year, but also the most successful National Federations, having generated the highest results throughout the season.\n\n“The Silver Belt Series Tournament in Maribor will be the first event of the World Boxing Tour. I am sure that the Slovenian Boxing Federation will provide a high level of organization and will give a proper start to such an important boxing project”, IBA President Umar Kremlev said\n\n“Maribor, Slovenia will be the capital of boxing from October 19 till October 29. We are honored and proud to have been entrusted with the organization of such a prestigious and important tournament. The tournament is very important not only for boxers from all over the world, but also for taking boxing in Slovenia to the next level. It is an honor to be a part of the IBA and we would like to thank IBA for making it possible for us to organize the tournament in Slovenia. We promise to deliver it with excellence”, Robert Reher, the President of Slovenian Boxing Federation said.",
    "17th regular session of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia": "SLOVENIA, September 22 - The Government has today started discussing a package of proposed amendments to five tax acts: the Personal Income Tax Act, the Excise Duty Act, the Tax Procedure Act, the Financial Administration Act and the Fiscal Validation of Receipts Act. They will be finally adopted by the Government in the coming days, after they have been discussed by the Economic and Social Council tomorrow. In light of an extremely tense and unpredictable situation, in drafting the proposed tax changes, we have sought to strike a balance between targeted measures to address price increases and the (too) large shortfall in budget revenue. The proposed tax changes are therefore being augmented with measures to mitigate inflation and price increases. Minimum, average and up to five times average wage earners will certainly receive higher net incomes next year compared to this year. We have paid additional attention to those in the lowest income brackets and to young people, who are most in need of help from the state right now. We have found additional solutions to relieve the burden on young farmers taking over a farm, and we are introducing an immediate, direct and higher excise duty benefit on the purchase of marked fuel to power agricultural and forestry machinery, and vehicles adapted for transporting beehives.\n\nAnother of the proposed tax changes is the overhaul of the system of flat-rate taxpayers. The Government stresses that it is not getting rid of the system, but that it has been demonstrated through public debate and dialogue with the social partners that changes are necessary. In terms of taxes, this year we have readied the most urgent corrections, which we aim to implement swiftly in light of the current situation.\n\nThe aim of the proposed Act on Intervention Measures in Education for the 2022/2023 School Year is to prevent the social distress of pupils, students and their families by keeping the price of school lunches in the 2022/2023 school year at the same level as in the 2021/2022 school year. The proposed Act also provides that accommodation fees for high school and university students shall be set at the baseline price valid for the period between 1 January 2022 and 31 August 2022.\n\nWith businesses facing increasing challenges due to rising energy prices and the Ukrainian crisis, the Government decided to amend the Act Governing Aid to Businesses Hit by High Increases in Electricity and Natural Gas Prices. The main purpose of the proposed amendments is to expand the scope of beneficiaries and increase the share of eligible costs reimbursed to businesses from the initial 30% to 50% for basic aid. The amended Act also introduces a new measure of soft liquidity loans for businesses affected by the crisis in the amount of EUR 6 million. The amendments will more than double the government funds allocated for business aid in this area, which will amount to EUR 86 million.\n\nThe changes brought by the proposed Act Amending the Parental Protection and Family Benefits Act are aimed at facilitating the reconciliation of work and family life. According to the proposed amendment to the Act, fathers will be able to take 15 out of 30 calendar days of paternity leave in the period from the birth of their child until the child is three months old. The remaining 15 days which until now they have been able to take any time until the child completed the first grade of primary school, would be included in the part of the parental leave that is non-transferrable.\n\nToday, the Government confirmed the final assessment of immediate damage to property caused by the fire in the Karst between 17 July and 1 August 2022 in the Notranjska and Severnoprimorska regions. The damage totals EUR 26,876,227.68 and was verified by the National Commission for the Evaluation of Damage Caused by Natural and Other Disasters on 7 September 2022. The Government also approved a report on measures and intervention expenditure related to extinguishing fires in the Karst between 17 July and 1 August this year. Furthermore, it decided to finance additional equipment for the societies that took part in the firefighting in the Karst.",
    "What’s In a Name, Indy? Haughville — Part 2: Immigration into Haughville": "In the late 1800s, a rural area of Wayne Township was developing into what became known as Haughville. Among the initial residents of the farmland in the area as well as of this new community were, according to a registration form from the National Register of Historic Places, people who had immigrated here from Ireland. Information presented by The Polis Center indicated that the population of Haughville was primarily composed of people of Irish and German heritage in the early 1880s.\n\nAs development took place, new residents to Haughville came from a different section of Europe — the lands of what is today Slovenia.\n\nGeorge Lambert is the individual credited with bringing a number of Slovenians to Haughville. Various news reports indicated that he was also known as “Juri Lampert” and “Jurij Lampert.” According to his gravestone at Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery in Indianapolis, Mr. Lambert died at the age of 62 in 1925. One source indicated his birth name — before being Americanized — was “Jurij Lumpert.”\n\nThe former Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church was founded by Slovenian immigrants to Haughville in 1906. This church was merged into another local Roman Catholic church in 1914. (The photograph was provided courtesy of Nyttend, April 10, 2011.)\n\nThe Polis Center reported in a brochure, Near Westside Neighborhood – 1830-1998, that Mr. Lambert started to recruit men to work at National Malleable Castings Company, a major industrial concern in Haughville. That brochure indicated that the recruitment efforts began in 1885; other news sources indicated that recruitment of Slovenians began in 1895.\n\nMr. Lambert made arrangements for National Malleable Castings Company to pay for immigrants to travel from what is now Slovenia to Haughville, according to news reports. In exchange, the immigrants had to work for the company for a specific period of time.\n\nThe details of these indentured servitude efforts — number of years individuals were required to work for the company, amount of money to be repaid to the company or other items — are not known.\n\nAt the time that the Slovenian men immigrated to Haughville, Slovenia did not exist as a separate country. Instead, what is now the independent nation of Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As World War I ended, the lands populated by Slovenia joined with territories populated by Serbians, Croatians, Bosnians and other nationalities in the Balkans to form what eventually became Yugoslavia. In 1991, after a short war, Slovenia became a distinct independent country.\n\nThe obituary of the wife of George Lambert, Mary Lambert Sadar, in June of 1951, indicated that Mr. Lambert made seven trips to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She moved to Indianapolis — with four children — following one of those trips, according to the obituary.\n\nThe Slovenians were among a group of immigrants from Eastern Europe that were called “Hunyaks.” Considered to be a derogatory term, the word came “from the word ‘Hunk,’ a 19th [century] corruption of Hungarian, and ‘yak,’ a colloquialism used to indicate a ‘low brow’ or ‘round head,’” according to a news article in The Indianapolis News on May 9, 1908. This newspaper article indicated that “Hunyak” was “a nickname that originated, it is thought in Indianapolis … in the dawn of the twentieth century, and now applied to [immigrants] from all the Balkan states and southeastern Europe to the United States.”\n\nThe Indianapolis News made the point, in this same news article, that there were some “very good citizens” among the Slovenians that lived in Indianapolis: “In Haughville where the Slovenians are grouped and where they have their families, and one can see that, after all, these ‘Hunyaks’ have in them some points that may make them, in the second or third generation … very good citizens.”\n\n“The ‘Hunyaks’ do not like the name that has been fastened on them in Indianapolis and Indiana,” noted this news article in The Indianapolis News. “When one probes them for the reason of their dislike of the word ‘Hunyak’ one finds that it has become odious to them because of the contemptuous manner in which it is generally pronounced.”\n\nThe Polis Center, in the brochure noted above, indicated that by 1900, “almost half of the residents … [of Haughville were] Slovenian immigrants.”\n\nAs the Slovenian population grew in Haughville, civic, educational and religious entities developed as well in this section of Indianapolis. Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church was founded on April 29, 1906. It was established as a Slovenian National Church. This meant it was not a geographic-based local parish, but instead, its congregation was based on an ethnic group.\n\nThe status of this church changed in 1948; it was no longer considered a national church but from that year forward, it was considered a local parish church. Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church was closed, according to the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, and was merged into Saint Anthony Roman Catholic Church on Nov. 30, 2014.\n\nWhile few people with Slovenian heritage live in Haughville today, the relationship between Slovenia and Indianapolis continues through the Indianapolis Sister Cities International Program. One of the nine sister cities to Indianapolis is Piran, Slovenia. According to the city of Indianapolis, the relationship between the two cities dates back to Sept. 2, 2001.\n\nA document from what was then called the “Mayor’s Office of International and Cultural Affairs” within the city of Indianapolis indicated that: “This partnership would lead to collaborations between Indianapolis and the Slovenian city’s higher learning institutions. The long history of Slovenian immigration in Indy, and support from the ethnic community, was also thought to be beneficial for the partnership, whose cultural initiatives would strengthen the bond between the people of the two cities.”\n\nAdditional information on Haughville will be detailed in Part 3.\n\nDo you have questions about communities in Indianapolis?

    "New city, new problems: Slovenia arrives in Berlin much later than expected": "Slovenia arrived approximately 10 hours later in Berlin than expected. Then, a misunderstanding at the training facility caused the players to change outside.\n\nCredit: FIBA\n\nThe Slovenian national team famously had to take taxis to their first game in EuroBasket 2022 group stage in Cologne against Lithuania as the designated team bus did not arrive. With the playoffs teams situated in Berlin now, the issues are not leaving the reigning champions of Europe.\n\nFirst, the difficulties started before even arriving in Berlin. The organizers had scheduled a charter flight for Slovenia at 9 in the morning on Thursday. The national team decided that it was too early for the players in order to preserve their sleep and rest, and optioned not to take the flight.\n\nInstead, Slovenia hoped to take a high-speed train to the capital of Germany at 3 in the afternoon. However, it was not that easy. The entire train management system of Cologne Central train station malfunctioned due to heavy rain the day before, meaning that no trains could arrive at the station.\n\nAs experienced by our BasketNews journalist team as well, many basketball fans and journalists alike had to scramble for additional options to travel to Berlin.\n\nEventually, Slovenia took a plane from Cologne to Berlin and arrived approximately at 8 in the evening.\n\nHilariously, the issues did not stop there. When the team had to hold a training session yesterday, there was an unfortunate misunderstanding at the training facility.\n\nDuring the tournament, each team gets assigned an attaché who leads the team through various tournament facilities and helps the players and the coaching staff get around in the city. However, Slovenia's attaché did not know where the locker rooms in the training facility were or at least did not guide the team there, and the players had to change outside while watching France's practice at the same time.\n\nTeams can watch other teams' practices through multiple windows outside, and there's nothing stopping them.\n\nAfter all the issues, Slovenia faces Belgium today in the Round of 16. The game is scheduled at 14:45 CET.",
    "Rise and climb: Sunrise summiting in Slovenia": "Even after doing it thousands of times, a sunrise wake-up never gets easier. It’s 4am when my alarm goes off and I poke my nose out of our overnight accommodation. Precariously positioned over a clifftop more than 2,000m above sea level, the Bivak pod is a compact, unmanned refuge that’s little more than a glorified tin can, but here, on the stark, rocky side of Grintovec mountain in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps of northern Slovenia, it gives off vibes of an alien monolith. We arrived the previous afternoon, having blindly navigated our way through a whiteout, where scattered light makes it dangerously impossible to see the terrain. Conditions have cleared, though, and I’m met by a dark sky gleaming with stars in every direction. The sunrise summit is on.\n\nThis is day three of a Slovenian long-weekend adventure, having hiked, hitched and ridden the odd train to cross Europe’s green heart. I’m lucky enough to call adventure – skiing, biking and paddling to some of the world’s wildest spots – my full-time profession. This trip, although closer than some of my other excursions to my home in Chamonix, France, is still an expedition in the truest sense. Joining me on it are adventurer and model Jess Clark and ex-pro rugby player turned ultrarunner Lewis Robling, whom I first met in Sri Lanka earlier this year.\n\nSlovenia is perfect for this sort of short trip. A patchwork of lush green forests, rolling hills and vineyards, the small Balkan nation may be similar in size to Wales, but it rivals its immediate neighbours – Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia – when it comes to adventure. Boasting more than 350 2,000m-plus summits, the ranges of the Julian Alps, the Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the Karawanks make the former Yugoslavian state a mountaineering playground.\n\nAaron Rolph at the amazing Slap Kozjak waterfall © Aaron Rolph Navigating the rocks before sun-up requires all of our attention as we weave through deep caverns that appear to plunge indefinitely Aaron Rolph\n\nWe arrived by train into Triglav National Park, around 65km west of our current location, and spent two days sampling its effortlessly dramatic landscapes. The 880sq-km park’s crystal-clear waterfalls, gorges and plunge pools provided welcome spots to escape the sweltering July heat – 37°C days are not unusual at this time of year. Continuing east, the medieval town of Bled in the foothills of the Julian Alps offered an afternoon of good food, its cobbled streets soundtracked by traditional live music.\n\nWith a population of less than 300,000 in an area little more than 160sq-km in size, Ljubljana is small but vibrant in history and rich in varied architecture Aaron Rolph\n\nThe small town also shares its name with the vivid blue lake upon which it lies. Rising majestically out of Lake Bled on a small island, the Pilgrimage Church of the Assumption of Maria presents an iconic image that has become synonymous with Slovenia, and while no longer a ‘hidden gem’, it does live up to the hype. Even a wet night of wild camping above its vivid blue waters couldn’t dampen our spirits. Catching a glimpse of the first rays of golden sunshine forming a perfect ribbon around the silhouetted island was well worth the soggy sleeping bag. After returning to its shore early for a quiet swim, it was time to pack up our kit and head into the big mountains.\n\nNear the Austrian border, in the shadows of the Kamnik-Savinja Alps’ tallest peaks, the only way is up. Aiming to summit at first light, we’ve got our sights set on Skuta – the third highest in the range, topping out at 2,532m. After brewing some fresh coffee through yesterday’s worn socks – I’d forgotten to bring any sort of press – we throw on our head torches and hit the trail.\n\nFirst light over Lake Bled © Aaron Rolph\n\nNavigating the rocks before sun-up requires all of our attention as we weave through deep caverns that appear to plunge indefinitely into the undulating bedrock. This isn’t somewhere you want to take a wrong step, and the route becomes progressively more technical as you progress.\n\nLooking up at the peak, it’s now blue hour, which occurs just before the sun has crept over the horizon – my favourite time of day. I can see the first rays of light kissing the highest peaks and casting shadows, which only makes the impressive landscape grander. Leading towards the ridge, I take care to avoid knocking loose rocks down the gully into the team below. Eventually, we take those final summit footsteps.\n\nEssential kit for peak performance\n\nStubble & Co Adventure Bag\n\nThe go-anywhere-do-anything bag you can trust, whatever the destination\n\nKnog Bilby 400 Headlamp\n\nEasy to charge, comfortable on your head, and lasts more than 105 hours on low-power\n\nSlowtide Quick-Dry Towel\n\nSuper-absorbent and available in loads of designs, this towel is practical and stylish\n\nArc’teryx Nuclei FL Jacket\n\nA lightweight, fully insulated and packable layer that feels cosy anywhere\n\nFatmap\n\nA 3D-map navigation app with useful overlays and real-time GPS tracking\n\nTaking the first plunge in Slovenia © Aaron Rolph\n\nThe views open up and there are mountains as far as the eye can see, the pale limestone peaks emerging from forests at times giving the appearance of snowcaps. At this altitude, the air is refreshingly cool and contrasts with the gentle warmth of the sun. We pause and take it all in, independently enjoying these special moments of solitude while also sharing the experience without a single word spoken. Alas, we can’t stay here for ever, and after a while we head down the impossibly steep east face, which demands our fullest attention.\n\nCompleting the arduous descent is celebrated in true Slovenian style – a refreshing river dip – before we make the short trip to the country’s capital city. With a population of less than 300,000 in an area little more than 160sq-km in size, Ljubljana is small but vibrant in history and rich in varied architecture, shaped by a range of cultures since the Middle Ages. But, tired and hungry, all we can focus on are the numerous restaurants, bars and ice-cream opportunities. After a big day in the mountains, we’ve earned it.\n\nAaron Rolph is an outdoor photographer and adventure athlete who broke the Guinness World Record for cycling the most countries (14) in seven days. He’s also the founder of the British Adventure Collective, which works to inspire others to experience the outdoors.",
    "Slovenia to keep head coach Sekulic": "2022-09-15T11:33:01+00:00\n\n2022-09-15T11:33:01+00:00\n\n2022-09-15T11:36:10+00:00.\n\nFrom the disappointing ending in 2022 EuroBasket to the next chapter with Aleksander Sekulic remaining the Slovenia senior national team selector\n\nBy Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nAleksander Sekulic will see through his contract with the Slovenia senior national team, explained Basketball Federation of Slovenia president Matej Erjavec.\n\n“Of course, Sekulic has a contract until the end of next year and that’s it,” he clarified the future of the 44-year-old tactician, “An excellent coach, he is under contract with us.”\n\nIn 2020, Sekulic became the head coach of Slovenia, following three years as an assistant. Under his guidance, Luka Doncic and the remaining members of the squad competed in the 2020 Olympic Games held in Tokyo last summer but were narrowly shy of winning a medal, bested by Australia in the bronze-medal contest.\n\nKnocked out by Poland in the 2022 EuroBasket Quarterfinals Wednesday evening, Slovenia fell short of expectations this summer. Slovenia previously eliminated Belgium in the Round of 16 and topped Group B of the preliminary round ranking over Germany, France, Lithuania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Hungary. The upcoming challenge is securing a spot in next summer’s FIBA World Cup through Group J of the European Qualifiers.\n\nSekulic, 44, was recently named as the new head coach of Lokomotiv Kuban, in preparations for the 2022-23 edition of the VTB United League. Moving to Russia, he ended his tenure as the ERA Nymburk play-caller.\n\nThe Ljubljana-born specialist worked his way up from a coach in the youth system of his hometown Slovan. Becoming the head coach of Krka in 2011 led to winning the Slovenian league title and Supercup in 2012. Landing at Nymburk in 2017, he was promoted from assistant to head coach for the 2021-22 season and added the Czech Republic’s NBL championship to the list of achievements.\n\nPhoto Credit: FIBA.BASKETBALL",

The payments will have no strings attached, and recipients will be allowed to use the money in whichever way they see fit.\n\nThe second aid package, worth €40 million, is for companies that need help paying higher electricity and gas costs, with €20 million available this year and €20 million next year.\n\nDepending on the type of aid, the state will finance 30% or 70% of the energy costs of the eligible companies.\n\nBusinesses have welcomed the aid, but the corporate sector says much more will be needed.\n\nThe government has said a more extensive aid package would be put in place for next year when more companies are expected to have problems due to the expiry of long-term contracts under which many still pay relatively low prices of electricity and gas compared to current market prices.\n\nPrime Minister Robert Golob has said aid worth up to €1 billion might have to be made available next year if prices remain as high as they currently are.",

    "Without Roglic and Mohoric, Slovenia are weakened but free from confusion and controversy at Worlds": "On Monday, at the offices of the Slovenian Olympic Committee, the press conference for the Slovenian National Team ahead of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships was held in a quiet room proudly displaying the country’s impressive array of Olympic memorabilia.\n\nPresent at the conference were the selectors of the men’s, women’s, and under-23 national team, and riders representing each.\n\nThe event came at a particularly tense time in Slovenian cycling, with Primož Roglič having crashed out of the Vuelta a España, after which the team released a rather incendiary press release blaming the incident solely on Fred Wright.\n\nThat was, in turn, rebutted on Cyclingnews by fellow Slovenian Matej Mohorič, who came to the defense of his Bahrain Victorious teammate with the equally fiery comment: \"We know that Primož crashes a lot\".\n\nJokes abounded equivocating the kerfuffle to Šmarna gora, a famous Slovene football scandal, wherein the 2002 national football team was torn apart by bitter internal rivalries ahead of the World Cup, for which Slovenia had rather miraculously qualified. However, neither Mohorič nor Roglič will be present at this year’s World Championships in Wollongong, Australia.\n\nMohorič, after a poor Grand Tour showing and suffering from the lingering effects of COVID-19 and Epstein-Barr, opted to take a break between the Canadian races and the final Classics of the season. Roglič’s program for the remainder of the year after his spectacular exit from the Vuelta remains unknown.\n\nSuffice it to say, via an Instagram post of him lounging in the sun reading a book on alpinism, he will not be at the World Championships.\n\nThis leaves Slovenia in a rather interesting position.\n\nDespite, in recent history, having one of the strongest men’s teams, Slovenia’s showing in the World’s road race has been relatively weak. Its best result came in 2020 when Roglič finished 6th after the peloton was worn down earlier by a long-range attack from then-Tour de France winner Tadej Pogačar.\n\nDespite a stacked line-up in 2021, the team underperformed, with Mohorič being dropped after the final selection was made, from which only Julian Alaphilippe broke free. Similarly, in the time trial, Slovenia’s best result was surprisingly far down in the standings: Pogačar’s 10th place in last year’s World’s.\n\nRoglič crashed out of the Vuelta (Image credit: Getty Images Sport)\n\nThis year, the first with Uroš Murn replacing UAE’s Andrej Hauptman as the national selector, its line-up is admittedly middling in terms of power.\n\nPogačar, the clear leader, is joined by his UAE Team Emirates teammate Jan Polanc, and Bahrain Victorious’ Domen Novak and Jan Tratnik. The other two slots are filled by riders from the continental ranks, Jaka Primožič from Hrinkow Advarics Cycleang, and Adria Mobil’s David Per.\n\nApart from the absence of Roglič and Mohorič, Luka Mezgec is also missing, as is reigning national champion Kristijan Koren who declined to attend citing tiredness. Bahrain Victorious' Matevž Govekar has elected to instead race the Under-23 Worlds.\n\nIn the time trial, Pogačar is the sole representative from his country. The profile of the time trial is relatively flat, though Pogačar is known to have performed well in flat time trials, such as Stage 5 in the 2021 Tour de France. Murn told Cyclingnews that he believed Pogačar’s best chance was in the time trial.\n\n\"The course suits him very well because it's very technical and we know that he is a very technical rider.”\n\nClarity\n\nMeanwhile, for the road race, Pogačar is the clear leader. Novak will be helpful as a talented climbing domestique and Polanc and Tratnik can both serve on rouleur duty. Per and Primožič are both sprinters.\n\nIn a lumpy circuit course, such a team composition would put Slovenia more on the defensive against the likes of Belgium and the Netherlands. Unlike last year, they do not have the numbers to control the race.\n\nPogačar is clearly in form, as demonstrated by his outsprinting Wout van Aert in the GP Montreal. However, the World’s parcours, a circuit comprised of 10 laps featuring a 1.1km climb of 8.6%, represents a middle ground between the two Canadian races. It bears similarity to that of the GP Québec, whose repeating climb was 0.4km at 5.8%, vs Montreal which was 2.3km at 6.2%.\n\nPogačar finished 24th in Quebec, the parcours not being difficult enough for him to win through attrition. Facing competition from seasoned Classics riders, especially Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel, it’s possible that the team dynamics will mean that the Slovenian is simply outnumbered.\n\nPogacar won the recent GP Québec (Image credit: Getty Images Sport)\n\nWhen asked, Murn said: \"Tadej is plan A, but we must consider if something important happens at 60, 80 kilometers to the finish. We'll cover up with Jan Tratnik. We know that that he's also in very good shape right now, and he's capable of doing something important also in this kind of race.\"\n\nNovak, who represented the men’s elite team at the press conference, also mentioned Tratnik, who, like Novak himself, has had a strong, aggressive season as a domestique.\n\n\"Jan is super strong and can surprise. He can attack a little bit before the finish with some good riders.\"\n\nDespite the supposed weakness of this team, it does have a strength over the teams formed in recent years; there is a clear hierarchy and leader in Pogačar. Novak also said as much.\n\n\"I think sometimes it is good to go with just one leader like Pogačar because if you help both, it's sometime difficult, spending a lot energy for two. If one rides well and the other doesn't, the team is in two parts. And with one leader it is easier because you have focus.”\n\nHowever, in the end, Novak added: \"You always need luck to do these races.\"\n\nPerhaps for Slovenia, luck this year will come through clarity.",
    "From Ancient Artefacts to Slovenian Truffles: Revealing Secrets Using Nuclear Techniques": "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was one of several nuclear analytical techniques discussed today by participants of the event ‘Revealing Secrets Using Nuclear Techniques,’ held during IAEA’s 66th General Conference, to showcase the potential of nuclear techniques in uncovering secrets of both the past and the present.\n\nAttendees also heard about the applicability of NDT in various domains, from investigating the composition and origin of historical objects to revealing fraud and verifying the authenticity of paintings, food and timber.\n\nIn the field of cultural heritage, non-destructive testing techniques, allow researchers to assess the integrity and physical properties of objects without damaging them, in contrast to traditional chemical analytical methods, which has proved valuable to restorers when dealing with historical artefacts and other valuable or fragile pieces.\n\n\"Cultural heritage objects contain within their building blocks information that can only be unravelled by scientific analysis and examination,\" said Matthew Grima, forensic scientist and manager at the Heritage Malta's Diagnostic Science Laboratories. \"It is thus fantastic to be able to apply them also in a non-destructive way, sourcing the information without damaging the object.\"\n\nAt the event, attendees learned that accelerator-based techniques, like ion beam analysis (IBA) can be applied to determine the composition of cultural artefacts, such as paintings. For instance, it is possible to get analytical information from the sub-surface of a painting, in addition to the X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data provide analytical information from the surface. The combination of these techniques revealed that the sfumato technique, a fine shading artistic technique perfected by Leonardo da Vinci, was used to produce a soft transition between colours and tones to achieve a realistic impression in several renaissance paintings, including the Mona Lisa.\n\n“This example shows that accelerator and portable systems are complementary nuclear based-techniques for NDT of paintings and more generally for cultural heritage materials,” said Lucile Beck, researcher in cultural heritage at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).",
