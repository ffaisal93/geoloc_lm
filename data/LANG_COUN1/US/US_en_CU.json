    "Hurricane Ian nears Cuba on path to strike Florida as Category 4": "Hurricane Ian was growing stronger as it approached the western tip of Cuba on Monday, on a track to hit the west coast of Florida as a major hurricane as early as Wednesday.\n\nIan was forecast to hit Cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger Category 4 with top winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking Florida along a stretch of coast including the Tampa Bay area.\n\n\"Please treat this storm seriously. It's the real deal. This is not a drill,\" Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a Monday news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba suspended classes in Pinar del Rio province and planned evacuations Monday as Ian approached the island's westernmost provinces. Cuba also was shutting down its train system ahead of the worst weather.\n\n\"Cuba is expecting extreme hurricane force winds, also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,\" U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press early Monday.\n\nAt 11 a.m. EDT on Monday, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph), about 240 miles (385 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 80 mph (130 kph).\n\nAs the hurricane approached the Cayman Islands, members of the government and opposition were working together \"to ensure that our people are made as safe as possible — the supplies, plywood, in some cases sandbags, are distributed so that they can safely weather this storm,\" Premier Wayne Panton said in a video posted Sunday. \"We must prepare for the worst and absolutely pray and hope for the best.\"\n\n\"Ian is not expected to spend much time over western Cuba, and additional strengthening is likely over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday,\" the center said. \"Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field and will be slowing down by that time, which will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida.\"\n\nA surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas. That's enough water to inundate low-lying coastal communities.\n\nAs many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said at a news conference Monday on preparations.\n\nSome of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters. \"We must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,\" Wise said.\n\nFlorida residents were getting ready, lining up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and clearing store shelves of bottled water. At an Ace hardware store in Titusville, on the state's Atlantic coast, generators, gas cans, chain saws and weather radios were in demand, owner Bill Pastermack said.\n\nA hurricane watch was issued for Florida's central western coast including the Tampa Bay area, where Hillsborough County suspended classes through Thursday to prepare schools to serve as shelters for evacuees. Additional watches for more northern areas along the peninsula's west coast may be issued, Brown said.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency, and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies as it swirls northward off the state's Gulf coast.\n\n\"You have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,\" DeSantis said. \"That's going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You're going to have flood events. You're going to have a lot of different impacts,\" he said at a news conference in Tallahassee.\n\nDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Sept. 27 trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nPlaying it safe, NASA began slowly rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.\n\nFlash and urban flooding was predicted for much of the Florida peninsula, and then heavy rainfall was possible for the southeast United States later this week. With tropical storm force winds extending 115 miles (185 kilometers) from Ian's center, watches covered the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\nBob Gualtieri, sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, said in a briefing that while no one will be forced to leave, \"mandatory\" evacuation orders are expected to begin Tuesday.\n\n\"What it means is, we're not going to come help you. If you don't do it, you're on your own,\" Gualtieri said.\n\nThe evacuation zone is all along Tampa Bay and the rivers that feed it, encompassing MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa International Airport and well-known neighborhoods such as parts of Hyde Park, Davis Islands and Ybor City.\n\nSt. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch urged residents not to ignore any evacuation orders. \"This is a very real threat that this storm poses to our community,\" Welch said.\n\nThe hurricane center has advised Floridians to have hurricane plans in place and monitor updates of the storm's evolving path.\n\n\"The biggest problem is that people tend to wait until the last minute,\" Pastermack said between customers. \"I'm always the last person to get prepared, which is kind of ironic.\"",

    "Cuba approves same-sex marriage in unusual referendum": "HAVANA (AP) — Cubans have approved a sweeping \"family law” code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt as well as redefining rights for children and grandparents, officials said Monday, though opposition in the national referendum was unusually strong on the Communist Party-governed island.\n\nThe measure — which contains more than 400 articles — was approved by 66.9% to 33.1%, the president of the National Electoral Council, Alina Balseiro Gutiérrez, told official news media, though returns from a few places remained to be counted.\n\nThe reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from the growing evangelical movement in Cuba — and many other Cubans — despite an extensive government campaign in favor of the measure, including thousands of informative meetings across the country and extensive media coverage backing it.\n\nCuban elections — in which no party other than the Communist is allowed — routinely produce victory margins of more than 90% — as did a referendum on a major constitutional reform in 2019.\n\nThe code would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel Díaz-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged questions about the measure as he voted on Sunday.\n\n“Most of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, he celebrated approval of the measure, tweeting “Love is now the law.”\n\nPassage “is to pay a debt to various generation of Cubans whose domestic plans had been waiting years for this law,\" he added. “As of today, we will be a better nation.”\n\nThe measure had been approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, after years of debate about such reforms.\n\nA major supporter of the measure was Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially — and often militantly — atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro — Raul’s brother — it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nOpposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Hurricane Ian will hit Florida as a major storm, forecasters say": "Updated September 26, 2022 at 3:06 PM ET\n\nHurricane Ian is projected to bring a perilous storm surge and winds as strong as 140 mph when it nears Florida's Gulf Coast in the middle of this week, the National Hurricane Center said on Monday.\n\nIan had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph as of 2 p.m. ET Monday — but it will rapidly intensify into a major storm, developing wind speeds over 110 mph as it moves toward western Cuba, forecasters say.\n\nAs it hits Cuba, Ian's storm surge \"could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet above normal tide levels\" in some areas, the hurricane center said. The surge is predicted to be slightly less severe in Florida, but parts of Tampa Bay could still see waters 5 to 10 feet higher than normal.\n\nIan is currently around 120 miles west-northwest of Grand Cayman, moving northwest at 13 mph, the NHC said in its 2 p.m advisory. Over the next 48 hours, the storm is expected to shift course toward the north and northeast — and the timing of those moves will likely determine where it makes landfall on the U.S. mainland.\n\nIan sets off alarms after a quiet summer\n\nLuis Santana / Tamp Bay Times via AP / AP Victoria Colson, 31, of Tampa, Fla., loads sandbags into her truck along with other residents who waited for over 2 hours at Himes Avenue Complex to fill their 10 free sandbags on Sunday.\n\nA hurricane warning — meaning dangerous conditions are imminent — is in effect for western Cuba. In the U.S., roughly 100 miles of the Florida coast is under a hurricane watch, from Englewood north to the Anclote River — a stretch that includes Tampa, Clearwater, and St. Petersburg. A hurricane watch is normally issued 48 hours before storm conditions arrive.\n\nIan is the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2022, a season that only saw its first hurricane earlier this month. So far, predictions of above-average activity in the 2022 hurricane season haven't come to pass — a circumstance explained by fluctuations in the jet stream and heat waves in northern latitudes.\n\nBut Ian's menacing approach is a reminder of a warning that hurricane experts often invoke: A single bad storm is enough to upend people's lives.\n\n\"It only takes one land-falling hurricane to make it a bad season for you,\" Jamie Rhome, the NHC's acting director, told NPR earlier this month.\n\nBoth President Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis have declared emergencies in Florida, easing the way for federal and state agencies to coordinate their planning and response.\n\nPeople in Florida are tracking the storm closely\n\n/ Esri, HERE, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS / Esri, HERE, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS Hurricane Ian will strengthen into a major storm before it runs into western Cuba and Florida, forecasters say.\n\nAlong the coast of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, all eyes are on forecasts that model Ian's potential path. But experts urge everyone in the region to have an emergency plan in place, even if the latest track doesn't show the storm making landfall in their area.\n\nPredictions currently call for the storm to remain off of Florida's western coast as it moves north toward the Panhandle. But it will drop heavy rain along the way — up to 15 inches in local areas, and 8-10 inches in central western Florida overall.\n\nIn areas along the coast, the deepest waters are expected to strike on the storm's right-hand side, due to the double-whammy of the storm surge and waves whipped by strong winds.\n\n\"Regardless of Ian's exact track and intensity, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this week,\" the NHC said on Monday.\n\nGrocery shoppers in the storm's predicted path are stocking up on water, batteries and other supplies. Some shelves were reportedly bare in northern Florida, but in the Tampa area, residents were more relaxed, hoping the storm will steer clear of them.\n\n\"It's trending west,\" a shopper at a Winn-Dixie store in Sarasota told member station WUSF on Sunday. \"We have looked at the models and only a few of them look like they are going to impact us, everything else says it is going to be the Panhandle.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Pandemic worsened inequalities, exposed true essence of unjust global order, Cuba tells UN": "“Never has humankind had this wealth of scientific and technical potential that it has now, neither has it ever had the extraordinary capacity than it does now to create wealth and well-being,” he said on Wednesday, but added: “However, never has the world been so unequal in terms of just how much people suffer.”\n\nHe pointed to some grim figures, including that some 828 million people are going hungry, around 50 million children suffer from stunting and unemployment will affect 207 million persons in 2022.\n\nTrillions in military spending while vaccines remain scarce\n\nHe went on to note that around 6.5 million people have died because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccinations to tackle this crisis are inaccessible to billions of people in low-income countries.\n\nReferring to global military expenditures, which have grown at a dizzying pace and for the first time now exceeds $2 trillion dollars, and while championing the universalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he raised the question of how much more could be done if these resources were devoted to promoting health and development, how many lives could be saved.\n\nTalking about the climate crisis, the Cuban Foreign Minister remarked, “we have one planet earth, one common home, for the rich and the poor, we must act without delay.”\n\nEconomic war against Cuba\n\nIn sharing his observation that international relations are moving along a dangerous path, he decried the United States for its offensive of economic, military, political and diplomatic coercion.\n\nRecalling the General Assembly’s adoption of the first resolution to end the embargo against Cuba 30 years ago, he denounced the US for the “act of economic war in times of peace,” for ignoring the resolution, creating material shortages, pressuring banking institutions and damaging the Cuban people.\n\nCriticizing the “unfair inclusion” and “slanderous classification” of Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism when Cuba “has been a victim of state terrorism”, he called out the US for its double standards, inconsistency, selectivity and manipulation including on human rights.\n\nReferring to the colossal challenges that face the Cuban people and government, he said “the Cuban economy has withstood extraordinary pressure which is having an impact on industry service provision, leading to scarcity in food and medicine, and leading to a decline in consumption and thus resulting in a decline in the general well-being of our people. The human damage caused by this policy is impossible to quantify but is nevertheless vast, cruel and immoral.”\n\nUrging the US to address the issues fueling irregular migration, he commended the return of visa processing at the US embassy in Havana and reiterated Cuba’s readiness to move towards better relations with the US but only based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and no attempts at undermining sovereignty and independence.\n\nSolidarity with others\n\nThe Foreign Minister shared that at the worst moments of the pandemic, Cuba was able to send 58 medical brigades to some 48 countries. He went on to express solidarity with the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua, support for Caribbean nations’ claims for reparations for the slave trade and colonialism, reaffirmed Cuba’s commitment to independence of Puerto Rico and reconstruction of Haiti.\n\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez reiterated Cuba’s staunch commitment to peace in Colombia, an end to foreign interference in Syria, and a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict. He also called for an end of the Israel occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n\nHe concluded by turning to Ukraine and said that the realistic solution to the war must guarantee the security and sovereignty of all. He said, “Cuba will continue to speak out loud and clear to reject hegemonism and domination, unilateral coercive measure, genocide blockades and attempts to impose one culture and one model on the world.”",

    "U.S. Embassy in Cuba to process full immigrant visas in early 2023": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. Embassy in Cuba will begin processing full immigrant visas in early 2023, making it easier for Cubans to reunite with family members in the United States.\n\nThe embassy in Havana had last processed full immigrant visas in 2017. The U.S. government will also stop requiring Cubans seeking visas in family preference categories to travel to Georgetown, Guyana, for their interviews.\n\nAdditional government personnel will staff the embassy to handle the visa requests. The added personnel are part of the commitment stemming from the resumption of the Cuban Family Reunification Parole program last month. The 2007 program enables U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for their family members in Cuba to come to the U.S. sooner than conventionally allowed.\n\nWATCH: How Cuban Americans see U.S. role in Cuba’s struggle for democracy\n\nUnder accords with Cuba, the U.S. has committed to ensuring the legal migration of at least 20,000 Cubans annually, not including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.\n\nAttempted border crossings by Cubans has increased sharply over the past year, according to data issued Monday by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

    "Hurricane Ian nears Cuba on path to strike Florida as Cat 4": "HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Ian was growing stronger as it approached the western tip of Cuba on a track to hit the west coast of Florida as a major hurricane as early as Wednesday.\n\nIan was forecast to hit the western tip of Cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger Category 4 with top winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking Florida.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\n“Please treat this storm seriously. It’s the real deal. This is not a drill,” Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba evacuated 50,000 people in Pinar del Rio province, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses, according to state media.\n\n“Cuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,” U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press early Monday.\n\nHere are the 11am EDT Monday 26 September Key Messages for Hurricane #Ian.\n\n\n\nLatest Advisory: https://t.co/tnOTyfOjMY pic.twitter.com/3yeYqkQCxe — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 26, 2022\n\nThe hurricane center predicted areas of Cuba’s western coast could see as much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.\n\nIn Havana, fishermen were taking their boats out of the water along the famous Malecon, the seaside boardwalk, and city workers were busy unclogging storm drains ahead of the expected rain.\n\nHavana resident Adyz Ladron, 35, said the potential for rising water from the storm worries him.\n\n“I am very scared because my house gets completely flooded, with water up to here,” he said, pointing to his chest.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h), about 195 miles (310 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 85 mph (135 km/h).\n\nThe center of the hurricane was passing to the west of the Cayman Islands, where Premier Wayne Panton said the government and its opposition were working together to keep the people as safe as possible. No major damage was reported there Monday, and residents were going back into the streets as the winds died down.\n\nIan won’t linger over Cuba, but will slow down over the Gulf of Mexico, growing wider and stronger, “which will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,” the hurricane center said.\n\nA surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas. That’s enough water to inundate coastal communities.\n\nMichael Brennan, the acting deputy director of NOAA, discusses the forecast track of Hurricane Ian. (Source: CNN)\n\nAs many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said. Some of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters.\n\n“We must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,” Wise said.\n\nFloridians lined up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and cleared store shelves of bottled water. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies as it swirls northward off the state’s Gulf coast.\n\n“You have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,” DeSantis said at a news conference. “That’s going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You’re going to have flood events. You’re going to have a lot of different impacts.”\n\nDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Tuesday trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nPlaying it safe, NASA planned to begin slowly rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.\n\nFlash flooding was predicted for much of the Florida peninsula, and heavy rainfall was possible for the southeast United States later this week. With tropical storm force winds extending 115 miles (185 kilometers) from Ian’s center, watches covered the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nBob Gualtieri, sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, said in a briefing that although no one will be forced to leave, mandatory evacuation orders are expected to begin Tuesday.\n\n“What it means is, we’re not going to come help you. If you don’t do it, you’re on your own,” Gualtieri said.\n\nZones to be evacuated include all along Tampa Bay and the rivers that feed it. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch urged residents not to ignore any evacuation orders.\n\n“This is a very real threat that this storm poses to our community,” Welch said.\n\nThe hurricane center has advised Floridians to have survival plans in place and monitor updates of the storm’s evolving path.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida; Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida; and Julie Walker in New York.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Life Expectancy: The US and Cuba in the Time of Covid": "The article documents that, for the first time, life expectancy in Cuba exceeds that in the US by almost three years. It explores intertwined reasons behind this occurrence, including responses to Covid, health care systems, racism, poverty, misinformation campaigns, the embargo, international solidarity efforts, and resilience to climate change.\n\nRecent data shows that between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy (LE) in the US plunged almost three years while for Cuba it edged up 0.2 years. Yet, in 1960, the year after its revolution, Cuba had a LE of 64.2 years, lower by 5.6 years than that in the US (69.8 years). As I document in Cuban Health Care , the island quickly caught up to the US and, from 1970 through 2016, the two countries were nip and tuck, with some years Cuba and other years the US, having a longer LE. But neither country was ever as much as one year of LE ahead of the other.\n\nLife Expectancy (LE) in US and Cuba, 2017-2021\n\nYear LE US LE Cuba US – Cuba 2021 76.1* 79.0 ‡ – 2.9 2020 78.8† 78.9 ‡ -0.1 2019 79.0* 78.8 ‡ +0.2 2018 78.7† 78.7 ‡ 0.0 2017 78.6† 78.6 ‡ 0.0\n\nThis continued through the beginning of Covid, which sharply changed the pattern. LE in the US suddenly dropped behind that in Cuba. Bernd Debusmann Jr.of BBC News wrote , LE in the US fell “to the lowest level seen since 1996. Government data showed LE at birth now stands at 76.1 compared to 79 in 2019. That is the steepest two-year decline in a century.” From 2019 to 2020 , “LE declined in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nHow could a country with all the problems of Cuba, actually have LE almost three years greater than the US? There were enormous differences between the way the countries responded to Covid.\n\nThe Covid Contrast\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirmed that “ Covid-19 was the main contributing factor [to changes in LE]. The statistics show that Covid-19 accounted for 50% of the decline between 2020 and 2021. Between 2019 and 2020, the pandemic contributed to 74% of the decline.”\n\nA critical divergence between the two countries is that Cuba guarantees health care to all as a human right while the US system is based on profit and political grandstanding. When Covid hit, the US dawdled for months as Cuba mobilized for medical action.\n\nThe Ministry of Health developed a national strategy before the island’s first victim had succumbed to the disease. Cuban TV carried daily press conferences with detailed info on the status of new patients, results of cabinet meetings on Covid, and announcing the best way for citizens to protect themselves and others. Social distancing, masks and contact tracing were universally accepted.\n\nEach day Cuban medical students knocked on doors to ask citizens how they were. Students’ tasks included obtaining survey data from residents and making extra visits to the elderly, infants and those with respiratory problems. Clinic staff dealt with issues that doctors were unable to cope with and sent patients they could not care for to hospitals. Medical data was used by those in the highest decision-making positions of the country. In this way, every Cuban citizen and every health care worker, from those at neighborhood doctor offices through those at the most esteemed research institutes, had a part in determining health policy.\n\nThis inclusive approach resulted in Cuba’s having 87 Covid deaths by July 21, 2020, when the US had experienced 140,300. While the US population is 30 times that of Cuba, it had 1613 times as many deaths.\n\nTwo aspects of Cuba’s response to Covid stand out. First, Cuba does NOT have more money to spend on health care. It actually spends less than a tenth as much per person per year than does the US, but it spends that wisely on a holistic system. Second, Cuba’s health care is global – it continued its practice of sending thousands of medical staff to other countries during Covid.\n\nOver the past six decades more than 400,000 Cuban medical professionals have worked in 164 countries and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In addition to providing Cuban doctors with experience coping with diseases and medical issues they do not see at home, this action is positive global diplomacy. US diplomacy, on the other hand, seems to focus on threatening to harm people and/or actually harming them.\n\nIn Addition to Covid\n\nNews stories also mentioned other factors associated with the shorter LE in the US: drug overdoses, heart disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and suicides. The corporate press also acknowledged racial disparities.\n\nThere had been progress in reducing LE differences between Black and white Americans. This was reversed during 2018 – 2020 when LE went down 1.36 years for whites, 3.25 years for Hispanics, and 3.88 years for Blacks.\n\nThe fall in US life expectancy was even more pronounced among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Since 2019, it “dropped by 6.6 years, more than twice that of the wider US population.”\n\nThe US has multiple groups who reject government attempts to vaccinate or wear masks. Most loud-mouthed, of course, are the right wingers who lividly despise the very idea of public health campaigns. While their thought processes are hallucination-based, people of color have reality-based fears of being ignored, lied to, and used for government experimentation, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. There is a strong connection between vaccination hesitation and racism.\n\nWhat They Did Not Look At\n\nAmong factors with increasing US Covid rates ignored by corporate media in the US are poverty, an acute rise in misinformation, abortion, the embargo against Cuba and preparation for climate change.\n\nPoverty . The first task of the Cuban revolution was to simultaneously address poverty, food, sanitation, literacy, education, racism and housing, which the rebels saw as parts of unitary whole. During the Covid crisis, many US corporations were determined to force low wage workers to stay at their jobs, spreading the disease. Cuba told those with Covid to stay home.\n\nMisinformation . Discussions of Covid deaths must not ignore the deadly role of science denial. At the same time Trump was foolishly downplaying mounting dangers of Covid, Cuba was far along developing its “Novel Coronavirus Plan for Prevention and Control.” Trump was not and is not an isolated individual – he manifests a life-threatening movement toward lunacy. Cuba has no significant group which confronts Covid with a bottle of Clorox or expects a cure brought by Q Anon on a flying saucer.\n\nAbortion . Cuba also does not have a “Women’s Lives Don’t Matter!” movement seeking to eliminate abortion rights. Those who do not want an abortion do not get one and people do not seek to impose their religious and spiritual beliefs on others. The Supreme Court’s allowing states to criminalize abortion will cause many women to die, due both from self-attempts at abortion and lack of its availability. LE averages are impacted more by deaths of young than elderly; so, we can expect many abortion-induced deaths in US will be among teenagers and young women, which will affect LE.\n\nEmbargo . The “trade sanctions” or “blockade” or “embargo” have a special relationship with LE in Cuba: one might expect it to decrease LE; but it has not done so. When Cuba was reeling from the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, the US passed laws intending to punish those who continued to trade with it. This raised prices in the already impoverished country and has prevented or slowed the arrival of much life-saving medical equipment. Yet, due to its prioritizing health care during the 1990s, Cuba’s infant mortality decreased while its LE showed a slight increase.\n\nInternational solidarity movements have stepped in to help Cuba overcome many embargo effects. Lack of essential material prevented Cuba from performing liver transplants in children. But, during May 2022, Puentes de Amor (Bridges of Love) delivered the vital chemical compound to the William Soler Pediatric Hospital.\n\nResilience . Avoiding the use of fossil fuels and enormous hydro-, solar- and wind-projects, as Cuba does, will cut down on global destructiveness but have very little effect on reducing climate change on the island. However, preparing for resilience in the face of climate change can hugely affect its quality of life.\n\nIn March 2022 (p. 8) Scientific American editors wrote that most important in preparing for the next pandemic is “building new systems.” Unfortunately, this is what the US is avoiding as it becomes absorbed in making minor tweaks to outmoded, inadequate systems of environmental protection.\n\nCuba has been holding Bastión (bulwark) events involving as many as four million citizens who carry out food production, disease control, sanitation and safeguarding medical supplies. When a policy change is introduced, government representatives go to each community, including the most remote rural ones, to make sure that everyone knows the threats that climate change poses to their lives and how they can alter behaviors to minimize them. They include such diverse actions as conservation with energy use, saving water, preventing fires and using medical products sparingly.\n\nAnother energy positive being expanded in Cuba is farms being run entirely on agroecology principles. Such farms can produce 12 times the energy they consume. Biodigesters break down manure and other biomass to create biogas (very different in Cuba than the US) which is used for tractors or transportation. Vegetable and herb production in Cuba exploded from 4000 tons in 1994 to over four million tons by 2006. This is why Jason Hickel’s “Sustainable Development Index” rated Cuba’s ecological efficiency as the best in the world in 2019.\n\nWhere Are We Headed?\n\nThe connection between LE and climate change is becoming increasingly evident. US media stories typically focus on a given disaster such as a flood and mention how aging infrastructure is being neglected. The implication is that if infrastructure were updated to its status of 50 or 100 years ago, that would be adequate. It would not be adequate because climate change means that storms will be more frequent, more intense and more deadly in the future.\n\nBy 2017, Cuba had become the only country with a government-led plan (Project Life, or Tarea Vida) to combat climate change which includes a 100 year projection. While Cuba is looking ahead and planning how to protect people from increasingly devastating storms, US politicians feverishly bury their heads in the sand in subservience to corporate interests, subjecting future generations to ever greater catastrophes.\n\nThis causes LE in the US to plunge down while LE in Cuba climbs slowly upward. Covid did not create the LE divide between the US and Cuba. Covid exacerbated trends which have become increasingly intertwined for decades. The best guess is that these trends will continue well into the future.",
    "Cuba: U.S. keeping the country on terrorism list is 'illegitimate' and 'immoral'": "Cuba’s deputy foreign minister accused the Biden administration of acting immorally, illegitimately and unfairly by keeping Cuba on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, claiming it has been a victim of state-sponsored terrorism by the United States for more than 60 years.\n\nCarlos Fernández de Cossio said in an interview with The Associated Press that maintaining Cuba on the State Department blacklist with North Korea, Iran and Syria is “an easy way to punish Cuba with the overall aim of trying to make Cuba what it is not — to make Cuba a failed state.”\n\n“The U.S. unfortunately pays no price for doing something that is illegitimate, unsustainable and immoral,” he said. “And even though, speaking with government officials, they find no reason why Cuba should be in the list, they claim that it is politically difficult for them.”\n\nCuba's director general of U.S. affairs, Carlos Fernández de Cossio, speaks in Havana on Jan. 12, 2021. Ramon Espinosa / AP file\n\nThe United States imposed an economic embargo on Cuba in 1960 following the revolution led by Fidel Castro and the nationalization of properties belonging to U.S. citizens and corporations.\n\nRemoving Cuba from the blacklist had been one of then-President Barack Obama’s main foreign policy achievements as he sought better relations with the Caribbean island, an effort endorsed by Biden as his vice president.\n\nDays before Biden was inaugurated as president, then-President Donald Trump’s administration redesignated Cuba as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” imposing new sanctions. During his campaign, Biden promised to renew relations with the communist-governed island, but he has made no move to do so.\n\nFernández said the “pretext” then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave was the presence in Cuba of representatives of Colombia’s last guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN. He said Cuba didn’t invite them but responded to a request from the Colombian government to host peace talks with the group in Havana.\n\nHe didn’t mention that Pompeo also cited Cuba’s continued harboring of U.S. fugitives and its support for Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as reasons.\n\nFernández said U.S. officials describing delisting as a “politically difficult” decision is “an immoral excuse, because as a result of this designation, the Cuban economy is suffering an additional pain on the one already imposed by the blockade.”\n\nHe explained that anyone engaging economically or financially with a country on the list faces the possibility of being punished by the United States, and that because of Cuba’s designation over 30 financial and banking institutions interrupted their relationships with the country.\n\n“There is huge economic pressure,” Fernandez said, explaining that for the past six years the country has had no sources of financing or development credit, and the U.S. has tried to deprive Cuba of fuel so it has to pay a 15-30% premium because of the risk that the few sellers take.\n\nThe country is also still suffering from the impact of Covid-19 and tourism, especially from Canada and the European Union, which is an important source of income, he said.\n\nNonetheless, the minister said Cuba hopes the economy will grow by 2.5% this year.\n\n“So the country has not collapsed,” he said, though there are serious difficulties in terms of electricity, power and fuel.\n\n“We think we could come out of it,” Fernández said. “We’ve done it in the past, but it’s going to take a lot of effort. It would be much easier if the entire blockade did not exist, or at least a few flexibilities were introduced, which the Biden administration has promised but has not introduced.”\n\nHe expressed hope that the Biden administration will “do the right thing” and lift the terrorism designation because “it’s totally unfair, it’s totally unjustified, and it’s totally immoral.”\n\n“There is no way to morally sustain or justify punishing several generations of Cubans, or the whole population of Cuba, for over six decades with the aim of making the country a failed state,” Fernández said.\n\nHe cited a State Department document from April 1960 that describes the aim of U.S. policy to depress Cuba’s standard of living, provoke hunger and despair, and force the population to rebel against the government.\n\nThe Cuban minister said the government had no answer as to why Biden didn’t follow Obama’s opening to Cuba.\n\n“The simple answer they give is Biden is not alone,” he said. “That, in my opinion, is an excuse for a way out.”\n\nFernández led the Cuban delegation to talks in Washington in April on migration that he said focused on reviving the 1994 agreement on the U.S. issuing 20,000 visas for Cubans every year. He said there was progress, and perhaps the target can be reached later this year.\n\nFernández said the mass exodus of Cubans this year is the result of “a perfect equation” — the U.S. not complying with the 20,000 visas per year since 2017 and people wanting to migrate, the incentive for people to migrate by irregular means including by using smugglers because close to 90% of Cubans who reach the U.S. are accepted, and the difficult economic situation in Cuba which the U.S. encourages.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

    "Cuba’s Family Code Referendum Is Sparking Deep Debates": "On September 25, Cuba will hold just its fourth national referendum since the 1959 Revolution. The vote, which will decide the fate of the government’s proposed New Family Code, is generating intense debate. Many voters will cast their ballots based not on the content of the Code, but rather their views on the government and the referendum process itself.\n\nAmid a severe economic downturn, much of the public is struggling to access medicine, electricity and even a basic diet. Meanwhile, the administration of President Miguel Díaz-Canel is scrambling to improve its international image even as it prosecutes a prolonged crackdown on civil society and political opposition. In the wake of the massive anti-government demonstrations of July 11, 2021, over 1,400 alleged participants have been arrested. All of this has precipitated a massive exodus; record numbers of Cubans are attempting to reach the U.S., Spain and other countries.\n\nMany opponents of the government say they will vote against the Family Code to deny the Díaz-Canel administration a victory that might improve its international image and distract from this backdrop of economic and social crisis. For its part, the government claims noble intentions with the referendum. In the last two referenda on modifications to the constitution, in 2018 and 2019, conservatives prevented marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights from being codified.\n\nNow, the Code would guarantee rights to marriage equality and surrogate pregnancies. It would also codify domestic violence penalties; extend labor rights to those who care full-time for children, the elderly, or people with disabilities; and allow for parental rights to be shared among extended and nontraditional family structures that could include grandparents, stepparents and surrogate mothers.\n\nThose in favor of the Code say it promotes equality by guaranteeing basic rights. Some opponents cite religious objections or discomfort with shifting gender roles or identities, while others are concerned about the Code’s language around child abuse and education. It would outlaw corporal punishment or “any other kind of violence, abuse or inappropriate forms of discipline.” It also includes a parental duty to educate children to respect authorities and “love of family,” “the homeland” and “its symbols.” It would also make it easier for anyone to report physical or verbal abuse of minors to law enforcement.\n\nSome fear the government will abuse these stipulations to separate dissidents from their children. The new Penal Code includes a similar stipulation, forbidding anyone from encouraging a minor “not to fulfill their duties related to respect for and love of the homeland.” The government has recently used such laws to incarcerate parents for attempting to homeschool their children.\n\nCritics of the referendum also say that in leaving this decision up to a popular vote, the legislature is abdicating its own responsibility to pass laws that guarantee rights, promote equality and protect minorities. This may serve two purposes, they say. First, if the Code is rejected, the government can simply “wash its hands” of gender and sexuality discrimination and ignore the issue. Second, the act of calling a referendum as opposed to simply passing legislation seems performative. After all, Cuban authorities recently approved the new Penal Code and Decree Law 370, which restricts freedom of expression, without referenda. Critics say the government chose to submit the Family Code to a vote only in order to boost the image of Cuba’s system of “democratic centralism.”\n\nThrough this system, the government has sponsored many rounds of discussions about the Code in workplace and local government councils. Officials say they take note of the points made in these discussions and elevate them up decision-making channels. The government has modified its proposal two dozen times, supposedly based on feedback from these discussions. However, there is little transparency in how these decisions are made, and there is no watchdog or auditing body to oversee them. Even so, the government has been praising this system of consultation in the media as its political leadership seeks to show “greater closeness to the people.”\n\nIf it passes, the Code will also allow the government to posture as aligned with the international left on gender and LGBTQ issues, even as it continues its crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression. For now, the international community continues to condemn the government’s prosecution and jailing of dissidents, some of them minors, since the July 11 demonstrations.\n\nThe Díaz-Canel administration seems bent on improving its reputation—but without softening its repression of political dissent. This may drive many voters who support much of the content of the Code to vote against it.\n\nTurnout is almost always high in Cuba, because authorities generally view abstention as subversive and can easily identify those who don’t vote. This is why most people who wish to protest a vote will turn in blank ballots instead of refusing to cast a ballot. Many others vote in line with the government to avoid the problems that come with being identified as a possible dissident.\n\nWhen the votes are tallied in the referendum on the Family Code, observers should keep in mind that the results will reflect much more than simply how people feel about its contents.\n\n—\n\nGarcía is head of monitoring, evaluation and impact at the Cuban independent media outlet El Toque and is communications lead at the Transparency and Accountability Initiative",
    "Cuba holds unusual vote on law allowing same-sex marriage": "This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nHAVANA (AP) — Cuba held a rare referendum Sunday on an unusually contentious law — a government-backed “family law” code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt, as well as outlining the rights of children and grandparents.\n\nCuba holds parliamentary elections every two years, though no party other than the Communist is allowed, but seldom has it held referendums on specific laws.\n\nAnd seldom has an officially backed measure met as much open criticism as the family law of more than 400 articles, which has been questioned by many members of the island's increasingly vocal evangelical community.\n\nThe sweeping code also would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel Díaz-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged resistance as he voted on Sunday.\n\n“Most of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said. Results of the referendum are expected on Monday.\n\nSixty-four-year-old market vender Miguel Alberto Galindo said he had voted for the measure: “It's time that homosexuals have the same rights as everyone else,” he said.\n\nBut Alejandro Rodríguez, a 33-year-old hardware store worker, said he'd voted against the measure, saying, “Some things in the code are good but others are bad.” He said he did not agree with giving gay couples the same rights as “normal” families.\n\nThe measure was approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, following a thousands of government-organized information sessions this year in neighborhoods across the country.\n\nA major supporter of the measure is Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there’s a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba, where evangelical churches have been growing. Several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially — and often militantly — atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro — Raul’s brother — it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nThe opposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.",
    "Cuba, Cambodia reaffirm positive diplomatic relations": "Both leaders talked about the positive bilateral relations and also reiterated the willingness to strengthen cooperation in sports, health, culture and biotechnology.\n\nThe Cambodian leader, who arrived in Cuba on Friday night, stressed his country’s stance against the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the U.S. government on Cuba and reported on a donation of 2,000 tons of rice.\n\nPresident Díaz-Canel, on the other hand, alluded to the historical ties of friendship and recallled firm links between Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz and King Father Norodom Sihanouk, founders of the Non-Aligned Movement (MNOAL).\n\nThe Cuban leader congratulated people and government of Cambodia on the centenary of the King Norodom Sihanouk´s birth.\n\nAccording to the Cuban Foreign Ministry (MINREX), the official visit takes place in the year during which Cambodia holds the pro tempore presidency of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nLikewise, this is the first visit by a high-ranking leader of Cambodia since Cuba’s accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) two years ago.\n\nPll/mv/dgh",
    "Cuba: the communist climate criminal kids ignore": "When it comes to socialist and communist dictatorships, environmental groups fall silent. There is an unwillingness to criticise these oil-heavy nations for profiting off the black gold of fossil fuel, even when things go horribly wrong.\n\nThis moral double standard makes a mockery of UN-affiliated green groups who routinely heap praise on their ideological bedfellows while demonising Western nations for their rolling green fields of family farms or the horror of reliable energy grids.\n\nThe ethical dilemma was on full display when a Cuban oil storage facility at the Matanzas supertanker port went up in flames on August 5 after it was struck by lightning. The resulting blaze spread across four fuel tanks over the following week, injuring over a hundred. It was later discovered that 16 firefighters were missing and eventually confirmed dead. The ferocity of the blaze sent thick, black smoke laden with chemicals churning into the sky like a volcanic eruption.\n\nThe Big one… Raging fire in Cuban oil depot leaves 80 injured and 17 firefighters missing: 800 people evacuated as smoke billows towards Havana after lightning strikes oil tank#cuba pic.twitter.com/3O0cNATC1l — Kyle.Taylor (@livingbyyyz) August 6, 2022\n\nExperts were rushed in from ‘friendly’ nations such as Venezuela and Mexico during the initial panic. They created a fleet of planes and helicopters that buzzed around the fire like bugs at night, dousing it in foam. Their efforts could not stop the original half-tank fire spreading, but did eventually bring the worst fire disaster in Cuban history under control.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cuba has called on the US Environmental Protection Agency for help wanting access to ‘innovative US techniques and procedures’ for the cleanup operation. The amount of help offered by the Biden administration is likely to be limited.\n\nThe destroyed fuel tanks formed part of an eight-tank facility that stores part of Cuba’s vast supply of crude oil ready for transport. Some is sent off to the nation’s thermoelectric plants – one of which had to be shut down. At the time, locals were ‘warned to wear face masks and avoid acid rain’ as water mixed with toxic fumes. They later saw evidence of black filth appearing all over their residences.\n\nWhile our politicians bicker about whether or not they’ll have to destroy Australia’s agriculture industry to cut ‘emissions’, huge tanks full of oil were burned and released directly into the atmosphere.\n\nWhat’s the carbon footprint for this mess?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the United Nations going to punish Cuba for endangering the entire planet by bringing on the climate apocalypse?\n\nWhy didn’t we see climate-panicked school children from Western nations pour onto the streets, crying, screaming, and clutching banners about ‘Cuban climate criminals destroying the world!’?\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find an Australian school that mentioned the disaster that occurred near Havana, let alone a teacher brave enough to criticise their Left-wing regime.\n\n📹| Another Blast in Cuba Oil Warehouse. ▪️Friday’s thunderstorm caused a giant fire at a crude oil warehouse in #Matanzas, #Cuba. 1 dead, 147 wounded and 14 missing.pic.twitter.com/8Z2NG2T9FY — EHA News (@eha_news) August 9, 2022\n\nCuba distanced itself from the world in the 1950s under Fidel Castro and created a communist dictatorship. Their story since then has followed the typical communist collapse of terrible living conditions, blackouts, food shortages, crime, civil unrest, and pitiful healthcare.\n\nBut don’t worry, the World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report 2006 listed Cuba as the ‘most sustainable model of development on the planet’. It is, apparently, ‘environmentally sustainable’ with a ‘high quality of life’.\n\nWhy all the praise? They installed a few solar panels… That was enough to tip the virtue scales in their favour. It is a game of green shadows and disingenuous ‘science’. As world burns, Cuba number 1 for sustainable development: WWF, went the slightly awkward headline in 2016.\n\nDespite the obvious enormous environmental damage caused by this disaster, the propaganda machine that protects everyone except Western companies seems hesitant to criticise Cuba for the mishap.\n\nDelegate for the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, Oscar García Martínez, notes that ‘air quality’ is the main problem, but that it does not ‘compromise human health’.\n\n‘Everything indicates that what happened in the fire doesn’t seem to have compromised any aspect for the future,’ they said.\n\nBut what about the imminent climate apocalypse, I hear you say? No one mentioned it. Experts can tell you the carbon footprint of your salad wrap, but not the Cuban fire crisis because – uh – reasons?\n\nCitizen reports were more honest than official propaganda. According to World Nation News:\n\n‘In the days leading up to the fire, it was common to read independent media descriptions of residents in high-risk areas who reported “a black spot or powder that stains clothes and hands and leaves an unusual appearance in the water”. While he warned that in the Yumuri Valley, a few kilometers from the town of Matanjas, “the animals don’t want to eat the yerba. They chew it and throw it away. We have nowhere to water the animals. Rivers get polluted after the rains.”’\n\nDespite the glowing reviews of ‘sustainability’, 80 per cent of Cuba’s energy comes from oil and natural gas with almost all of the rest drawn from biofuels. The loss of these four tanks has spread fears of sustained and regular power outages in the months to come.\n\nThe French announced that they would help build the now notorious supertanker hub in 1989 in an agreement between the Bouygues Offshore Group, a Soviet company, and the Cuban oil ministry. While the original base was largely constructed with money from the Soviets, the destroyed tankers were new and built with help from Venezuela. It is no surprise to hear that after the destruction, President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro has put his hand up to say that he will instruct the Ministry of Petroleum to invest in the rebuilding of the Cuban supertanker hub.\n\nUnsurprisingly, instead of worrying about the massive oil fire, Cuba is more concerned about the environmental impact of … Covid.\n\n‘It is not difficult to predict then that the disease will cause new and greater damage to biodiversity, aggravating the already existing deterioration of ecosystems,’ said Cuba’s Minister for Science, Technology and the Environment, Elba Rosa Pérez Montoya.\n\nIt was part of a ploy to get wealthy countries to re-invest in developing countries to save their biodiversity.\n\nSo, while the communist tyrannies of the world burn fossil fuels and complain about their new Climate Change money-making demon of Covid, the rest of us face a future of Veganism and blackouts.",
    "Cuban Abdala vaccine: Effectiveness in preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19 in Havana, Cuba; A cohort study": "The study included 1 355 638 persons (Mean age: 49·5 years [SD: 18·2]; 704 932 female [52·0%]; ethnicity data unavailable): 1 324 vaccinated (partially/fully) and 31 433 unvaccinated. Estimated VE against severe illness was 93·3% (95% CI: 92·1-94·3) in partially- vaccinated and 98·2% (95% CI: 97·9-98·5) in fully-vaccinated and against death was 94·1% (95% CI: 92·5-95·4) in partially-vaccinated and 98·7% (95% CI: 98·3-99·0) in fully-vaccinated. VE exceeded 92·0% in all age groups. Daily cases and deaths during the study period corresponded to a VE above 90%, as predicted by models.\n\nThis retrospective cohort study in Havana analyzed Cuban Ministry of Public Health databases (May 12-August 31, 2021) to assess VE in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 (primary outcomes). Cox models accounting for time-varying vaccination status and adjusting by demographics were used to estimate hazard ratios. A subgroup analysis by age group and a sensitivity analysis including a subgroup of tested persons (qRT-PCR) were conducted. Daily cases and deaths were modelled accounting for different VE.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines have proven safe and efficacious in reducing severe illness and death. Cuban protein subunit vaccine Abdala has shown safety, tolerability and efficacy (92·3% [95% CI: 85·7‒95·8]) against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials. This study aimed to estimate Abdala's real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE).\n\nData from this study, compared with others in different countries, support the benefit of vaccines against COVID-19 as public health measures and suggest that their rapid, organized and massive use is a correct strategy to control pandemic, always considering the health system's characteristics. The inability of the available COVID-19 vaccines to effectively prevent infection, their potential effectiveness against the different variants of concern, the duration of their long-term protection and the need for booster doses are issues that require further attention.\n\nThe analysis of the effectiveness of the Abdala protein subunit vaccine in real-world conditions is the first carried out in Cuba and is similar to others carried out in the world. Demonstrates its high protective effect against severe forms and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection, with a complete schedule of three doses (0-14-28 days), in a scenario with a clear predominance of the variant of concern Delta. Likewise, it shows that implemented vaccination strategy, with a reduced scheme, accelerated and massive application in the population, provided satisfactory results against severe disease and fatal outcomes in adults and may be viable in a low-income country.\n\nWe searched PubMed and preprint archives (MedRxiv) for articles published in English and Spanish between December 1st, 2021 and February 28 2022, using the keywords “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, “vaccination”, “effectiveness”, “real world” and “cohort study”. We selected articles containing information about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the real world. Our search returned 268 studies, 31 of which were relevant to this topic. Previous studies have mainly focused on the effectiveness conferred by messenger RNA, viral-vector and inactivated virus vaccines in high and middle-income countries, but data about the effectiveness conferred by protein subunit vaccines in low-income countries are limited. To our knowledge, there is no previous real-world effectiveness assessment of the Cuban Abdala vaccine.\n\nThis study's objective was to estimate Abdala's real-world effectiveness in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 in fully and partially vaccinated adult persons in Havana, Cuba, compared to those who were unvaccinated. Estimates obtained for Abdala's effectiveness were contrasted with vaccine effectiveness forecasts made, considering a 70% vaccine effectiveness; 90% vaccine effectiveness; and no vaccination to produce a sensitivity analysis for these estimates.\n\nThe complex epidemiological situation previously described increased the burden on healthcare services in Havana, prompting the accelerated application of the Abdala vaccine,reaching a vaccination coverage of 88·4% in the adult population by August 31, 2021.\n\nConsidering these results, the Cuban regulatory agency (Centre for State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices, CECMED, Spanish) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Abdala on July 9, 2021.\n\nAbdala is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine developed by the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Centre (CIGB) that uses the yeast Pichia pastoris as the microorganism for expression.Its formulation includes SARS-CoV-2’s recombinant protein receptor binding domain (RBD), with aluminium hydroxide gel as an adjuvant. Abdala's complete vaccination schedule (per manufacturer guidelines, CIGB, Havana, Cuba), consists of three doses of 0·5 mL, administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region on days 0-14-28. It may be used as a booster or combined with other vaccines.Abdala's clinical trials (RPCEC00000346, RPCEC00000359, RPCEC00000363), assessing safety, immunogenicity and efficacy, showed that it was well-tolerated, and no severe adverse events were reported.In a phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out in “Saturnino Lora” Hospital, Santiago de Cuba, Abdala vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and induced humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with a 50 mg dose, applied in a 0-14-28 days schedule.In a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 48 290 adult volunteers, Abdala demonstrated an efficacy of 92·3% (95% CI: 85·7‒95·8), but, so far, peer-reviewed manuscript of phase 3 randomized clinical trials from Abdala are still unpublished.\n\nCuba's strategy to address the pandemic's challenges was to develop its own vaccine, taking advantage of biotechnological institutions with over three decades’ experience.By March 2021, Cuba had developed five vaccine candidates, all based on the protein subunit technological platform: Abdala, Mambisa, and Soberana 01, 02, and Plus.\n\nBy July 9, 2021, there were 608 confirmed cases (284·4 per 1 000 000 population) and 3 deaths (1·4 per 1 000 000 population) in Havana, which increased notably, reaching a peak of 1994 cases (932·7 per 1 000 000 population) on July 30 and 10 deaths (4·7 per 1 000 000 population) on August 1(Appendix Figure S-I). There was higher transmission in municipalities with higher population densities and more appreciable transmission in paediatric age groups.Of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, Delta was detected in Cuba at the end of April, spread rapidly countrywide and replaced other variants by July, resulting in high disease transmission and dispersion.\n\nIn Cuba, the first COVID-19 cases were detected on March 11, 2020. Since then, the infection has reached epidemic levels, with thousands of cases and deaths, constituting the country's main health problem.From the start of the epidemic, Havana accounted for the majority of cases and the highest incidence, despite the population being subject to non-pharmacological interventions established by the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP).\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a massive global disease burden.Non-pharmacological interventions have been the main public health strategies and policies implemented.Likewise, several COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly developed and approved for emergency use to tackle the prolonged pandemic, and mass vaccination campaigns have been implemented in many countries.However, these achievements have not been made available equitably, and huge access asymmetries remain between rich and poor countries.\n\nThe temporal association of introducing and lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions with the time-varying reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study across 131 countries.\n\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute (IPK)—CEI-IPK protocol 31-21, November 2021. The study complies with the bioethical framework for this type of medical research. Data for the study come from records of the MINSAP entity responsible for collecting infectious disease notifications, as well as for epidemiological population health surveillance and management, and thus their use does not require informed consent. This information is protected, and the confidentiality of all participants is preserved. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the Abdala vaccine against COVID-19 provides essential information and is the benefit of this study.\n\nAdditionally, a compartmental dynamic mathematical model of the differential equations type Susceptible-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Protected-Deceased-Vaccinated was used to predict daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Havana,that could be expected during the study period. This type of model is standard and has been commonly used in modelling vaccination of other virus-induced diseases.This model allowed us to simulate the effect of daily vaccine effectiveness on COVID-19 cases and deaths considering 70% vaccine effectiveness; 90% vaccine effectiveness; and no vaccination. Given direct contact with an infected person, those vaccinated had a probability of becoming ill of (1-η), representing an estimate of vaccine ineffectiveness. Data was analysed with R (4.1.1), Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. Forecasting cases were estimated with MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2018b software, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States.\n\nTo assess whether the effectiveness results were affected by potential differences in access to health care services between vaccinated and unvaccinated, we performed sensitivity subgroup analysis only on individuals who had been qRT-PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period as was proposed in Jara.\n\nFor crude vaccine effectiveness estimates, we only used vaccine status as a time-varying covariate with no adjustments for covariates. The adjustment was made using stratification by age, sex and municipality in the survival R package. To estimate specific vaccine effectiveness for age groups we implemented independent Cox models still adjusting for the remaining covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (%) was estimated as (1‒HR) × 100.The same procedure was used to calculate the effectiveness in each age group. All models were implemented in the statistical software R, using the survival package.\n\nThe temporal association of introducing and lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions with the time-varying reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study across 131 countries.\n\nWe estimated the vaccine effectiveness with Cox proportional hazards models, using vaccine status as a time-varying covariate for all individuals included. Primary outcomes of interest were severe disease and death. We right-censored individuals at the time of an event (Intensive Care Units [ICU] admission or death associated with COVID-19) and at the end of the follow-up period (31 th of August). Exposure was specified according to vaccination status (fully-vaccinated, partially-vaccinated or unvaccinated). The same cohort contributed person-time at risk to unvaccinated and vaccinated exposure categories, with all individuals starting in the unvaccinated state and sequentially transitioning through vaccinated exposure states until the outcome of interest or being censored at the point of the follow-up period. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates were obtained with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\nDeath from COVID-19: a person who died as a result of confirmed COVID-19, with symptoms clinically compatible with the disease.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) International guidelines for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection: an individual with or without characteristic COVID-19 symptoms,with a positive qRT-PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab sample taken at a healthcare institution.\n\nIn both cohorts, the COVID-19 outcomes measured included severe disease, defined by MINSAP's COVID-19 National Action Protocol,and death according to WHO.All cases included in the study were confirmed positive for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) International guidelines for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death.\n\nStudy inclusion criteria were met by 1 355 638 persons who were divided into two cohorts: 1 324 205 individuals in the vaccinated cohort (1 223 350 fully vaccinated and 100 855 partially vaccinated), and 31 433 in the unvaccinated cohort ( Figure 1 ).\n\nEligible for the study were 1 733 607 persons aged ≥19 years whose data were available and correctly registered. Of these, 377 969 were excluded: 52 260 whose qRT-PCR tests confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to study start; 83 400 who received a COVID-19 vaccine other than Abdala; and 242 309 who had inaccurate data.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we considered inclusion criteria to be 19 years of age or older, not having been diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection (qRT-PCR test+) prior to the start of the study, being residents of Havana, and having complete and accurate data.\n\nThe national online registry ANDARIEGO.HIGIA was used to acquire information on their ages, sex and residential area. Clinical evolution summaries for those admitted to wards designated for severe COVID-19 patients provided information on disease severity and death. MINSAP's COVID-19 case registries and epidemiological survey forms include diagnostic confirmation by the microbiology laboratories at Havana's Provincial Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology Centre via real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR, STAT-NAT COVID-19 MULTI, Italy) using nasopharyngeal swab samples, according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for qRT-PCR,applied free of charge for the general population, including all participants in this study.\n\nData on the cohort's participants were obtained from the national online registry ANDARIEGO.HIGIA (GEOCUBA, Cuba, http://higia.andariego.cu )—a database whose access is limited to authorized users—which includes, among other data, an identifier unique to each individual, demographic information, the vaccine used, and the dates doses were applied, according to the vaccine's schedule.Information on vaccine coverage was obtained from the daily report issued by MINSAP's National Statistics and Medical Records Division.\n\nThe Cuban health system is based on primary health care strategy and a single integrated public model. It guarantees free, equitable and universal healthcare coverage, supported by neighbourhood family practice offices. This facilitated consistent active surveillance at the community level, led by family doctors and health workers. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this allowed active daily screening for symptomatic cases and notification, as well as admission and care of all newly diagnosed cases.\n\nA short follow-up study of the cohort was carried out for 111 days (from May 12 through August 31, 2021) via surveillance mechanisms implemented by MINSAP. For fully-vaccinated individuals, follow-up was carried out 14 days after the third vaccine dose was administered, until event occurrence or study's end. For partially-vaccinated individuals, follow-up was carried out after the first dose was administered until they become fully-vaccinated, event occurrence or study's end. Unvaccinated persons were observed from the start of the study until either the event occurrence, study's end or vaccination. The median contribution of fully-vaccinated was 43 person-days at risk, partially-vaccinated 42 person-days at risk and unvaccinated 34 person-days at risk.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, persons were considered fully vaccinated if they had received the complete vaccination schedule and were ≥14 days past their third dose and partially vaccinated if they had received 1-2 doses or 3 doses and less than 14 days past their third dose. Those who did not meet this criterion were included in the unvaccinated group.\n\nAbdala vaccine sufficient doses were available for the entire Havana adult population. The vaccine was administered free of charge in stages in each of the city's municipalities, using both personnel and vaccination sites that were duly accredited by CECMED and MINSAP.\n\nTo estimate the real-world effectiveness of the Abdala vaccine, we conducted an observational retrospective cohort study including persons aged ≥19, residing in Havana, and unvaccinated at the start of the study, which received subsequently the vaccine during a massive vaccination campaign. From this population, and after considering eligibility criteria, study cohorts were formed according to vaccination status: unvaccinated and vaccinated (partially and fully), and followed for 111 days. Inclusion in the three groups was dynamic throughout the study period; participants who did not receive vaccination were initially counted in the unvaccinated group until they had received their first dose, after which they were transitioned into the partially vaccinated group, where they stayed until received the third dose and 14 days elapsed, then they were moved to the fully vaccinated cohort. Havana's primary health-care system covers the resident population regardless of socioeconomic, political or cultural status, gender, race or ethnicity. Primary care data from family doctors’ office records were linked to laboratory test results, vaccination registries, patients’ clinical histories and epidemiological survey forms.\n\nFrom the start of the epidemic, Havana's population was subject to the general measures established by the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP) including mandatory masking, social distancing, restrictions on movement, and isolation of positive cases. These conditions and guidelines were maintained throughout the study period.\n\nThe study was carried out in Havana, Cuba, which is comprised of 15 municipalities with an estimated population of 2 137 936 inhabitants as of June 30, 2021, according to the National Statistics and Information Office (ONEI; www.onei.gob.cu ).\n\nAt the beginning of the study, daily cases and deaths reported by MINSAP agreed with forecasts that aligned with vaccine effectiveness of 90%, but by the study's midpoint, when vaccination coverage was 75%–80%, cases and deaths began to steadily decrease. This was much more apparent in the last weeks of the study period, indicative of effectiveness above 90% and thus consistent with the estimated effectiveness ( Figure 2 ).\n\nSensitivity analyses of potential differences in access to health care services between vaccinated and unvaccinated by immunization status, adjusted by age group, sex and resident area including only individuals who took an qRT-PCR during the study period, showed vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe disease COVID-19 and death above 90.0% ( Appendix, Tables S-I and S-II ), similar to those of the main analysis; confirming that effectiveness in the vaccinated cohort was consistent. These results address the concern that the observed vaccine effectiveness might be affected by healthcare access because all individuals included in the analysis had demonstrated access to the Cuban healthcare system.\n\nThe overall estimated effectiveness against severe disease reached 93·3% (95% CI: 92·1-94·3) in partially-vaccinated and 98·2 % (95% CI: 97·9-98·5) in fully-vaccinated ( Table 2 ), with the highest numbers in individuals 19-40 years (99·4 [95% CI: 98·2-99·8] and >80 years (99·1 [95% CI: 98·6-99·4]) fully-vaccinated ( Table 3 ). Likewise, effectiveness in preventing death from COVID-19 was greater in fully-vaccinated 98·7% (95% CI: 98·3-99·0) than those partially-vaccinated 94·1% (95% CI: 92·5-95·4) ( Table 2 ). Similarly, the highest figures were observed in persons fully-vaccinated 19-40 years (99·5 [95% CI: 95·2-100·0] and 61-80 years (98·8 [95% CI: 98·3-99·2]) ( Table 3 ).\n\nDuring follow-up, COVID-19 severe disease occurred among 181 fully-vaccinated individuals, 228 partially-vaccinated individuals and 938 unvaccinated individuals, with incidence rates per 10 000 person-years of 0·03, 0·04 and 0·23, respectively ( Table 2 ). All participants received specialized medical care in Havana hospitals’ ICU. Death from COVID-19 was reported in 76 patients who had been fully-accinated, 128 patients partially-vaccinated and 366 who were unvaccinated. Among COVID-19 fatalities, lower incidence densities were observed in fully-vaccinated (0·01 per 10 000 person-years) and partially-vaccinated (0·02 per 10 000 person-years), compared to unvaccinated individuals (0·09 per 10 000 person-years) ( Table 2 ).\n\nThroughout the study period of May 12 through August 31, 2021, 1 355 638 persons met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 1 223 350 were fully-vaccinated, 100 855 were partially-vaccinated, and 31 433 were unvaccinated. The mean age was 49·5 years (SD: 18.2), thus most individuals were aged 19-40 years (469 383/1 355 638 [34·6%]) and 41-60 years (507 362/1 355 638 [37·4%]). Overall, there were more females (52·0%) than males and most participants inhabited Boyeros (10·8%) and Arroyo Naranjo (10·0%) municipalities. More than 70·0% of severe disease cases (946/1347 [70·3%]) and deaths (441/579 [70·4%]) were observed in individuals >60 years and males predominated in both outcomes (738/1347 [54·8%] and 312/570 [54·7 %]), respectively. The highest numbers of severe disease cases and deaths were observed in municipalities Diez de Octubre and Plaza ( Table 1 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\n12 Centro para el Control Estatal de Medicamentos, Equipos y Dispositivos Médicos (CECMED) (CU)\n\nABDALA 50 µg (Vacuna anti COVID-19 de subunidad proteica). , 13 Gorry C.

The results validate the high effectiveness of the protein subunit Abdala vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19 disease and death, when measured from 14 days after administration of the full three-dose schedule (following the manufacturer's recommended application at 0-14-28 days),achieving the desired effect in a relatively short time. In partially vaccinated individuals (1-2 doses or 3 doses and less than 14 days past their third dose), similar results were obtained for both outcomes (vaccine effectiveness 93·3% and 94·1% respectively).\n\n13 Gorry C.

Severe disease has important implications for public health and policy making, since it may not only lead to death but also long-lasting sequels, with substantial repercussions for populations and healthcare systems. Our results demonstrate that the Abdala vaccine provides substantial protection for older adult populations and adds to the knowledge base of real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. In both outcomes (preventing severe disease and death), the Abdala vaccine's effectiveness was satisfactory (>90%) for all age groups, and the vaccine has received EUA in several other countries.\n\n20 Jara A\n\nUndurraga EA\n\nGonzález C\n\net al.

A systematic review of methodological approaches for evaluating real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines: advising resource-constrained settings. Similar results in preventing severe disease and death have been reported in other countries.Systematic reviews including a wide variety of study types and settings, including 107 real-world vaccine effectiveness studies in adults which covered eight vaccines across all vaccine platforms, demonstrated protection against COVID-19 severe infection or death in the general population of, at least, 60% and most often close to 100%.However, it should be noted that variations in estimated effectiveness reported in other studies could result from differing study designs, settings, testing protocols, study populations, types of vaccine, schedules and time intervals considered appropriate to best measure each vaccine's immunological effects. More real-world effectiveness studies of longer durations are required in low-and middle-income countries since the majority of such research has been carried out in high-income nations.\n\nA major unresolved issue regarding COVID-19 vaccines is their inability to effectively prevent infection. Additionally, authorizations for their use have been given via accelerated regulatory pathways, with limited supporting clinical data, making it imperative to continue research to provide additional, more robust information on their safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and long-term protection; all of which are important to consider risk, minimize damage and maintain public confidence over time.\n\n30 Patel MK\n\nBergeri I\n\nBresee JS\n\net al.

Equity and the Cuban National Health System's response to COVID-19. An observational study under real-world conditions is difficult to conduct without introducing bias, given the lack of vaccine randomization and of balance between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons with respect to the risk of contracting the disease. The main biases of concern for this study (the search for and access to healthcare, diagnosis confirmation, exclusion of persons with prior COVID-19 infection, and previous vaccine administration, among others) coincide with the bias described by WHO.Overall, our adjusted sensitivity analyses of qRT-PCR tested individuals by immunization status were qualitatively similar to those obtained by considering the complete cohort, and provides empirical evidence that they are unaffected by a potential differential health care access. Potential under-testing, under-diagnosis and under-notification bias cannot be ruled out and should be considered as a limitation. All three were minimized by performing confirmatory qRT-PCR tests on everyone with COVID-19 symptoms, as well as on their contacts, a practice established in the Cuban National COVID-19 Action Protocol (Version 1.6)and backed by the characteristics of the Cuban health system described previously.\n\nTo control for prior infection bias those who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR+) before the start of the study were excluded. During the study period, the number of tests was considerably expanded nationwide, increasing the number of qRT-PCR and antigen tests performed.\n\nSelection biases and confounding effects due to possible imbalances caused by comorbidities associated with the disease were unavoidable potential limitations and should be considered when assessing our study. It was not possible either to fix propensity bias to get vaccinated, or propensity to get vaccinated early in the study period. Data on ethnicity were not collected either, considering that Cuba is a country with an important mix of race among the population and no particular ethnic groups share economic, cultural and social characteristics.\n\n9 Noda Alonso S\n\nFernández Perdomo Y. Variantes Genéticas Aumentan la Severidad de la COVID-19. Mesa Redonda con la Dra. Guadalupe Guzmán. Outcome misclassification due to false negatives cannot be completely ruled out, even if a test with high SARS-CoV-2 specificity was used. Finally, although vaccination registries may have missed some vaccinated individuals within the Cuban healthcare system, automated data collection via the ANDARIEGO.HIGIA registry minimized this effect. Although genomic sequencing in Havana detected a switch from beta to delta as the main variant of concern with the highest circulation during the study period,we lack representative contextual data from that period.\n\nThe study period encompasses the most complex epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Havana. From our point of view, the accelerated and high coverage vaccination campaign carried out and including all population (regardless of age, sex, skin colour, economic status, religion or political trends), based on community participation and supported by governmental institutions, contributed decisively to a fast decline of cases, severe disease and deaths, allowing for the recovering of social and productive activities - including the opening of airports - a few weeks later, which continued until today.\n\nOur results contribute to a better understanding of Abdala's effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the importance of these studies in demonstrating vaccine protection against severe illness and death from COVID-19, and ratify the usefulness of vaccines as essential tools to control the disease and improve its outcomes. These data may also be useful to health policymakers for use in controlling COVID-19 in their respective settings.\n\nFollow-up on these effectiveness values over time and the need to apply booster doses to maintain effective protection are pending tasks requiring further research. However, it merits repeating that vaccines alone will not solve the problems associated with the pandemic; success in meeting these challenges requires a health system capable of rapid and organized action. This was a great strength that contributed to our ability to achieve results in a comparatively short time.\n\nThe Abdala vaccine showed high effectiveness in preventing severe illness and death under real-world conditions. Future studies will make it possible to assess the duration of the vaccine's protection over the long term, as well as the advisability of booster doses.",

    "Cuba grew up with Family Code, Díaz-Canel states": "President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on Sunday that Cuba grew up in the process generated by the new Family Code, and expressed confidence in its approval in today's referendum.\n\nIn statements to reporters after exercising his right to vote, the president pointed out that although there should not be a unanimous vote, he does expect majority support from citizens. He acknowledged that a part of Cuban society still fails to understand some elements contained in the regulations because, in 62 years of the Revolution, patriarchal criteria have persisted in some people and families.\n\nThe head of State added that the process of constructing the Code respected everyone’s right to an opinion, but he regretted that for reasons of belief a part of the citizenry still does not understand that the law respects the type of family that they defend and also protects the rights of other forms of love.\n\nDíaz-Canel noted that a strategy of demonization of the Cuban Revolution, of discredit, is also underway, which generates a lot of hatred towards everything related to it, mainly on social networks.\n\nIn this regard, he added that those who are part of this platform use very aggressive language against the Code, but none of it has to do with convictions or opinions, because if it said the opposite, they would still criticize it because it is a legal norm within the Revolution.\n\nDíaz-Canel highlighted the benefits of the legal document, which gives rights and guarantees to the entire society regardless of the type of family organization.\n\nHe stressed that the Family Code was a necessity since the nation has become more heterogeneous and there were debts from the legal point of view, evident in the life stories told these days, recorded in research works, and in situations discussed in court.\n\nThe new law resolves these issues, said the president, who extolled the participation of the people and experts in the process of building the law, and urged them to read it and interpret it with their hearts, putting themselves in the place of others, of those who have experienced complex situations.\n\nI think that Cuba has grown up, the president emphasized, adding that this is the most important thing, the growth as a society.\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revolución\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revolución\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revolución",
    "Three Crises Merge in Cuba’s Economy: Causes & Risks": "From Progreso Weekly\n\nBy Julio Carranza (Progreso Weekly)\n\nHAVANA TIMES – What follows is a text trying to summarize, in a concrete way, the main factors that affect, characterize and challenge the Cuban economy at this time.\n\nFirstly, we must take into account that the economy has been in crisis mode for a long period of time with some intermittent but insufficient recoveries, which began in the 1990s — since the fall of the socialist camp and the disappearance of the USSR, plus the intensification of the U.S. blockade. It all gave rise to the obsolescence of the economic model that, without going into details and nuances now, was essentially inspired by the economies of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe that had been established during the first decades of institutionalization of the revolution, especially in the 70s and 80s. This stage, by the way, corresponded to the period of greatest growth and stability of the economy.\n\nPreviously we have tried to make a periodization of this long stage of crisis that has already lasted for more than three decades until reaching this last critical segment that begins in 2020, when the main economic indicators have once again fallen notably and the standard of living of the population has contracted perhaps as in no other previous period, including the special period of the 1990s. In this case with a different generation and under the leadership of a government that, for logical reasons, does not and could not have the influence, the historical authority and the leadership of the then-government.\n\nFactors affecting the current situation:\n\nThe intensification of the U.S. blockade that, after the important but very brief moment of notable improvement in relations with the U.S. during the end of the Barack Obama administration, has reached strong extremes under the delusional administration of Donald Trump and that, so far, has been essentially unchanged during the first two years of Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe impact of the global COVID 19 pandemic, which for more than two years has meant the almost total loss of income derived from tourism, and the commitment of important and very scarce resources to face its various internal consequences.\n\nThe extraordinary achievement during this period, perhaps the only significant one in this context, was by the Cuban scientific community that quickly and effectively obtained more than one vaccine to guarantee total coverage of the population is remarkable.\n\nThe weight of the external debt, time and time again partially renegotiated with Cuba’s main creditors (including China and Russia, with whom it was possible to suspend the payment of their service until 2027), but which continues to limit the country’s access to credit, trade, and international investment.\n\nThe deterioration of the international situation, impacted by the war in Ukraine, which, in economic terms, is characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the markets, as well as by a strong inflationary process worldwide.\n\nFinally, an essential factor of an internal nature is the late, slow and not sufficiently integrated economic reform that the national economy should have.\n\nIf the combination of the above factors is taken into account, it could be stated that the challenges and pressures have been enormous and the response has not been up to the task and with the certainty and agility required. Although the resistance capacity that the country has shown in the face of difficulties and aggression must be recognized, despite moments of increased social tension.\n\nThree crises at once\n\nTrying to dissect the current situation, it could be said that the national economy faces at least three crises that overlap and reinforce each other in the same time and space:\n\n1. The structural crisis of the economic model:\n\nAs we stated earlier, beyond the discussion of whether or not it was the best option, the reality is that for years the Cuban economy established a model for organizing the economy inspired by the socialist economies of Eastern Europe and accompanied by a process of integration in the economic space that they formed with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CAME).\n\nThe disappearance of that world and the closure of the economic space that had allowed Cuba to largely overcome the isolation imposed by the U.S. blockade, made evident from very early on in the 90s the need for a fundamental economic reform of the economy, not to abandon its socialist horizon, but to adapt it to the new and difficult international conditions. Contributing and discussing that necessary change is what motivated our book published in Havana in 1995, “Cuba: Restructuring the Economy: A Contribution to the Debate” (Carranza, Gutiérrez and Monreal). However, beyond specific changes, some of them certainly very important, up to now the model of organization of the national economy has not been restructured to the extent needed and with the necessary depth.\n\nAfter almost two decades of debates and above all the accumulation of evidence, the party congresses discussed and approved documents that opened the political space to advance in the necessary economic reform, mainly “The conceptualization of the economic model,” the “Guidelines” and finally the new Constitution of the Republic approved by the majority vote of the population. However, the measures for change were adopted slowly (if not late) and without sufficient comprehensiveness, which has delayed and continues to delay the articulation of the only strategic solution that, in our opinion, the Cuban socialist economy has in overcoming the immense challenges it faces and the enormous pressures that oppose it.\n\nEssential to the process is the integrating the different economic actors based on their various forms of ownership and management, a deep reform of the state company (leader of the system), reform of the agricultural production subsystem, modification of the relationship between planning and the market, move the economic model towards greater decentralization, construction of markets — including the means of production and monetary markets — with their corresponding regulations, an active monetary, exchange and fiscal policy economically based and rigorously implemented, a focused and effective social policy, an investment policy that respond to national priorities, etc. and everything in the right sequence.\n\nThe reform of the state company is a key point. Make changes, both in their internal organization (so that they better express the interests of their owner, which is the people), as well as the ways in which they relate to each other and to the rest of the economic actors, to create the conditions that allow them to raise their efficiency, which today, in general terms, is at clearly low levels.\n\nA more dynamic economy is needed with greater autonomy and in a competitive context and strong financial restrictions. The leadership of the state company in the national economy should not and cannot be established by “decree,” but rather the result of its scale, efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe proper operation of the markets, with the necessary regulations, including the money market, is impossible without a reformed state company that allows it to attend to them without causing strong distortions. The markets must integrate all the economic actors (state, cooperative and private, plus foreign investment companies), under the leadership of the state company, which must also respond to a more strategic and financial planning than traditional bureaucratic planning that has affected the socialist economies, the Cuban one included.\n\nThe macroeconomic crisis\n\nSecond, the precipitated macroeconomic crisis after 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic — in a two year period the economy contracted more than 13%, with a very slight recovery of 1.3% during the last year — imports were drastically and abruptly reduced, with which the scarcity of practically everything invaded the spaces of the national economy, generating multiple difficulties and growing discomfort in the population.\n\nAll marketing spaces have been characterized over the last two and a half years by a sustained shortage and permanent queues, more in those that offer products in national currency, but also in those that offer in MLC, the latter more difficult to understand since it is a segment that can finance itself and sustain the flow of foreign exchange that favors the economy. (In this sense, and as several economists have been proposing for some time, a greater liberalization of the wholesale and retail markets has recently been decided, a measure still to be implemented.)\n\nThe most evident expression of this dimension of the crisis is the galloping inflation and the monetary chaos that remains and grows in the country as a result of the contraction of the economy and also of the insufficiencies and inaccuracies with which the economic policy has been conducted during the last two and a half years, including how the so-called “monetary order” — started in January 2021 — was conceived and implemented.\n\nWe have expanded on the reasons for the impact of this on the growth of inflation in previous articles. The causes of inflation are not only in the economic and monetary policy, without a doubt there are also external factors, but the internal economic policy has fueled it notably.\n\nOn the one hand, the multiplication of business costs with the devaluation of the national currency from January 2021, and then, trying to compensate for the rise in prices with an excessive expansion of demand with the increase in various incomes and the distribution of “utilities” without the productive support and precise calculations that allow maintaining macroeconomic balances and keeping the fiscal deficit under control, essential factors for the stability and growth of any economy.\n\nThe strong expansion of demand in an economy such as Cuba’s, where the country’s industrial and productive base in general, including agriculture, is so affected, while still tied by clearly unjustified limitations (in addition to pressure from the blockade), makes the response to that monetary expansion not productive but inflationary, it does not exist, so that it can be quickly activated, what Keynesians called “multiplication factor”.\n\nHence the importance of the underestimated sequentiality and comprehensiveness of the reform. Before multiplying costs and expanding demand, conditions must be created for the recovery of supply via production with adequate progress in the comprehensive economic reform, including the consolidation of the different economic actors, including the emerging private sector of SMEs and cooperatives, as well as and essentially, we insist, the reform of the state company, also with a part of the available foreign exchange dedicated to maintain essential imports, especially medicines, food and certain means of production, even when this implies a reduction in the rate of investment in sectors such as tourism.\n\nIn other words, of course, the establishment of an integrated exchange market and monetary order must be a very important component of the reform, but not in any way, with any order, or at any time.\n\nAdded to the regulations are the recent measures for the establishment of a market for the purchase and sale of currencies, but it is being carried out again in a partial, limited and disintegrated manner, which has motivated a new spiral of growth in the price of foreign currency in the parallel market, with all its implications, among them the rise of inflation, which mainly affects the lower-income sectors, which in Cuba affects the largest sector of the population.\n\nIt should be noted that certain official prices (including fuel and other services and products offered in the state network) have maintained their level anchored in the exchange of 1 USD for 24 CUP, which was established in January 2021. However, due to the new official parallel rate OF 1 USD for 120 CUP, plus the informal one that is already around 150 CUP, it turns out that for holders of foreign currency or MLC (not the majority of the population that only receives national currency and therefore deals with low incomes), these products and services have, via the exchange rate, a comparatively low price (gasoline is a typical case), which causes significant losses to the state. It is the expression of the great distortion of the money market that this process has created.\n\nMonetary policy is a fundamental instrument of economic policy and also of social policy. It cannot be treated simply as a mechanism for “recovery” of foreign currency because these negative distortions are generated. Previously we had stated that the idea of ​​evaluating the possibility of investing a few million dollars to expand and bring the money market under control — of course there is not enough foreign currency — is not a minor matter. It is a fundamental factor in contributing to put the foreign exchange market and inflation under greater control — a fundamental social priority. It might even be possible to obtain international credits for this purpose. It is a subject as complex as it is essential, so a discussion about it with the corresponding specialists, calculating and reviewing the data, would be very convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, continuing to seek and apply various ways to alleviate the pressure of the external debt is also a factor of great importance, including the exchange of debt for investment, bond issuance, etc. Without payment guarantees there is no possibility of obtaining the resources that the country needs through credit and investment. This is a critical point.\n\nThe country’s economists have talked a lot, and rightly so, about the need for a more balanced investment policy adjusted to national priorities where the agricultural sector stands out for its role in guaranteeing the food security of the population, now notably affected.\n\nAccording to calculations made by economists, between 2 billion and 2.5 billion dollars of investment per year would be necessary to sustain a GDP growth rate of more than 5% per year. The current level is very far from that figure. This supposes greater incentives and policy updates for foreign investment, including aspects such as direct payment to workers hired by investors, etc. But to return to our essential point, an economic model that works in an integrated and efficient manner is also decisive in this matter, including the existence and functionality of structures such as financial services, insurance, post, connectivity. Do they exist? Yes. Do they work effectively? No.\n\nThe sectoral crisis\n\nAdded to the two previous dimensions of the crisis is the specific crisis in important sectors of the economy: mainly energy and agriculture.\n\nThe former is affected not only by prices and difficulties in accessing fuel, but also, and very importantly, by the lack of sufficient foresight in the maintenance cycles of the country’s main power plants, as well as in fuel tanks, which is the reason for constant breakages and accidents. Are they causes or risks?\n\nOf course, the lack of foreign currency and the blockade limits the proper maintenance and capital repairs, but it is a factor that the economy must have enough time and include in its strategic plans. There is not only an economic problem in this, there is also a national security problem.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that the insufficient progress in the installation of alternative energy sources that contribute to changing the national energy matrix. Cuba still has an immense space and conditions to advance in this field.\n\nOn the other hand, the crisis in the agricultural sector, which despite having benefited from a set of liberalizing measures has not yet had the strategic transformation it needs. That is, as we have stated on other occasions, what is needed is a profound change of the agricultural production subsystem as part of the general and comprehensive reform of the economy. “A group of measures” is not enough, no matter how positive they may be. The incentives, links and forms of management in the entire agricultural sector, from production and distribution to marketing and consumption, must be fully transformed.\n\nThe country cannot allow itself to have strong limitations in the supply of food and at the same time idle land and other lands with productivity levels far below those that could be obtained, even taking into account the strong limitations imposed by the blockade.\n\nMention should also be made here of the deterioration of the traditional sugar sector, whose current production levels are still insufficient even to cover national demand.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is imperative that the economic strategy and the economic policy respond to these three crises at the same time, with the integrality and the necessary sequence, without the solutions to the emergencies dismantling or hindering the strategic solution that is, I insist, in the integral and deep transformation of the organization of the economic model, preserving its character of justice and social inclusion, complex and difficult, yes, impossible, no. The future of the country is at stake. Time runs fast and is a critical variable.\n\n*Julio Carranza, PhD in Economic Sciences, is considered among the most lucid Cuban specialists.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times.",
    "More migrants are coming from dictatorships like Venezuela and Cuba": "It took nearly a month for Fabricio Hoyos to make the dangerous and uncertain trek from Venezuela to the United States. But as he arrived at a migrant processing center recently, he had another long journey ahead: the process of seeking asylum.\n\nCBS News national correspondent Manuel Bojoquez spoke to Hoyos at the migrant processing center, located in El Paso, Texas, where around 1,500 migrants are seen each day. About half of those being seen at the center are coming from Venezuela.\n\nThey are part of what U.S. Customs and Border Protection have called a \"new wave\" of migration. 157,921 people were encountered at borders nationwide last month, according to the agency — a 2.2% increase from the month before.\n\n\"Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,\" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said this week in a statement.\n\nHe added that \"those fleeing repressive regimes pose significant challenges for processing and removal.\"\n\nAt the center in El Paso, migrants are screened and vetted, and identified and classified, according U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Landon Hutchens. They — along with people coming from Nicaragua and Cuba — are processed under Title 8 authorities, said Hutchens. That usually allows them to be released and request asylum, a process that typically takes years to complete.\n\nBut not everyone is allowed in. According to Customs and Border Protection, more than 1.3 million migrants have been deported or expelled so far this year. It's a number greater than those still in the United States.\n\nStill, critics say the Biden administration's policies incentivize migrant crossings.",
    "Cuba swelters through power outages amid an energy grid in need of an overhaul": "At their wits' end, hundreds of people in Nuevitas, took to the streets two weeks ago banging pots and pans at night.\n\nSporadic protests have been recorded throughout Cuba since scheduled blackouts increased this spring: people have come out to vent in the towns like Los Palacios in the west, cities like Camagüey in the center of the island and Santiago in the east.\n\n“There have been dozens of protests around the country, generally small scale, confined to particular neighborhoods,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University.\n\n“So far the government has been smart in how it has responded,” he added. “Not one of them has expanded like (last year’s) July 11 demonstrations, and the government has tried to be responsive, having local officials come out and tell people when the power is coming back.”\n\nWhen protesters came out in Los Palacios in June, the president of the municipal parliamentary assembly, Jose Ramón Cabrera, went to speak with them. After trying to “transmit confidence” to the protesteors, he said delegates and protesters “hugged each other.”\n\nBut in authoritarian Cuba, cuddles can mingle with coercion. The three people contacted by NBC in Nuevitas about the protests, which went on for two nights, all declined to give their names for fear of reprisals. All said plainclothes police officers and even special forces appeared following the protests. Justicia 11, a human rights group that monitors arrests on the island, said that following the protests, 19 people in the municipality have been arrested.\n\nInfrastructure decays, sanctions bite\n\nThe Cuban government says the energy crisis is driven by a lack of fuel and an aging energy grid. “We have a situation of deterioration,” Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged recently, “which cannot be quickly resolved.”\n\nHe’s not wrong: half of Cuba’s electricity comes from 13 thermoelectric plants, most of which were built in the Soviet times. Before even considering fuel, the country needs $250 million a year just to maintain and operate its grid, according to the Cuban Ministry of Energy and Mines.\n\nDecades of underinvestment mean that most infrastructure in Cuba is old and often shoddy. With revenue streams pinched, it’s not clear the state has enough money for upkeep.\n\nMiriam Cortes poses with her fan next to a photo of Fidel Castro during a planned power outage in Regla, Cuba, on Aug. 1. Ramon Espinosa / AP\n\nWhile protesters mainly blame the government, experts consulted by NBC said U.S. sanctions on the island — which specifically target energy shipments — make the blackouts worse.\n\nThe U.S. embargo on Cuba, which turned 60 this year, is the longest and most comprehensive regime of sanctions in modern history.\n\nIn word and deed, the Trump administration reprised the initial logic behind the sanctions — “alienating internal support” for the regime by visiting “economic dissatisfaction and hardship” on the population, in the words of President Dwight Eisenhower’s State Department. To stymie hard currency inflows, the Trump administration hammered the island with more than 200 new measures, part of its “maximum pressure” campaign.\n\nDespite his campaign promise to “reverse the failed Trump policies that inflicted harm on Cubans”, President Joe Biden has so far left most of them in place.\n\n“The embargo is a major contributing factor to the power cuts because (it is) one of the major reasons for the government’s shortage of foreign exchange currency,” LeoGrande said.\n\n“Without foreign exchange currency, the government cannot afford the parts and supplies for proper maintenance of the electrical grid’s equipment. They cannot afford to expand the grid’s capacity to keep up with rising demand,” he said.\n\nIn addition, a long-term decline in oil shipments from its main ally, Venezuela, has forced the country to buy more petroleum on the open market; the Covid pandemic has crushed tourism revenues; and now Russia's invasion of Ukraine has ramped up global gas prices.\n\nWith allies' help, trying to get the lights back on\n\nVenezuela and Mexico, both of which sent specialist teams to help put out last month’s fire, have said they will help rebuild the supertanker storage facility in Matanzas.\n\nThe role of Russia is also critical: analysts say the American and the European Union sanctions imposed on Moscow after the Ukraine invasion are forcing the government of President Vladimir Putin to find new oil outlets. Shortly after the fire, a Russian tanker carrying 700,000 barrels of oil docked on the island.\n\nDíaz-Canel said new investments will allow a gradual recovery of the electrical system. By December, he said, the country will be able to “reduce blackouts as far as possible, even reducing them to zero.”\n\nSince the fire, Cuban officials have held talks with a Turkish company to have it double the megawatts it currently produces from floating power plants.\n\nTrying to run Grand Prix 'with a 1954 Chevy'\n\nThe Communist Party of Cuba will likely be breathing a sigh of relief after getting through a disastrous summer without a repeat of last year’s historic protests. In addition, five years on from the Obama administration's historic opening of relations with Cuba, Washington’s renewed policy of regime change toward the island is yet to bear fruit.\n\nFrom the government’s standpoint, there are some green shoots: tourism — one of the economy’s main engines — is reviving; energy demand is projected to reduce as fall approaches and air conditioning units are switched off; and if, as polls predict, Luis Inácio Lula de Silva is elected president next month in Brazil, Havana will count on a hefty new ally with a history of ploughing money into the island.\n\nAnd yet Cuba’s energy troubles are too deep-seated to go away any time soon. Economists agree that unless the government makes the island’s moribund economy much more productive, it won’t be able to build the new energy plants it needs and will remain stuck with its current policy: a “Band-Aid solution”, according to Jorge Piñon, senior research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute.\n\n“You cannot continue to run these old plants that are tired and worn out.

    "WOLA Event: A Compounding Crisis in Cuba": "Join the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) and the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) for a discussion on the current crisis in Cuba\n\nAlthough Cuba’s government has sought to spur economic growth in recent years by shrinking the state sector, encouraging greater foreign investment, and expanding the private sector, the sluggish implementation and counterproductive nature of these measures and the ongoing crisis has enacted a deep toll on the quality of life of the Cuban people. Some of the economic measures aimed at the long-term improvement of the Cuban economy have had a dire impact on the ability of Cuban families to survive. In practice, the crisis has meant that Cubans are forced to endure hours-long energy blackouts and stagnated incomes, extreme inflation, and a lack of basic goods and services. The goods that are available on the shelves are often more expensive or in hard-to-obtain currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Lower-income families and Afro-Cubans bear the brunt of this as not all have equal access to foreign currency from abroad. Remittances are one of the top sources for Cuba’s hard currency and play a major role in the ability of many Cuban families and the private sector to survive the ongoing economic crisis on the island. As the Biden administration continues to hold back specifics on how its recent measures will successfully be implemented, Cuban-Americans and others continue to struggle to support their loved ones on the island.\n\nCuba’s economic crisis—defined by extreme inflation, a shrinking GDP, the accumulation of social debts, goods shortages, high external dependency, and weak economic growth—leaves many questions about the island’s economic development and its future overall.\n\nOn Friday, September 9, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. EST, join the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) for a discussion with experts on the current state of Cuba’s crisis, how it differs from the special period in the 90s, and the island’s future overall. A Compounding Crisis: Domestic Shortcomings, U.S. policies, and the Impact on Everyday Cubans will explore weaknesses within Cuba’s economic model, recently announced economic reforms, the role of remittances and the Cuban diaspora, and how U.S. sanctions disproportionately impact Cuban families and the private sector while having relatively unchanged levels of impact on the state economy.\n\nREGISTER ON ZOOM\n\nEvent Details:\n\nFriday, September 9, 2022\n\n10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. EST\n\nPanelists:\n\nOscar Fernández\n\nCuban Economist and Entrepreneur\n\nAnamary Maqueira\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Economics at\n\nthe University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nDenisse Delgado\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Public Policy\n\nat the University of Massachusetts, Boston\n\nModerator:\n\nRicardo Torres\n\nResearch Fellow at the Center for Latin American\n\nand Latino Studies at American University\n\nThis event will be livestreamed via WOLA’s YouTube page.",
    "Mark Cuban says 25% of his ‘Shark Tank’ deals are flops: ‘What the hell was I thinking?’": "After 13 seasons on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" Mark Cuban estimates that he's had about as many hits as misses.\n\nSome of his on-screen deals have worked out great, he says. Others, not so much. Such is the risk of investing. But even when it comes to the ones that eventually left him scratching his own head, Cuban tells CNBC Make It that he has \"no regrets.\"\n\nBy Cuban's own estimation, roughly one in four of his \"Shark Tank\" deals \"have done really well or crushed it,\" he told a local Denver ABC affiliate on Friday. \"Fifty percent ... have been good and continue to go on, and 25% where I just think to myself: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"\n\nOne notable example: Cuban has highlighted the Breathometer, billed as \"the world's first smartphone breathalyzer,\" as his worst \"Shark Tank\" investment to date. Cuban said he lost roughly $500,000 on the deal, after investing in the business in 2013.\n\n\"That was my biggest beating,\" Cuban told CNBC Make It in July.\n\nIn total, the billionaire investor has struck more than 200 on-screen deals worth more than $61 million in his time on the show, according to a recent online estimate. On Monday, Cuban told Forbes that the real-life figure is closer to $29 million: Not all of the deals depicted on the show make it all the way to closing.\n\nCuban says his \"Shark Tank\" deals aren't always solely about bringing in big financial returns. \"I'm good with that with my 'Shark Tank' companies,\" Cuban wrote on Twitter in July. \"I don't do the show to get the best investments. And I don't always invest because I think I'll make money. Sometimes my deals are purely to help someone or send a message.\"\n\nThat's why he doesn't seem to mind not yet being in the black when it comes to his total investments on the show. In July, Cuban told the \"Full Send\" podcast that he's taken a net loss on all of his \"Shark Tank\" investments so far. He later clarified that he meant \"on a cash basis,\" only accounting for the investments he's already exited.\n\n\"I haven't gotten out more than I have put in. But that doesn't account for all the ongoing, operating businesses and their valuations,\" Cuban told CNBC Make It at the time.\n\nDeals that flop are an inevitability of investing, according to fellow \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary. \"You make 10 investments, you get two to three huge hits. And it pays for the other seven [failed investments],\" O'Leary told CNBC Make It last month.\n\nStill, Cuban says he's beginning to think about when he should step away from \"Shark Tank\" to focus on his own ventures, including the new online pharmacy Cost Plus Drugs.\n\n\"Part of me wants to quit,\" Cuban told Forbes on Monday.\n\nThe investor didn't offer any timeline for when he might depart the popular program, but said the show could likely weather his exit: \"They'll survive fine without me.\"\n\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter\n\nDon't miss:\n\nWhy Mark Cuban called this 'Shark Tank' CEO who brought in millions 'a great case for what not to do'\n\nBarbara Corcoran to 'Shark Tank' start-up: This common mental mistake is 'the biggest danger' to your success",
    "‘Cuba Libre’: Keshet International Boards Ambitious Portuguese TV Drama About Che Guevara Follower Ana Maria Silva Pais": "EXCLUSIVE: Keshet International has secured rights to Cuba Libre, a buzzy drama about a follower of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara that’s being billed as one of Portugal’s most ambitious television series ever. The six-part biopic, based on the life of Ana Maria Silva Pais, will form part of KI’s slate at Mipcom Cannes next month.\n\nProduced by Hop! Films for Portugal’s public service broadcaster RTP, the drama follows newcomer Beatriz Godinho in the lead role of Annie, a young Portuguese woman joined the Cuban revolution and gave everything to Che Guevara. The show debuts on RTP tomorrow (September 21) and you can watch the trailer below, with English subtitles.\n\nPais, whose story is told against the backdrop of the Cold War, was the only daughter of the Director General of Portugal’s secret service, the PIDE. Considered a culture lover and legendary beauty, she often clashed with her family’s political opinions in a dictatorship-run Portugal and eventually escaped to Havana with her Swiss diplomat husband. There, she abandoned her life and joined the Cuban revolution, secretly falling in love with the storied Guevara along the way.\n\nJoining Godinho (O Sítio da Mulher Morta) in the biggest international cast ever assembled in a Portuguese drama are Adriano Luz (Mysteries of Lisbon, Night Train to Lisbon) and Margarida Marinho (Meu Amor, Low-Flying Aircraft), who play her parents Fernando and Nita, and French-German actor Pierre Kiwitt (Das Boot, Charité II) plays her husband Raymond. Most of the casting was done over Zoom during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHenrique Oliveira (1986, Vidago Palace), Hop!’s Managing Director, is producer, writer and director. “This has been something of a passion project for me, and it’s taken 20 years to bring Annie’s story to screen having first read about her in a newspaper article,” he said. “This series is quite probably the most ambitious period drama ever produced in Portugal – certainly in terms of its international cast – and I’m thrilled the team at Keshet International is representing it.”\n\nAnke Stoll, KI’s VP of Acquisitions and Co-productions, added: “This is an incredible true story of a woman who changed so many lives to follow her passion and strong political beliefs. The team at Hop! Films have done a fantastic job bringing her vibrant story to life for TV viewers.”\n\nSeveral companies are understood to have tracked the project but ultimately KI, which has sold several local language shows internationally, picked up the rights.\n\nKeren Shahar, KI’s COO and President of Distribution, said: “Adding this vibrant, colorful and authentic drama to our slate brings me joy. Not only is this a captivating watch, but I’m thrilled that we’re helping to bring Annie’s life story to global audiences. It’s fitting that more people will get to learn of her influential role in Cuba’s history.”\n\nOther shows on KI’s Mipcom slate include My Name is Reeva: I Was Murdered by Oscar Pistorius, Rabbit Films’ coming-of-age thriller Summer of Sorrow, which was selected for the 2022 MipTV Drama Showcase in April; Woodcut Media’s World’s Most Evil Killers and reality competition format The Perfect Dessert, which returns to Keshet 12 during the World Cup for a second season.",

    "Cubans flee island’s economic woes by air, land and sea": "MIAMI (AP) — One Cuban man endured a trek through eight countries that lasted more than a month. Another man paid a small fortune for a furtive speedboat trip. A third decided to risk a perilous passage aboard a homemade raft rather than stay a moment longer on the island.\n\nCubans are fleeing their country in the largest numbers in more than four decades, choosing to stake their lives and futures on a dangerous journey to the United States by air, land and sea to escape economic and political woes.\n\nMost fly to Nicaragua as tourists and slowly make their way to the U.S. border, often to Texas or Arizona . A smaller number gamble on an ocean voyage. Three men who survived the odyssey spoke to The Associated Press about it.\n\nTens of thousands of others share the same goal. From January to July, U.S. border authorities stopped Cuban migrants entering from Mexico nearly 155,000 times, more than six times as many as in the same period of 2021. From October to August, the Coast Guard intercepted more than 4,600 Cubans, an almost sixfold increase over the entire previous year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vast majority are released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to immigration authorities.\n\nIn all, it is the largest flight of Cuban exiles since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when nearly 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. over a six-month period.\n\nThe exodus is fueled by Cuba’s worst economic conditions in decades — a result of tightened U.S. sanctions and a hangover from COVID-19.\n\nMassive street protests in mid-2021 triggered widespread arrests and fears of political oppression that prompted more to flee. An additional enticement emerged in November, when Nicaragua stopped requiring visas for Cubans to promote tourism.\n\nTwo of the three men spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity because they fear for the safety of relatives still on the island. These are their accounts of the trip:\n\n___\n\nCROSSING EIGHT COUNTRIES AND TWO RIVERS\n\nRolando José Cisneros Borroto, who worked as a street vendor in Camaguey, a city in central Cuba, said he was tired of going hungry and decided to leave his wife and three children in hope of finding a job in the U.S that would help sustain his family.\n\nBorroto, 42, sold everything — his house, furniture and television — to pay for the journey, collecting $13,000. His family stayed in another house that belongs to the wife.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter taking six flights, he finally arrived in Nicaragua in June. From there he went overland to Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nHe crossed two rivers on an inflatable rubber ring, walked through mountains and along highways, and got rides aboard buses, cars and motorcycles.\n\nWhile hiding from Mexican police, he spent days drinking water from a river and eating only grass. He finally crossed into the U.S. south of Del Rio, Texas, and surrendered to the Border Patrol.\n\nBorroto was released after three days of detention and now lives in Algona, Iowa, where a cousin offered him a room in his house and food. The trip lasted 36 days.\n\n“I never thought it would take so much work to arrive,” said Borroto, who was detained at least three times in Cuba for selling garlic in the streets. “What one goes through along the way I do not advise anyone, but Cubans prefer to die on the way before staying in Cuba.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA PROTEST, A PROSECUTION AND A SPEEDBOAT\n\nAnother Cuban man, 35, participated in protests in July 2021, when thousands of people across the island clamored for food and a change of government. He was tried on charges of public disorder and contempt and freed after 30 days in jail to await sentencing.\n\nHe fled in February, the month before he was to be sentenced to five years in prison. Air travel was out of the question because he would be stopped at the airport upon showing his passport. A raft was too dangerous.\n\nA speedboat “was the only way to escape,” the man said in an interview at the office of his Miami attorney, Wilfredo Allen. He left the island without telling his 5-year-old daughter. Only his wife, his mother and a brother knew.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnemployed, he asked his father, who lives in Texas, for about $15,000 to pay smugglers who gave him instructions over the phone.\n\nTwo days before the trip, he traveled 250 miles (400 kilometers) to Ciego de Avila, a city in the center of the island. From there, a bus picked him up along with 30 other people, and took them about 60 miles (100 kilometers) to one of the Cuba keys to board the speedboat. Among the migrants were a pregnant woman and a 7-year-old boy.\n\nThey passed through the Bahamas and, after 12 hours, arrived at an unknown place in the Florida Keys, at dawn. The boat stopped in a mangrove swamp. Then they came ashore, and several cars picked them up on a highway. A Cuban friend met him at a house where he was taken.\n\nA DESPERATE VOYAGE ON A HOMEMADE RAFT\n\nCubans who can’t afford a speedboat or the $10,000 to $15,000 for travel and smuggling fees to fly to Nicaragua sometimes flee on rafts made from pipes or wood.\n\nAmong them was a 37-year-old man who occasionally worked in construction and fished. He couldn’t pay a smuggler, so he built a raft of 10-foot aluminum tubes. In May 2021 he traveled with three friends for 22 hours until they reached south Florida.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The first thing one thinks of is leaving, that either we all die of hunger little by little, or we make an attempt,” said the man, who secretly constructed the raft over six months. “I knew I could die in the water, but I needed to take the risk.”\n\nHe built the raft alone and kept it hidden in bushes and mangroves. The same day of the journey, he purchased a small engine that allowed him to travel at about 6 mph (10 kph).\n\nNo one knew about the trip, except his three companions, his mother and his wife. For fear of being discovered, he told his companions the date of their travel just a few hours before they left.\n\nThey departed late at night, rowing out from a fishing port west of Havana, he said in a long interview at Allen’s office. With no GPS, they navigated by the stars.\n\nA whole day passed, and when night started to fall again, they saw the entry buoys to an island. They approached the coast and walked.\n\n“At least we’re alive,” he thought, but they soon realized that someone was calling authorities to report them. They immediately ran back to the boat and returned to the sea, fearing that they would be detained and deported.\n\nThey waited in the water for a while and later reached a beach in Key West, where a group of Cuban tourists offered to take them to Miami. The man called his wife to tell her that he had arrived safely and was on his way to his in-laws’ house.\n\nHe is now seeking asylum and hoping to bring his wife and three teenage daughters to join him in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Andrea Rodríguez in Havana contributed this report.",
    "The largest mass emigration in Cuba’s history continues": "A Cuban stands with his makeshift raft on a beach near Havana. ADALBERTO ROQUE (AFP)\n\nCuba’s latest migration crisis is breaking records. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports that in the last 11 months, nearly 180,000 Cubans crossed the US-Mexico border, and another 8,000 tried to make it to the United States by sea. In addition, the US Coast Guard reports that it intercepted 5,421 Cuban rafters trying to cross the Florida Straits since October 2021, and about 3,000 made it to US shores, numbers that exceed the total number of rafters detained in the last five years. The current Cuban exodus is unprecedented and far surpasses previous mass emigrations like the 1980 Mariel boatlift (125,000 people) and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis (35,000 people).\n\nThe Cuban sociologists and economists we interviewed all agree that the hemorrhaging will not be stanched anytime soon and may even worsen due to deteriorating living conditions and economic hardship in Cuba. They believe that the current crisis is structural and that it will take years of investment, financial aid and radical reforms for the country to recover, measures that the Cuban government may be reluctant to take.\n\nMore information The US embargo against Cuba turns 60 with no policy change on the horizon\n\nCuban and US news outlets publish daily reports of deportations, shipwrecks, human trafficking operations and harrowing accounts of the land and sea journeys made by these Cuban emigrants. Hundreds have been killed by the mafias that control illegal migration in Central America and Mexico, while others have drowned at sea or crossing the Rio Grande. But this hasn’t deterred the desperate people who continue to leave Cuba.\n\nThe US Embassy in Cuba recently announced that the US is increasing patrols and enforcement by land, air and sea, as well as a new “interagency task force responsible for deterring, preventing, and responding to illegal maritime migration under Operation Vigilant Sentry. The primary objectives of the task force are to prevent loss of life at sea and to deter and dissuade maritime migration using Department of Homeland Security forces.”\n\nCuban television reporters recently interviewed several rafters deported from the US, including a young woman with a small child, who told how they nearly died at sea. They vowed not to try and emigrate illegally again, sending a clear message of deterrence to viewers. But it is unlikely that this will resonate with the desperate, exhausted and disillusioned Cuban people.\n\nThe crisis led Cuba and the US to convene a “technical meeting” in Havana between the Cuban Border Guard and the US Coast Guard to “increase bilateral cooperation” in combatting irregular migration, human and drug trafficking, as well as maritime search and rescue.\n\nThe official Cuban communiqué about the meeting said it was fruitful and conducted “in a respectful and professional atmosphere… Both delegations noted the usefulness of these meetings and the importance of increased cooperation in this area,” and agreed to hold more technical meetings in the future. In April, Cuba and the US resumed bilateral talks on migration issues, the first high-level discussions since US President Joe Biden was elected. The meetings had been suspended during the Trump administration, which reversed the Obama-initiated rapprochement between the two countries.\n\nImmigration has always been a key issue in the turbulent US-Cuba bilateral relationship. Over the last 60 years, several mass emigrations have ratcheted up tensions between the two nations. Cuba has used emigration as an escape valve during times of economic and political crisis, and also to pressure the US. But the magnitude of the current exodus is unprecedented, and led to historic anti-government protests on July 11, 2021. That date established a before-and-after point in time for Cuba, and the emigration numbers speak for themselves.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020 (year ending on September 30), 14,000 Cubans illegally entered the US across the Mexican border. In FY 2021, this number increased to 39,300. As of August 2022, almost 180,000 migrants have entered the US across its southern border. If the current pace continues, US officials say FY 2022 could close with a record 200,000 irregular Cuban migrants. The US Coast Guard data on Cuban rafters is equally alarming. The number of Cubans intercepted at sea bounced around for years (1,468 in 2017; 259 in 2018; 313 in 2019; 49 in 2020; and 838 in 2021), but in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, US officials picked up 5,421 Cubans at sea.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most severe migration crisis since the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959. The problems in Cuba that are driving the exodus are equally severe and difficult to solve. There seems no end in sight for the widespread exhaustion and desperation of the Cuban people caused by economic hardship, draconian energy blackouts, runaway inflation, medicine and basic necessity shortages, and deteriorating health care services. Many young people feel that leaving is their only option for a better life, a scenario that will surely mortgage the country’s future.\n\nThe Biden administration does not want more irregular Cuban emigrants, and has recently launched several initiatives to resurrect the family reunification program and restore the consular services that Trump dismantled. But Cuban officials say that these measures are inadequate and accuse Washington of accelerating the flow of illegal emigrants by failing to comply with the bilateral agreement stipulating the granting of 20,000 visas annually to Cuban citizens. Cuba also says that the US has not complied with the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows Cubans to obtain permanent residency a year and a day after entering the country, even if they entered illegally. Lastly, Cuba continues to blame US economic sanctions for all its problems. While both governments remain mired in long-running disputes, Cubans continue to suffer and the exodus intensifies.",
    "Better than Bulgaria but not as nice as Cuba: how did the US become such an awful place to live? | Arwa Mahdawi": "What do you call a country where nearly one in 10 adults have medical debts and a broken bone can boot you into bankruptcy? A country where a city of more than 160,000 residents recently had no safe drinking water for weeks? A country where life expectancy has dropped for the second year in a row and poor people sell their blood plasma in order to make ends meet? A country where the maternal mortality rate of black women in the capital is nearly twice as high as for women in Syria?\n\nYou call it one of the richest countries in the world.\n\nThe US is the second-wealthiest country in the world (recently overtaken by China) when you look at national balance sheets. It’s the largest economy in the world when you look at GDP. And it’s home to some of the richest people in the world. By all those measures of progress, the US is doing great. By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth. And, on this measure, the US comes just behind Cuba and just above Bulgaria. The US is “becoming a ‘developing country’,” one political historian said last week, based on this index.\n\nIf you’re reading this from the other side of the Atlantic, things aren’t much better. An analysis in the Financial Times last week found that “On present trends, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024, and the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade.” Essentially, the analysis concluded, income inequality in the US and UK is so enormous that the two nations should be classed as poor countries with some very rich people. Most of whom seem to be in the government.",
    "Cuba Is an Island in Mourning": "By Fabiana del Valle\n\nHAVANA TIMES – It’s 7:30 AM and I was walking down the streets in my town to get to the bank. I guessed the electricity would be back on soon after a long night with a blackout, or maybe the bank would have fuel for their generator to switch on the building and tend to the population’s needs.\n\nAfter so many fruitless trips, I was ready to wait as long as it would take. Despite my optimism, the silent streets were a bad omen. I sat on a wall in front of the bank, and I could see the sun turning the buildings orange from there.\n\nOther people arrived, asked who was last in line, and said:\n\n“I already asked the guard and he told me that they don’t have fuel for the building’s generator. They asked the government, but they were told there wasn’t any.”\n\n“What do you mean they don’t have any? If there isn’t any, how come they’re still driving everywhere?”\n\n“Let’s see if the electricity comes back on, I couldn’t sleep last night. This is the fourth time I’ve come, and I haven’t been able to get what I needed done.”\n\nIt’s 8 AM and we all gather outside the door. The manager comes out sorry and explains the situation to us. There wasn’t any electricity and fuel for the back up generator ran out yesterday. We already knew that. But it did surprise us that the bank had also been offline for three days. The problem had been reported to the provincial office and they still hadn’t had a response.\n\nI started walking home. We walked down the streets like demotivated zombies with their brains fried from thinking too much. What do I feed my children? When will the drugstore get the medicine I need? What do I do tonight when the electricity cuts out and my baby begins to cry?\n\nWe were born in a country in mourning. We walk over the scars of its silent avenues, every day at dawn. The daily routine that follows dark nights full of mosquitoes and sweat. Work days where bags under the eyes and sleep deprivation limit our efficiency, while hunger tugs at our insides and our pockets shrink.\n\nThis is my island, where there were believers willing to put their lives on the line in trenches for inconceivable causes. God bless those who managed to open their eyes! Others continue to give thanks [to those in power] while hardship engulfs everything around them.\n\nChildren experience bleak summers, without candy, toys, hope. They are taught doctrines at school, but this generation doesn’t believe, they have too many tears being held back, too many “I can’ts” from cash-strapped parents.\n\nYoung people leave in search of opportunities. Places where the future smells like hope. They carry the burden of fear in their backpacks and the pain of a farewell. Parents are separated from their children, wives from their husbands, friends.\n\nMothers cry in front of empty cooking pots. Fathers look into their helpless pockets. Grandparents reminisce about better times.\n\nWe are a people with withered eyes. There isn’t space for smiles in this landscape with leaks and putrid water, mosquitoes, heat, hunger.

    "EXCLUSIVE Cuba seeks more electricity supply from Turkish powerships": "Companies S-Energy Co Ltd Follow\n\nHAVANA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Cuba, mired in an energy crisis that has brought frequent blackouts, is negotiating with a Turkish company to have it double the megawatts it currently produces for the country from shipboard generators just offshore, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nCuban officials are in talks with Karpowership, one of the world’s largest operators of floating power plants and part of the Turkey-based Karadeniz Holding, the sources said. The company already has five ships operating off Cuba with a capacity of around 250 megawatts (MW).\n\nThe Communist-run country needs to generate more than 3,000 MW to meet minimum demand and currently is producing between 2,000 MW and 2,500 MW.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe Cuban National Electric Union did not respond to a request for comment. Karadeniz declined to comment.\n\nThe sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations, said the talks centered on how to ensure lease payments from Cuba.\n\n\"The (U.S. trade) embargo makes Western financial transactions very difficult and Cuba is cash short and behind on payments with many suppliers and joint venture partners,” one source said.\n\nExperts say the Turkish company would need to add to its fleet off Cuba to produce the required amount of energy. Powerships carry their own generator fueled by oil or gas, anchor close to land and connect to the local electricity grid. They are leased by the host country.\n\nThe deal, if it moves forward, would provide quick and much-needed relief for the embattled Cuban government as power outages have spread across the island and increased in length.\n\nCuba is desperate for more electricity.\n\nThe energy crisis, with blackouts in 4 to 6-hour-blocks twice daily or more in most of the country, is perhaps the most painful symptom of a deeper financial crisis caused by external factors such as U.S. sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic and poor economic management.\n\nCubans are also living through food, medicine and fuel shortages, forcing them to wait in long lines for the basics.\n\nThere have been scattered, small protests this summer and U.S. authorities registered a record of more than 175,000 Cubans at the U.S.-Mexican border since October, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency statistics.\n\nCuban power plants are obsolete, averaging 35 years of age, with a backup system of hundreds of smaller generators at least 15 years old. Just 5% of power comes from alternative energy sources.\n\nThe government blames lack of funds for its inability to update its decrepit grid, and says breakdowns, not fuel shortages, are the main cause of blackouts.\n\nEnergy and Mining Minister Livan Arronte Cruz said last week that the country hoped to all but eliminate blackouts by the end of the year, in part by adding “531 megawatts to generating capacity through new investments,” a figure reduced to 450 MW by President Miguel Diaz-Canel at the weekend.\n\nOmar Ramirez Mendoza, deputy director of the state electricity monopoly, said on state-run TV that “240 MW {of the 450 MW} will come from mobile generation,” a euphemism used by officials to refer to the powerships and coinciding with the source accounts.\n\nThe remainder of the new capacity would come from upgrading existing facilities with the help of foreign partners in the Moa nickel region in eastern Cuba and at the Mariel Special Development Zone just west of Havana, Ramirez said.\n\nJorge Pinon, Senior Research Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute specializing in the Latin American region, said he believed the powerships would provide the \"mobile generation\" referred to by Ramirez, but wondered how the extra capacity would be financed “as the Cubans do not have any money.”\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marc Frank, additional reporting by Can Sezer in Istanbul, Editing by Dave Sherwood and Alistair Bell\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Cuba Boosts Cigar Exports to Facilitate Recovery Amid Sanctions": "In the first 14 months of the Biden administration, the blockade has caused Cuba economic losses of around US$6.3 billion.\n\nCuba continues to promote cigar exports for economic recovery as the country braves the headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. trade embargo.\n\nSituated on the outskirts of the Cuban capital city of Havana, the El Laguito cigar factory is well known for producing Cohiba cigars over the past five decades.The factory, one of the five making cigars for exports in Havana, has some 250 workers, with 70 percent being women.\n\nAmong them is Nelsa Leonard, a 75-year-old roller, who started working at El Laguito in 1968. She expects Cuban cigar production to help the Caribbean nation's economy recover amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"These are the best cigars in the world and Cohiba is our top brand,\" she said. \"We are doing our best to sell as many Cuban cigars as possible to the world.\"\n\nOfficial data showed that in 2021, the Caribbean nation reported record sales of its hand-rolled cigars worth over US$507 million, as the tobacco industry is one of the four core sectors that contribute most to Cuba's GDP.\n\nOscar Rodriguez, director of El Laguito cigar factory, said that they are now making some 9,000 Cuban cigars a day.\n\n\"We continued to work despite the COVID-19 pandemic as this is a critical sector for the performance of the economy,\" he said. \"This factory is projected to deliver 2 million Cuban cigars by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe upcoming Cuban tobacco harvest is scheduled to start in October this year, said the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture.

    "A Minnesota tourist in Cuba – Southside Pride": "BY YOEL YOHANNES\n\nIn the sweltering hours of a late summer’s evening, airplanes touch down in Havana’s José Martí International Airport and pull into gates, full of tourists and expatriates returning to see family. Past passport security and baggage claim, cigarette-smoking airport employees direct recent arrivals into the currency exchange boxes and vendors hock bottles of warm beer and children’s juice pouches. José Martí International, a multi-terminal airport, is named after a Spanish-citizen Cuban-denizen poet and long-respected political prisoner and soldier of the third war for Cuban independence against Spain (1895-1898). As it turns out, this airport is the only port of entry for Americans. Some of the airlines that arrive at this particular airport include Southwest, American, Copa and JetBlue. Dispersed among Terminals 2 and 3, these airlines bring Americans from New York, Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Houston in to be asked, “Do you want your passport stamped?”\n\nSince the airport is located a half hour’s drive from central Havana, the only real option a U.S. citizen has is to travel by taxi.\n\nIt is possible to rent a car, but if you are using an American credit card to rent it, there is an almost 100% guarantee your account will be frozen. You cannot use American credit cards, debit cards or travelers’ cards in Cuba. The Cuban government will allow it, the U.S. government will not.\n\nOnce settling to opt for the taxi, always know that no matter who you are, you have the option to haggle for a price. Whatever the suggested price is, consider cutting it in half and adding maybe 200 pesos, or offering 60% of the requested payment. Most likely, the taxi driver will not even need a map. Tell them the address and the driver will reach the street and go down block by block. We would advise that you have downloaded the entire map of Cuba on Google Maps, as internet connections will be quite difficult to have most days on the island. On top of Google Maps, try to download the Google Translate Spanish translation dictionary onto your phone as well. You will be able to map out the cities you visit and translate any audio, video and written words offline. Very helpful.\n\nI had reserved our casa particular (a hostel that is personally owned, as opposed to a state-operated hotel) and paid in cash once we arrived. One of the worries as U.S. citizens is to be careful not to plan out or pay for anything related to the Cuban government or the military. The rule of thumb is if the place looks fancy, it’s government owned. Because of the American embargo imposed on Cuba, Americans cannot travel there as tourists. There are 12 possible reasons Americans are allowed to go to Havana. These specific reasons are listed on the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website. We chose the Journalistic Activity option.\n\nThe streets, especially San Rafael and O’Reilly, are filled with souvenir shops. Almost all of them are run by local owners who live either right above or next door. The owners are often the very same who run the shops and thus are the ones with whom you will haggle over prices. Many of the shops we visited were just down the road on Boulevard de San Rafael or de Obispo, and they offered almost exactly the same items, such as revolutionary-style green hats with Che’s image, wooden cars, magnets, shirts, cigar cases and other trinkets. In between many of these shops, restaurants and lounges, there are promoters that will try their best to move tourists into the shops and restaurants they are working for. They will neither hurt nor rob you, but the general deal is that if they bring you into a place to spend money, they are paid by the shop owner depending on how much you spend. In areas navigated by large groups of tourists, many of these promoters will be present. Often, they will approach apparent tourists and ask them where they are from, inform them of the nearby cigar festival (which is nonexistent and just a gimmick to promote interest, seriously, THERE ARE NO CIGAR FESTIVALS), and then let their listeners know they can exchange currencies. There isn’t really a problem with exchanging money, but just try for an exchange rate of at least 100 to 1, whether you have euros or U.S. dollars.\n\nBoth Obispo and San Rafael are dotted with cafeterias, restaurants, sandwich shops and other eateries. If you’re interested in a bevy of five-star food spots and Michelin-rated dining, Havana isn’t really for you. The city does have higher-end eateries, but we focused on where locals ate and drank for our food and drink.\n\nWalking down tourist-filled paths, we noticed that several sandwich shops and bakeries were operated directly from local residents’ home kitchens. Menus with pre-made juice blends, shots of instant espresso, and ham and cheese baguettes lined the streets in the mornings. Groups of people lined up to an entrepreneurial resident’s back door and shelled out a handful of pesos for egg sandwiches and lemonade. We followed suit and were treated to deliciously fresh beans and bread, mango juice and hot espressos, paying maybe two dollars total.\n\nSince Havana is home to a large harbor, christened the Port of La Habana, water surrounds you in the capital city. Having said that, Havana was also the most defended city in the New World; the Spanish built safeguards throughout the city before moving on to build around Florida’s St. Augustine. Along the coast of Havana, sights like the San Salvador Castle or the Malecon merge the ruggedness of stone and the fluidity of the water bordering it. However, seafood isn’t as apparent in the local diet as one would expect. We perhaps saw fish served at one nearby restaurant. Our photographer, Haileab, preferred the lobster served at this locality.\n\nEvenings were melodic and serene during our stay. We walked past closed services in Chinatown and saw quiet people-watchers setting their folding chairs in front of their apartments, cigars in hand. Open windows with metal bars gave snapshots into apartments where residents watched television and talked, some nodding their heads as we passed. Down Paseo de Martí, a hushed promenade between two streets leading towards the Bay of Havana, young locals practiced their skateboarding. Some would sit on the benches lining the walkway with their paramours and practice something else. Traffic was almost nonexistent, only two or three 60- or 70-year-old Buicks with newer parts shipped in from the east or a Moskvitch would pass every so often. Every few blocks, we would pass a small convenience store based out of an apartment selling Coral brand fruit-flavored water in small pouches. This isn’t to say that no one was out. The streets still had promoters and tourists milling about, but daylight hours bring hordes of tourists and businesspeople. Compared to this, the late-night crowds only congregate around bars still open, or smoking lounges that serve small snacks.\n\nWe made plans many years ago to visit Havana, not realizing that we would not be able to go as tourists. It is quite fortunate for us that we were able to go now. It became a repeated mantra during our time in Cuba to say, “Imagine we made it to Cuba,” and laugh. Our experience in this part of the world, hit not only by political upheaval but by a historically momentous embargo by such a near neighbor and fervent defender in the past, showed us again that people find ways to survive even in the toughest situations. We encourage readers to visit Havana under the Support for Cuban People allowance, a U.S. governmentally legal opportunity to see the neighborhoods and locally owned shops in cities like Trinidad, Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos and, of course, La Habana.",
    "How I became the matriarch of my Cuban family in New England": "My cousin gave me the news at my aunt’s funeral. Teresita and I were both teary-eyed, just a few feet from Tia Silvia’s coffin, in a room full of Spanish-speaking mourners cooing comfort to each other. Tere leaned toward me, pulling the syrupy scent of lilies with her, and whispered, “You are the matriarch now.”\n\nI must have looked as stunned as I felt, because she let out a giggle that made grey heads turn our way. There’s no giggling in Cuban velorios. We mourn Old World-style, reliably somber, visibly pained, clad in a black for weeks or months, depending on our proximity to the deceased. Yet here I was, complicit in breaking the cardinal rule of luto, or \"mourning\": no giggling.\n\nWas I even old enough to be a matriarca? The evidence had been piling up, and not just in my mirror and knees. I’d just read that 29% of roughly 30 million Latinas in the U.S. are 45 or older — vieja range. Like me, they’d probably been shocked by how fast things unraveled once their beloved viejas started dying. We’re the viejitas, now, the ones who’ll be wearing the matriarca’s shawl.\n\nThe author and four generations of her Cuban American family in Lexington in 2012. (Courtesy Ana Hebra Flaster)\n\nIt’s a magical garment, woven by resilient women who bridged two cultures and two countries, clung to old rituals, protected the mother tongue with a ferocity that often left us in tears. All that bridging and clinging was tricky for us because after fleeing the revolution, we’d settled in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1967. We didn’t have a Latino community to lean on. No \"Sabado Gigante,\" no Hola magazines, Mexican pharmacists, Puerto Rican grocers. Even today, New Hampshire has one of the lowest Latinx populations in the country, 23,000, the 10th lowest number of any state.\n\nSo Mami, Tia and Abuela created a Cuban community out of thin, cold air. My cousins and I ran between the two sides of our little yellow duplex on Hunt Street as primos hermanos, as we would have in Cuba, \"cousin-brothers\" who saw each other every day, and grew up fighting, making up, getting into trouble together.\n\nAbuela lived on our side of the duplex, but she showed up wherever we were scheming and put a stop to it. She was arthritic and slow, but somehow omnipresent and probably an espíritu, because she would materialize in front of us, a stealthy fantasma who made a killer ropa vieja.\n\nWe stuck out wherever we went. Our dark skin, the smell of garlic, onion and green pepper that infused our wool coats, accents that left the very white residents of our old mill town scratching their heads. We spoke loudly and all at once, traveled around town as a tumultuous, Spanish-speaking mini-mob that refused to stay hidden. The adults in the family were fine with all of that. They were different, Cuban, and proud — and we should be, too, ¡Coño!",
    "Socialism makes the difference: Cuba and China exceed U.S. in life expectancy": "Children born in socialist Cuba and China can expect to live longer than children born in the capitalist United States. | AP photos\n\nTo extend a population’s life expectancy at birth (LEB) requires capabilities that are scarce in the United States. The U.S. LEB has fallen in the recent period, quite abruptly. Meanwhile, life expectancy in China and Cuba continues its long-term rise. To understand why we should explore nations’ varying capabilities to achieve social change and promote social gains.\n\nMedical and sociological causes of death that relate to life expectancy and are specific to the United States will not be explored here. A subsequent report will cover that ground.\n\nThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics on Aug. 31 set U.S. LEB for 2021 at 76.1 years, the same figure as in 1996. The decline from 77.0 years in 2020 and from 78.8 in 2019 was the greatest continuous U.S. fall in LEB in 100 years. Life expectancy for men in 2021, 73.2 years, represented an unprecedented male-female gap of almost six years (increased male mortality is routine).\n\nLife expectancy for people in Cuba and for China now exceeds that for people born in the United States. Cuba’s LEB rose from 57.6 years in 1950 to 79 years in 2021—an advance of over 21 years. In those years, China’s LEB moved from 43 years to 78.2 years—a 35.2-year increase—and LEB for Americans rose by 7.9 years. The Cuban and Chinese achievements of drastically improving life expectancy in a few years and from very low levels are remarkable.\n\nPolicies put in place following the two countries’ socialist revolutions led to wide-ranging social initiatives that are protective of all people’s lives and, incidentally, crucial for long life expectancy. Capitalist governments, less oriented to social change, are prone to tolerating gaps in social development.\n\nThe two socialist countries pursued particular objectives to achieve social gains. Specifically, they have endeavored to establish working-class political power, promote decent and healthy lives for all working people, eradicate major economic inequalities, and build unity.\n\nSome capitalist countries have also attempted to fulfill a few of these objectives when under left-wing governance, with mixed success. A look at how well they may have succeeded, and at some of the consequences when they have not, may shed light on the failings of capitalist states to support the lives of their people, particularly the U.S.’ failure to sustain a LEB that in 2020 was already lower than that of 53 other countries.\n\nThe subject of providing social support is, of course, vast. On that account, the discussion here pays more attention to health care and less to other areas. It draws on the insights of Vicente Navarro, professor of public health and public policy at universities in Baltimore and Barcelona.\n\nAs regards working-class political power, Navarro maintains that “countries with strong labor movements, with social democratic and socialist parties…have developed stronger redistribution policies and inequality-reducing measures…. These worker-friendly countries consequently have better health indicators [including LEB] than those countries where labor movements are very weak, as is the case in the United States.”\n\nNavarro blames the lack of universal health care in the United States, unique among industrialized nations, on the lack there of a strong labor movement and/or a labor or socialist party. Political power exerted by the organized working class in industrialized nations may vary, but it almost always exceeds workers’ power in the United States, where statistical markers of health outcome are decidedly less favorable.\n\nThe political weakness of the organized workers’ movement in the United States is clear. “The working class,” Navarro writes in 2021, does not appear anywhere in the Cabinet nor the Senate, and only appears in the House with an extremely limited representation of 1.3 percent.” Most “members of these institutions belong to the corporate class, closely followed by upper-middle class.” He condemns the “privatization of the electoral process,” in which “there is no limit to how much money can go to the Democratic or Republican party or their candidates.”\n\nDecent and healthy lives are far from routine in capitalist countries, where poor health is associated with low social-economic status. Navarro reports that, in the United States, the “blue-collar worker has a mortality rate from heart conditions double that of the professional class. Mortality differentials by social class are much larger in the United States than in Western Europe.”\n\nHe notes that “top level British civil servants live considerably longer than do lower level ones,” and that “members of the [Spanish] bourgeoisie…live an average of two years longer than the petit bourgeoisie…who live two years longer than the middle class, who live two years longer than the skilled working class, who live two years longer than members of the unskilled working class, who live two years longer than the unskilled [and unemployed] working class.”\n\nAlienation under capitalism exacerbates health problems. According to Navarro, “the distance among social groups and individuals and the lack of social cohesion that this distance creates is bad for people’s health and quality of life.” The social isolation he describes adds to challenges faced by social support systems and detracts from the usefulness of interventions.\n\nAttempts by capitalist countries to remove wealth inequalities, especially in the health care arena, show mixed success. As commercialization of healthcare advances, difficulties mount. As the result of profit-taking in that sector, society-wide inequalities are aggravated, and working people lose equal access to quality care.\n\nAnd yet some form of public overview of, or support for, health care sectors is more or less routine in the various capitalist countries. In many, public authorities operate and pay for hospitals, nursing homes, staffing, drugs, equipment, and training. But the infiltration of market prerogatives and privatization in the health care systems of richer countries now threatens long established goals of accessible health care for all.\n\nIn Europe, austerity campaigns under neoliberal auspices have led to cutbacks in publicly provided care. Privatization inroads blunted the institutional response in Europe to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investor groups have been eyeing the hospital and nursing home sectors as profit-making opportunities. According to the Lancet medical journal, privatization within the British National Health Service contributed to an increase in preventable deaths from all causes between 2013 and 2020.\n\nThe United States is the poster child of war in defense of privilege. There are stories, from health care:\n\nIn 2020 salary and benefits for William J. Caron, Jr., CEO of MaineHealth, a major care provider in the author’s locality, were $1,992,044; for Richard W. Petersen, Maine Medical Center CEO, they were $1,822,185. A commentator notes that “Hospital CEOs are compensated primarily for the volume of patients that pass through their doors—so-called “heads in beds.” Average annual income for U.S. primary care physicians was $260,000 in 2021; for specialists, $368,000.\n\nAccording to bain.com, “Medtech companies are among the most profitable in the healthcare industry, with margins averaging 22%…profit pools [will] grow to $72 billion in 2024.” And “HME (home medical equipment) retail companies average 45 percent gross profit margin (GPM).”\n\nResearchers found that between 2000 and 2018, the “median annual gross profit margin” (gross profit is revenue minus costs) of 35 pharmaceutical companies was 39.1% higher than that of 357 non-pharmaceutical companies. The CEOs of three major pharmaceutical companies” increased their wealth by “a total of $90 million” in 2018. As for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers: “Moderna’s and BioNTech’s 2021 net profit margins reached 66% and 54%, respectively.”\n\nThe matter of creating unity to establish socialism and arrange for the common good needs little comment. Unity within society is a near impossibility under capitalism, inasmuch as divisions there are inherent to a world of greed and individualism. Meanwhile, China, opting in favor of life, put on a magnificent display of socialist unity as its people grappled with the pandemic.\n\nThe government imposed strong preventative measures and accepted the inevitability of economic disruption and loss. China’s COVID-19 mortality rate is 1.07 deaths per 100,000 persons. Its U.S. counterpart never seemed to choose and, that way protected economic growth. The U.S. COVID-19 mortality rate is 319.59 deaths per 100,000 persons.\n\nIt is important, finally, to lay to rest any suggestion that the riches of the United States and other capitalist nations automatically enable them to offer long life expectancies. Individualized entitlement to wealth is basic to how they operate, and that’s a contradiction and an obstacle.\n\nA society aiming to pursue social initiatives that are comprehensive and directed to all population groups equally is a society that has to redistribute wealth. Wealth redistribution is the necessary adjunct to the objectives already discussed. The message here is that capitalist-inspired measures don’t make the grade and that socialist programs, as in Cuba and China, do work and do offer the promise of decent and secure lives to entire populations.\n\nAs with all op-eds published by People’s World, this article reflects the opinions of its author.",
    "In Cuba, Where There’s Fire, There’s Anti-Government Propaganda (OPINION)": "HOUSTON — In the months since an explosion at the Saratoga Hotel in Havana killed 47 people, and weeks after 14 firefighters died fighting the oil fire at the port in Matanzas, recent fires at state-owned and military facilities are leading people on social media to draw various conclusions.\n\nMany have been discussing whether the U.S. government or Cuban exiles in the United States are responsible for stoking discontent amid near-constant power outages on the island. A quick browse through Twitter and Facebook confirms that despite the lack of evidence, many Cuban Americans are suggesting the fires are related to an uprising against the government—as Americans tend to do whenever anything damaging to the Cuban state occurs.\n\nThe propaganda that comes out of the United States relating to Cuba (and Latin America) is as strong as that of the Cuban government. Besides conservative Cubans employing xenophobia towards the mostly Afro-Cubans coming to the United States, they are also promoting the destabilization of the country and forcing it into deeper turmoil.\n\nCuba says US is acting immorally by keeping it on blacklist https://t.co/eVDqytoMEb pic.twitter.com/E3lYwC10MT — The Hill (@thehill) September 8, 2022\n\nThere is no question that Cuban-American views vary greatly, just as they do within other voting blocs. Humanitarian-minded Cubans typically lend their voice to ending the embargo against the island and opening up a relationship with the Cuban government similar to the U.S. alliance with Vietnam and other communist nations. The fact that the United States openly works with other countries around the world with similar government and not its own neighbors isn’t lost on anyone.\n\nAs pro-government Cubans continue to suggest the CIA is behind the fires—not an uncommon theory—anti-government Cubans suggest a very unlikely revolt is on the horizon. Still, there is little question that government actors, such as the U.S. Department of State, are spreading disinformation about Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and their comrade nations.\n\nLatin Americans and their descendants are aware of how the U.S. government frames things in the hemisphere. Whether there is a Democrat or Republican sitting in the White House, the policy of influencing what happens in the region is akin to a standing order. The U.S. isn’t going to simply back down after interfering with nearly every country south of the border for over a century. In the U.S., corporate interests sit above all else.\n\nFor that reason, the U.S.’ deployment of purposeful misinformation should not come as a surprise.\n\nFires Seemingly Everywhere\n\nIn August alone, several state-owned restaurants were among several facilities that caught fire and suffered extensive damage. But the more prominent incidents that have people talking are the fires that occurred on military bases. While the fires took place at the recreational facilities on the grounds, many Cubans have drawn a parallel to how the Cuban Revolution started.\n\nIn July 1953, Fidel and Raúl Castro, accompanied by 70 fighters, began a multi-pronged attack on military installations across the island. The initial attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago, Cuba was a failure, landing the brothers in prison. Two years later, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista was pressured into releasing all political prisoners on the island, including Fidel and Raúl, who fled to Mexico where they joined other exiles and began planning the overthrow of Cuba’s government.\n\nBy 1955, student protests and riots were commonplace on the island. The Batista regime dealt with the uprising through repression and labeled the young people as revolutionaries. In April 1956, another group launched raids against army barracks using Castro’s attack as a blueprint to start a revolution.\n\nThen, in November 1956, the Castro brothers, accompanied by Ernesto “Che” Guevara and others, landed in Playa Las Coloradas and made their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains. These events led to many attempted uprisings, U.S. involvement in protecting Batista’s regime (supplying weapons and air support), and a Cuban military offensive in the mountains against the rebels that ended with the defeat of Batista’s army.\n\nFor Cuban Americans who have fled the island, they see the Saratoga Hotel explosion, the fire at the oil facility in Matanzas, and other recent fires as hopeful signs that another uprising similar to the Revolution is imminent. The reality is that most Cubans still support the government and its openness to adopting more progressive economic and social policies.\n\nAs is the case in the United States, the loudest among them represents a minority of the population. They argue that they are somehow being oppressed while simultaneously promoting repressive policy ideas on the island.\n\nFor many Cuban Americans, similar double standards exist as well. Much of their opposition to the new family code in Cuba, which grants equal rights to gay and trans people, is based on the same fear-mongering in the United States.\n\nSpending just a short amount of time watching Spanish-language news, whether in the U.S. or in any Latin American country, explains why such misinformation is spreading so fast. Much like Americans in the U.S. who are being convinced that they are losing their rights to the LGBTQ+ community, for example, Latinos are similarly being targeted by propaganda through Spanish-language media.\n\nThe difference is that Spanish-language content remains largely unchallenged.\n\nNo Uprising Anytime Soon\n\nWhile Cuban Americans remain hopeful, unfortunately for them, there won’t be any uprisings against the Cuban government anytime soon. Protests are happening nearly every day in various communities experiencing blackouts, but correlation isn’t causation. The Cuban government has addressed only one fire that they suspect was set intentionally by Cubans who are angry about the electricity issues on the island. The rest have been proven to be unintentional.\n\nAnti-government writers and influencers never talk about efforts the Cuban government is making to supplement the power grid, open up its economy to foreign business, and subsidize the private sector. Cuba imported several Turkish power plants on barges and is looking to install many more to address current electricity issues. All of these policies have created tangible benefits for Cubans.\n\nFew in U.S. media will report on any of these things. Most journalists take what the State Department says without challenging its statements, typically reporting on the information provided by the government and nothing else. Government claims are taken at face value and reported as fact.\n\nCuba is negotiating with Turkey's @KarpowershipSA to lease more powerships to boost electricity output amid frequent blackouts nationwide, per Reuters. US sanctions have slashed Cuba's revenues, complicating its ability to pay on time & use Western banks. https://t.co/7lVU39kH8t pic.twitter.com/UFv4lGIGOK — Belly of the Beast (@bellybeastcuba) September 8, 2022\n\nNot questioning such narratives is dangerous for people living abroad who have been targeted by the military-industrial complex and U.S. corporate interests (see: Iraq and Afghanistan). Wall Street has always influenced U.S. foreign policy. Months after a coup in Bolivia removed socialist leader Evo Morales in November 2019, to the benefit of electric car manufacturers who wanted access to the country’s lithium deposits, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted: “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.”\n\nMusk said the quiet part out loud.\n\nWhile Latin America and the Caribbean continue to stand by Cuba in its times of need, the United States unflinchingly denies the Cuban people any assistance regardless of how dire their plight may be. Cubans on the island acknowledge and recognize this as more repressive than anything the Cuban government does.\n\nThe richest nation in the world also has the most power and influence. This plus its blatant disregard for human life at home and abroad leaves the vast majority of Cubans with a deep resentment toward the United States. If U.S. citizens think Cubans will go to war with each other at the behest of those that fled the island—or even at the command of the U.S. government—they should adopt a new strategy and expectations.\n\nAs Spanish-language U.S.-based propaganda continues to spread unabated online, debunking it and countering the messaging has never been as important as it is today—for Cubans, even more so.\n\n***\n\nArturo Domínquez is a first-generation Cuban American, anti-racist, journalist, and the publisher of The Antagonist magazine.

    "US Migration from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua Soars in August": "The number of Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans taken into custody at the U.S. border with Mexico soared in August as migrants from Mexico and traditional sending countries were stopped less frequently, authorities said Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities stopped migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua about 56,000 times last month, up from 49,826 times in July and 23,141 times in August 2021, according to administration officials. At the same time, fewer migrants were stopped from Mexico and the Central American “Northern Triangle” countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for a third straight month.\n\nOverall, migrants were stopped about 203,000 times. They were stopped 199,976 times on the U.S. border with Mexico in July and 213,593 times in August 2021.\n\nThe growing numbers from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, are the latest sign of rapidly changing migration flows as U.S. authorities wrestle with unusually large influxes.\n\nWhile no single reason can be pinpointed, it is extremely challenging for the U.S. to expel migrants from those countries under a pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, which U.S. officials invoke to deny a chance at seeking asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. U.S. relations with all three countries are deeply strained, making it difficult to impossible to send them home.\n\nMexico agrees to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 if they are from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador, in addition to Mexico. While the rule applies to all nationalities in theory, people from those four countries are most affected.\n\nThe Biden administration has leaned on other countries in the Americas to absorb more people fleeing their homes, including Mexico, Costa Rica, which is home to many Nicaraguans, and Colombia, which has taken in millions of Venezuelans in recent years.\n\nVenezuelan migration plummeted early this year after Mexico introduced restrictions on air travel but has increased in recent months as more come over land through the notoriously dangerous Darien Gap in Panama.\n\nIn July, Venezuelans were stopped 17,651 times on the U.S. border with Mexico, most of them in and around Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas.\n\nReminders of their presence are in daily headlines. The roughly 50 migrants that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flew to the upscale Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard were all Venezuelan, as were five of the six bodies that U.S. authorities found drowned to death in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass on Labor Day weekend. The sixth was from Nicaragua.",
    "Cuba solidarity group in Puerto Rico hits FBI harassment, defends rights – The Militant": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — In response to FBI harassment of participants in a solidarity brigade to Cuba a few weeks after they returned to Puerto Rico, the Cuba Solidarity Committee of Puerto Rico has called for a protest at the Federal Building here Sept. 17 at 11 a.m. The action also calls for an end to the U.S. blockade of Cuba.\n\nThis operation by Washington’s political police is an assault on the rights of all those on the island and beyond.\n\nFrom Aug. 23 to 26, FBI agents visited or called nearly 60 people across this U.S. colony who joined the July Juan Rius Rivera Solidarity Brigade to Cuba or work with the committee. Some agents claimed to be investigating “criminal activity,” the breaking of an unnamed “federal law” or Cuban security “infiltration.” Two pro-Cuba activists in the U.S. were also called by the FBI asking about the Puerto Rican brigade.\n\nThe FBI harassment is “a clear signal that our activism has had a positive effect,” noted a Sept. 8 solidarity committee statement.\n\nAs soon as Milagros Rivera, president of the Cuba Solidarity Committee, learned what the FBI was doing, she sent out an alert, reminding everyone that there is no reason, legal or otherwise, to answer any questions from the FBI.\n\n“The FBI is an instrument to perpetuate colonialism in our country,” Rivera said. “They are trying to intimidate and frighten us and to criminalize our solidarity with Cuba.”\n\nWashington seized Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, and placed troops in Cuba, after it defeated the Spanish rulers in its first imperialist war in 1898. U.S. control over Puerto Rico was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that “insular laws” passed by Congress meant constitutional protections that are not “fundamental” don’t apply here, because it is a U.S. colony. Puerto Rico has its own Constitution including a watered-down Bill of Rights, which does include freedom of speech, press and assembly.\n\nWhen WAPA-TV News called the San Juan office of the FBI about the visits, an FBI spokesperson refused to comment, claiming that the FBI only investigates “violations of federal law” and does not target people because of their politics or beliefs.\n\nBut that’s a bald-faced lie.\n\nThe FBI has a long history of going after trade unionists, working-class political parties, Black rights activists and opponents of U.S. government policy in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\n\nFBI agents were sent here in 1936 after a local U.S. attorney complained to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover that Nationalist Party leader Pedro Albizu Campos was publishing “articles insulting the United States” and giving “public speeches in favor of independence.”\n\nIn 1937 Albizu and other Nationalists were railroaded to prison on charges of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government, despite no evidence that they had committed a single illegal act.\n\nWhen the U.S. rulers entered World War II, Washington offered Albizu and other Nationalists their freedom if they would agree to suspend all pro-independence activity during the war. They refused.\n\nImpact of the Cuban Revolution\n\nIn the 1960s the U.S. government launched Cointelpro — Counter Intelligence Programs — that targeted the political activities of millions of people in the U.S., including the Socialist Workers Party. Its 37 disruption operations in Puerto Rico were among the largest FBI Cointelpro campaigns.\n\nWorking people in Puerto Rico were deeply impacted by the 1959 overthrow of the U.S.-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba. As several activists in the movement told the Militant during a Sept. 4-6 reporting trip, the victory of the Cuban revolutionary movement, led by Fidel Castro, showed that it is possible to win real independence and to make a socialist revolution.\n\nWashington and the FBI gave the green light to counterrevolutionary Cuban groups in Puerto Rico to go after supporters of the revolution here.\n\nOne case is the 1979 assassination in San Juan of Cuban-born Carlos Muñiz Varela, a founder of the magazine Areíto and of the Antonio Maceo Brigade. The brigade was formed by young Cubans in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who fought for normalization of relations between Washington and Havana.\n\nRaúl Alzaga, a former collaborator of Muñiz, is one of those the FBI called at the end of August. As a result of the efforts of Alzaga and others over decades, thousands of pages of FBI documents have been released that prove the agency had infiltrated the Cuban counterrevolutionary groups and — at the very least — knew who the assassins were and who paid them. But no one has ever been prosecuted for the killing.\n\nWhen the FBI called this time, Alzaga thought they were calling to let him know that more of the documents he has been seeking for decades were being released. “But then they said no, they wanted to ask me questions about Milagros Rivera,” he told the Militant. “So I told them, I had nothing to say.”\n\nFighting corruption?\n\nTo bolster its claim of being “nonpolitical,” the FBI’s Puerto Rico website highlights its investigations of “corruption” in the government and the union movement. This includes the arrest of a number of officials, including former Gov. Wanda Vásquez, as well as officers of the dockworkers union.\n\n“This isn’t the first time that the FBI has intervened in the unions,” José Rodríguez, a representative of the Movimiento Solidario Sindical, told the Militant. In 2004, some 60 FBI and IRS agents raided the headquarters of the Independent Authentic Union in the middle of a strike against the government-run Water and Sewer Authority in an attempt to weaken the union. The FBI claimed they were investigating fraud in the union-run health care fund. Several union officials were framed up and imprisoned, one of whom was only released last year.\n\nThe FBI uses corruption cases like this both to go after the labor movement and to make it look as if they are defending working people, Rodríguez said. “It’s important to educate working people about the real history of the FBI.”\n\nJosé Escoda, a member of the Socialist Front who works with the Cuba Solidarity Committee, made a similar point. “The FBI has created an aura that they are eliminating corrupt officials. The purpose is to show who’s really the boss here,” he said.\n\nEscoda was one of those the FBI has approached about the Cuba brigade. “Some people think they can ‘explain’ things to the FBI, but if you talk to them, they will win,” Escoda said. “I didn’t even give them a chance to mention Cuba or the brigade. I didn’t let them ask me a single question.”\n\nThe Cuba Solidarity Committee is asking for messages of protest against the FBI’s harassment from opponents of the U.S. embargo of Cuba, trade unions, defenders of civil liberties and others.

    "How Cuba treated me for COVID – Liberation News": "Photo: Cuban healthcare workers in Villa Clara\n\nIn late July, I traveled to Cuba as part of a delegation of anti-blockade activists delivering medicine. Three days into my trip, I tested positive for COVID-19. During my seven days in quarantine, I experienced Cuba’s deeply compassionate health care system and thorough COVID-19 protocol firsthand.\n\nI got my positive test results while staying in Villa Clara, a province about three hours from Havana. In the United States, COVID patients have to seek out tests on their own, deal with expensive insurance and bills, and find their own transportation to health care facilities. In Cuba, within a few hours of taking a positive rapid test, I was visited by a doctor who gave me a PCR test, checked my symptoms, and completed a detailed account of my whereabouts since my arrival for contract-tracing purposes.\n\nFree, quality health care is guaranteed to all Cuban citizens and even foreigners like myself. In the United States by contrast, seeing a doctor is costly and tests are difficult to access. In New Orleans where I live, PCR tests are almost exclusively available at drive-through pharmacies. After being exposed to COVID-19 in the United States this past February, I walked for 30 minutes to my nearest drive-through PCR test and was refused a test because I was on foot.\n\nFor the next five days after testing positive, I was visited daily by doctors who checked my vitals, asked me questions about symptoms, and asked if there was anything I needed. My case was mild, but for someone dealing with more serious COVID symptoms or complications, this thorough and persistent care could make the difference between life and death. In fact, Cuba’s mortality rate rate for positive COVID cases is 0.77%, significantly lower than the 1.1% in the United States – that means that someone who contracts COVID in the United States is about 40 percent more likely to die than someone who gets the disease in Cuba.\n\nDespite my patchy Spanish, doctors, nurses and workers at the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples, or ICAP, did everything they could to communicate effectively with me. Despite all the difficulties the country is experiencing because of the U.S. blockade, I was provided with three delicious, home-cooked meals per day in addition to tea and bottled water. Several friendly workers at ICAP visited me every day at a distance and with PPE. I was scared to spend isolation in an unfamiliar place, but they consistently made up the best parts of my day.\n\nQuality medical care did not prevent me from feeling isolated and anxious, but everyone providing me with care took my mental health into consideration as well, and did everything they could to cheer me up. One morning when I was feeling down, the ICAP workers invited me to sit at a distance outside with them and chat and have coffee. They took turns sharing stories of their experiences with COVID and told me about their lives, and soon enough my anxiety was replaced by the warm, cheerful feeling of community.\n\nSocialist healthcare saves lives\n\nCuba’s socialist health care system is able to protect its citizens more effectively than U.S. capitalism’s for-profit counterpart in many areas, leading to lower infant mortality and higher overall life expectancy. Since the 1959 revolution, Cuba has made major strides in improving its population’s wellbeing through massive state investments in health care and biomedical research. While in the United States, over 31 million do not have health care and 1 in 10 adults face medical debt, in Cuba health care is a guaranteed human right. Cuba maintains the world’s highest ratio of doctors to population, and sends doctors around the world to other countries in need. Health care in the United States is run by medical corporations and insurance companies that charge exorbitant prices in the pursuit of profit, but Cuba’s socialized health care is administered by the government with the goal of promoting public health.\n\nCuba has a community-based, three-tiered health care model that cultivates trust between citizens and providers, while on-the-ground presence in neighborhoods allows prevention and early detection of illnesses. Primary care is administered by family doctors, who keep track of the population through preventative care and basic services in a neighborhood where they themselves live. Every resident of each neighborhood is visited at home by their doctor at no cost to them. Family doctors may refer patients with more serious illnesses to hospitals managed at the provincial level or to nationally-managed specialized hospitals.\n\nThese achievements were accomplished in spite of the suffocating blockade the U.S. government has imposed on Cuba for over 60 years. Not only are entities in the United States prohibited from trading with Cuba, any business anywhere in the world that does business with Cuba is banned from the U.S. economy — with only extremely limited exceptions. The weight of the U.S. market — over 200 times as large as Cuba’s — as well as Wall Street’s stranglehold over the vast majority of financial transactions in the world, are leveraged together in a cruel effort to cause unbearable hardships for the entire Cuban population.\n\nThe blockade applies to many kinds of medicine too, and the U.S. government refused even a temporary reprieve for the duration of the pandemic. When the virus first hit, Cuba had immense difficulty even getting oxygen to treat COVID patients. This cruel policy must end.\n\nCuba’s battle against the pandemic\n\nSince the Cuban economy and health care system are centrally planned, the government was able to quickly mobilize resources to serve people’s needs during the pandemic, even while struggling to access tests and personal protective equipment. In the United States, the government is at the mercy of corporate profits, and policy measures focused on getting people back to work rather than keeping them healthy. As a consequence, the United States suffered by far the highest death toll in the world.\n\nIn early 2020, Cuba staged a society-wide mobilization against the pandemic — training medical staff, preparing quarantine facilities, and informing its public about symptoms and precautions. When the first cases were confirmed in early March 2020, the government mobilized medical students to check for symptoms at each individual house in the country, and testing and contact-tracing programs took effect immediately.\n\nBy March 20, 2020, the government had mandated physical distancing, guaranteed full wages for quarantining workers for the first month of isolation and 60% wages for the duration of pandemic, halted tourism, and expanded food distribution to the most vulnerable neighborhoods in particular. Local neighborhood Committees for the Defense of the Revolution carried out public services like delivering supplies and cleaning and cooking in quarantine centers.\n\nCommunity-based initiatives like these and a humane policy that took into account the hardships faced by workers facilitated trust. When Cuba launched its own domestically-developed COVID vaccine in July 2021 — a monumental biomedical achievement necessitated by the U.S. blockade — most of the population took the vaccine without hesitation. 90.1% of the Cuban population is fully vaccinated, compared to just 68% in the United States.\n\nLack of transparency from the U.S. government, hyper-individualistic attitudes created by the ideology of a capitalist society, and hysteria fueled by corporate media contribute to anti-vaccine attitudes in the United States. In contrast, Cuba’s socialist system cultivates a culture of collectivity and social responsibility to one another. Despite the mask mandate being lifted a few months ago, many Cubans continue to wear masks both indoors and outdoors, which is a testament to their willingness to make small sacrifices for collective health.\n\nAfter seven days in quarantine, I took a negative PCR test and stopped isolating. Thanks to my diligent quarantining and the diligent safety measures in Cuba, no one I was traveling or staying with got COVID from me. I am thankful to everyone who helped take care of me for keeping me healthy and showing me what socialist health care looks like. As someone who lives in the United States and is used to hasty, impersonal doctor’s visits and expensive medical bills, it could not have been more different to receive such quality, attentive health care in Cuba.\n\nCuba’s tireless commitment to serving its population — and even visitors like me! — is especially impressive given the inhumane blockade imposed by the United States, which prevents access to essential medical supplies and inflicts intense economic hardship on the Cuban people. Efforts like the Hatuey Project — the group I was with delivering over-the-counter medicines — have drawn attention to this particularly cruel component of the economic war being waged on Cuba. The Biden administration must end the suffocating blockade so that Cuba can make even greater strides in serving its people."
