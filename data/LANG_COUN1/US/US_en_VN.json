    "Vietnam is the unlikely winner of deglobalization": "Credit: Vlyaks Shutterstock\n\nVietnam has come in under the deglobalization radar. A lot of commentary in recent months has focused on deglobalization. Namely, where it will hit the hardest and whether China can survive massive divestment. However, little attention has been paid to the winners of this fallout.\n\nChina has become a less attractive option\n\nChina has been, arguably, the world’s biggest winner of globalization over recent decades. Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China’s GDP has increased over eleven times, rising from the sixth largest economy in the world to second place, and rapidly closing in on the US.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tides have since turned. Both within China and beyond. Via its dual circulation policy, China is investing significantly in advanced technology to ensure that is no longer reliant on key foreign technology. This is most evident in semiconductors. This trend is unsurprising, given that companies are becoming more aware of the risks involved with investing in China—most notably, around its zero-Covid policy. As the cost of labour and land continues to rise, investing in China does not make economic sense for many multinational companies. Several of those staying in China is also mulling a ‘China Plus One’ policy to make sure they hedge their bets. As such, many are considering regional alternatives.\n\nVietnam is well placed to thrive\n\nEnter Vietnam. Several factors explain the country’s perfect position. Geographically, Vietnam sits just south of China, and its access to the South China Seas via large seaports means that products can be exported quickly. Much of the value-added is still made elsewhere, notably in China, where technology and access to a higher-skilled workforce are more abundant. However, Vietnam has positioned itself as a perfect place for final-stage assembly of tech products. Final-stage assembly does not require access to a very highly skilled workforce, and companies can make use of Vietnam’s cheaper costs of labor and land (compared to its neighbors). Thailand and China have seen consistently high levels of investment in manufacturing, leading to higher prices for land to build factories but also rising wages, making them less competitive than their Vietnamese neighbors.\n\nVietnam’s demography is also a key factor. With 98 million people, Vietnam is the fifteenth largest nation in the world by population and a large proportion of its population is of working age. Compared to China, Vietnam is a young country, and this is one of the reasons why it was able to justify ending its zero-COVID strategy last autumn.\n\nSome big players have already invested in the country\n\nSamsung is a key company that has bet heavily on Vietnam. This year, it has invested $920 million into its factories in Vietnam. But it is not just Samsung. Apple and Foxconn have also increased their investments in the country.\n\nWhen it comes to deglobalization, one of the most examined industries is the semiconductor industry. As China seeks self-sufficiency and semiconductor firms manage geopolitical risks, opportunities are opening up. Notably, Samsung has announced that it will begin making chips in Vietnam in July 2023, and US chipmaker Synopsys has shifted investment to the country.\n\nThese factors point toward a bright future for Vietnam, a nation historically known for its steadfastness in the face of malign foreign influence, be that from China, France, or the US. Vietnam now faces a much more benign form of foreign influence, through the means of FDI.",
    "‘The Greatest Beer Run Ever’ Review: Vietnam on the Rocks": "In the early winter of 1968, the 26-year-old civilian Chickie Donohue arrived in Vietnam with a duffel bag of brewskis and an errand that could be reasonably called idiotic, patronizing, suicidal — and, even, as this shaggily appealing comedy insists, “The Greatest Beer Run Ever.” Donohue (Zac Efron) has been double dog dared by his drinking buddies back home in Inwood, then a working-class Irish neighborhood in Manhattan, to hand-deliver a beer to four of their buddies serving in the war. “A sudsy thank you card!” Donohue exclaims, delighted by his own moxie. His farcical mission is mostly true and just the sort of crowd-pleaser about lunkhead enlightenment that intoxicates the director Peter Farrelly in the wake of his Oscar for “Green Book.”\n\nFarrelly and his co-writers, Brian Currie and Pete Jones, see the national id reflected in Donohue’s patriotic, ill-reasoned rationale for his quest, which is clearly a few cans short of a, you know. To this layabout slacker, his blustering pals and their jingoistic barkeep, the Colonel (Bill Murray, near-invisible under a gruff flattop), a pull-tab of domestic ale supports the troops by reminding the fighters abroad that America reigns supreme. For a while, Farrelly feigns to agree; the film starts like a Super Bowl commercial and ends like a hangover.",

    "Lubbock remembering those who served in Vietnam at memorial traveling wall": "LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Since 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has been a simple, somber reminder of those who died in conflict.\n\nThere, comrades and civilians can search for names of their fallen brethren, and place their hands on the granite reflection. They can also trace their names on a small piece of paper, which is made available there at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis week in Lubbock, people do not have to travel so far to look for the names. The American Veterans Traveling Tribute has placed a replica of the wall, 80 percent scale, at the north end of Texas Tech’s Memorial Circle, where people can stop and see the names. This project has also been sponsored by the South Plains Honor Flight, which is an all-expense-paid trip for South Plains veterans to visit memorials and museums at our nation’s capitol.\n\nThe wall will remain in Lubbock through Sunday evening.\n\nVeterans and volunteers assembled on Wednesday morning to help with the setup.\n\n“Everybody wrote the same check, these guys cashed theirs,” said Rick Hadley, who served stateside during the Vietnam War. “We fought this war to keep communism where it was at, at that time, to keep it from coming over here. If we stop it there, we won’t have to stop it here.”\n\nVietnam veteran Lee Sandlin, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1971-74, was also there to help with the setup.\n\n“Well, if you look at all the names, that’s all the people, and they’re here,” he said, while holding off tears.\n\nU.S. Army veteran Jose Salinas, who served from 1989-99, was injured in Bosnia during the 1990s. His family fought in Vietnam, and he was on Tech’s campus Wednesday in their honor. He says the struggles of the Vietnam Conflict laid the foundation for how the United States would conduct wars and battles years later.\n\n“These men and women here and all that served during that time, didn’t get actually anything,” he said. “A lot of the things that they did, then shaped the way we do warfare now... with less body count.”\n\nAt Wednesday afternoon’s ceremony, Ron Milam, Associate Professor and Executive Director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict (IPAC), says the public’s perception of the Wall in Washington played a vital role in healing for the veterans.\n\n“For those of us old enough to remember, the Vietnam War was not a popular war; it made the very idea of a memorial almost impossible.”\n\nThe original memorial, which sits at the northwest corner of the National Mall, was approved by Democratic president Jimmy Carter, and years later by Republican president Ronald Reagan. The only goal was for all of the names to be listed.\n\n“In 1980, there was not yet any healing,” Milam says. “I saw the wall as the only memorial in Washington, D.C. that could not be seen from your car as you drive by and as hiding rather than proudly displaying our service. I was reluctant to see the wall, but I did so, and I was blown away, and as I looked at all of the other people staring at those names, some crying, I thought how wrong I had been not to appreciate the beauty of this place that honors those who had fallen in the most personal way, with their names etched in granite, along with all of the others who did what their country asked them to do.”\n\nWednesday afternoon, wreaths were placed by representatives who served in Vietnam, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock County Sheriff’s Office, DPS, and Texas Tech University. Fallen soldiers from other wars are also recognized on the west end of Memorial Circle.\n\nThe AVTT has a donation box there on site where people can donate. The 2023 South Plains Honor Flight is also accepting donations, which can be made on their Web site www.texassouthplainshonorflight.org.\n\nCopyright 2022 KCBD. All rights reserved.",

A Thai spokesperson said then that the objective of raising prices jointly was to increase their leverage in the global market and boost farmers' incomes.\n\nThailand and Vietnam account for about 10% of global production of rough rice and about 26% of global exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThai exporters have said a price cartel would be unfeasible and would make Thailand and Vietnam uncompetitive.\n\nThe Vietnam Food Association said late last month the country's rice exports are expected to rise to 6.3 million-6.5 million tonnes this year from 6.24 million tonnes last year on strong demand.

    "DAR to rededicate Bears Mill Vietnam Memorial": "GREENVILLE—Fort GreeneVille Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, a 50th Anniversary Vietnam War Commemoration Commemorative Partner, will be holding a rededication ceremony at the Bears Mill Vietnam Memorial with a bronze plaque at the site. The unveiling of the new bronze plaque will be on Friday, September 30, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. The Bears Mill Vietnam Memorial is located next to historical Bears Mill on Arcanum Bears Mill Road, Greenville.\n\nPresenting the colors will be the Versailles VFW/American Legion Color Guard Unit. The Vietnam Memorial at Bears Mill was created by Terry Clark, a Vietnam Veteran, and other local Vietnam Veterans including Craig Jenkinson, Mike Good, Bob Sharp, and Chuck Shields. It was dedicated in 1989 to “the men who never came home by the men who did” and to all Darke County Vietnam War Veterans. The memorial was created from the Darke County Courthouse’s original dome.\n\nDuring the March 29, 2022 National Vietnam War Veterans Day ceremony at the memorial, it was noticed that weather had taken its toll on the plaque that named all the Darke County Vietnam soldiers that never came home. Fort GreeneVille DAR stepped up to the honor to have the existing plaque replaced with a bronze plaque. With the help from Mike Wise, Lasting Legacy Memorials and the family of Vietnam soldier, Gerald F. Subler, Versailles, a bronze plaque will be placed and dedicated.\n\nA special thank you goes to the family of Gerald F. Subler. Gerald’s brother Gene and Nancy Subler recently visited the memorial for the first time and appreciated the memorial. After contacting Fort GreeneVille DAR, the family made a generous donation. In honor of the donation, Terry Clark and Fort GreeneVille DAR felt it appropriate to hold the dedication on Sept. 30. Gerald Francis Subler was born on December 30, 1947, Versailles. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and began his tour on September 11, 1968. Subler was attached to the 1st Marine Division, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, B Company. During his service in the Vietnam War, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Subler sustained hostile artillery rocket mortar in South Vietnam, Quang Nam Province and lost his life on September 30, 1968.\n\nPlease plan to attend this honorable event in honor of all those listed at the memorial and all who served in the Vietnam War. Fort GreeneVille Chapter DAR is a commemorative partner of the United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration — a 13-year program to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the war. Since 2012, the federal government has partnered with local governments, private organizations, and communities to commemorate the Vietnam 50th anniversary.\n\nGerald F.

    "Police in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City accused of beating YouTuber, destroying camera": "Tran Dinh Son, 29, who has just over 10 followers, told RFA that the beatings caused bleeding and nausea.\n\nA Vietnamese YouTube content creator told RFA that local police in Ho Chi Minh City beat him twice and destroyed his camcorder, adding that he has been bleeding and experienced nausea and vomiting the day after the beating.\n\nTran Dinh Son, a 29-year-old Vietnamese YouTuber from the city’s Cu Chi district, runs the channel Đời thường TV, which has just over 10 followers.\n\nHe told RFA that communal police in the Tran Phu Trung district attacked him while he was making a fishing video on Monday. Son said he went fishing at a lake that also grows lotuses at the Tan Phu Trang industrial park, hoping to capture content that he would later put on his YouTube channel.\n\nBut Son says a security guard then came from the industrial park and asked him to stop fishing. After the two men argued for a while, Son says the guard called local police to come, who also asked him to leave. When he refused, Son says one of the police officers and the security guard took turns beating him.\n\n“A police officer slapped me two or three times and then held me so that the security guard could beat me. The three cops were very big while I was small. They hit me on the head and threatened me. While beating me the guard screamed ‘Give me your address, I’ll come kill your parents!’” Son said, recounting the details of the incident.\n\nSon says the police then subdued him and took him to the commune headquarters, where they confiscated the GoPro5 that he uses to create YouTube content, two cellphones, and his motorcycle before leaving. When other officers were assigned to deal with his case, Son says they asked him to write a report about the incident, which he refused to do, and demanded to know why he was violently beaten while he had not committed a crime.\n\n“At the police station, I was beaten again. They hit me a lot on my head and my arm with their bare hands. A police officer named Tai hit me and kicked me. Another strangled me and one who appeared to be the boss elbowed me in my face. Then they handcuffed me, knocked me down to the floor and dragged me to a room nearby and left me alone there.”\n\nAs Son shouted for help, a woman heard him and informed his mother, a local teacher. When Son’s mother, Nguyen Thi Ty, arrived at the headquarters, he said police agreed to remove his handcuffs and then repeated their request for him to write a report about the incident, where he would admit to “illegally” fishing at the park.\n\nSon says the police added that they would return all his belongings on condition that he deleted the videos of them beating him.\n\nWhen police returned his belongings, they asked him to fill out a handover note. However, Son says some parts of his GoPro 5, which costs VND4 million (around USD $170), were destroyed.\n\nWhen the officers left for a break while he was filling out his paperwork and did not return, Son and his mother left the station. Another group of police officers, however, stopped him from going to the hospital to treat his injuries, he said.\n\nOne of the officers, surnamed Hai, asked Son to return the handover note that he filled out at the police station, threatening him with charges of “stealing state data” if he refused.\n\nIn a video filmed at Son’s home, Hai, who was in uniform, denied having beaten Son.\n\nRFA contacted the Tan Phu Trung commune police office to verify the incident. However, the officers who answered the phone said they could not provide a response unless a reporter came directly to their office.\n\nTranslated by Anna Vu. Written by Nawar Nemeh.",
    "Vietnam Bucks Asia's Weakening Growth Trend": "Vietnam Bucks Asia's Weakening Growth Trend\n\nVietnam’s upbeat growth outlook is bucking the slowing trend elsewhere in Asia, with relatively subdued inflation that’s also an exception to the general rule in the region.\n\nThe first half of this year saw a swift economic rebound as Vietnam’s pandemic restrictions eased following the adoption of a living-with-COVID strategy and a robust vaccination drive. Supportive policies such as low interest rates, strong credit growth, and the government’s Program for Socioeconomic Recovery and Development have been accompanied by strong manufacturing output and a recovery in retail and tourism activity.\n\nAccordingly, we recently raised our Vietnam growth forecast to 7 percent this year, lifting it by a full percentage point from three months earlier and the only significant upward revision among major Asian economies. We lowered the projection for next year by 0.5 percentage points to 6.7 percent, but that still contrasts with dimming prospects elsewhere and would be the fastest pace among Asia’s major economies. By way of contrast, growth estimates for Asia were lowered to 4.2 percent and 4.6 percent for this year and next in the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook Update.\n\nVietnam’s inflation pressure has been mostly limited to some goods like fuels and related services like transport. Consumers are largely insulated from the global surge in food prices because of ample domestic supplies, pork prices declining from last year’s peak, and a preference for rice, which remains cheaper than other grains like wheat. Further, price gains for services, such as health and education, have also been very mild.\n\nConsumer prices in the first seven months of the year rose, but remain below the central bank’s 4 percent target for the year. The economy’s delayed recovery last year has kept core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, below regional peers.\n\nInflation, however, could pick up as economic activity gets back to full speed. Higher costs for transportation and commodities such as fertilizers and animal feed could also raise prices for a broader range of goods and services, adding inflationary pressure.\n\nVietnam’s recovery also faces headwinds from global growth decelerating from 6.1 percent last year. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook lowered estimates to 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year amid the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the slowdown in China and major advanced economies. Such a slowdown implies reduced demand for Vietnam’s exports, especially from key trade partners like the United States, China, and the European Union.\n\nIn addition, financial conditions are tightening as interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies rise to curb inflation. That in turn increases financing costs and can lead to capital outflows, as we already see in many emerging markets in the region.\n\nFinally, greater uncertainty about global trade and financial markets could weigh on the recovery, especially if some industries lose access to needed intermediate goods because of further supply-chain disruptions. That could curtail foreign investment in Vietnam, slowing production and technological growth. Together, these factors mean policymakers must be agile and make timely changes:\n\nFiscal policy should take the lead in aiding recovery, yet flexibly adjusted to evolving economic conditions,\n\nThe central bank should focus on rising inflationary risks, and communicate that it’s ready to act as needed and remains committed to meeting its inflation target.\n\nAuthorities should also continue addressing bad loans in the banking system and closely monitoring for potential risks in real estate markets to safeguard financial stability.\n\nEven after decades of impressive gains, Vietnam still faces several challenges, and broad economic reforms will be needed for it to achieve its developmental goals.\n\nFor example, potential economic growth is reduced by a performance gap between highly productive firms that benefit from foreign direct investment and other less productive companies. Businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, are hampered by burdensome regulations, cumbersome administrative procedures, weak corporate governance, insufficient infrastructure, and digital connectivity gaps.\n\nLabor markets would benefit from reducing the mismatches that result if workers don’t have the right job skills, and more formal employment should be encouraged by improving skills and lowering costs for companies to formalize.\n\nElsewhere, social safety net coverage should be scaled up and be made more efficient. Climate-related risks can be addressed through concrete policy actions to invest in climate adaptation, reduce carbon emissions, and achieve the country’s ambitious environmental agenda.\n\nTackling these challenges will further unleash Vietnam to its considerable growth potential and continue advancing on a sustainable development path toward higher income status. Importantly, the country’s development strategy already includes reforms like these, and decisive implementation will help foster sustained, inclusive, and green growth.\n\n****\n\nEra Dabla-Norris is Vietnam mission chief and assistant director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department.\n\nFederico J.

    "HRW: Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security continues Stalinist crackdown": "Activist Bui Tuan Lam (left) holds a sign saying: “Corruption is probably an easy job but investigation of the causes runs slowly.” Teacher Dang Dang Phuoc holds a sign saying “Support parliament to issue a law on demonstrations.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) says the Vietnamese police have adopted a Stalinist model of repression with propaganda it describes as ‘laughable’ and ‘pathetic.’\n\nDeputy Director of HRW's Asia division, Phil Robertson’s comments came in response to an article in the Công an Nhân dân (People's Police) online newspaper, the mouthpiece of Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS).\n\nThe MPS article was published on Sept. 19 with the title \"Wrong interference is a violation of principles in ensuring human rights,\" smearing two newly detained dissidents, Bui Tuan Lam and Dang Dang Phuoc. It also criticized HRW for speaking out for their freedom.\n\n\"Calling for the release of subjects being investigated for criminal acts is against the principles of international relations and is an unreasonable interference in the proceedings of a state,” said the two authors Anh Tu and Huan Nguyen,\n\n\"When HRW or other organizations disregard the truth and interfere with illegal individuals, these organizations are violating international law and the principles of ensuring human rights,” said the article, published in the column \"Against peaceful evolution.\"\n\nRFA's Robertson likened the Vietnamese authorities' policies to those of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who ruled the USSR with an iron fist from 1922 to 1953.\n\n“This totally wrong-headed article shows the truly small world view of the Vietnamese police who apparently think that their rights abusing laws are sacrosanct,” he said.\n\n“Their ignorance is so profound that they apparently don't understand that, when a government like Vietnam ratifies international human rights treaties, it is the legal obligation of that government to bring their laws into conformity with those rights treaties.”\n\n“International law supersedes national laws, not the other way around, when it comes to human rights, which are universal values recognized by the UN and the global international system,” said the Bangkok representative of the human rights organization.\n\n“Propaganda like this from the Ministry of Public Security is really rather laughable and pathetic, and points out how far back the MPS is stuck in some sort of Stalinist retrograde, highly repressive communist history,” said Robertson.\n\n“For a nation like Vietnam which aspires to modernity and global presence, this kind of backward attitude is really embarrassing,” he added.\n\nAnti-State propaganda arrests\n\nBui Tuan Lam, a human rights and social activist, who participated in the civil society delegation during the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on human rights in Vietnam in Geneva in 2014, was arrested on Sept. 7. He was charged with “conducting anti-State propaganda” under Article 117 of the Criminal Code.\n\nA day after Lam's arrest, Dak Lak provincial police took music teacher Dang Dang Phuoc into custody, also under Article 117 charges.\n\nLawyer Le Quoc Quan, a former prisoner, fighting for human rights and democracy, told RFA:\n\n“I see the actions of brothers and sisters Pham Doan Trang, Le Van Dung (aka Le Dung Vova), Nguyen Lan Thang, etcetera, who were arrested a long time ago, and more recently detained Mr. Bui Tuan Lam and music lecturer Dang Dang Phuoc are all in line with Vietnamese law and with the demands of people's consciences to speak up for justice, truth, and the grievances they encounter on a daily basis.”\n\nThe People's Public Security newspaper defended the arrest of the two dissidents as well as many others under Article 117, calling them criminals. However, according to former prisoner of conscience Le Quoc Quan, their arrest is a repression of freedom of expression and other universal rights.\n\n\"The current increase in repression is aimed at protecting the regime and preserving the Communist Party's political monopoly, not preserving national stability\" Quan said.\n\nCommenting on Human Rights Watch's response to Vietnam's arrest of activists he said:\n\n“I find all voices of international organizations, democracy and human rights activists or conscientious individuals about the current repression situation in Vietnam very important, necessary, and correct.”\n\n“It reflects a human restlessness and also the conscience that people foresee such persecution, and people speak out. This statement is absolutely correct.”\n\n\"The People's Public Security newspaper used slanderous language when it considered HRW's voice to be 'wrong interference'.\"\n\nQuan agreed with HRW’s call on Vietnam to remove Article 117, saying the article is unconstitutional and contrary to Vietnam's international commitments to human rights.\n\nLawyer Quan said that the Vietnamese government uses the article on national security as a scanning net to arrest people who are considered \"anti-state\" while they are just people who are awake to the current situation of the country. He said they dare to speak the truth about the regime’s shortcomings because they want a better country and are not \"anti-state\" as alleged.\n\nThe arrest of peaceful activists and many individuals simply because they expressed their opinions on social media showed the weakness of the regime, Quan added.",
    "How Vietnam's exports weathered global storm": "Containers are seen at Cat Lai Terminal in Ho Chi Minh City in April 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Quynh Tran\n\nVietnam’s exports have maintained double digit growth this year, but could face global headwinds like falling consumption and rising inflation in the remaining months.\n\nExports were up 18.2% year-on-year in the first eight months to over US$252 billion, with August shipments rising to a five-month high thanks to recovery in smartphones, computers and garments.\n\nThe rise is partly attributed to a shift in orders from China to Vietnam as the former pursues a strict Covid-19 policy and an electricity shortage in its southwestern region has affected manufacturing there, according to securities brokerage VNDirect.\n\nAnother reason is the contribution of foreign-invested companies, lender HSBC said.\n\nVietnam, along with Singapore and Malaysia, has been climbing up the value chain in recent years thanks to its unrelenting efforts to increase manufacturing capacity.\n\nAgriculture and fisheries have also helped sustain exports despite tightened spending being seen in major markets such as the U.S. and Europe.\n\nTuna exports to the U.S. and the E.U. rose by 65% and 70% year-on-year in August.\n\nThe belt-tightening in these markets is increasing demand for canned tuna as a favored source of protein, the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers said.\n\nRice exports rose by 8.1% to over $2.3 billion.\n\nBut there are challenges on the horizon.\n\nInflation in the U.S. is still at a decades-high level, demand is weakening in China and Europe is going through an energy crisis.\n\n\"We cannot keep thinking that exports must rise year after year,\" economist Le Dang Doanh told a recent forum.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has adjusted its global growth forecast downward five times this year, indicating how unstable the world economy is, he said.\n\nVietnam, though still one of the fastest growing economies in the world, could not be complacent, at least for now, he added.\n\nHSBC also said there are signs that demand for electronics is declining, a threat to Vietnam’s exports.\n\nVNDirect analysts forecast Vietnam’s export growth to slow down in the fourth quarter due to the falling global demand for its goods.",

    "Apple to move 25% iPhone production to India by 2025, 20% iPad and Apple Watch to Vietnam, analysts say": "Apple to move 25% iPhone production to India by 2025, 20% iPad and Apple Watch to Vietnam, analysts say\n\nApple began assembling some of its devices in India and Vietnam a few years ago, slowly cutting its reliance on China. The Cupertino-giant is now gearing up to make the two nations key global manufacturing hubs, according to analysts at JP Morgan.\n\nIn a report they sent to clients Wednesday, JP Morgan analysts said Apple will move 5% of global iPhone 14 production to India by late 2022, and expand its manufacturing capacity in the country to produce 25% of all iPhones by 2025.\n\nVietnam, on the other hand, will contribute 20% of all iPad and Apple Watch productions, 5% of MacBook and 65% of AirPods by 2025, the report said, which was reviewed by TechCrunch.\n\nIndia has attracted investments from Foxconn and Wistron in recent years by offering lucrative subsidies as New Delhi moves to make the country a manufacturing hub. The presence of the foreign production giants, coupled with “ample labor resources and competitive labor costs,” make India a desirable location, the analysts said.\n\nApple-rival Samsung identifies India as a key global manufacturing hub and has set up one of its largest factories in the country. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which currently leads the market, as well as its rivals Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus also locally assemble a number of their handsets in the country.\n\nGoogle also plans to move some of Pixel smartphones’ production to India, The Information reported recently. The company, which skipped shipping flagship models in India for two generations, said Wednesday it will launch the upcoming Pixel 7 models in India.\n\nEven as Apple commands a tiny market share in India, the iPhone-maker has broadened its investment in the country in the past five years. It opened its online Apple Store in the country two years ago and has publicly shared that it’s working to launch its first physical store in the nation.\n\nFoxconn currently has over 20,000 operators in its iPhone assembly business in India, compared to 350,000 of those in China, the analysts estimated.\n\n“India’s iPhone supply chain has historically supplied only legacy models. Interestingly, Apple has requested that EMS vendors manufacture iPhone 14/14 Plus models in India in 4Q22, within two to three months of the start of production in Mainland China. The much shorter interval implies the increasing importance of India production and likely higher iPhone allocations to India manufacturing in the future,” the report added.\n\n“We believe Apple only produces iPhone 14/14 Plus models in India now due to the more complex camera module alignment of the iPhone Pro series (done by EMS vendors) and higher local market demand for the iPhone 14 series (tax savings). We expect the volume to start small in 4Q22 (~1M units per month, or 5% of total iPhone volume).”\n\nIn the “near term,” China and Taiwan will continue to still gain market share due to better cost structures, the analysts said.\n\n“Taiwanese EMS vendors, especially Pegatron and Wistron, are more selective and prioritizing profitability while focusing on new areas such as EVs and servers. Hon Hai remains a primary EMS partner for iPhones and should benefit from the move to India,” the report said.\n\n“Mainland China-based production share should swing toward local vendors, while Taiwanese EMS hold an edge in India. In Vietnam, we expect share to be split between Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese EMS.”",
    "County Exec urges Schools and Families to Visit the Traveling Vietnam Wall this weekend": "Prev\n\n1 of 2\n\nof Next\n\nPutnam County Executive MaryEllen Odell joins Veterans Service Agency Director Karl Rohde in urging schools and families to take advantage of an event that will give local meaning to national history and bring students to see the Traveling Vietnam Wall when it visits Carmel this weekend.\n\nThe Traveling Vietnam Wall will be on display at the Putnam County Veterans Memorial Park from noon on September 22nd until 3:00 PM and on September 25th, will be open for visits 24 hours a day. There will be an opening ceremony tonight, September 22, at 7pm in the park\n\n“This is a great educational opportunity,” County Executive Odell said. “Not only can students see a version of the Vietnam Wall without having to go to D.C., but they will have the chance to meet with local veterans from Putnam County who may have served in the war. It’s a good example to show the students how national history is also local history.”\n\nThe Traveling Wall is an 80 percent scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. This visit will include The American Traveling Tribute, a display that features every war America has been involved in from the Revolutionary War right up to today, and a half-size replica of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThis event is a collaboration between the Putnam County Veterans Service Agency and the Putnam County Joint Veterans Council (PCJVC). The PCJVC is a local non-profit Veterans Service Organization.\n\n“We believe that this is an excellent educational and community service opportunity,” Rohde wrote in a letter to school officials throughout the region. “We know it’s early in the school year, but It is our hope that you can present the students at your school with this gift.”\n\nBuses will be available to transport visitors round trip from Putnam Plaza and the Putnam County Office Building to the park to see the wall. The buses will run from the Tops Store at Putnam Plaza every hour on the hour from noon to 5 p.m. on Sept. 22-24. They will stop at the county office building 10 minutes after the hour. Please see the below Traveling Wall Public Transportation schedule for details.\n\nThe closing ceremony will take place at 11 a.m. Sunday, September 25, which is Gold Star Mother’s Day, and will feature a concert by The Hudson Valley Council Band.",
    "What is an FNG in the Military During Vietnam War?": "Of the jargon in the military, there is the abbreviation “FNG.” It was commonly used during the Vietnam War, so you might have heard it in such films.\n\nBut what is an FNG in the military exactly?\n\nExplain FNG is short for “Fucking New Guy.” As implied, it is the nickname for newcomers. Learn more about the FNG military acronym used by U.S Vietnam soldiers below.\n\nAll About Military FNG\n\n1. FNG Definition\n\nAs mentioned briefly in the opening, FNG stands for “Fucking New Guy.”\n\n2. FNG Meaning\n\nFucking New Guy is a demeaning way to refer to a newcomer. This implication is that the FNG is a rookie without any experience, and is, therefore, useless. FNGs are suggested to do more harm than good.\n\nNote Since new units joined the war in groups, the phrase FNG group was also popular.\n\nHere is an example of FNG being used in a sentence, “Damn, nearly everyone here is an FNG, we will surely be wiped out on the next OP!”\n\nIn the eyes of Veteran warfare troops, new unit members were a liability. They:\n\nWere homesick\n\nWere homesick Talked to loud\n\nTalked to loud Made too much noise while moving\n\nMade too much noise while moving Did not know what to take to the bush\n\nDid not know what to take to the bush How to wear equipment properly\n\nHow to wear equipment properly Flake out on the easiest moves\n\nFlake out on the easiest moves Fired too much ammo\n\nFired too much ammo Struggled to respond to basic combat commands\n\nFNGs were treated as a non-person. It was common to be scorned and shunned. They were even considered despicable and villainous.\n\nTo the soldier referred to as an FNG, it was a source of psychological stress and burden. It was a constant reminder to prove their worth. Case in point: Before you [the soldier] demonstrate your value, you are just a three-letter abbreviation.\n\nNote Being poorly treated (routinely) as an FNG was a mental toll on troops. The consequence was a high number of psychiatric casualties. Nowadays, Army psychiatrists refer to it as the FNG syndrome.\n\nListen to Vietnam War vets talk about their experience as an FNG in this video here.\n\n3. FNG Purposes\n\nIt was used by the existing units of Vietnam War American soldiers to address new recruits.\n\nOther than combatant troops, the term was used by Army and Marine chaplains and medics. So, today, we often hear of FNG Army or FNG Marine together.\n\nThis was because, during the war, all units had an FNG. FNG was widely used across all types of units, and you can hear it on the front lines as well as backstage.\n\nIn fact, it slipped from the tongues of Vietnam War troops so easily that today, we look back at it as the FNG syndrome or FNG phenomenon.\n\nFNG (and the treatment of people dubbed one) played a big role in the distinct group dynamic of the U.S Vietnam War units. There was a line drawn between those who had experienced the war terror (“us”) and those who had not (“them”).\n\n4. FNG Origin\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the FNG syndrome or phenomenon started from the U.S military policy for individual rotation during the Vietnam War. Individual troops were rotated in and out with already deployed units in Vietnam in tours lasting 12 months.\n\nThis differed from previous American wars; units have always been sustained and deployed as a whole and only once.\n\nBesides in Southeast Asia, at the time, the United States had to maintain a large troop presence in Western Europe and South Korea because of the Cold War.\n\nAnd the Johnson administration did not have the political capital needed to call up the Reserves and National Guard or request congressional approval to lengthen the tours of draftees to over 24 months. Hence, the unit-based strategy was replaced by the individual rotation policy.\n\n5. FNG Usage\n\nToday, the term is still used in the U.S military, law enforcement, wildland firefighters, technical trades with ex-military members, and even the Canadian military.\n\nA popular reference to the term is the first post-Apollo astronaut group (NASA Astronaut Group 8)’s self-given nickname “TFNG.” This was short for “Thirty-Five New Guys.”\n\nIn the Media\n\nPlatoon\n\nIn this 1986 film by Oliver Stone, the abbreviation FNG is mentioned several times through the depiction of the experiences of Private Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen) during the Vietnam war.\n\nFull Metal Jacket\n\nFNG popped up a few times in this Stanley Kubric film revolving around Private Joker (played by Matthew Modine) and his new recruits in basic training and deployment into the Vietnam War’s 1968 Tet Offensive.\n\nDoom 3\n\nThe main character in Doom 3 holds the F.N.G rank after arriving at MArs City.\n\nGeneration Kill\n\nIn the “Get Some” episode of this HBO series, the character Lance Cpl. Trombley is referred to as the FNG by fellow marines because he wore his Boonie hat after dark.\n\nIn Literature\n\nThe Beach\n\nFNG was mentioned in this backpacker novel by Alex Garland. And the term was introduced into popular culture when it was made into a film of the same title in 2002.\n\nIn Video Games\n\nCall of Duty 4\n\n“F.N.G” is the name of the first level in the video game “Call of Duty 4.” When you tune in, one of the soldiers introduces the players to the squad commander and says, “It is the FNG, sir.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is FNG in Forrest Gump?\n\nThe FNG mentioned in Forrest Gump is the same FNG used by Vietnam War troops. In the film, the character played by Tom Hanks and his best friend are referred to as FNGs by their officer in command when they first come to Vietnam.\n\nWhy was Charlie in Vietnam?\n\nCharlie is another term used to refer to a “type” of people during the Vietnam War. It came from the GI shorthand for Victor Charlie, which was shortened to VC and used to call the Viet Cong.\n\nEventually, VC was changed to Charlie and the name stuck. You can learn more about this term in our article “What does Charlie Mean in the Military.”\n\nWhat does FNG mean in Apex?\n\nFNG Apex was a hot topic in 2020.\n\nAt the beginning of Chapter 9 in the Apex Legends’ Broken Ghost quest, the character Bangalore says, “This time, I was the FNG.”\n\nIt was in response to her act of giving away character Loba’s position, which results in her final confrontation with the character Revenant.\n\nHere, Bangalore alludes to the FNG abbreviation used during the Vietnam War. Essentially, she calls herself a noob!\n\nConclusion\n\nNow, you know the answer to, “What is an FNG in the military?” FNG is short for Fucking New Guy, an abbreviation used by American troops during the Vietnam War as a result of the individual rotation policy.\n\nBeing called an FNG is not fun. It is a hurtful term that causes stress. As such, it caused many psychiatric casualties. Army psychiatrists nowadays call it the FNG syndrome.\n\nToday, it is still used in military-related professions and referenced in military content like films, books, and video games.\n\n5/5 - (2 votes)",
    "How Vietnam’s Ancient Whale Temples Are Helping Science": "This piece was originally published in Hakai Magazine, an online publication about science and society in coastal ecosystems. It appears here with permission.\n\nThe strong afternoon sun bears down on the coastal town of Can Thanh in southern Vietnam, but inside Lăng Ông Thủy Tướng—a single-story, pale-yellow building on the town’s shoreline—it is cool. Diffused sunlight illuminates the main hall, and the air is laden with the woody aroma of burning incense. A lone man, most likely a fisherman, enters the hall, walks toward a 20-meter baleen whale skeleton displayed in a glass case, and folds his hands in deep reverence.\n\nLăng Ông Thủy Tướng—the temple to the god of the sea—is one of 1,000 or more such shrines on Vietnam’s 3,260-kilometer coastline. At these temples, which come in varying sizes and configurations but all house whale bones, fishermen worship in hopes that their prayers will be carried to Cá Ông, the whale spirit, and they will be blessed with a safe fishing trip and a bountiful catch. Close relatives of fishermen also visit to light candles, burn incense, and pray for the safety of their loved one, sometimes offering fruit and money, hoping their prayers are heard.\n\nFor over two centuries, fishing communities along Vietnam’s central and southern coastlines have built places of worship to honor the dead cetaceans washing up on their shores. From large ornate structures to simple graves with headstones to small wooden shoebox-sized shrines bedecked with incense and flowers, these “whale temples” are a centuries-old part of the country’s cultural history, but they also house evidence of its natural history. For this reason, Vu Long, cofounder of the Ho Chi Minh City–based Center for Biodiversity Conservation and Endangered Species (CBES), a grassroots wildlife conservation organization also involved with marine mammal research, is visiting Lăng Ông Thủy Tướng. For marine mammal researchers like Vu who are faced with extremely limited resources and a lack of funding, these whale temples—some holding dozens of skeletons—prove an invaluable source of information regarding the current and historical diversity and distribution of marine mammals in Vietnam. “Besides being a unique aspect of Vietnamese culture, whale temples are a great supplementary source of information for our research,” says Vu, who, along with his team at CBES, collects data about marine mammals in Vietnam via boat-based surveys and by monitoring cetacean strandings.\n\nMarine mammal researcher Vu Long studies marine mammals in the field, but also through the skeleton repositories at Vietnam’s whale temples. Courtesy the Center for Biodiversity Conservation and Endangered Species\n\nVu sits outside the temple entrance with Lê Văn No, a 71-year-old retired fisherman who has served as a volunteer caretaker of the temple for over 20 years. Lê cleans the temple daily, and, along with others, decorates it for special occasions, such as the annual Nghinh Ông (whale worship) festival celebrated in the eighth month of the lunar calendar.\n\nLăng Ông Thủy Tướng is one of the country’s older known temples, the original shrine site dating back to 1805, and Lê is eager to share the story of the whale behind glass, just one of the dozens of skeletons associated with this shrine. (The others are piled in one of the temple’s rooms or stored in one of the 17 coffin-like bins located at a nearby property.) “Local people found this whale with bullet wounds,” says Lê. “It was another victim of the [Vietnam] war.”\n\nHe shows Vu a discolored black-and-white photograph from 1971 and recounts when the whale carcass was found floating in the waters near the temple. Lê was only 20 years old then but recalls that the dead animal—about the length of 13 park benches—was too large to be moved by human effort alone. So the community used a small motorboat to drag the carcass to the nearby mangroves. It decomposed there for several months before its bones were moved to the temple, where it became a focal point for worship.\n\nIn Da Nang, about 1,000 kilometers north of Can Thanh, 35-year-old fisherman Trần Văn Mùi, has prayed at the Vạn Nam Thọ temple since he was a child. In an earlier interview conducted by Vu, he learned that Trần’s faith in the miraculous powers of whales and whale temples was reinforced in 2005, when he and his fishing crew avoided a storm that the weather forecast had failed to predict. At sea, Trần’s crew observed a whale surface and head toward shore, a sighting they took as an omen from Cá Ông, the whale spirit. They sailed home earlier than planned. In doing so, Trần believes, they avoided the storm, and their lives were saved.\n\nAccording to Vu, this profound faith in the mystical power of whales can be traced back to three different origin stories. One is rooted in Hinduism and another in Buddhism, but the one that is most widely believed in Vietnam comes from the country’s history. In the 18th century, Nguyễn Ánh, a powerful warlord, was waging a 20-plus-year war against his enemies. On the verge of getting captured, he prayed to the gods for a way to escape. At that moment, two whales rose from the sea and carried him and his flagship away from the enemy, thus ensuring his safety. In 1802, Nguyễn Ánh became the first emperor of a unified Vietnamese kingdom, the precursor to modern Vietnam. As a token of gratitude to the gods, Nguyễn Ánh declared that all whales in Vietnamese waters must be worshipped as gods.\n\nThe skeleton of a baleen whale takes center stage at the temple Lăng Ông Thủy Tướng in Can Thanh, Vietnam. Courtesy the Center for Biodiversity Conservation and Endangered Species\n\nIn keeping with this historical story, fishermen consider it their duty to bring a whale they find floating or catch accidentally to shore and conduct a burial ceremony—on the beach or in a dedicated whale graveyard. After three years or so, they exhume the bones and transfer them to the community’s whale temple. It’s a reverence akin to that shown for a parent or an elder. “When fishermen see a stranded whale, they believe that the animal has chosen their village as its final resting place,” explains Vu. “They feel honored and obligated to give it a proper burial ceremony.”\n\nYears, decades, and in some places even centuries of skeletons collected at temples have resulted in a treasure trove of information about Vietnam’s cetaceans, not just whales. (If fishermen see a dead animal with a horizontal tail and a blowhole, they usually consider it a whale. As a result, the temples tend to have a mix of whale, dolphin, and porpoise bones.)\n\nVu, who has studied the marine mammals of Vietnam for a decade, is one of the authors of a 2021 paper that highlights the wealth of information inside whale temples. He emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach—including social scientists and cultural historians, for instance—to studying them.\n\nOver the years, Vu and his team have located more than 200 temples. For their recent paper, they visited 18 whale temples on Vietnam’s central coast, where they identified and measured 140 marine mammal skeletons from 15 species. To determine the species, they examined the dentition and took 10 specific skull measurements.\n\nSome whale temples studied for the paper had acquired just a single carcass since the 19th century, others received a dead dolphin or whale every month, often of differing species. Several of the species they found in the temples were not seen on their boat surveys, explains Vu. One example was the data deficient Omura’s whale, a whale that was first described by Japanese scientists in 2003. Vu and his colleagues found two specimens in their whale temple survey. These finds brought the species’ record in Vietnam to five.\n\n“The collections within these temples are reminders of how much has changed.”\n\nMuch to their surprise, Vu and his coauthors also came across three dugong skulls during their visit to two whale temples in the northern part of the central coast. In recent times, the presence of dugongs has only been confirmed in southwestern Vietnam and the Con Dao archipelago, located to the southeast of the country. So this observation sheds new light on their historical distribution. They think the skulls date back to the 1990s through to the early 2000s, indicating that the dugongs’ local extinction is recent. Vu also theorizes that the local extinction of dugongs was most likely caused by human activities like hunting, by-catch, and the destruction of their seagrass habitats.\n\nEmma Carroll, a whale researcher and an associate professor at the University of Auckland (Waipapa Taumata Rau) in New Zealand, says that “societies suffer from shifting baselines, the idea that what we see now is normal, as there’s no collective memory of the biodiversity that thrived even in the recent past. The collections within these temples are reminders of how much has changed, for example, the shift in dugong distribution that was revealed [in Vu’s paper].”\n\nShe adds that the collection of bones holds a unique archive of species diversity, population abundance, and distribution information that can be revealed with modern genetic analysis techniques, but emphasizes that these studies should only happen with community support and approval.\n\nThe whale worship house in Ben Tre, Vietnam. Michael Habana Coronel/Shutterstock\n\nVu and his team have continued documenting whale temples even after the publication of the paper. To date, they have identified 25 cetacean species in whale temples, including rare and endangered species like sperm whales. In comparison, they’ve identified only 20 cetacean species via the stranding monitoring done over the past five years and just three species in their boat-based surveys. These results underscore the importance of whale temples as information storehouses about Vietnam’s cetaceans. Vu hopes that the temples will, in the long run, become key centers for interaction with fishermen and awareness campaigns about sustainable fishing.\n\nFor now, Vu and his team still have hundreds of whale temples to document. But they are unfazed. By analyzing and dating the specimens found in these repositories, the researchers are confident of narrowing the information gaps that exist around Vietnam’s marine mammal diversity and its distribution over time.\n\nBack at Lăng Ông Thủy Tướng, as Vu and Lê chat, a pair of curious Vietnamese tourists wander up to the temple entrance. Lê slowly rises from his chair, and walks over to greet them and share whale worship stories with this eager, younger audience.",
    "Gilead Joins First-of-its-Kind Public-Private Initiative to Improve Management of Viral Hepatitis in Vietnam and the Philippines": "- Public-Private Effort to Shift Traditional Model of Hepatitis Management to Primary Care and Help to Expand Care to More People in Need -\n\nFOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. today announced a new public-private initiative with the Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam (HAIVN), a collaboration between Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This multi-year initiative will have a phased approach to help address barriers that limit viral hepatitis diagnosis and care at primary healthcare facilities in Vietnam and the Philippines, two countries with high burdens of hepatitis B and C.\n\nGilead and HAIVN will work together with a multi-stakeholder coalition, involving national ministries of health, academic stakeholders including the University of Philippines-Manila (UP Manila), provincial hospitals and primary healthcare centers to support this pilot program. The focus of the program will be on person-centered approaches in training non-specialist community-based healthcare providers in prevention and management of viral hepatitis, incorporating education, screening, diagnosis and linkage to care for hepatitis B and C into routine patient visits for at-risk populations. Gilead and HAIVN will also aim to strengthen primary healthcare systems including the referrals and counter-referral systems to enhance coordination between specialist and primary care. The two organizations will make the outcomes and learnings from the initiative public to contribute towards better understanding of adequate public health approaches to improve person-centered, community-based management of viral hepatitis.\n\n“This collaboration will provide evidence to support a shift from the current dependence on scarce and overstretched specialists to a broader group of primary care clinicians while simultaneously strengthening primary health care systems and expanding countries’ capacity to diagnose, manage and treat viral hepatitis,” said David Duong, MD, MPH, Director of the Harvard Medical School Program in Global Primary Care and Social Change and an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Through this innovative initiative with Gilead, we will apply new patient-centered, community-based models to hepatitis care and treatment, building on the foundation that HAIVN has built.”\n\nThe initiative will support national priorities for Vietnam and the Philippines: both governments are committed to strengthening primary healthcare and controlling hepatitis. The World Health Organization has set a global target to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030, calling for 90% of people with hepatitis B and C to be diagnosed, 80% of those eligible for treatment to be treated and a 65% reduction in mortality, in addition to developing preventative actions.1 However, despite the important gains in biomedical technology and management of viral hepatitis, implementation of best practices and access to diagnostics and treatment in both countries are still significantly limited and inconsistent. At the current pace, Vietnam and the Philippines are not expected to reach WHO targets before 2050.\n\n“This approach has significant potential for application in many other disease areas and low- and middle-income countries where specialist providers are scarce,” said Dr. Harald Nusser, Vice President, Head of Global Patient Solutions, Gilead Sciences. “More than proof of concept for eliminating viral hepatitis and strengthening healthcare systems, this initiative demonstrates the potential for the meaningful impact that public, private and academic collaborations can make on improving global health equity and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 regarding good health and well-being.”\n\nHepatitis B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people globally and together are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related deaths. An estimated 354 million people worldwide live with hepatitis B or C, and for most, testing and treatment remain beyond reach.2 In Vietnam, out of a population of 97 million, nearly 7.8 million people have hepatitis B and over 900,000 have hepatitis C. Based on 2020 estimates from the CDA Foundation’s Polaris database, only 30% of Vietnamese people with hepatitis B have been diagnosed and only 3% treated. For hepatitis C, only 14% of cases have been diagnosed and 7% have been treated.3 In the Philippines, over 10 million people are infected with hepatitis B and nearly 450,000 with hepatitis C, with the care cascade standing at 5% diagnosed and less than 1% treated for hepatitis B and 23% diagnosed and 1% treated for hepatitis C. 3\n\nAbout Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were adopted by the United Nations (UN) Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They are call to actions by all countries to unite in a global partnership to ensure peace and prosperity for people and planet. SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing is one of the SDGs that Gilead supports to improve global health and sustainable development.

The FIA Region II Asia Pacific is made up of 24 countries, 19 Clubs and 35 million members.\n\nFor two days, over sixty delegates, speakers and FIA executives will discuss the future of mobility in the Asia-Pacific region, with a focus on tourism, road safety, sustainability, youth engagement and innovation. It will be the first physical FIA Region II Roundtable held since the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nFIA Deputy President for Automobile Mobility and Tourism Tim Shearman will be joined by FIA Region II President Greig Craft, hosting the Roundtable as AA Vietnam and AIP Foundation President, FIA Senate President Carmelo Sanz de Barros, FIA Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Tourism ad interim Onika Miller, FIA Director of Tourism Services Habib Turki and FIA Foundation Executive Director Saul Billingsley, along with other FIA experts and external speakers.\n\nAA Vietnam became a Member of the FIA in September 2018, establishing the first FIA Automobile Club in Vietnam. AA Vietnam offers various mobility services to its members and seeks measures that ensure greater road safety within the country through its partnerships with leading car dealers and manufacturers. To increase its positive impact on society, AA Vietnam profits are re-invested back into road safety projects, advocacy, environmental and climate matters, member benefits, and charitable activities.\n\nAA Vietnam’s strong commitment to lead road safety actions centres around education, infrastructure, research, advocacy and communication, and has been impelled by its President Greig Craft who has been a leading road safety advocate in Vietnam and globally for over 20 years.\n\nAfter moving to Vietnam in 1989, Craft created the AIP Foundation in 1999 to prevent road fatalities and injuries in Vietnam and low- and middle-income countries of the region. He initially focused on widespread helmet use as a habit for drivers in Vietnam. Craft and a team of international specialists and designers developed the world’s first “tropical” helmet, a lightweight, low-cost motorcycle helmet appropriate to warm and wet climates like Vietnam.\n\nIn 2001, Craft established AIP Foundation’s social enterprise helmet factory, Protec, which became noted internationally as a producer of affordable, climate-appropriate helmets. This was hailed a ‘silver bullet’ in child injury prevention. Protec is a social enterprise employing persons with disabilities in Vietnam and aims to provide a product for people at all levels of the economic pyramid. Craft has since continued to expand his focus to other road safety issues including pedestrian safety, speeding, driving skills, safe school zones, and industrial worker education.\n\nAs Members of the FIA, AIP Foundation and AA Vietnam work closely together to advance impactful road safety initiatives and drive effective change. Both organisations collaborate with the Vietnamese government to promote the use of safe and certified helmets and establish programmes to increase children safety in school zones.\n\nBy hosting the FIA Region II Roundtable, AA Vietnam and AIP Foundation reassert their commitment to leverage the collective power and expertise of the Region’s Members through stronger collaboration.",

    "Chef's Table with Gabriella's Vietnam chef Thanh Nguyen": "Thanh Nguyen came to the U.S. to study biochemistry but instead followed her passion and became a chef.\n\nState of play: Nguyen is the owner of Gabriella's Vietnam in South Philly, where she serves up dishes from her native Saigon, Vietnam.\n\nShe opened the spot at 1837 East Passyunk Ave. — her latest venture following previous restaurants in Philly, Norristown and Ambler — with her husband, Chris, in February 2021.\n\nGabriella's was the only Philly eatery to make it onto The New York Times' 2022 Restaurant List this week.\n\nAxios asked Nguyen a few questions for our culinary advice series, Chef's Table:\n\nMust-have tool in your home kitchen? Chopsticks. We use wooden chopsticks to cook just about every dish.\n\nGo-to grocery store for home cooking? Hung Vuong Food Market on Washington Avenue in Little Saigon.\n\nFresh ingredients are a must for us. We like to use ingredients that are as close to its natural state whenever we cook at home.\n\nThis means bone-in fish and meats, shell on crustaceans and shellfish and, of course, we always must have a serving of leafy greens with every meal.\n\nMost overlooked spice? Turmeric. It gives food a very comforting flavor and an eye-pleasing color that kind of triggers your tongue to want to eat the food.\n\nFavorite home-cooked meal: Thịt Kho — braised pork belly with boiled eggs. It's Vietnamese soul food and the best Vietnamese dish you'll ever have.\n\nThe pork belly is slowly braised with caramelized fish sauce until it is melt-in-your-mouth tender. We add boiled eggs in the braise so the whites soak up the braising liquid.\n\nThis dish is eaten with white rice but a simple blanch of leafy greens is a must.\n\nWhen we eat, we use our chopsticks or a spoon to break the eggs in half and drench the yolk in the braising liquid.\n\nWhat's your go-to dish at your favorite local restaurant? Mike's BBQ in South Philly, which is the only American BBQ joint my husband, Chris, and I crave and the only place we'll probably ever eat at.\n\nOur go to is the juicy, tender, perfectly cooked brisket and the amazing crispy pork belly. We've had other menu items and they're all pretty much up there in taste and quality.\n\nQuick tip for at-home cooks: The best way to clean your ingredients, and hold their quality and color is to flash blanch it in boiling water first.\n\nBy giving it a quick blanch, you're going to wash off and release any impurities of the meat or vegetable. This also helps to hold their shape and color.\n\nAfter flash blanching, you can use the ingredients to steam, stir-fry, or cook, and the texture will almost always be perfect.\n\nHow do you unplug: I read a lot. You'll find me on my phone almost every time that I'm not working. Besides that, there is one video game that I've been enjoying for almost 10 years now: \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,\" which I play with my husband.",

    "Vietnam friendlies a good opportunity for Indian players to prepare for Asian Cup 2023: Bhutia": "New Delhi: Former India captain and the new co-opted Executive committee member of the AIFF, Bhaichung Bhutia has said that national men’s football team’s two-friendly matches in Vietnam, scheduled on September 24 and September 27, will be a good opportunity for the players to prepare for the Asian Cup next year.\n\nThe Blue Tigers have travelled to Vietnam for a two-match tour. They will play the Hung Thinh Friendly Football Tournament against Singapore and hosts Vietnam.\n\nTwenty years ago, Bhutia was the captain when India won the historic 2002 LG Cup in Vietnam.\n\n“I think it’s great for our national team that they are going to play some matches there. I think it will be a good tour. Vietnam are a very good team. So are Singapore. It’s going to be a useful experience for the players,” said Bhutia.\n\nEarly this week, the AIFF Executive Committee endorsed the Technical Committee’s recommendation to extend senior men’s team head coach Igor Stimac’s contract till the end of the AFC Asian Cup 2023.\n\nThe former Blue Tigers striker feels the extension will give the required time to both players and the coach to build the team chemistry.\n\n“It is a very sensible decision taken by the committee because we are not left with too much time before we plunge into the Asian Cup battle. The extension will help coaches and the players feel more comfortable and will give them ample time to build on what they have been doing for the last three to four years. So hopefully, I think this match and the preparation for the Asia Cup will now be much better,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, Bhutia has urged everyone in the Indian football community to treat the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup with “utmost priority”.\n\nThe 16-team championships, where India are placed in Group A with the US, Morocco and Brazil, is almost knocking on India’s door and will begin in 20 days from now, on October 11.\n\n“The U-17 World cup is a priority right now and is very important. Everybody is looking forward to some creditable performance from our girls. I think that should be given the top priority as it is starting in the next few weeks,” the former captain said.\n\n“The girls have to play some matches against good teams now before the world cup kicks off. It will give them the required motivation,” he added.\n\nThe 45-year old also urged all football fans to attend and support the event. “I think it’s a great opportunity for our girls in the U-17 team. The fans should come in numbers in the stadium and support the team,” he said.\n\nBhutia said the six eminent players in the executive committee will bring lots of experience on the table, which is very much required for the development of Indian football.\n\n“We all should work for the development of Indian football. That is all we are here for. I would like to thank the Supreme Court for giving this honour to all the six players because I believe we can bring a lot of experience and provide the right advice for the improvement of football,” he concluded.\n\n–IANS",

    "Vietnam Electricity Industry Report 2022: Market Size Analysis 2017-2021 and Forecasts 2022-2031": "DUBLIN, Sept. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"Research Report on Vietnam's Electricity Industry 2022-2031\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nResearch and Markets Logo\n\nWith a large population, strong economic growth, and rapidly declining reserves in existing oil and gas fields, Vietnam is one of the fastest growing energy import markets in Asia. Vietnam's annual electricity demand is expected to grow by 10% to 12% per year over the next decade, making it one of the fastest growing countries in Asia in terms of electricity consumption.\n\nVietnam has average strength on the power generation side, but is growing rapidly. According to IEV's March 2021 report, the total installed capacity of Vietnam's power system will be about 56 GW by 2020. Vietnam's power mix has the largest share of coal-fired power and hydropower at 34% and 30% respectively, gas turbine and oil-fired thermoelectric power at 15%, solar (including rooftop solar) at 24%, wind power at 1%, biomass power at about 1%, and hydropower imported from Laos at 1%.\n\nThe total number of operating power plants in Vietnam is about 162 (excluding small hydropower plants and renewable energy). the maximum load capacity of the power system in 2020 is about 38.7 GW, and the crude reserve ratio of the power system (excluding wind and solar) is 34.3%. According to the Vietnamese government, the installed capacity is expected to reach 125-130 GW by 2030, doubling the installed capacity within 10 years. Vietnam's power generation CAGR is expected to reach 5.7% from 2021 to 2030.\n\nRetail electricity tariffs in Vietnam are approved by the government's Prime Minister and have a uniform tariff policy throughout the country, with tariff levels that are low compared to other countries in the region. The higher electricity tariffs for industrial, commercial and foreign consumers subsidize the electricity bills of urban and rural residents.\n\nTo attract more private sector investment in IPP projects, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and EVN (Vietnam Electricity) are pushing the government to gradually deregulate electricity prices, according to the analysis. Under current regulations, EVN can raise or lower electricity prices every six months without government approval, within a 10 percent range whenever the cost of power generation (fuel prices, foreign exchange rates, changes in generation mix, etc.) rises by 3 percent, and government approval is required for price changes above 10 percent. The current average price of electricity in Vietnam is VND1,533-2,580 (6.3 to 10.75 cents) per kWh, depending on usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nVietnam has experienced rapid economic development in recent years, with high potential for future economic growth. Since early 2022, Vietnam has gradually gotten rid of the adverse effects of COVID-19, which is conducive to further inflow of foreign capital and will drive electricity demand to maintain high growth.\n\nIt is expected that in the next few years, Vietnam will gradually reduce the proportion of thermal power generation while Vietnam will work to accelerate the development of renewable energy (hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, etc.).\n\nThe analyst recommends that investors actively explore the possibility of investing in wind and solar power as well as developing pumped storage hydropower plants. On the other hand, they can continue to install clean and efficient thermal power plants in some regions, and prioritize the development of pithead coal power using clean coal power technology in the power shortage and coal-producing areas of northwest Vietnam.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nOverview of Vietnam's power sector\n\nThe economic and policy environment of Vietnam's power sector\n\nWhat is the impact of COVID-19 on the power sector in Vietnam?\n\nVietnam Electricity Industry Market Size 2017-2021\n\nVietnam Electricity Industry Market Forecast 2022-2031\n\nVietnam Electricity Import and Export Analysis\n\nAnalysis of major power companies in Vietnam\n\nKey Drivers and Market Opportunities in Vietnam's Power Sector\n\nWhat are the key drivers, challenges and opportunities for Vietnam's power sector during the forecast period 2022-2031?\n\nWhat is the expected revenue of Vietnam's power sector over the forecast period 2022-2031?\n\nWhich segment of the Vietnam power industry market is expected to dominate the market in 2031?\n\nWhat are the main negative factors facing the power sector in Vietnam?\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1 Overview of Vietnam\n\n1.1 Geographical situation\n\n1.2 Demographic structure of Vietnam\n\n1.3 Vietnam's economy\n\n1.4 Minimum Wage in Vietnam 2011-2022\n\n1.5 Impact of COVID-19 on Vietnam's power sector\n\n1.6 About the Analyst\n\n\n\n2 Vietnam power industry development environment\n\n2.1 Brief History of Electricity Development in Vietnam\n\n2.2 Types of electricity in Vietnam\n\n2.3 Policy environment of Vietnam's electricity sector\n\n\n\n3 Vietnam electricity industry supply and demand situation\n\n3.1 Vietnam electricity industry supply situation\n\n3.2 Vietnam electricity industry demand situation\n\n\n\n4 Vietnam's electricity industry import and export status\n\n4.1 Vietnam's electricity industry import status\n\n4.1.1 Vietnam's electricity import volume and import value\n\n4.1.2 Vietnam's main sources of electricity imports\n\n4.2 Export status of Vietnam's electricity industry\n\n4.2.1 Vietnam's electricity export volume and export value\n\n4.2.2 Vietnam's main export destinations for electricity\n\n\n\n5 Vietnam Electricity Industry Market Competition\n\n5.1 Barriers to entry in Vietnam's electricity industry\n\n5.1.1 Brand Barrier\n\n5.1.2 Quality Barriers\n\n5.1.3 Capital Barriers\n\n5.2 Competitive Structure of Vietnam's Electricity Industry\n\n5.2.1 Bargaining power of electricity suppliers\n\n5.2.2 Consumer bargaining power\n\n5.2.3 Competition in Vietnam's electricity sector\n\n5.2.4 Potential Entrants in the Electricity Industry\n\n5.2.5 Alternatives to Electricity\n\n\n\n6 Analysis of major power companies in Vietnam\n\n6.1 Quang Ninh Thermal Power JSC (QTP)\n\n6.2 Pha Lai Thermal Power JSC\n\n6.3 Tkv Campha Thermal (NCP)\n\n6.4 Ninh Binh Thermal Power JSC\n\n6.5 Hai Phong Thermal Power SJC\n\n6.6 Central Hydropower Joint Stock Company\n\n6.7 An Giang Power And Water Supply Joint Stock Company\n\n6.8 Dai Truong Thanh Holdings Energy Investment Joint Stock Company\n\n6.9 Tra Vinh Rural Electric Development Joint Stock Corporation\n\n6.10 EVN International Joint Stock Company\n\n\n\n7 Vietnam Electricity Sector Outlook 2022-2031\n\n7.1 Analysis of development factors of Vietnam's electricity sector\n\n7.1.1 Drivers and Development Opportunities in Vietnam's Electricity Sector\n\n7.1.2 Threats and challenges to Vietnam's electricity sector\n\n7.2 Vietnam Electricity Industry Supply Forecast\n\n7.3 Vietnam Electricity Market Demand Forecast\n\n7.4 Vietnam Electricity Import and Export Forecast\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/nul201\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nResearch and Markets\n\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager\n\npress@researchandmarkets.com\n\n\n\nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470\n\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630\n\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\n\n\n\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\n\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\n\nLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/539438/Research_and_Markets_Logo.jpg\n\nCision\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vietnam-electricity-industry-report-2022-market-size-analysis-2017-2021-and-forecasts-2022-2031-301629922.html\n\nSOURCE Research and Markets",

    "Nurses in Vietnam: Putting Themselves in Danger to Keep Men Alive": "“In Pleiku, the sound was faint at first, then gradually grew louder; a medevac chopper somewhere in the night sky,” writes Diane Carlson Evans, a former Army Nurse Corps captain and the founder of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, in her book Healing Wounds. “For grunts, the sound was a benevolent god with rotor blades; for nurses, an adrenaline-pumping bird that brought us merciless, soul-harrowing work.”\n\nFor nurses in Vietnam that work occurred in Army field evacuation, surgical and MUST (Medical Unit, Self-contained Transportable) hospitals, on Navy hospital ships and aboard Air Force helicopters and planes. The average age of nurses was 23. About 65 percent had less than two years of experience, and 79 percent were women. They served in both active duty and reserve units. There was a range of tour lengths for nurses, although Army nurses, like other soldiers, served one-year tours.\n\nU.S. Army nurses at the 93rd Evacuation Hospital in Long Binh, near Saigon, in 1968, work to stabilize a patient. Nurses in Vietnam often faced not only intense demands for patient care but also the threat of attacks on close-by military facilities and even the hospitals themselves. (B.J. Greenway Rasmussen Collection, Military Women’s Memorial)\n\nEasy Targets\n\nMedical facilities were frequently near supply depots and airfields—targets for enemy fire, which could come from any direction at any time. Some hospitals suffered significant damage from shelling. Guards were on patrol 24/7, and barbed wire encircled the compounds. Nurses also had to deal with the loss of electricity, a lack of operating tables and shortages of supplies and equipment.\n\nThey responded with resourcefulness and creativity. Tables were constructed with discarded lumber and assorted scrap. Red Cross bags were filled with stones and used as traction weights. Combat nurses were scheduled for a 72-hour week—12 hours a day, six days a week—but after a major firefight with heavy casualties, a nurse’s shift might be 24 hours or longer. Despite all the difficulties, nurse veterans say a high level of camaraderie and the appreciation of their patients kept morale high.\n\nNurses in Vietnam often faced more intense demands for patient care than had been the case in previous wars. The widespread use of UH-1 Huey medevac helicopters enabled more of the severely wounded men to get to a hospital fast, sometimes within half an hour, substantially increasing the workload and pressure on nurses stationed there. Facilities for medical treatment admitted 133, 447 wounded personnel between January 1965 and December 1970, and 97,659 of them were hospitalized.\n\nthis article first appeared in vietnam magazine See more stories SubscriBE NOW! Facebook: @VietnamMag | Twitter: @VietnamMag\n\nThe combination of fast transport and advances in medical care resulted in a survival rate of 98 percent for those reaching a hospital in an hour or less. On average, Vietnam War patients left the hospital sooner than those in World War II and Korea because of the improved medical care. During the Vietnam War, the hospital mortality rate per thousand was 2.6 percent, compared with 4.5 percent during World War II.\n\nFirst Responders\n\nHospital ship USS Repose, which operated mainly in northern South Vietnam, sailed to areas of heavy fighting so helicopters could transport casualties to the ship. (Naval History and Heritage Command)\n\nNurses were among the earliest U.S. service members in Vietnam. The first military women to arrive were Army Nurse Corps Majs. Jane Becker, Francis Smith and her sister, Helen Smith, who landed in Saigon on April 29, 1956, on a temporary duty assignment with U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group’s Medical Training Team. Their task was to train South Vietnamese nurses in medical procedures. In the summer of that year, Navy mobile construction battalions, the Seabees, made their first appearance in Vietnam. Hospitals were put on the Seabees’ to-do list as the American military presence expanded in the early 1960s.\n\nArmy nurses arrived in Vietnam at one of two sites: Tan Son Nhut Air Base near Saigon and Bien Hoa Air Base, about 20 miles outside the city. The Tan Son Nhut arrivals went to the 178th Replacement Company at Saigon’s Camp Alpha. The Bien Hoa arrivals reported to the 90th Replacement Battalion at nearby Long Binh. From those points, it was on to their duty assignments. A variety of buildings were converted into hospitals. Some facilities had been turned over to the Army by the South Vietnamese. Often the acquired spaces were reconfigured into an “X” shape with the nurses in the center, where they could better monitor all the patients.\n\nPrior to 1967, tents were the primary living quarters for nurses. The tents were replaced with Seabee-constructed buildings such as simple living quarters called hooches and Quonset huts. Hooches, like those in the Central Highlands town of Pleiku, were typically made of wooden-framed buildings with window screens. Some Quonset hut residences, prefabricated structures of corrugated metal, had individual rooms. In others, the nurses shared an open bay. When hospitals moved closer to combat operations, the nurses ended up in tents again.\n\nNavy nurses also came to Vietnam early in the war. They served on two hospital ships, USS Sanctuary and USS Repose, and at two land facilities: Station Hospital Saigon and Station Hospital Da Nang.\n\nMedical assistants unload a wounded man from a rescue helicopter onto the Repose in 1966. (Naval History and Heritage Command)\n\nNavy Matter\n\nIn 1963 the Navy assumed responsibility for civilian and military medical activities at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Two members of the Navy Nurse Corps reported in February of that year. They worked at Navy Station Hospital Saigon, a five-story inpatient facility with an operating and emergency area. Four Navy nurses attached to the hospital received Purple Hearts after a Christmas Eve 1963 Viet Cong bombing of the bachelor officers’ quarters, where the nurses were staying. They were the first female members of the U.S. armed forces to earn Purple Hearts during the Vietnam War.\n\nLt. Cmdr. Dorothy Ryan, a Navy nurse, checks on a Marine aboard the Repose in 1966. (Naval History and Heritage Command)\n\nThe Repose arrived in February 1966 and was stationed off the coast of the Hue/Phu Bai area in northern South Vietnam. It served there until March 1970. The Sanctuary reached Vietnam in April 1967 and was stationed at DaNang. The ship’s unofficial motto was, “You find ’em, we bind ’em.” The Sanctuary left Vietnam in April 1971.\n\nIn March 1966 the Navy’s Saigon hospital was transferred to the Army. During its Navy days, more than 6,000 patients were hospitalized. Approximately 130,000 outpatients received treatments. The Navy nurses at the Da Nang hospital served from August 1967 to May 1970, when that hospital was also turned over to the Army. It became the largest casualty treatment center in the world, with 600 beds and 63,000 patient admissions.\n\nIn 1966 the Air Force shipped to Vietnam 400-square-foot containers modified for use as hospitals. Within the next two years, a hospital at Cam Rahn Bay, about 200 miles north of Saigon, was the second largest in the Air Force, with 475 beds and 100 more for a causality staging facility. Ultimately, Cam Rahn Bay evolved into the aeromedical evacuation site for the entire theater.\n\nIn 1968 the Air Force sent the first airplane specifically designed for medevac operations to Vietnam. The aircraft, a McDonnell-Douglas C-9A, was named “Nightingale” to honor Florence Nightingale, the English nurse noted for her work during the 1853-56 Crimean War. The Air Force assigned its first female nurses to Vietnam in 1966, the majority in Cam Rahn Bay. The following year, female flight nurses became part of the medevac crews.\n\nArmy of Care\n\nAs America’s combat forces increased, so did the nursing force. In 1965 the Army had 113 hospital beds and 15 nurses in Southeast Asia. By December 1968, there were 900 nurses in Vietnam working in 23 Army hospitals and one convalescent hospital, totaling 5,283 beds. That year there were 11 Reserve and National Guard medical units in Vietnam.\n\nDuring an 11-year stretch from the opening of the 8th Field Hospital in the central coastlands town of Nha Trang in March 1962 until March 29, 1973, when the last Army nurses departed after the cease-fire that ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, an estimated 11,000 women served there, including not only nurses but also other military women and civilians.\n\nAir Force 2nd. Lt. Kathleen Sullivan comforts a Vietnamese child as part of the military’s Medical Civic Action Program, MEDCAP, which assisted people in villages. (U.S. Air Force))\n\nThe rising demand for nurses in Vietnam put staffing pressures on the Army Nurse Corps, which was simultaneously providing nurses in Europe, Guam, Japan, the Philippines and the United States. A shortfall of 2,000 nurses made recruitment the highest priority for Col. Mildred Clark, chief of the Army Nurse Corps from 1963 to 1967. (Her successor, Col. Anna Mae Hays, who held the position from 1967 to 1971, was promoted to brigadier general on June 11, 1970, making her the first American woman to earn a general officer’s rank.)\n\nWhy Did Women Volunteer to Become Nurses in Vietnam?\n\nNurses volunteered for an array of reasons—including patriotism, a calling to help soldiers in need and a desire for adventure. Reflecting on a 30-year military career in a 2006 interview with American Nurse, Vietnam veteran Mary Jo Rice-Mahoney said: “It provided me the opportunity to travel around the world, learn about different cultures, perform various nursing procedures, make lifelong friends, and live through a combat experience. It’s where my love of nursing began.”\n\nThe C-9 “Nightingale” was staffed with nurses and medical technicians who cared for patients transported from Vietnam to larger hospitals in the Philippines. (U.S. Air Force) (U.S. Air Force)\n\nRice-Mahoney joined the Army Student Nurses Program at St. Joseph’s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in 1968, during her third year in nursing school. She was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Nurse Corps six months before graduation and then reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey. She worked in an orthopedic ward and got what she described in the American Nurse interview as a crash course in “Combat Injuries 101.” In March 1969, Rice-Mahoney was ordered to report to the 67th Evacuation Hospital at Qui Nhon in the central coastal region of South Vietnam.\n\nWhat Did Vietnam War Nurses Do?\n\nAn Air Force crewman seriously injured in the crash of a C-5A Galaxy transport plane on April 4, 1975, is treated at a Saigon hospital.

(AP Photo/Neal Ulevich)\n\nNursing in Vietnam encompassed more than the treatment of combat wounds. As in previous wars, diseases were the most common threat to a service member’s health, accounting for nearly 70 percent of hospital admissions from 1965 to 1969. Diseases such as malaria and hepatitis were frequent. Among the worst injuries were burns. The required treatment was the application of Sulfamylon, a thick cream applied to the affected area. It was reapplied every four to six hours after the previous cream had been removed, a very painful process. A heavy dose of narcotics did not keep many from crying out in pain.\n\nMilitary nurses also treated allied forces, American civilians and Vietnamese men, women and children. In their free time, many visited local villages and their hospitals to participate in U.S.-funded health programs through the Medical Civic Action Program, or MEDCAP.\n\nTime for relaxation was rare. The beaches at Cam Rahn Bay and China Beach in Da Nang were popular gathering spots. Nurses got together for music and dancing, broke the rules by riding in helicopters and airplanes to view the landscape and the South China Sea, attended USO performances featuring popular entertainers and had a one-week furlough for rest and recuperation out of the country. Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand were locations available for R&R.\n\nLEAving Vietnam\n\nThe last Army nurses left Vietnam on March 29, 1973, two months after the cease-fire. However, more service and sacrifice were still to come. On April 4, 1975, as Saigon was about to fall to communist forces, the Air Force conducted Operation Babylift to fly orphans from Vietnam to the Philippines, a stop on their way to the United States for adoption. Air Force Nurse Corps Capt. Mary Klinker and about 130 passengers died when a Babylift C-5 cargo plane experienced a malfunction shortly after taking off from Tan Son Nhut airport and crashed. Klinker was 27.\n\nU.S. Army nurse Sharon Lane, being congratulated upon her promotion to first lieutenant in August 1968, was killed in June 1969 during a Viet Cong rocket attack on the hospital where she worked.

All were nurses—four died in plane or helicopter crashes, one from illness, one from a stroke and one from enemy fire. On June 8, 1969, 25-year-old 1st Lt. Sharon Lane of Canton, Ohio, was killed in a Viet Cong rocket attack on the 312th Evacuation Hospital in Chu Lai in northern South Vietnam.\n\nEvans, author of Healing Wounds, came up with the idea for the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in 1983 and founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Project in 1984. Ten years later her dream was realized. A groundbreaking was held on July 29, 1993, and the memorial was dedicated on Nov. 11, 1993. The centerpiece of the memorial is sculptor Glenna Goodacre’s bronze statue showing three military women with a wounded soldier.\n\nVisitors lay flowers at the memorial, which depicts three women caring for a wounded soldier.

It is positioned about 100 yards from the apex of the V-shaped wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Evans served as president and CEO of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation (her organization’s name since 2002) for more than 30 years.\n\nNurses who came home carried with them experiences and emotions that changed their lives. “I learned so many lessons, but it took me years to put them into words or concrete thoughts,” Janis Nark, a Detroit native who served as an Army nurse in Vietnam 1970-71, said in a 2015 article, “Angels of War,” published on the website of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. “Vietnam hardened me,” she added, but also said, “It heightened my sense of humor. It made me realize what’s important in life, and what isn’t.”\n\nTom Edwards, a Navy veteran who served in Vietnam 1968-69, is a freelance writer/photographer in Forest Lake, Minnesota.

    "Honor Flight shifts to Vietnam veterans amid America’s evolving relationship with the war": "Theirs was an unpopular war, especially at the end. No brass bands welcomed the U.S. service members returning from Vietnam. No parades.\n\nThey came back to a country eager to move on and deeply divided about whether the conflict and the 58,000 American lives lost had been worth it.\n\nThis story is for subscribers We offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nation’s doubts and misgivings got transferred onto the returnees, surrounding them with myths about their inability to hold jobs and stay in marriages. Hollywood depicted them as damaged goods, the ragged remnants of a national failure.\n\nFifty years later, a different kind of reception awaits a group of 85 Vietnam veterans who are taking a trip from San Diego to Washington, D.C., and back later this month.\n\nThe name of the trip captures the shift in sentiment: Honor Flight.\n\n“As a nation, we know that the Vietnam veterans did not get the homecoming they deserved,” said Holly Shaffner, vice-chair and public relations director for Honor Flight San Diego, the nonprofit that is organizing the three-day Sept. 30 trip. “They weren’t treated well and we want to change that.”\n\nAt Miramar National Cemetery on Saturday, Sept. 17, 2022 in San Diego, CA., volunteers made up of active duty sailors, ROTC and Patriot Guard Riders took part in folding 44 U.S. flags. (Nelvin C. Cepeda/The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nHonor Flight started in Ohio in 1985 as a way to say “thank you” to World War II vets. It took them on all-expenses-paid trips to the national capital to see the various monuments, especially the World War II Memorial, which had opened the year before.\n\nThe idea spread to San Diego, which became one of the busiest of the 130 Honor Flight chapters around the country. Since 2010, it has ferried about 1,500 vets to Washington. It typically does two charter trips every year, one in the spring and one in the fall.\n\nSeveral years ago, as the number of living World War II vets dwindled, the local group added Korean War survivors. That roster has been exhausted, too, Shaffner said, and the invitations are now going to Vietnam-era fighters.\n\nThe upcoming trip will be the first one from San Diego devoted entirely to Vietnam vets. A second one is planned for early November.\n\nAt Miramar National Cemetery each flag represents the 44 Seawolves who were KIA from the Vietnam War. (Nelvin C. Cepeda/The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nPeople who have been on the treks say they are about much more than sightseeing. Everywhere the vets go, they get treated as heroes. Spontaneous applause at airports and in hotel lobbies. Requests for autographs and selfies.\n\nThe trips also become an opportunity for reflection and healing. Surrounded by others who saw and did the same things in combat, many of the vets open up for the first time and talk about their experiences. Tears fall.\n\nOrganizers expect it will work that way for Vietnam vets, too, another step in America’s evolving relationship with the war.\n\nLingering tensions, questions\n\nWorld War II is often remembered in the United States as the “good” war. Korea is the “forgotten” war. Vietnam?\n\n“Unsettled” is the word Jerry Lembcke uses.\n\nHe’s an associate professor emeritus in anthropology and sociology at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., and the author of two books about Vietnam. He served in the Army during the war as a chaplain’s assistant. When he got out, he was active in the anti-war movement.\n\nHe uses the word “unsettled” to describe Vietnam because many of the tensions and societal divisions it unleashed in America remain. “The floodwaters recede,” he said, “but they never really go away.”\n\nHe traces a lot of those tensions to the fact that the United States lost the war, which in turn leaves lingering questions about why that happened and who should be blamed.\n\nJerry Lembcke is the author of two books about Vietnam. (Courtesy of Jerry Lembcke)\n\nAmericans supported the war in the beginning, according to Gallup polls. In 1965, six months after President Lyndon Johnson began large-scale U.S. involvement in Vietnam, just 24 percent of those surveyed said it was a mistake to send troops. Sixty percent said it was not a mistake.\n\nA plurality of those surveyed continued to say it was not a mistake until July 1967, and then public opinion soured. In August 1968, for the first time, a majority of Americans believed sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake, and that number kept growing. In 1973, it was 60 percent.\n\nTo returning vets, that unpopularity played out in various ways. Some reported getting spit at, although Lembcke’s 1998 book, “The Spitting Image,” challenges the validity of such incidents and shows how they’ve become an urban legend underwriting another myth: that America lost the war on the home front, not the battlefield.\n\nMost vets came home without experiencing hostility and got on with their lives, according to Lembcke. “They went back to work, back to the farm, went to school on the GI Bill,” he said. “They put the war behind them.”\n\nThat’s what Gary Ely did after serving in the Navy Seawolves, a helicopter squadron. The Lakeside resident was in Vietnam from January 1970 to August 1971.\n\nWhen he came home, he still had 18 months to go in the Navy and was sent to a squadron stationed in Imperial Beach. After his Navy stint, he worked in an aviation depot at North Island for 35 years.\n\n“I never got spit on or anything like that, but my exposure to the negative stuff was limited because I was still on active duty,” he said.\n\nBut he knew the war was unpopular. “We all did,” he said.\n\nVisiting the wall\n\nEly, 73, is one of the veterans headed to Washington on the Honor Flight. All the seats have been reserved for Navy HA(L)-3 Seawolves, a decision the organizers made that reflects the desire to heal the festering wounds of Vietnam.\n\n“We wanted to go big and go with a unique group that deserved it,” Shaffner said. In a similar vein, the November Honor Flight will be for decorated veterans, those whose service in Vietnam earned them a Purple Heart or higher.\n\nThe Seawolves flew more than 130,000 hours of combat and logistical support during the war, much of it in the Mekong Delta. It was the only active-duty helicopter gunship squadron in the history of Naval aviation, according to a Congressional Resolution adopted in 2010.\n\nGary Ely sits in a helicopter at the USS Midway Museum, where he is a volunteer. (Courtesy of Holly Shaffner)\n\nIts members earned five Navy Crosses, 31 Silver Stars, 156 Purple Hearts, 101 Bronze Stars and 219 Distinguished Flying Crosses, making it one of the most decorated units in Navy aviation history.\n\nAll that came with a cost: 44 Seawolves killed in action and more than 200 wounded.\n\nSome 2,500 people — pilots, door gunners, mechanics and others — served in the squadron from 1966 to 1972. Many of them belong to the Seawolf Association, started in 1987. It holds reunions and funds scholarships.\n\nEly said spending time with other Seawolves is the main reason he’s going on the Honor Flight.\n\n“It will be nice to see the memorials,” he said, “but it’s really about being with them.”\n\nThe trip will include a stop at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where the names of those killed in the war are etched into a long, V-shaped wall of black granite. People who go there often make pencil rubbings of the names.\n\nHonor Flight plans to do rubbings of the names of the 44 slain Seawolves while the group is at the memorial, Shaffner said. Also on hand will be 44 American flags that have flown at Miramar National Cemetery and were recently donated to Honor Flight for the trip.\n\nEly has visited the Vietnam wall before, on work trips to Washington. “I always get a lump in my throat,” he said. “Just the sheer size of it, all those names, is overwhelming.”\n\nHe said it will be nice if the group gets the typical Honor Flight treatment — the applause, the photos, the adulation — but he’s not looking for recognition.\n\nAt Miramar National Cemetery volunteers made up of active duty sailors, ROTC and Patriot Guard Riders took part in folding 44 U.S. flags. Each flag represented the 44 Seawolves who were KIA from the Vietnam War. (Nelvin C. Cepeda/The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\n“I’m not the type of guy who thinks this is overdue,” he said. “I take things one day a time. I try not to beat my own drum over it.”\n\nThere are 60,000 Vietnam War veterans living in San Diego, according to Honor Flight. Anyone interested in a future trip can fill out an application through the group’s website, honorflightsandiego.org.",
    "The Vietnam War from the perspectives of 2 American veterans, as told to Columbia audience": "Two people who had very different experiences of the Vietnam War shared their stories Wednesday with a Columbia audience at the Holiday Inn Executive Center.\n\nThe National Stars and Stripes Museum and Library in Bloomfield sponsored the event. Several veterans, active-duty military and ROTC cadets were in the crowd.\n\nFirst up was Wayne Wallingford, a former B-52 pilot during the war, a former state senator and the current director of the Missouri Department of Revenue. He's a retired Air Force colonel.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you what it was like from 35,000 feet, and Col. Clark will tell you what it was like at ground level,\" Wallingford said, referring to the other speaker, John Clark.\n\nWallingford flew missions during 11 days of bombing of North Vietnam at the end of 1972, to convince the North Vietnamese to negotiate.\n\n\"It was the largest B-52 commitment during the war,\" Wallingford said. \"It rained destruction on North Vietnam during those 11 days.\"\n\nNorth Vietnam was heavily defended, he said.\n\n\"No one thought the B-52s would be able to survive flying in such a densely defended target area as that,\" Wallingford said.\n\nSeveral of the bombers were lost, he said.\n\nThe B-52 was a \"flying bomb,\" Wallingford said. It had 312,000 pounds of fuel and 70,000 pounds of bombs.\n\n\"You get hit by a surface-to-air missile, and your odds aren't good,\" Wallingford said.\n\nHis plane did get hit during a sortie but survived, he said.\n\nThe North Vietnamese ran out of missiles, and they couldn't be resupplied because the infrastructure had been destroyed, he said.\n\n\"We had the North Vietnamese at their knees,\" he said.\n\nNorth Vietnam returned to the negotiations, and the war was over by late January, with 591 American prisoners of war returned home by March, including Clark.\n\n\"Now you have heard from the rescuer, and I will give you a little bit what it was like to be rescued,\" said Clark, of Columbia. He's also a retired Air Force colonel.\n\nAfter nearly six years, he was tired of being a prisoner of war, he said.\n\nTheir prison camp was in the center of Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.\n\n\"One of the discussions that persisted was between the pessimists and the optimists\" among the prisoners, he said.\n\nIf there was a tiny piece of pork in their \"sewer grass soup,\" he said the optimists thought they were being fattened to go home.\n\nAnother discussion was whether our country would negotiate for their release during peace talks or if they would be tried as war criminals and executed.\n\n\"The argument of the pessimists was we were just a big liability,\" he said.\n\nBeing what he termed a \"logical realist,\" Clark said he thought that his country wouldn't allow them to be forgotten.\n\nIt was winter 1972, but they didn't keep track of dates.\n\n\"The ground one day jiggled like a bowl of Jell-O,\" he said.\n\nThere were aftershocks. An earthquake?\n\n\"It was kind of a mystery to us,\" he said. \"But then we heard the thunder.\"\n\nThe sky was clear.\n\n\"Holy cow, nothing could do that but our BUFFs, our B-52s,\" Clark said.\n\nThe response was immediate.\n\n\"When the B-52s came to town, Hanoi just erupted like a volcano\" with anti-aircraft missiles, Clark said.\n\nThe prisoners watched the bedlam over the next 11 days with glee, he said.\n\nSome pilots flew the bombers low over the prison, causing prisoners to cheer.\n\nBy early 1973, he and the other prisoners were released and they headed back home, he said.\n\nThere must be an accounting of those still missing, he said.\n\nRoger McKinney is the education reporter for the Tribune.

    "WIPO wants to establish Vietnam Intellectual Property Training Institute": "Deputy General Director of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Hasan Kleib.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the trip, the WIPO official discussed with Vietnamese officials specific programs and activities to strengthen mutual cooperation and WIPO’s support to Vietnam in the use of intellectual property as a tool to promote innovation.\n\nAt the meeting with representatives of the National Office of Intellectual Property (Ministry of Science and Technology), he said that he was impressed with Vietnam's economic growth, especially in the context of the pandemic.\n\nVietnam ranks first in the group of 34 low-middle-income countries in the Global Innovation Index (GII). It is also the first country to apply and convert the global innovation index into the provincial innovation index.\n\nTo promote the development of intellectual property, he recommended that Vietnam pay attention to three target groups, including young people, women and small and medium sized enterprises.\n\nThe group of small and medium enterprises accounts for 98% of the total number of enterprises in Vietnam. This rate is higher than the average for developing countries (95%). The WIPO representative said that intellectual property is closely related to the development of small and medium enterprises.\n\nBesides patents, intellectual property is also significant in protecting trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications of products. Raising awareness of intellectual property is therefore very important for businesses, especially small and medium enterprises.\n\nFor the remaining two target groups, Vietnam currently has 25% of the population aged 15-30, while more than 60% of Vietnam's small and medium enterprises are owned by women. Therefore, these are two groups that need special awareness of intellectual property.\n\nWIPO will support Vietnam in using intellectual property as a tool to promote innovation. To do that, WIPO wants to establish a training institute on intellectual property in Vietnam.\n\nCurrently, WIPO has 12 similar facilities in the world. In Vietnam, WIPO will support the operation of this institute in the early years, then completely transfer it to the host country and be ready to advise if there is a request.\n\nThe WIPO Deputy General Director also signed a Memorandum of Understanding and launched the Intellectual Property Training Program for diplomats and trade negotiators.\n\nTrong Dat",

Go Vap Townhouse - Unique and impressive design - A house is \"mix and match\" unique, showing off impressive and outstanding spatial lines. Possessing the characteristics of the open design trend, Go Vap Townhouse has the ability to self-regulate the air and create a multi-space connection, bringing a liberal and inspiring beauty to the owner. Instead of pouring walls like other normal houses, the architect chose a design that makes use of flexible mirror tiles. Making a house with a ground floor and two floors is like putting on a shiny, sparkling shirt while still keeping the modern and trendy space. It is difficult to fully understand the uniqueness of the house from the outside. However, this is also a distinct attraction of the Go Vap Townhouse space.\n\nVentilation holes in the façade and skylights inside and outside have the effect of air conditioning, it also increases ventilation for the whole space. More than that, the essence of the Zen style makes the house quieter, more comfortable, and more private. A bit of interior minimalism in Minimalism cleverly combines with the green nature of traditional Japanese interiors to bring an overall Go Vap townhouse with simple and elegant beauty. The highlight of the house is the interference of the color pair between the ceiling and the wall to create a cool and harmonious open space. Besides, with the west-facing facade, the design becomes sparkling and outstanding in the late afternoon. At night, the light from the lamp system cleverly penetrates through the glass walls, making the space brighter and clearer.\n\nThe apartment architecture with 3 separate floors, supports the needs of flexible users and solves the problem of space. Setting up individual properties for each floor is an option to optimize the function and utility of the house. The ground floor is the most commonly used and shared living space. Here, the architect designed a small bar to separate the living and dining areas. Family members can enjoy the evening gathering in the dining area, entertain, party in the empty yard or host friends, and relatives, or do business with partners in the living room. Without using partitions and taking advantage of natural light, the house feels wrapped in warmth.\n\nWith the need to enjoy life and entertainment with family. The mezzanine space will make you unable to take your eyes off. The cozy design is extremely airy, using a lot of green space and optimizing the types of furniture that take up a lot of space. This floor is divided to set up the resort and play area for the family. With harmonious and elegant colors, the rooms are built with just enough privacy and feel closeness and intimacy.\n\nThe top floor is the most ventilated area. This will include a laundry and drying area. In addition, this highest floor space is designed with a skylight above the ceiling. The skylight is designed in a circular shape, clad in glass to expand the view, and suitable for relaxation. The owner describes this space as extremely optimal if you want to enjoy a private, quiet space and perfectly suitable for stargazing. Prioritizing comfort and privacy for family members, each floor and room has its own toilet. More specifically, every corner of the space has a modern sound with a uniform aesthetic beauty.\n\nAccording to the architect, the structure is the perfect connection between light, natural wind and trees. All create a sophisticated overall space, emphasizing simplicity but still ensuring comfort and freshness for the house.

He asked the country to continue advocating Vietnam’s candidacy for a seat in the UN Human Rights Council for 2023 - 2025.At another meeting, the Vietnamese official and Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi highly valued the vigorous growth in the two countries’ strategic partnership as seen in flexibly maintained meetings at all levels and great strides in economic and trade links.They agreed to step up all-level delegation exchanges, especially when the countries mark the 10th anniversary of their strategic partnership in 2023, effectively implement the action plan for 2019 - 2023, and prepare to build another for 2024 - 2028.The two officials also exchanged views on some regional and international issues of common concern. They reaffirmed the support for the maintenance of ASEAN’s solidarity and principles agreed upon on the East Sea issue, as well as for the compliance with international law and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).Deputy PM Minh underlined Vietnam’s support for Indonesia to successfully hold the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2023.Talking to US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Minh expressed his delight at the progress in the Vietnam - US comprehensive partnership, recommending the two sides further increase discussions and dialogues at all levels and strengthen ties in all fields to substantively develop bilateral relations.He also called on the US to continue assisting Vietnam in war aftermath settlement, digital transformation, energy transition, and climate change response.Sherman said the comprehensive partnership has been flourishing, noting meetings and delegation exchanges have been resumed to help sustain momentum for their ties.She highly valued the Vietnamese Government’s efforts in digital transformation, energy transition, and engagement in the discussion of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. The official also affirmed the her country's commitment to continue helping Vietnam with climate change response and war aftermath settlement.At a reception for US Ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Cindy McCain, Deputy PM Minh appreciated tireless efforts by her husband - late Senator John McCain, who joined generations of the countries’ leaders to turn the two former foes into comprehensive partners of each other.He emphasised that efforts by John and Cindy McCain have helped turn the cooperation in war aftermath settlement into a bright spot in bilateral relations, promote reconciliation, built up trust between the two countries, and opened up many cooperation chances in other areas.Cindy McCain expressed her pride to join her husband in contributing to the growth of bilateral relations.As the US Ambassador to FAO, she applauded Vietnam’s achievements in agricultural development, climate change response, and water resource security ensuring in the Mekong Delta. She also called on Vietnam to share agricultural development experience with the international community./.",
    "China stokes encirclement fear in next-door Vietnam": "With a 3,200-kilometer coastline, it would seemingly be hard to feel claustrophobic. But Vietnam, which has skirmished with China for decades over contested borderlands and disputed territory in the South China Sea, now faces the prospect of being encircled by its giant northern neighbor.\n\nFor millennia, Vietnam has been aggressed from the north by China across their shared 1,297-kilometer border. The last war the two historical adversaries fought in the 1980s, the so-called Third Indochina War, saw Chinese forces launch numerous border incursions.\n\nTo Vietnam’s east, China has occupied the Paracel Islands for decades and has militarized an estimated seven features in the South China Sea. Altercations between their fishing vessels and maritime militia in the sea are frequent and common.\n\nHanoi argues that Beijing is salami-slicing its way to controlling the entire sea area. Its latest Defense White Paper, released in 2019, stated that “great-power competition is getting increasingly tense” while the South China Sea could become a “flashpoint.”\n\nPotentially worse for Vietnam are persistent reports that Cambodia, its western neighbor, might allow China to station troops at its Ream Naval Base, which opens into the Gulf of Thailand and could potentially provide China a southern flank on the South China Sea.\n\nEven if that doesn’t mean a permanent Chinese military presence – which Phnom Penh adamantly insists there won’t be – a small rotational posting could be used by Beijing for surveillance of Vietnam’s naval forces, most of which are based nearby.\n\nAny Chinese military presence in Cambodia or Laos, another Beijing ally, would leave Vietnam threatened from the west and south.\n\nImage: Twitter / VOA\n\n“Beijing’s attempts to woo Vietnam’s neighbors, Cambodia and Laos, with economic rewards are as dangerous to Hanoi as its destabilizing actions in the [South China Sea],” Khang Vu, a doctoral candidate in the Political Science Department at Boston College, recently wrote in regional media.\n\n“Vietnam being encircled by China on four fronts only means one thing, which is that China is posing a comprehensive threat to Vietnam on both land and sea,” he told Asia Times.\n\nVu says Vietnam has two choices to break this emerging encirclement. Either it has to seek stronger defense cooperation with the US, Japan and India, or it can increase its own military power without formal alliances to ensure that “China does not pose a threat to its survival.”\n\nAlthough the US Navy is no stranger to Vietnam’s ports, Hanoi has so far avoided any direct military alliance with any partner. Both sides were poised to upgrade relations to a “strategic partnership” in 2019 but failed to follow through. In part, that’s because of Vietnam’s historic “three no’s” policy, which was recently expanded to “four no’s.”\n\nThe latest Defense White Paper states that “Vietnam consistently advocates neither joining any military alliances, siding with one country against another, giving any other countries permission to set up military bases or use its territory to carry our military activities against other countries nor using force or threatening to use in international relations.”\n\nBut the same White Paper added an important caveat: “Depending on circumstances and specific conditions, Vietnam will consider developing, necessary, appropriate defense and military relations with other countries.”\n\nDerek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, argued earlier this year that “Hanoi’s non-aligned foreign policy since the end of the Cold War means China might attack without fear of reprisal from stronger nations.”\n\nA Vietnamese soldier keeps watch in front of US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson after its arrival at a port in Danang, Vietnam March 5, 2018. Photo: Agencies\n\nDue to its “four no’s” policy, Vietnam is likely to adopt the second option of armed neutrality, said Vu.\n\n“Vietnamese political and military leaders are well aware of China’s military strength and growing technological prowess,” said Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia. “They adopt a sanguine view of their strategic position; in other words, China’s so-called encirclement of Vietnam presents both opportunities and challenges.”\n\nIn February 2021, Thayer noted, the ruling Communist Party approved a resolution to initiate “Vietnam’s most ambitious and far-reaching program to modernize its armed forces.”\n\nIt called for the creation of a “compact and strong” Vietnam People’s Army by 2025, as well as the modernization of certain parts of the armed forces by 2030. Modernization of the rest of the military would take place afterward.\n\nVietnam will face two major challenges in meeting these goals, analysts say. First, it has to maintain high economic growth to finance its arms procurements, especially those that involved advanced technologies.\n\nVietnam’s military spending dipped from 7.9% of GDP in 1990, at the end of its last war with China, to around 2.3% in the late 2010s, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn real terms, however, it spent US$5.7 billion on defense in 2018, up from $3.6 billion in 2010, according to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.\n\nBut Hanoi has more recently committed to reducing state expenditures due to concerns about its mounting debt. That broad budgetary belt-tightening will present difficult choices for Hanoi in allocating its future defense spending.\n\nEven if it was to spend around 3% of GDP on defense (or around $6.3 billion a year), that would only represent 2.5% of what China currently spends on its military annually.\n\nSecond, it will need to tread carefully to avoid US sanctions if it decides to continue procuring arms from Russia, its principal provider of military equipment dating back to the Cold War.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2021, Vietnam’s arms imports totaled $9.07 billion, of which Russia accounted for $7.4 billion, or 81.6% of the total, according to SIPRI.\n\nSoldiers marching during a celebration to mark National Day at Ba Dinh square in Hanoi.

For decades, Vietnamese defense policy has centered chiefly on the sea.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of Vietnamese defense ministry debates, there is now growing recognition that Vietnam needs to partially shift its focus away from maritime to land defense.\n\nIn early 2021, reports surfaced that China was building a surface-to-air missile base 20 kilometers from its border with Vietnam.\n\nTaking effect in January, China’s new land border law seeks to strengthen its border control and protection. Beijing will “resolutely defend territorial sovereignty and land border security,” it states. Analysts, however, foresee a muscular bid by China to resolve border disputes on its preferred terms.\n\nFrom Vietnam’s perspective, much will come down to Cambodia and Laos. According to some commentators, Vietnam has “lost” its former ally in Cambodia.\n\nVietnam’s military support in 1979 to overthrow Cambodia’s genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, a Beijing ally, sparked the Third Indochina War. Cambodia remained resolutely pro-Vietnam until the early 2000s when Beijing began to develop ties with Phnom Penh.\n\n“Vietnam’s post-Cold War reorientation toward the [South China Sea] is based on the premise that its land borders are already secured. But China’s moves to win Laos and Cambodia to its side should shift its focus back landward,” Vu has argued.\n\nHanoi is ramping up engagement with its western neighbors. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc signed new cooperation deals on security and national defense during a meeting last December.\n\n“The two sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in defense and security based on the principle of not allowing any hostile forces to use their respective territories to harm the other’s security,” the two leaders said in a joint statement.\n\nIn May this year, Tea Banh and Phan Van Giang, the defense ministers of Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, held their first border defense friendship exchange in Hanoi.\n\nVietnam has also increased its investment in Cambodia and bilateral trade stood at nearly $9 billion last year, marking an 80% rise compared to 2020. Cambodia’s trade with China was worth $11 billion last year.\n\nSimilarly, Vietnam is also busy reforming relations with Laos, another of its historic allies. Hanoi has pledged funds to build new infrastructure projects in the landlocked state, including a proposed railway that would connect Vientiane with Vietnam’s port city of Vung Ang.\n\nRefreshing ties with Cambodia and Laos are key to Vietnam’s new emerging security approach, analysts say. Hanoi and Beijing’s contest over influence in Phnom Penh and Vientiane could define mainland Southeast Asian geopolitics in the years to come, some say.\n\n“The so-called encirclement thesis posits that China and Vietnam view each other as adversaries at best and enemies at worst, leaving Vietnam little option but to align with the United States. The situation is far more complex,” Thayer said.\n\nVietnamese and Chinese communist youths wave flags to welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong at a meeting in Hanoi on November 6, 2015.

Armed neutrality seems to be the better option in this case,” Vu added.\n\nFollow David Hutt on Twitter at @davidhuttjourno",
