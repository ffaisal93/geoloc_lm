    "Netherlands vs. Belgium": "Captain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat neighbours Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to clinch top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year's finals tournament.\n\nVan Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nThey finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so.\n\nAny hopes of a goal feast were quickly stymied, however, as the two sides effectively cancelled each other out in a tight tactical battle.\n\nThe Dutch pressing game frustrated Belgian efforts at building up attacks, while a five-man defence for the visitors meant there was little room for the home strikers.\n\nIt meant the winner came from a simple set piece with Van Dijk leaping over his marker, the 18-year-old Zeno Debast, to give Louis van Gaal his 37th victory in his three spells in charge of the national side, equalling the record for a Dutch coach held by Dick Advocaat.\n\nBelgium, whose own coach Roberto Martinez had to sit in the stands after being given a red card at the end of last week's win over Wales, had a chance for a perfect start after only four minutes, with Eden Hazard set up by Amadou Onana only to blast his shot wide.\n\nThere were other first-half chances for Michy Batshauyi, Axel Witsel, Timothy Castagne and Onana as Belgium had the better of the half's opportunities while their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was largely untroubled.\n\nThe Dutch improved after a pair of half-time changes and Denzel Dumfries, Steven Bergwijn and Davy Klaassen were all thwarted as the home side began to find more room and Belgium lived dangerously at the back in the last stages of the game.\n\nBelgium might well have forced a draw as a spectacular effort from substitute Dodi Lukebakio came within inches of a last gasp equaliser with the final kick of the game.\n\n\"We wanted to win but it wasn't a great game. We could have done better but we also had to work hard against a team with a lot of quality players. But winning was the most important,\" Van Dijk said after the match.",

    "Is the next pandemic brewing on the Netherlands’ poultry farms?": "Poultry farming in the Netherlands is concentrated in the southeast, a rural appendage of the oddly shaped country sandwiched between Belgium and Germany. It’s part of the Dutch “Bible Belt,” and both more religious and more Catholic than the rest of the nation—factors involved in it being the region of the country most heavily struck by COVID in early 2020, as Carnival celebrations in February and, later, church services became superspreader events.\n\nDuring World War II, the south was liberated from German occupation sooner than the rest of the country, as the Allied Operation Market Garden freed villages and towns in the Netherlands but failed to cross the Waal River, an extension of the Rhine, and drive on into Germany in the autumn of 1944. Outside Ysselsteyn in January, 20 kilometers from the German border and two kilometers from a cemetery of German war dead, a man hosed down a driveway at the Jenniskens Turkey Farm. The Dutch government doesn’t name farms where outbreaks occur, but a December 20 outbreak announcement had indicated a turkey farm, and the Jenniskens address is at the center of its map of the quarantine area that had resulted. The family’s Christmas lights were still up. Across the street, an egret stood in drenched fields.\n\nThe man in the drive declined an interview, and current regulations proscribe visiting farms, to prevent the spread of HPAI when humans step on infected droppings and carry them to another farm, or to the wild.\n\nDutch poultry farmers are now paying seven times as much for insurance as they were last year, because of all the culls, according to Jan Verhoijsen of LTO Nederland, the Dutch agricultural trade association. “We have had a lot of flu this year, and it costs a lot of money, but we don’t want to have the problem that people get sick,” he says. “So consumption stays on a normal level, and that for us is more important—better to pay more than the problem is going over to our consumer.”\n\nBeerens and Stegeman praised Dutch farmers’ biosecurity practices, such as maintaining a tray of disinfectant liquid which anyone entering a farm or barn must first step through and disinfecting the wheels of vehicles entering or leaving the farm. Each farm must undergo a biosecurity check at the beginning of autumn, regardless of whether an outbreak is already underway. Indeed, instances of transmission between farms have been few this season.\n\nA veterinarian by training, Stegeman would like to see prophylactic measures go further, such as designing farmyards so they’re unattractive to wild birds—by, for example, filling in ponds and cleaning up loose straw—and requiring workers to change clothes on the way in, like the scientists at a BSL 4 lab. Researchers are investigating new methods to prevent or limit outbreaks, including lasers that discourage wild birds from flying over farms and improved air filters at poultry facilities. “The big difficulty for biosecurity is that it has to be 24-7-365,” Stegeman says. “You can’t fail once.”\n\nThe Dutch expert group noted that reducing farm density and the number of animals raised on each farm would ameliorate zoonotic risk. “Spreading out these farms geographically and making farms smaller, that should reduce the likelihood of zoonosis,” Stegeman says. That land-use change could be managed through policy, and ideally new farms would be placed in less water-rich areas and hence away from large congregations of wild birds. But Verhoijsen dismisses these ideas, citing the low level of between-farm transmission as evidence that intensive poultry farming is not the prime contributor to HPAI spread. (In August, though, it was found on a farm within 10 kilometers of 235 other poultry farms, a situation that the Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality at the time, Henk Staghouwer, reportedly called “extremely worrying.” Within two weeks, two farms inside the 10-kilometer quarantine zone were stricken.)\n\n“It's the wild birds that fly in the air, that is what we think makes the biggest problems,” he says. “Our government wants more and more nature, and more water where birds can live, but we say that is also getting more risk for bird flu for our farmers.”\n\nUltimately, as Kuiken suggested, the only solution may be for everyone to just eat less poultry and fewer eggs. Even that might not be enough now that HPAI might be endemic in wild birds, according to EFSA. “Reassortment events will continue and zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses cannot be fully excluded in general when avian influenza viruses are present in birds,” EFSA noted in a March report.\n\nMeanwhile, swine can host both human and avian flu viruses, making them a vessel for dangerous reassortment, and influenza is now endemic in Dutch pig barns because of the high rate of production of piglets; researchers worried when 18 people in Ohio and Michigan became ill from H3N2 in 2016, and early information seemed to indicate person-to-person transmission, though it was later ruled out. The Netherlands conducts almost no surveillance of swine flu.\n\nAmerican and European officials assert that their inspection and culling programs are sufficient to keep HPAI-infected poultry out of the food supply, and that people won’t become ill from eating properly prepared poultry, anyway. But in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, programs to reimburse chicken farmers for culling flocks when bird flu is detected simply don’t exist. So they sell their sick birds, still living, for consumption.",

    "High-level FSO Safer Side Event Co-hosted by the Netherlands, the United States and Germany: Funding Gap Closed for First Stage of Salvage Operation": "The high-level side event at the United Nations General Assembly Week, co-hosted by the Netherlands, the United States and Germany, honoured the joint effort with the UN to prevent a looming environmental disaster with severe humanitarian and economic costs. To prevent this catastrophe the UN has coordinated – in close consultation with Yemeni parties – an operational plan. The estimated budget for the two-track plan is $113 million, of which $75 million is required to start the first phase of the operation (emergency operation). The United States, the UN, and the Netherlands partnered in April 2022 to launch an intensive awareness-raising campaign. Since the pledging conference in May 2022 – jointly organized by the Government of the Netherlands and the UN – many donors have pledged generously. At the high-level side event, we reached an important milestone as we have closed the funding gap for the emergency operation. The co-hosts are the biggest donors backing the UN-led plan, with 15 million Euros from the Netherlands, 12 million Euros from Germany and $10 million from the United States, followed by Saudi Arabia ($10 million) and the United Kingdom ($7.5 million). The co-hosts will continue their outreach to mobilize the funding needed to finalize the operation.\n\nMinister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands Liesje Schreinemacher: “Normally, as minister, it is my job to deal with the repercussions of disasters. But in this instance, we have a chance to prevent a disaster. The Safer is a ticking timebomb. We need swift action. It is encouraging that so many countries have pledged their financial support. Thanks in part to the Netherlands’ contribution we now have the necessary funds to start salvaging the vessel.”\n\nU.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking: “We are proud that the United States pledged $10 million for the UN Safer project. Our contribution stands alongside contributions from a range of countries, organizations, and individuals across the globe, representing a broad coalition of partners that understands the importance of preventing an economic and environmental catastrophe in the Red Sea.”\n\nDirector General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Peace Building and Humanitarian Assistance of the German Federal Foreign Office Deike Potzel: “Thanks to our continued joint efforts, we have a rare opportunity here, to tell a story not often told: the story of how we prevented a catastrophe! With its contribution of 12 million, Germany significantly contributes to this accomplishment. If all parties to the conflict stick to the agreement made to rescue the FSO Safer and the operation is successful, the FSO Safer can go from being a symbol of impending disaster to a beacon of hope for Yemen!”\n\nThanks to the mobilization and financial support of donor countries from the region and from all over the world, the operation is expected to start soon. It is now crucial that the donors swiftly disburse their contributions to allow UNDP, the UN organization coordinating the implementation, to sign all necessary contracts.\n\nIn New York, the UN gave insights into the operational plan: first transferring the oil into a safe vessel (Phase I), before installing a permanent storage solution and scrapping the Safer (Phase II). Phase II requires an additional $38 million. The co-hosts will continue their efforts and urge additional pledges in particular from the private sector to fulfil Phase II.",
    "What A Typical Breakfast Looks Like In The Netherlands": "What A Typical Breakfast Looks Like In The Netherlands\n\nEach morning, we leave dreamland behind us, then wake up and resume our daily activities. And one thing to look forward to each morning is the beloved breakfast, which is not called \"the most important meal of the day\" without a good reason. When eaten regularly, breakfast helps with weight management, reduces the risk of heart disease, and improves our energy levels throughout the day (via Better Health). However, Kitchen Infinity says that one in five Americans skip breakfast each day, which is not that bad, but if you're that one person that doesn't eat breakfast, you might need to reconsider your options.\n\nAnd although there are many different breakfast foods around the world, let's zero in on one specific country — the Netherlands. The country of Gouda cheese, great dams, and clogs takes pride in its food, from breakfast to dinner. Evening meals usually start early, around five in the afternoon (via Amsterdam Canal Cruises). The Dutch like to eat veggies, and stews before they go to sleep. But breakfast is quite different, so let's check out what a typical Dutch morning meal looks like.",
    "Holland or Netherlands: how should we refer to the ‘Oranje’ soccer team?": "The Netherlands national football team have been a fixture on the international stage for decades, participating in 10 World Cup and 10 European Championships, winning the continental competition in 1988 and reaching the final of the global tournament three times, in 1974, 1978 and 2010. The Oranje have been represented by some of the finest players ever to lace up a pair of boots, from Eddy de Neve, Abe Lentra and Faas Wilkes to Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Marco van Basten, Dennis Bergkamp and Robin van Persie.\n\nBut there is some confusion as to the correct name for the national side. The Dutch national team are commonly known as the Netherlands or Holland: is one more correct than the other? In reality, both names are used as often as the other. On the Netherlands’ official tourism website, both Holland and the Dutch national team are used liberally to refer to the Oranje.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Holland and the Netherlands?\n\nBefore unification of the Republic of Seven United Netherlands, or the Dutch Republic, as the Batavian Republic under French dominion in 1795, when Napoleon’s troops invaded, the Netherlands was not a kingdom. This changed when William I, the Prince of Orange, returned to the country in 1813 to fill the void after Napoleon’s brother, Louis, was forced to abdicate. William I created a United Netherlands as a kingdom, but the southern regions opposed unification and gained independence in 1830 as Belgium. The Dutch national team’s nickname, Oranje, comes from the House of Orange-Nassau, of which William I was a scion and which remains the reigning royal house in the Netherlands to this date.\n\nThe word Netherlands in Dutch literally means “low countries,” and is sometimes also used to refer to the wider association of the Benelux nations – Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nThe term Holland historically only refers to two of the Netherlands’ 12 provinces, Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland, but as these were traditionally the source of most of the country’s wealth and economic output, it became commonplace to use the term Holland to refer to the whole country.",

    "Netherlands Received Almost 17k Study Permit Applications Until July 2022": "A total of 16,630 applications for a student permit have been filed in the Netherlands up until July this year, and about 10,000 of the student applicants collected their approved residence permits at The Hague University of Applied Sciences two Saturdays ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND), which is the institute responsible for issuing residence permits to foreigners living in the Netherlands, thousands of students collected their residence permits on September 17, while a second group was scheduled to obtain their residence permits on the following Saturday, September 24.\n\n“This year, 16,630 applications for a student permit were submitted to the IND up until July. This is an increase compared to 2021. Especially students from China, India, and America come to the Netherlands to study,” the press release points out.\n\nIt further notes that the reason why the permits have been collected at the Hague University of Applied Sciences is that the latter has volunteered to facilitate the central issuance of these documents at its main location, close to NS Train Station Hollands Spoor. The university has offered enough facilities and has made sure that the distribution of approved student residence permits runs smoothly.\n\nAccording to the team leader of Registrations and International Office at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, Marlies Rexwinkel, the university knows from experience that it takes time and energy for students to get familiar with how everything works in the Netherlands.\n\nShe adds that being able to collect their residence permit quickly enables them to focus on their studies instead of bureaucratic procedures, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n“After all, that is why they are here. If this allows us to help as many international students as possible start to their time here in the Netherlands smoothly, we are happy to play our part,” she says.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Merel Hekker, IND services manager, also says that the central issuance of residence permits has enabled the agency to deploy its staff as effectively as possible in order to avoid students waiting for months for their residence permits.\n\nTo organize the distribution of the approved study permits, 26 educational institutions have worked together closely with the IND, each of which has been individually responsible for distributing the residence permits of students enrolled with them.\n\nBack in April, Nuffic, the Dutch organization for internationalization in education, published a report called “Incoming degree mobility in Dutch higher education 2021-22,” according to which the number of international students enrolled in Dutch higher education institutions increased by 12 per cent for the 2021/2022 academic year, reaching a total of 115,068.\n\nThe majority of students were from Germany (24,500), Italy (7,200), Romania (5,600), China (5,300), Belgium (4,797), Spain (4,687), Bulgaria (4,607) and France (4,294).\n\nOn the other hand, the Netherlands marked a drop in the number of students from the United Kingdom by receiving 25 per cent fewer students than the year before.\n\n>> University of Amsterdam Tells Int’l Students to Secure Housing Before Travelling to the Netherlands",
    "Netherlands is heating up twice as fast as global average: KNMI researcher": "The temperature in the Netherlands is continuing to warm up. In the future, the hottest days could even increase up to four times faster than the global average, a climate researcher told Het Parool.\n\nGerard van der Schrier, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), told the paper that the Netherlands is currently heating up twice as fast as the global average, \"mainly because we have so much sun.\"\n\nThis warming can also worsen droughts, such as the one the Netherlands experienced this summer. However, this year's drought was a \"matter of chance\" and not a byproduct of climate change, said Peter Siegmund, another KNMI researcher.\n\nAround the world, oceans are warming up and the weather is becoming wetter. But this is not evenly spread across the globe, Siegmund explained. As a result, some areas are actually becoming drier. The forecast for the Netherlands largely depends on the amount of fossil fuels people continue to burn, Siegmund said.\n\n\"We expect it to become sunnier and drier in the future, especially in the summer, while the winters are slightly warmer and wetter,\" Siegmund said. “Southern Europe is expected to be drier, Northern Europe wetter, and we are somewhere in between.\"\n\nThe KNMI researcher called Amsterdam \"the new Paris\" based on historical data. The Dutch capital currently sees the average annual temperature that the French capital had 50 years prior. \"In spring, the temperature in Amsterdam can even be compared to that in Nice in the 1970s,\" Siegmund said.",

    "Netherlands springs from nowhere to emerge as China's biggest gasoil buyer in Aug": "China's exports of rare gasoil cargoes to the Netherlands in August marked record-high shipments to Europe, as the arbitrage sales window was opened amid a rapid gas-to-oil switching trend in the West, industry and trading sources said over Sept. 20-21, citing latest data from China's General Administration of Customs.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe August exports of 257,000 mt, or around 1.93 million barrels of gasoil to the Netherlands, surpassed the previous record of 223,000 mt in March 2020, customs data showed, placing the Dutch state as the top destination for China's gasoil exports.\n\nAugust shipments from China also accounted for 31% of the total 829,000 mt of the middle distillate products exported over the same month, customs data showed.\n\nExports to the Netherlands were largely attributed to healthy arbitrage sales margins from East to West, according to sources.\n\nAs Russia continues to threaten major European economies by tightening its gas supplies, European traders are willing to pay some premiums to pick up additional gasoil from the Far East so that they can actively stock up on liquid fuels to support the region's power and industrial sectors, as well as for heating needs, according to middle distillate marketers at major Chinese, South Korean and Malaysian refiners.\n\nChina hardly exported any cargoes to Europe in the past 13 months, with just 83,000 mt, or 623,000 barrels, sent to west of the Suez in June 2021.\n\nThe front-month gasoil Exchange of Futures for swaps spread -- a key indicator of East-West arbitrage economics -- averaged minus $31.78/mt in August, widening from an average of minus $29.17/mt over July, S&P Global Commodity Insights' data showed, reflecting improving economics to sell Asian gasoil barrels on arbitrage routes to the West.\n\nIn Europe, refiners, power producers, and major industries are likely to account for a 308,000 b/d growth in liquids demand in the first quarter of 2023, according to S&P Global, equivalent to about half the global share of gas-to-oil switching. The growth figure surpasses the 166,000 b/d level, or 47%, in Q3 2022.\n\nGasoline exports to Pakistan\n\nIn August, China exported around 109,000 mt of gasoline to Pakistan, marginally lower by 2.4% on the month, bringing the year-to-date exports to 1.67 million mt over the first eight months of the year, up 79.9% from a year earlier.\n\nThis kept Pakistan as the second-biggest destination for Chinese gasoline cargoes, behind the regional trading hub Singapore, the GAC data showed.\n\nPakistan was the only destination that recorded steady growth among China's top five gasoline recipients in August, despite overall gasoline exports from China falling sharply by 30.2% on the year to just 7.59 million mt over January-August.\n\nLooking ahead, however, Pakistan's faltering transportation fuel demand due to recent floods in the country may dampen gasoline sales to the South Asian nation in the near-term trading cycles, according to refinery sources and traders based in Beijing, Shandong, and Karachi.\n\nConsumer demand in Pakistan was already under pressure because of surging retail fuel prices. Fuel consumption in September and October is expected to fall by at least one-third year on year, as multiple road links connecting southern Sindh and Balochistan provinces with other key districts have vanished amid floods, halting mobilization of trucks and containers, according to middle distillate distributors and market analysts.\n\nA large section of the road and transport network to Pakistan's financial hub Karachi lies in Sindh, while Balochistan is the country's agricultural hub and a crucial consumer of middle distillates.\n\nPakistan's August domestic gasoline and fuel oil sales fell 13% year on year to 4.8 million barrels and 7% on the year to 2.48 million barrels respectively, with gasoil sales slumping 26% over the same period to 3.75 million barrels, Oil Companies Advisory Council data showed.\n\nThe average monthly consumption in the fourth quarter is also likely to weaken as floods hamper demand from the agricultural sector, said Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib in Karachi.\n\nTop 5 destinations for China's gasoline, gasoil exports (Unit: '000 mt)\n\nGasoline\n\nAug-22 Jul-22 % Change Aug-21 % Change Singapore 743 623 19.3% 35 2022.8% Malaysia 157 - - 7 2018.9% Pakistan 109 112 -2.4% 74 48.1% Brunei 36 36 -1.4% - - Mexico 36 - - - - Total* 1,117 881 26.8% 568 55.0%\n\nJan-Aug 2022 Jan-Aug 2021 % Change Singapore 2,963 4,664 -36.5% Pakistan 1,667 926 79.9% Philippines 516 1,525 -66.2% Malaysia 407 1,199 -66.1% Indonesia 291 838 -65.2% Total* 7,588 10,878 -30.2%\n\nGasoil\n\nAug-22 Jul-22 % Change Aug-21 % Change Netherlands 257 - - 1 47054.4% Hong Kong 170 109 56.1% 98 74.0% Philippines 82 - - 265 -69.0% Australia 80 - - - - Singapore 70 133 -47.7% 5 1229.9% Total* 829 359 130.7% 544 52.3%\n\nJan-Aug 2022 Jan-Aug 2021 % Change Philippines 582 3,754 -84.5% Singapore 366 2,154 -83.0% Hong Kong 305 1,425 -78.6% Bangladesh 211 1,857 -88.6% Australia 144 2,078 -93.1% Total* 3,260 14,947 -78.2%\n\n*Includes other outlets\n\nSource: General Administration of Customs",

    "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland": "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland\n\nFrom 12 to 14 September, a business delegation of 12 companies from the Netherlands participated in the New Mobility Congress 2022.\n\nNMC2002\n\nThis year’s edition, the third and most successful one so far, took place in the fantastically renovated EC1 in Łódż and offered a three-day programme on a wide variety of topics, with 81 panels and 241 speakers from all over Europe. The event was organized by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA) and hosted a record number of 1598 participants, becoming the largest-scale trade event on sustainable mobility in Poland. It effectively brought together all relevant players in the Polish mobility sector, including the automotive industry, transport companies, providers of mobility services, companies developing electromobility and policymakers from the public sector. The Netherlands’ ambassador to Poland, Daphne Bergsma, officially opened the congress, together with other dignatories, among which the mayor of Łódż, Hanna Zdanowska.\n\nDutch footprint\n\nSeizing the occasion of the NMC, the Netherlands Embassy in Poland decided to offer an \"Exhibition Participation Package\" for the Dutch private sector, under the Support for International Business Programme of the RVO, the aim being to introduce or position Dutch business in the fastly growing Polish mobility sector. The group of company representatives from the Netherlands that applied for the package turned out to be very diverse in background, scale, branch, interest and experience in Poland, resulting in serendipitous exchanges and a remarkably good vibe. We had small and large companies on board, involved in charging infrastructure (Alfen, Fastned, Volt Time, CV Charging Europe), smart energy and mobility solutions (Brenergie, LastMileSolutions), lease (Leaseplan), automotive (DAF Trucks), energy storage (e-ATEPS, StoragePartners), IT-solutions (Sourceful) and a venture capital fund (Urban Impact Ventures).\n\nActivities and visibility\n\nA total of 73 match-making meetings were held, with the invaluable suppport of Elro van den Burg of the Netherlands Polish Chamber of Commerce (NPCC). An other meet&greet-moment was the networking event hosted by the Embassy. Just before the congress, PSPA recorded a podcast in which a number of the Dutch companies presented themselves and the Economic Counsellor of the Netherlands Embassy, Sanne Kaasjager, reflected on developments and opportunities in Polish mobility. A special market survey “Poland Drives e-Mobility 2022”, commissioned by RVO and written by PSPA, provided the basis for that reflection and was also officially presented at the NMC2022. Many of the Dutch business representatives took active part in various panels. Michiel Langezaal, CEO of FastNed, made a keynote speech in the main hall. Herman Sips, representative of the Dutch ministry of Infrastructure and Water, responsible for the campaign to promote the Global MoU on electrification of heavy transport, contributed online in a highly interesting panel with representatives of leading e-truck manufacturers. The centrally-located NL Pavilion did its work by providing a “poster” for the Dutch brands and a lively meeting point. Visitors could also put on special Virtual Reality glasses with 3D-presentations of various Dutch sectors. A total of 54 people seized this new way of visualizing Dutch products and services way of doing business (and sometimes a little seasick). The abundantly present Polish media conducted 6 TV interviews with business and embassy representatives, increasing the Dutch visibility even more.\n\nOpportunities and potential areas for Dutch-Polish cooperation\n\nSo, what are the most potential areas for cooperation and growth? The analists of PSPA concluded that for Dutch investors and providers there are four areas to look at with particular interest: electrification of heavy transport, expansion of a public and private charging infrastructure, lithium-ion battery production and mobility-as-a-service. All Dutch participants where positively surprised by the potential of the Polish market and indicated a clear interest to come back next year. The Netherlands Embassy thanks all involved, especially the NPCC, RVO, the ministry of Infrastructure & Water, and especially the representatives of the Dutch companies for their interest and enthousiastic contributions.",

(Courtesy photo by ANP) (Photo Credit: Charéll de Koster) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following story is the third in the series Bits of the Benelux. This series takes a deep dive into the stories, cultures and traditions found throughout Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany]\n\nUSAG BENELUX - BRUNSSUM, Netherlands – Prince’s Day, or as the Dutch say, “Prinsjesdag,” is held annually on the third Tuesday of September.\n\nWhile not an official holiday, many Dutch citizens still consider it an important cultural and political occasion. The day (also known as Budget Day) marks the beginning of a new parliamentary year, as well as when the government announces its budget plans and anticipated revenue and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nThe Name\n\nOriginally, Prince’s Day celebrated the birthday of Prince Willem V. In the 18th century, during the French occupation, Prince’s Day was one of the most popular folk festivals since it allowed supporters of the Dutch monarchy to keep expressing their loyalty towards the Royal House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nSince 1814, Prince’s Day has been used to designate the first official day of Parliament. There is no historical context or official government documentation explaining why the name “Prinsjesdag” was given to the day Parliament opens.\n\nThe Third Tuesday of September\n\nThe modern Prince’s Day was first held on the first Monday of November, and then later on the third Monday of October.\n\nHowever, that was still too short a time frame to have the national budget ready before Jan. 1, so in 1848 Prince’s Day changed to the third Monday of September.\n\nMany parliament members disagreed with holding it on a Monday, since it meant those living outside The Hague would have to travel on a Sunday. Christian politicians greatly opposed Sunday travel as it is considered a sabbatical day.\n\nDue to the backlash, since 1887, Budget Day has been held on the third Tuesday of September.\n\nRoyal Procession\n\nThe Prince’s Day ceremonies begin with the Royal Procession, where King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima depart Palace Noordeinde (one of the three official palaces of the Dutch Royal House) in the Glass Coach along with Crown Princess Catharina-Amalia.\n\nThe procession usually ends at the Hall of Knights at The Hague, however this year it will end at the Royal Theater due to ongoing construction in the area.\n\nThe Royal Procession is one of the most publicly visible portions of Prince’s Day, with spectators lining up along the route in order to watch the parade.\n\nBesides members of the Royal House, the procession includes officers of the Royal Household, mounted police, a band and various army units.\n\nThe procession is usually led by the Johan Willem Friso Royal Military Band, with military personnel from the cavalry, the Grenadiers and Hunters regiment and the Royal Marechaussee (Dutch: Koninklijke Marechaussee, or KMar) forming a mounted honorary escort.\n\nMusic can be heard throughout the procession, as various military bands and musicians are placed along the route.\n\nHundreds of military personnel from all branches of the Dutch armed forces also line the entire parade route, and salute as the Glass Coach and the king pass by.\n\nSpeech from the Throne and Budget\n\nOnce the procession arrives at the theater, the king and queen meet with their ministers, state secretaries, members of parliament and distinguished guests.\n\nThe king then opens the new parliamentary year by reading the Speech from the Throne. The speech covers the current status of the country and presents the government's program for the coming year.\n\nFollowing the speech, the Prime Minister carries the ceremonial briefcase to the Dutch House of Representatives in order to begin budget deliberations. This briefcase contains the proposed National Budget and Budget Memorandum for the upcoming year.\n\nIn the Budget Memorandum, the government outlines its financial plans and specifies the coming year’s anticipated revenue and expenditures.\n\nRevenue in the Netherlands mainly comes from taxes and social insurance contributions, and other sources such as the sale of natural gas.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the government documents how much it plans to spend on programs such as education, social security, health care and security. Additionally, it discusses the national and international economic situation and gives an indication of the Dutch financial situation.\n\nMilitary Link\n\nOn royal occasions and national events, the Dutch military plays an important ceremonial role.\n\nUnits of the navy, army, air force and KMar perform a variety of tasks, acting as a visual ‘business card’ for the Netherlands.\n\nThis close connection between the armed forces and the royal house can be seen during major events such as royal funerals, coronations, the National Remembrance Day and Prince’s Day.\n\nA unique ritual on Prince’s Day is the gun salute by the Corps of Riding Artillery, also known as “Yellow Riders” (Dutch: “Gele Rijders”). Starting with the departure of the Royal Procession from Palace Noordeinde, and continuing during the route back following the king‘s speech, the artillerymen fire a shot every minute.\n\nHat parade\n\nAnother highlight of Prince’s Day for the general public is the “hat parade.”\n\nA fairly recent tradition, since 1977 female attendees of the Speech from the Throne have worn conspicuous hats in order to stand out, serve as tribute to the queen, or even to make political statements.\n\nAccording to some Dutch media outlets, the size of the women's hats represents the Dutch economic situation that year.\n\n—\n\nThis series, Bits of the Benelux, will continue to explore the many cultural traditions in and around the Benelux. Further stories like this on the local traditions, festivals, and events are scheduled to be published monthly, as they occur.\n\nAdditional Resources",
    "The Netherlands Drops All Entry Requirements And Travel Restrictions": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 1 week ago\n\nEffective September 17th, 2022, the Dutch Government has made the decision to get rid of all Covid-19 travel restrictions and requirements. This decision applies to all travelers, including those traveling into the Netherlands from outside the EU/Schengen area. The Netherlands kept their Covid protocols for travelers in place much longer than the majority of European countries. However, as of September 17th, the country has officially taken its name off the list of the last European countries that still have entry requirements.\n\nCurrently, Spain is the last major European country with entry requirements still in place. As other long-time holdouts like the Netherlands drop their final remaining protocols, perhaps Spain will soon follow.\n\nWho Is Most Affected? What Does This Mean For Travelers?\n\nUntil recently, the Netherlands had a complete ban on unvaccinated travelers from countries like America or Canada. As a result, this decision directly affects unvaccinated travelers from both countries. Before this decision, Americans and Canadians had to be fully vaccinated in order to visit the Netherlands. Visitors from EU/Schengen countries were allowed to enter the Netherlands without restrictions. Still, the country did not let up on protocols for any other travelers.\n\nSeptember 17th’s decision means that unvaccinated travelers from all countries, including Americans and Canadians, will be able to enter the Netherlands without proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative Covid test. The country does not have any mask requirements in place, and all venues are open and operating normally. Traveling to the Netherlands now will offer an experience much like before the pandemic turned the world upside down.\n\nTravel Chaos, Know Before You Go\n\nThis news will likely pique travelers’ interest, and some may be ready to book their next ticket out. Most travelers who visit the Netherlands go to the nation’s capital, Amsterdam. Indeed, the city was ranked as the 26th most popular city in the world in 2019 when it welcomed 8.84 million tourists. Many people wanted to visit Amsterdam this summer even when the vaccine requirement was still in place. Unfortunately, the city’s airport was woefully underprepared. As a result, Amsterdam was the European capital of travel chaos this summer.\n\nAmsterdam’s Schiphol Airport had a rough summer, and it doesn’t look like it will get much better for travelers interested in visiting this fall. The airport announced on Friday, September 16th, that it would reduce daily passenger counts by 18% through the end of October due to its labor shortage. The airport is one of the busiest in the world and is a significant transfer hub for many major airlines. However, the country recently made the decision to cut flights by almost 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels in an effort to combat climate change and get away from its “transfer hub” reputation.\n\nAn Odd Decision\n\nAmsterdam is a city filled with beautiful canals, 16th-century architecture, and of course – bikes. There are plenty of different things to do. Still, for many, the first thought after hearing about Amsterdam is of Marijuana. Famed for its lax rules regarding cannabis consumption well before most other countries in the world, Amsterdam has long been regarded as a haven for cannabis enthusiasts. Indeed, as much as 30% of all tourists that visit Amsterdam visit one of its coffee shops with the sole intention of purchasing cannabis, and it’s big business for the area.\n\nThat is why a recent push by the city’s Mayor may come as a surprise. The Mayor, Femke Halsema, intends to make cannabis purchases in the city a residents-only privilege. The plan has yet to be implemented. Still, travelers visiting with cannabis as one of their main reasons should keep an eye on the news to ensure they remain unaffected. This isn’t a set-in-stone change but is something being seriously considered – making it worth keeping tabs on.\n\nGetting There\n\nAmerican travelers interested in visiting Amsterdam can fly direct from 20 U.S. cities, while Canadians can fly direct from 5. Travelers from both countries should be weary when flying back, as Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport has had extremely long lines this summer. Go to the airport much earlier than you would have in the past, and try to avoid checking a bag if possible.\n\nTravelers flying to Amsterdam from Canada should be extra careful if they fly out of Toronto Pearson or Montreal Trudeau airports. Both were recently ranked as the first and second worst airports in the world for flight delays.\n\nU.S. Cities That Fly Non-Stop To Amsterdam\n\nBoston (BOS)\n\nNew York (EWR)\n\nPhiladelphia (PHL)\n\nNew York City (JFK)\n\nDetroit (DTW)\n\nWashington (IAD)\n\nMinneapolis (MSP)\n\nChicago (ORD)\n\nOrlando (MCO)\n\nAtlanta (ATL)\n\nMiami (MIA)\n\nDallas-Fort Worth (DFW)\n\nAustin (AUS)\n\nHouston (IAH)\n\nSalt Lake City (SLC)\n\nSeattle (SEA)\n\nPortland (PDX)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX)\n\nSan Francisco (SFO)\n\nLas Vegas (LAS)\n\nCanadian Cities That Fly Non-Stop To Amsterdam\n\nMontreal (YUL)\n\nToronto (YYZ)\n\nCalgary (YYC)\n\nEdmonton (YEG)\n\nVancouver (YVR)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "Preview: United States v Netherlands": "What the teams are saying\n\nReturning to the same court a day after defeat is not something players face often on Tour, but Fritz sees nothing but positives in the situation.\n\n“If anything, it's better I'd say,” he said. “You don't get to play yourself into a tournament if you lose early. I always feel like once I play a match on the court, I'll always come back the next day and I'll feel better and get used to the conditions.”\n\nAs for the kind of match Botic Van de Zandschulp expects in his first singles meeting with Fritz, the Dutchman said, “He's serving well, hitting the ball well from the baseline, and can hit winners from everywhere, I think. Yeah, it's going to be a good match.”\n\nThe prize on offer is not lost on Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis as he looks ahead to Malaga in November: “This is very big for us. Whoever finishes first, on paper, has a much better draw. It’s fantastic that we qualified, that was our main goal, but one tie decides whether we finish on top, and we’re going all in.”\n\nIf this is to be Bob Bryan’s last tie as USA’s captain – at least for now – the stand-in has had a great time on the bench. “It’s fun. I love being out there with the guys and seeing that tennis up close, and trying to keep their energy up. I’m doing what I can, but these guys are all such great competitors and such great players I'm in awe of the tennis they're playing out here this week.”",

That is also in their own interest. Perhaps a small encouragement from the minister will provide just that little bit of motivation that the ABU needs.”\n\nEarlier this month, SIA interviewed Jurriën Koops, Director of the ABU, in an audio interview discussing the Dutch government’s plans to reform the labour market.",
    "Recreating City of Joy in the Netherlands": "A slice of Kolkata in Europe! That’s how Indians in the Netherlands are going to celebrate Durga Puja.\n\nThis is the sixth year 'Anandadhara', a Bengali club in the north European country, is celebrating Durga Puja. The theme selected for this year is 'Ek tukdo Kolkata'—the depiction of Kolkata and its surroundings. A wooden Howrah Bridge over the Hooghly river, created using lights, along with greenery of the City of Joy would be the main attractions.\n\nNot only Bengalis, but all Indians settled in the country would be part of the grand celebration, the organisers say.\n\nThe celebration is organised at a big ground in Amstelveen. Flowers and banana tree leaves are being flown to the city by air. The idols of Duga and her sons and daughters have already been sent by Kumartuli’s famous idol maker Prashanta Paul.\n\n“The finishing touch for the celebration is going on. We, mostly IT job holders, will be on leave for five days during Durga Puja and are going to engage ourselves totally in the grand celebration,” said Sudipta Laskar, an IT professional and one of the organisers.\n\nLaskar hails from Hooghly, a neighbouring district of Kolkata. The river Hooghly flows through most part of his district.\n\nPreparations on for the five-day Durga Puja celebrations\n\nThere will be cultural programmes in the evening of each day of Durga Puja. “The highlight of this year's cultural performances is Rabindra Nath Tagore's dance-drama Chitrangada, which will be performed by our in-house dance troupe Ananda Taranga,” said Laskar.\n\nDipwanita Mukherjee, who is in-charge of the show, also shared her excitement. \"Our troupe performing in front of over 500 audiences makes me both nervous and excited. We do rehearsals every alternate day despite our busy schedule with family and office. During Durga Puja, we are endowed with additional energy to make it all happen. Looking forward to the D-day,\" she said.\n\nOther performances include classical dances like Kathak, Odissi and Bharatanatyam by professional dancers, besides folk and cinematic dances. Musical shows, including vocals and instrument recitals, as well as recitation of Bengali poems have also been included.\n\nVarious games and contests have also been arranged targeting the youth. There will also be a contest to find out the best dressed couple—Shriman-Srimati—which was a hit last time, say the organisers.\n\nVarious cultural programmes are being organised as part the celebrations\n\nCovid-19 will have nominal impact this time with almost all restrictions being lifted. “Nevertheless, we have ensured that there will be no overcrowding and safe distance can be maintained,” says Nabanita Sarkar, who hails from Asansol.\n\n\"But yes, finally we don't have to wear masks with our saris! Covid has lost its importance as it has become just a glorified 'cold',” she says.\n\nSujit Mandol, who hails from Durgapur, is the theme artist this year. He is engaged in creating the gigantic replication of Howrah Bridge.",
    "Europe's energy crisis and the Netherlands' 1,000 billion buried treasure": "Despite skyrocketing energy prices and a shortage of natural gas supply in the European Union, the Dutch government has taken the decision to proceed with the closure of natural gas wells in the Groningen region. The field is one of the biggest in the world, worth up to 1000 billion Euros. But for now, it's a treasure that will remain untapped for the forseeable future.\n\nThe reason the decision was taken was because of seismic shocks triggered by the gas extraction in the area. Some 1200 earthquakes have been recorded so far, with around 27,000 homes being severely damaged and deemed unsafe to live in. That's according Jan Wigboldus, president of the Groningen Gas Council, an umbrella group representing civil society organisations in the impacted region.\n\nSeverely damaged house from earthquake activity Euronews\n\nBut a growing number of experts are urging the government to overhaul its decision – and to extend gas extraction for at least a few more years. This, they argue, could help to secure a future supply of gas and help to bring down energy prices.\n\nMachiel Mulder, is the Professor of Regulation of Energy Markets at the University of Groningen.\n\n“The field could be re-opened in case of an emergency situation. So when people living in Germany, Estonia or other countries are really experiencing a shortage of gas, this is an emergency situation. And then the decision will be reconsidered whether to re-open the gasfield from Groningen to produce more.”\n\nAn alternative to gas-extraction at home is the importation of gas from abroad. The Netherlands has now put into operation a supplementary LNG terminal. Other countries – such as Germany and France, are also setting up new infrastructure to import liquified natural gas.\n\nSome 81.000 jobs are linked to the Dutch greenhouse industry, and half of the companies face financial problems due to the rising gas prices.\n\n81.000 jobs are linked to the Dutch greenhouse industry Euronews\n\nExtending the Groningen gas field extraction could ease their situation, but the industry is also taking measures to adapt to the new reality, as Greenhouse Manager, Juliska van der Breggen explains.\n\n\"We had to close one location and 30 percent of our employees we had to say good-bye. The problem is the high energy prices, and we have to reduce the use of our using of energy. It is possible to reduce for 30 percent. Our whole branch we can reduce 900 million cubic metres of gas.\"\n\nTo put this into perspective, 900 million cubic metres of gas is equivalent to powering three Dutch cities.\n\nBut will actions like this one be enough? The Netherlands have relaunched their coal power stations and that’s bad news for the climate. Using gas from Groningen would be less harmful to the environment, but for now, at least, it doesn't seem likely that the government will change its decision.",
    "Solaris to deliver 10 MetroStyle trolleybuses to Arnhem in the Netherlands": "Solaris and Dutch operator Hermes, part of Transdev/Connexxion, have signed a contract for the delivery of 10 Trollino 18 trolleybuses featuring our unique MetroStyle design\n\nSolaris and Dutch operator Hermes, part of Transdev/Connexxion, have signed a contract for the delivery of 10 Trollino 18 trolleybuses featuring our unique MetroStyle design. These emission-free trolleybuses will significantly contribute to boosting innovative public transport in the Arnhem Nijmegen region as well as in the entire province of Gelderland. The vehicles will make their way to Arnhem in the first half of 2024 and they will be the first Solaris trolleybuses to be deployed in the Netherlands.\n\nSolaris has been working for many years with Hermes, a carrier which is part of the Transdev Netherlands group, a leader in emission-free public transport in the Netherlands. Arnhem, a city of over 150,000 inhabitants and located on the Nederrijn river, is an important industrial, scientific and cultural centre. The ten modern Trollino 18s to be delivered by Solaris will allow it to expand its transport network between the University in Arnhem and the University in Wageningen. These will be the first Solaris trolleybuses in the Netherlands.\n\nThey will stand out due to their dynamic and stylish MetroStyle look. This unique design has been developed by Solaris as a response to the latest trends in the public transport industry. The first Solaris vehicle built sporting the new design was the Trollino 24, showcased at Busworld Europe 2019 in Brussels.\n\n“We are very proud that our Solaris Trollino 18 vehicles will arrive in Arnhem soon. This is the only Dutch city with an operating trolleybus system. We are therefore particularly pleased that its residents will soon be able to travel on board the most modern Solaris trolleybuses”, said Wil Willems, Managing Director of Solaris Netherlands.\n\n“We are very much looking forward to the next chapter in our collaboration with Solaris. Our goal is to provide the residents of the Netherlands with the most comfortable, state-of-the-art, and environmentally-friendly solutions for public transport. We are absolutely certain that Solaris Trollino 18 trolleybuses are just such a choice”, said Martijn Mentink, Executive Director at Hermes for the South-East Region.\n\nOne important feature of the trolleybuses ordered by Hermes is that they will be able to drive without being connected to overhead wires. This will be possible due to traction batteries with a capacity of around 90 kWh. Thanks to these batteries, the vehicles will be able to cover a distance of up to a few dozen kilometres without needing to be connected to the overhead line network. The batteries will be charged using the “In-Motion-Charging” system, directly while travelling using the overhead wires. The Solaris Trollino 18 trolleybuses will be equipped with a 240 kW electric motor.\n\nThe comfortable, air-conditioned and spacious trolleybus interior will be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, i.e. it will feature, among other things, two functional wheelchair bays. What is more, to enhance both travel comfort and safety, the vehicles will boast a range of cutting-edge solutions such as USB charging ports for mobile devices, a passenger information system, and a video surveillance system. These solutions will also include Mobileye Shield+, a system that uses sound and visual alerts to warn the driver about any objects detected in the blind spot of the vehicle. Enhanced visibility for the driver will be ensured by cameras that replace side mirrors, transmitting images on screens inside the vehicle. Among its many other advantages, the innovative design of MirrorEye has allowed the width of the vehicle to be reduced.\n\nThe first Solaris vehicles made it to the Netherlands in 2017 when Transdev placed an order for 40 articulated Solaris Urbino 18 buses. Since then, the fleet of Solaris vehicles plying the streets of towns and cities in the Netherlands has been expanded by the addition of 26 more vehicles, including 16 hydrogen buses. Trolleybuses have been part of the Solaris offering since 2000. To date, nearly 2,000 vehicles of this type have been delivered to 60 towns and cities in 18 countries.\n\nIn the picture, from the left: Bart Kraaijvanger, Zero Emission Program Manager for Transdev Netherlands, Martijn Mentink, Executive Director at Hermes for the South-East Region, Wil Willems, Managing Director of Solaris Netherlands B.V., Bartłomiej Cieślik, Senior Area Manager, Solaris Bus & Coach sp. z o.o.\n\nSOURCE: Solaris",
    "France back on track as Netherlands close on Nations League finals": "Kylian Mbappe starred as world champions France shrugged off injuries and off-field problems to beat Austria on Thursday, while the Netherlands won in Poland to close in on a place in next year's UEFA Nations League finals.\n\nFrance's build-up to their defence of the World Cup in Qatar in November and December has been marred by fitness issues surrounding a host of key players as well as other worries, but Les Bleus did not appear distracted as they outclassed the Austrians in Paris, winning 2-0.\n\nMbappe showcased his phenomenal pace and strength on the way before finishing emphatically to put the hosts ahead in the 56th minute at the Stade de France.\n\nThe recalled Olivier Giroud doubled their lead nine minutes later, heading in Antoine Griezmann's cross to score his 49th international goal -- he is now just two goals short of Thierry Henry's French record.\n\n\"We did what we needed to do to get the victory, creating lots of chances and controlling the match,\" said France coach Didier Deschamps.\n\n\"There are lots of positives to take from the game.\"\n\nInjuries had deprived Deschamps of a whole team, with goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris, midfield duo N'Golo Kante and Paul Pogba, and Karim Benzema among the players missing.\n\nPogba has also been in the headlines after filing a complaint with Italian prosecutors saying he was the target of a 13 million-euro ($13m) blackmail plot.\n\nHis brother Mathias is one of five people charged and detained in the case.\n\nMeanwhile this week began with Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe refusing to take part in a photo shoot in a row with the French Football Federation over image rights.\n\nMbappe celebrated his goal by mimicking a photographer in an apparent nod to that row.\n\nJust eight days shy of his 36th birthday, Giroud is France's oldest ever goal-scorer.\n\nComing exactly two months before they begin their World Cup defence against Australia in Qatar, the result also allowed France to stave off the threat of relegation from the top tier of the Nations League, a competition they won just last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeschamps' side still need to win their last Group A1 game away in Denmark on Sunday to be certain of avoiding relegation, while qualification for the four-team finals next June is already out of reach.\n\n- Croatia see off Denmark -\n\nCroatia, the 2018 World Cup runners-up, are on course to top the section after beating Denmark 2-1 in Zagreb.\n\nBorna Sosa's 49th-minute opener for the hosts was cancelled out by a magnificent Christian Eriksen strike in the 77th minute.\n\nHowever, Croatia's winner came just two minutes later through Lovro Majer.\n\nCroatia are a point clear of the Danes before going to Vienna to play bottom side Austria on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands are well placed to advance to the finals from Group A4 after a 2-0 win away to Robert Lewandowski's Poland in Warsaw.\n\nCody Gakpo turned in a Denzel Dumfries centre at the end of a superb move to put the Dutch in front early on, while Steven Bergwijn made it 2-0 on the hour mark after a one-two with Vincent Janssen.\n\n\"It was a big test for us. I am very satisfied with how we played,\" said Dutch coach Louis van Gaal.\n\n- Belgium beat Wales -\n\nGroup rivals Belgium beat Wales 2-1 in Brussels, with Kevin De Bruyne and Michy Batshuayi scoring first-half goals before Kieffer Moore pulled one back.\n\nThe Netherlands are three points clear of Belgium before the sides meet in Amsterdam on Sunday.\n\nHowever, having won 4-1 in Belgium in their last meeting, even a two-goal defeat would be enough for Van Gaal's side to qualify for the four-team finals.\n\nIn contrast Wales -- who had no Gareth Bale in their starting line-up -- must now beat Poland in Cardiff on Sunday to stay in League A.\n\nSpain and Hungary top the other two groups in League A before action continues on Friday, when Germany host the Hungarians while England face Italy in Milan.\n\nas/jc",

    "How the Dutch league hopes to catch up to its national team": "Feyenoord are one of the most storied clubs in Dutch football. Over their 114-year history, they've amassed 15 league titles, 13 cups, and multiple European titles.\n\nTheir women's first team history is nowhere near as long. In fact, they only have a single full season under their belt. Understandably, it’s also nowhere near as illustrious as that of their male counterparts.\n\nManon Melis is the woman tasked with changing that, and helping further bolster the foundations of Dutch women's football.\n\nThe Rotterdam native is the seventh most-capped woman in Dutch history. After a successful, swashbuckling career featuring stops in the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States, Melis hung up her boots and has been Feyenoord’s Director of Women’s Development since 2017.\n\nShe's overseen the evolution of Feyenoord's women's department from a couple of youth and girls' teams to the establishment of a women’s side in the Dutch first division. Feyenoord had to balance the hefty expectations tied to their well-established name with the challenges facing any new club.\n\nManon Melis has helped build Feyenoord's women's program from scratch.\n\n\"We know what we're doing and how we want to do it. But you know, everybody else thinks Feyenoord is a big name in the Netherlands. So they have expectations, but it's really important to keep the focus on your own goals and how we want to do things,\" Melis told DW.\n\nFeyenoord had a respectable outing in their opening campaign, finishing fifth out of nine teams. They've started their second season on firm footing, winning both their matches so far.\n\nThe Dutch National team's explosive growth\n\nWhile Feyenoord are playing catch up to other Dutch sides, rival clubs didn't have as long of a headstart as one might guess. Big-spending PSV and Ajax only launched women's teams in 2012, and 8-time title winner Twente is ancient by comparison, having been founded in 2007.\n\nEven these sides, dominant in the Netherlands, struggle internationally. Ajax may have the chance to knock out Arsenal ahead of this season's group stages on Wednesday, after a 2-2 draw in the first leg of their playoff. But no Dutch team has made it past the Champions League round of 16 since 2006, before it was rebranded.\n\nThe Dutch league's diminutive stature makes it all the more impressive that the Netherlands have morphed into one of the stronger teams in Europe. While they came up short of defending their Euros title this summer, the Netherlands have evolved into contenders at both the European and global level.\n\n\"I think with the national team, things went a lot faster. Even with things like facilities, or how many times you can practice in a week, these things improved faster [than at the club level]. And of course, a lot of our girls are playing in different leagues, for some of the best clubs in Europe,\" said Melis.\n\n\"After Euro 2017 everything changed. Beforehand the team wasn't that popular. Afterwards [the Netherlands] began playing in front of full stadiums, and more players started going abroad,\" she continued.\n\nLeaving the Netherlands remains the most viable way for Dutch players to test themselves at the highest level. Still, more than half of the Dutch Euro 2022 squad were based in the Eredivisie, which means the national team can't rely solely on players earning their wages in France, England, Germany or Spain.\n\nThe professionalization push\n\nAccording to Melis, conditions at Feyenoord are nearly unrecognizable from her playing days. \"They're totally different worlds. Everything changed in recent years. The competition in the Netherlands improved, especially when it comes to facilities. When I started we were all amateurs. Now, clubs like Ajax, PSV, Feyenoord have really nice conditions. It's normal for young girls now,\" she said.\n\nStill, women's teams with deep-pockets are a relative anomaly in the Netherlands. Melis estimates that only a few teams are fully professional, and semi-pro Feyenoord still have a long way to go on that front.\n\n\"We have some of the girls work for the club on various projects, and a lot of other girls are at university or studying. We can't offer for them to be professional players yet, but hope in a few years we will be able to,\" she said.\n\nEngland, France and Sweden currently have fully-professional women’s leagues, and Italy and Spain just joined their ranks this season. According to Nadine Kessler, UEFA's Head of Women's Football, expanding that number further is a major element to growing women's football on the continent.\n\nVivianne Miedema is one of a number of Dutch players who had to leave to play abroad early\n\n\"We need to really make sure that all of these doors are open right now to all girls all over Europe. What England did with the Women's Super League needs to happen across Europe. I always say five to 10 professional leagues, that's when we make change. That's when the parent says, 'Okay, there's a job opportunity out there for my girl, that's something I'd really push her to do',\" Kessler said at a press conference before the Euros kicked off.\n\nWhile the relatively slow growth of Dutch domestic football seems odd in light of the national teams successes, it's reflective of the broader state of women's clubs football. Full-professionalization for Feyenoord and the rest of the Eredivisie might be a ways out, but Melis at least has clearer immediate objectives.\n\n\"If you see Lyon or Barcelona, their budget is different than what we have here in the Netherlands. So I don't know if we can reach that. But it's also about the young, talented players. We need to focus on our own youth players and trying to have them stay longer in the Dutch competition,\" she said.\n\nHolding on to top talents a bit longer would help raise the overall level of the Eredivisie, and as the game continues to grow, could bring in transfer fees down the line. If Feyenoord were around a decade ago, they might have been able to sign one of the club's biggest fans, Vivienne Miedema.\n\nMiedema, who recently eclipsed Melis as the highest goal scorer in Netherlands history, grew up watching the Feyenoord men play with her family. Further growth at clubs like Feyenoord means the next Miedemas might be able to launch their careers at their childhood club.",
    "Van Gaal unhappy with Netherlands display but confident for Qatar": "Not good\n\n“I assume that we will do better in possession at the World Cup,” Van Gaal told a news conference. “We were not very good against Belgium although without possession I thought we did well.” He admitted Belgium had the better of the game.\n\n“That had to do with the form of the day and the quality of the opponent. Belgium is the number two in the world rankings for a reason. And it’s unbelievable that we have beaten them twice.” The Netherlands also won 4-1 in Brussels in June, finishing six points clear at the top of their Nations League group.\n\nVan Gaal now heads to a second World Cup, having taken the Dutch to third place in Brazil eight years ago.\n\n“I think we are going to be a difficult opponent to go up against. We showed that if we are out played we can still be difficult to break down by playing more compact,” he said.\n\nMore quality\n\n“I have more quality now in defence and midfield. Only then did we have more exclusive quality in the front with Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. But with Van Persie injured some of the time, I had a young boy fill in many times then. His name was Memphis Depay.” Depay, along with his Barcelona team mate Frenkie de Jong, did not play against Belgium after going off injured when the Dutch beat Poland 2-0 away on Thursday but Van Gaal said he was keeping a place for both.\n\n“I expect my players to play at a certain level at their club,” he said, adding he had mostly made up his mind about his 26-man squad for Qatar.",
    "In the Netherlands, 4 contemporary art museums go beyond the Old Masters": "Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWhen you think Dutch art, you probably picture Van Gogh, Rembrandt and other old masters whose work graces the walls of museums in Amsterdam and beyond. But the Netherlands also has a rich variety of bold and compelling contemporary art found in museums across its 12 provinces. I’ve chosen a few to whet your palette, so to speak, but this is but a small sampling of the possibilities.\n\nI’ve started the list in Amsterdam, at the Stedelijk Museum. Although it is the country’s best-known source of contemporary and cutting-edge art, it is still overshadowed by its super-famous neighbors. Then we move south to Rotterdam, an industrial-leaning city more known for its architecture than its art. The choice here, Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen, combines the two in groundbreaking, breathtaking ways. Moving toward The Hague, the newest destination on the list is Museum Voorlinden, a testament to how a private collector can create a public destination. Finally, we go down to Tilburg, about 90 minutes south of Amsterdam, in the province of North Brabant, where the TextielMuseum lovingly honors its industrial past while looking far into the future at the adjacent TextielLab.\n\nStedelijk Museum\n\nAlthough the Stedelijk is the Netherlands’ most important museum for modern and contemporary art, it’s overshadowed by its more famous neighbors on Museum Square. At the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum, you’ll almost always find lines of people waiting to get in. Not so here. Even its name, which translates to “municipal museum,” downplays the Stedelijk’s significance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you step into “the bathtub,” so nicknamed for its oblong addition protruding over the square, which was added to the original 1895 building a decade ago, you’ll find an intoxicating mix of modern masterpieces and experimental work.\n\nA current series, “POST/NO/BILLS,” blends history and graphic design around the museum’s historic staircase and in the arches of the corridor. The current show in the series is “Sophie Douala — Follow the Black Rabbit” (through Dec. 31). Douala, born in Cameroon, raised in France and living in Berlin, creates trippy, colorful designs punctuated with somber, self-reflective videos that use current events as the backdrop.\n\nThe Stedelijk’s permanent-collection display contains about 500 art and design objects dating from 1870 to the present, shown in three categories. (The full permanent collection includes around 100,000 items.) The museum also was an early supporter of the Dutch design duo Drift and recently acquired more of its lighting and material installations.\n\nComing up, “Anne Imhof — YOUTH” (Oct. 1-Jan. 29) features the German visual and performance artist, who will place a sound-and-light installation in the Stedelijk’s nearly 12,000-square-foot lower-level gallery. “Bad Color Combos” (Oct. 22-March 5) is an overview of the recent work of French-Moroccan artist Yto Barrada, including her film, textiles, photography and sculptures.\n\nDepot Boijmans Van Beuningen\n\nBilled as the world’s first publicly accessible art depot, a.k.a. storage space, this recently opened architectural stunner in Rotterdam holds some 151,000 objects from the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, located next door. The museum, which opened in 1849, is closed for renovation until at least 2029.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get a peek at the vast holdings inside, outside you’ll see your surroundings and the skyline reflected in the curved building’s mirrored facade, perfect for selfies.\n\nIn the building’s atrium, you can gaze up through glass at the depot’s six stories, accessible by stairs and a clear elevator. Although not all the art here is contemporary, the overall look certainly is, as are many of the pieces highlighted. Most artwork is stored in rooms with huge windows, which you can enter with a guide. Other work is cleverly displayed in glass cases positioned at eye-catching angles. You feel as if you’re in a monsoon of art and design objects coming at you from all directions. It’s overwhelming in the best of ways.\n\nOn the free guided tours, you can go into a storage area to see works hung on racks or stored on pallets, in cases or on shelves. Some are exhibited often, while others are rarely seen. During the workweek, you can also see art conservators laboring behind windows, and you can sometimes get the opportunity to ask about their projects.\n\nOnce you’ve absorbed as much art as you can, check out the lovely tree-lined rooftop and its restaurant, where you’ll be treated to a panorama of Rotterdam.\n\nMuseum Voorlinden\n\nPick a warm, sunny day to visit this private museum and gardens in Wassenaar, just northeast of The Hague, where nature, art and architecture harmonize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe museum, which opened in 2016, was founded by Dutch art collector and industrialist Joop van Caldenborgh. Housed in a 100-acre nature reserve, it features a private permanent collection and rotating temporary exhibits with a backdrop both old and new. The grounds include walking paths, gardens, sculptures and a 20th-century country mansion, where the restaurant and terrace are located.\n\nThe elongated museum building is designed to pull in light from every corner. The 20 galleries are lit by natural daylight, while a roof made of glass incorporates indirect LED lighting.\n\nSeveral of the favorite permanent works here are huge and beg for interaction.\n\n“Swimming Pool,” designed by Argentine conceptual artist Leandro Erlich for the Voorlinden, makes a splash with its optical trickery. As visitors look down into the pool, they see other visitors — clothed and dry — walking on its floor. (The “swimmers” enter on a lower level of the museum.) It’s the people that make this experience so fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing the holiday theme is “Couple Under an Umbrella,” one of Australian sculptor Ron Mueck’s oversize, hyperrealistic human figures. An older shirtless man in swimming trunks lies under a beach umbrella, with his head in his wife’s lap. They’re designed with uncanny precision, down to the wrinkles and hair.\n\nOn a more meditative note, American artist Richard Serra’s “Open Ended” is a huge work of six vaulted steel plates molded together to form a maze. A walk through it is both mysterious and calming.\n\nAlong with works from the permanent collection, current and upcoming exhibits include “GROUND,” a major retrospective from British sculptor Antony Gormley (through Sept. 25), and a retrospective from Italian artist Giuseppe Penone (Oct. 8-Jan. 29).\n\nTextielMuseum and TextielLab\n\nIf a textile museum conjures clanking wooden looms, huge spools of cotton thread and elementary school field trips, you wouldn’t be totally wrong. But nowadays, this dynamic destination in Tilburg brings together textile design, art, fashion and innovation, with heritage at its core.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe building itself blends past and present. The museum is located in an old textile factory that was built in the 1860s by a woolen fabric manufacturer. The last addition, in 2008, extended the main building with a striking glass-covered entrance area. Another redevelopment is planned for the coming decade.\n\nThe future hums in the textile lab, located inside the museum. Here fabric innovations are born through collaborations with staff and a host of Dutch and international designers. In fact, there’s a good chance that anything you see made by a Dutch designer that includes a clever use of textiles was executed here. Visitors can walk through much of the workspace, where staff members are on hand to demonstrate and explain the weaving, knitting, lasering, tufting and embroidery techniques employed today.\n\nThe museum also explores the industry’s past, especially in the permanent display “Woollen Blanket Factory 1900-1940.” The exhibit re-creates activities in a textile factory from 1900 to 1940, including spinning and weaving looms driven by a steam engine built in 1906.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTemporary exhibits often focus on sustainability and research. “To Dye For” (through Nov. 13) explores the world of textile dyeing, from its origins to current practices, as well as its effects on people and the environment. “Secrets of making #2 — Artists and designers in the TextielLab” (through June 4) is a behind-the-scenes look at the creative processes of 10 makers who recently worked in the lab.\n\nThe museum also has a colorful cafe and a beautiful shop, where many of the textiles designed and made in the TextielLab are for sale.\n\nDaniel is a writer based in the Netherlands and Florida. Her website is bydianedaniel.com.\n\ncorrection A previous version of this article and a photo caption incorrectly said the Stedelijk Museum's permanent collection contains about 500 items. In fact, about 500 items from the permanent collection are on display; its full collection contains about 100,000 items.

    "24% Of New Car Sales Now Electric In The Netherlands!": "The Dutch auto market has finally seen the light at the end of the tunnel, growing 9% year over year (YoY) in August, while the Dutch plugin vehicle (PEV) market has continued to grow, last month by 20% YoY. That’s mostly thanks to pure electrics (24% of all new vehicle sales), which grew 30% year over year (YoY) last month. Plugin hybrids (PHEVs) also remained positive in August, if only by 1%, by registering 2,296 units, or 10% share.\n\nOverall, the year-to-date (YTD) market share for plugin vehicles was up to 32%. Highlighting an ongoing shift in the market toward BEVs, they had 71% of plugin sales in August, up from the 63% average of 2022.\n\nLynk & Co’s 01 PHEV crossover won August’s best seller race, achieving 502 registrations last month. Interestingly, it was the only PHEV model in the August table, and the Chinese model was responsible for 22% of all PHEV sales in the Netherlands last month! Now, imagine if they a had a truly competitive (as in, BEV) model!\n\nLooking at the remaining positions on the podium, we have the practical Skoda Enyaq in second place, with 442 registrations, while the new generation gave the Kia Niro EV a welcome boost that lifted it to the 3rd spot in the table.\n\nIn the remaining positions in the table, Volkswagen Group had a positive month, with three models (Audi e-tron, Volkswagen ID.3, and Volkswagen ID.4) hitting year-best scores, while the sportier Volkswagen ID.5 continued to ramp up deliveries, reaching a record 128 units last month. That result brought it into the table, in #20.\n\nYear-best results weren’t a Volkswagen Group exclusive, though. In the middle of a drought in its PHEV field, the XC40 EV had its best month in 2022, with 252 registrations, thus slowing Volvo’s downfall a bit.\n\nIn the second half of the table, we should highlight the Dacia Spring, in #14. It got 181 registrations in August, allowing it to also feature in this month’s top 20.\n\nOutside the top 20, one can tell that we are in holiday season, with not much to talk about. Exceptions include the good month of the BMW iX (106 registrations) and Tesla’s Model Y (97 registrations).\n\nLooking at the 2022 ranking, the Skoda Enyaq kept most of the advantage over the runner-up Lynk & Co 01 PHEV and is now the clear favorite for this year’s best seller title.\n\nIn 3rd place, the Peugeot e-208 needs to keep a close eye on the climbing #4 Kia Niro EV and #5 Kia EV6. The Korean models are looking to displace the French hatchback from the last place on the podium.\n\nBut it is in the second half of the table that we find the Climbers of the Month.\n\nThe rolling work of art that goes by the name of Hyundai IONIQ 5 was up four spots, to #12, while Volvo’s XC40 EV had a good month, jumping four spots to #13. The XC40 EV gave a much needed boost to Volvo’s sales in this time of a BEV rising tide.\n\nFinally, the Mini Cooper EV jumped from #20 in the previous month to its current position of 16th. The electric hot hatch is now just 10 units behind the best selling BMW Group model in Dutch lands.\n\nIn #19, we now have the VW ID.3, which kicked the Tesla Model Y off the table, but this absence should be temporary, as Tesla’s crossover will return in September, thanks to its usual end-of-quarter peak.\n\nIn the manufacturer ranking, PHEV-heavy Volvo (9.2%, down from 9.6%) took a beating and is barely hanging onto the leadership position. It resisted the BEV takeover, but it has new runner-up Kia (9.2%, up from 9.1%) now just 6 units behind, so the Korean brand should surpass the Swede and grab gold in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining top 5 players have kept their positions, but all lost share last month. BMW, down 0.4%, was hit particularly hard, to the profit of 6th placed Mercedes (6%) and especially 8th placed Volkswagen (4.8%).\n\nAs for OEMs, Volkswagen Group (20.5%, up 0.6%) is now more comfortable in the leadership position. It not only continued to earn share, but runner-up Stellantis (18.1%, down from 18.3%) even lost some ground.\n\n3rd placed Geely–Volvo saw its share drop in August from 15.9% to 15.7%, due to another slow month from Volvo. With PHEVs presumably out of fashion for the rest of the year, and no significant BEV launches coming in the remainder of 2022, one wonders how low the company will go.\n\n#4 Hyundai–Kia (13.7%, up from 13.2%) is in 4th place and continuing to increase its market share, waiting to see how big Geely–Volvo’s fall from grace will be.\n\nFinally, in 5th, we have a falling BMW Group (10.7%, down from 10.9%), as it is now suffering from the transition into a more BEV-heavy lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppreciate CleanTechnica’s originality and cleantech news coverage?

    "California and the Netherlands Forge Partnership on Climate Action": "California and the Netherlands Forge Partnership on Climate Action\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSeptember 6, 2022\n\nContact:\n\nPress@ltg.ca.gov\n\n916-445-8994\n\nLieutenant Governor Kounalakis and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom welcome Queen Máxima of the Netherlands to California\n\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by California and the Netherlands aims to cut pollution,\n\nadvance the transition to zero-emission vehicles, and build a sustainable economy\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – California launched a new partnership Tuesday in its global fight to cut carbon pollution, embrace the zero-emission transportation future and accelerate efforts to build a circular economy.\n\nAt Salesforce Park in San Francisco, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom joined by Her Majesty Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, announced a new partnership to advance climate action.\n\nCalifornia and the Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining several areas of collaboration, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to a circular economy, embracing zero-emission vehicles, building climate resilience, and prioritizing and supporting equity.\n\n“When it comes to climate action, California punches above our weight. We’re working with countries around the world to cut pollution and usher in a new era of zero-emission vehicles. California and the Netherlands are proud to stand side by side in our collective efforts to advance bold climate policies and protect communities from Alameda to Amsterdam,” said Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis.\n\n“The partnership between California and the Netherlands has come at a critical moment for us as a global community,” said First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom. “We may not be able to undo all of the harms that have been done to our planet, but we can make better, climate smart decisions going forward. That’s what this MOU with the Netherlands is about, and our hope is that it will also serve as a model, demonstrating that when it comes to protecting our communities, our planet, and our future, no one state, or nation can or should lead in a silo. We are stronger together.” “California and the Netherlands share high ambitions on climate, working closely together for over 10 years as frontrunners. Recent years have demonstrated that we are increasingly being faced with global crises. Only by working together can we overcome these challenges effectively,” said Her Majesty Queen Máxima of the Netherlands said at the MOU signing.\n\n“Today, the entire West is in the grips of what may be the hottest and longest September heat wave ever recorded, exacerbating wildfires and drought,” said Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. “This is just the latest reminder of how real the climate crisis is, and how it is impacting the everyday lives of Californians and people around the world. Today, with our partners from the Netherlands, we are doubling down on our commitment to building resilience to this new reality and prioritizing the protection of our most vulnerable communities. We’re making the most aggressive push on climate this state has ever seen, because what we do today will be felt for generations – and the impact will spread far beyond our borders.”\n\n“The Netherlands and California are both leaders when it comes to climate action. As the decisions by California and Europe to ban fossil-fuel cars show, green mobility will be key in reaching our climate goals,” said Dutch Minister for the Environment Vivianne Heijnen. “This partnership will connect our expertise on charging infrastructure, so e-mobility will be easy, affordable, and accessible for all on both sides of the Atlantic. I’m looking forward to working together with California and Governor Newsom on expanding our collaboration to work towards a clean future for our children.”\n\nFollowing the MOU signing ceremony, Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis and First Partner Siebel Newsom accompanied Her Majesty to meetings with business leaders from the Netherlands and California. The group spoke of shared economic ties and the role of the private sector in bringing the necessary innovation, investments, and commitments that will be critical to solving the climate crisis.\n\nThe partnership with the Netherlands is the latest in a series of similar climate agreements stretching from Canada to China.\n\nEarlier this year, California signed Memorandums of Cooperation with both Canada and New Zealand to tackle the climate crisis. Those agreements followed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Japan signed in March to advance cooperation on climate and clean energy priorities and strengthen trade relations. Governor Newsom also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China to accelerate ongoing initiatives to protect the environment, reduce carbon and air pollution, and promote clean technology development.\n\nIn 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom designated Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis as his Representative for International Affairs and Trade Development, and as Chair of the corresponding Interagency Committee that oversees the state’s trade, investment, and international relations.\n\nCalifornia’s world-leading climate policies have led the state to exceed its 2020 climate target four years ahead of schedule and created partnerships across the U.S. and around the world. California has committed a record $53.9 billion to tackle pollution, build climate-resilient water supplies, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, accelerate clean energy solutions, and protect communities from extreme heat.\n\nCalifornia’s ZEV market is leading the nation in every category. The state is ending the sale of new gas cars by 2035, reducing demand for oil and spurring partnerships across the nation and around the world. Responding to the Governor’s nature-based solutions executive order, which identified California’s lands as a critical yet underutilized sector in the fight against climate change, California last month released the Pathways to 30×30: Accelerating Conservation of California’s Nature strategy and Natural and Working Lands Climate Smart Strategy.\n\nView a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding signed today.\n\n###\n\nEleni Kounalakis is the 50th lieutenant governor of California and the first woman elected to the position. From 2010 to 2013, Kounalakis served as President Barack Obama’s Ambassador to the Republic of Hungary. In 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom designated Kounalakis as his Representative for International Affairs and Trade Development, and as Chair of the corresponding Interagency Committee that oversees the state’s trade, investment and international relations. Kounalakis is also alternating Chair of the three-member State Lands Commission, and a voting member of the University of California Board of Regents, the California State University Board of Trustees, and the California Community Colleges Board of Governors.",

    "Top 10 goalscorers for Netherlands national football team": "Some of the biggest legends of the game have played for the Dutch\n\nThe Netherlands have always been favourites at every tournament, due to their rich squad strength and extensive experience at major tournaments; despite only winning one major title, the Dutch remain a threat in a major competition.\n\nReaching the 2010 World Cup final and the 2014 World Cup semi-finals demonstrate how brilliant their players have been, despite not winning either. Their only World Cup win came in 1988, when they were led by the legendary Marco van Basten.\n\nThe Netherlands have struggled to win any competition since then. But they can now compete with any powerhouse, as the country has seen lethal strikers at their disposal. The national team consists of many world-class players at the moment. We have ranked them below.\n\n10. Johan Cruyff – 33 goals\n\nThe Netherlands’ greatest legend, Cruyff had the world at his feet both as a manager and a player. The way he inspired the Dutch team to become one of the best in the world is now a legend. Johan Cruyff was synonymous with football and led the Netherlands to the 1974 World Cup finals. He was an influential player, steering them to World Cup qualification in 1978, but was unable to participate due to high political unrest, and his family was threatened with kidnapping.\n\nCruyff retired with 33 goals in 48 games for the Netherlands after being named European Player of the Century in 1999 and runner-up in the World Player of the Century poll.\n\n9. Abe Lenstra – 33 goals\n\nAbe Lenstra was a member of the greatest Heerenveen team in history and was one of only a few players to score on his debut and final match for the national team. His awareness and eye for goal distinguished him as a great striker. He formed an excellent attacking partnership with Wilkes but was rarely used as a striker. Despite this, Lenstra managed to score 33 goals in 44 appearances.\n\n8. Ruud van Nistelrooy – 35 goals\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy scored 35 goals in 70 games for Netherlands (Courtesy: Manchester United)\n\nThe terrific striker had an illustrious club career as well as a starring role for the Netherlands on their way to glory. He did not win an international trophy, but he was an asset to the team, scoring 35 goals in 70 games for the Netherlands. His best performance came in the 2006 Euros when he scored four goals, but the Oranje were eliminated in the semi-final against Portugal. Nistelrooy’s last game came in 2008 in the Euros, where he scored a brace before hanging his boots.\n\n7. Faas Wilkes – 35 goals\n\nWilkes had one of the best goals per match ratio, 0.92, and his desire to score goals earned him a higher status with the national team, where he scored 35 goals in 38 appearances. Wilkes played fewer games, but his name was on every match scoresheet, well almost. Besides scoring goals, he was a creative player with excellent dribbling skills.\n\n6. Arjen Robben – 37 goals\n\nAlthough he was not used as a false nine, the pacy winger scored 37 goals in 96 appearances for the national team. Robben played in three World Cups and three Euros. He was the most important player in the squad, with a burst of speed that beat many defenders. He would have won the World Cup in 2010 if he hadn’t missed a one-on-one against Iker Casillas.\n\nAfter reaching the World Cup semi-finals in 2014, the Netherlands were unable to secure their place in the 2018 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich player subsequently announced his retirement.\n\n5. Dennis Bergkamp – 37 goals\n\nDespite scoring fewer goals, he was one of the most clever attackers in Dutch history. He was capable of netting as well as feeding goals to other players. His first international appearance was against Greece. His on-field mentality inspired the country to great runs in many World Cups, and the player was praised for his long-range goals. Bergkamp announced his retirement in Euro 2000, after losing on penalties to Italy and scoring 37 goals in 79 games.\n\n4. Patrick Kluivert – 40 goals\n\nKluivert, one of Europe’s most lethal strikers, scored his first national team goal against Malta in 1995, and the rest is history. The Dutch international was a big game player with exemplary striking abilities, scoring a famous goal against Argentina in the quarter-finals and an equaliser against Brazil in the 1998 World Cup. However, they lost in a penalty shootout, but Kluivert was a standout performer. He concluded his national career with 40 goals in 79 national team appearances.\n\n3. Memphis Depay – 42 goals\n\nDepay has scored 42 goals for the Dutch national team (Courtesy: Barcelona)\n\nDepay had a slow start, but he quickly picked up the momentum and is now only eight goals away from becoming the national team’s all-time leading scorer. His club performance impressed van Gaal, and he was called up by the manager for the 2014 World Cup. The current-Barcelona striker made a stellar debut as Netherlands were on the verge of drawing against Australia; Depay came on as a substitute and assisted Van Persie before scoring a goal, making him the national team’s youngest goal-scorer.\n\nThe player now has 42 goals to his name, and the team has qualified for the 2022 World Cup. Depay will have high ambitions in the tournament, as he will be their most reliable striker in the competition.\n\n2. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar – 42 goals\n\nHuntelaar may have flown under the radar by fans, but he is the Netherlands’ second-highest scorer, and his breakthrough came in 2006 when he scored a brace and assisted against Ireland. He hasn’t looked back since and has been on a goal-scoring streak ever since.\n\nHuntelaar went on to play in two European Championships and two World Cups, scoring 42 goals in 76 games. His best game came against San Marino when he scored three goals and assisted another.\n\n1. Robin van Persie – 50 goals\n\nVan Persie was a clinical finisher who scored many goals to become the Dutch team’s top scorer. In 102 appearances for the national team, the former Manchester United player scored 50 goals. Van Persie was integral in the Netherlands’ World Cup run in 2014, and his famous header against Spain was nominated for the Puskas award as well.\n\nIn the same tournament, he became the only player in World Cup history to score with his left foot, right foot, head, free-kick, and penalty. His last game was a 4-0 loss to France in a bid to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and join our community on Telegram.",
    "Netherlands, Croatia into Nations League Finals, France survives relegation": "London, Sept 25, 2022 (AFP) - Croatia and the Netherlands booked their places in the last four of the Nations League as holders France needed a favour to avoid relegation from the top tier on Sunday.\n\nLes Bleus lost 2-0 in Denmark to finish with just one win from their six group games, but Croatia's 3-1 win at Austria saved the world champions from the drop.\n\nDidier Deschamps will be hoping to have a number of key men back from injury by the time France's defence of the World Cup begins against Australia on November 22.\n\n\"It was a young French team, which for the most part does not yet have experience of the highest level,\" said Deschamps.\n\n\"Tonight is a dose of reality and what will be waiting for us in two months.\"\n\nFrance will also come up against the Danes in the group stage in Qatar and the Euro 2020 semi-finalists showed they are more than capable of causing more trouble in two months' time.\n\nBoth goals came before half-time as Kasper Dolberg stretched to turn home Mikkel Damsgaard's cross before Andreas Skov Olsen volleyed in from the edge of the area.\n\nFrance were without Hugo Lloris, Jules Kounde, N'Golo Kante, Paul Pogba, Ousmane Dembele and Karim Benzema through injury.\n\nBut the star trio of Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe failed to find a way back into the game for France.\n\nDenmark's win meant Croatia needed to get all three points in Austria to top the group.\n\nLuka Modric got the 2018 World Cup finalists off to a flying start, but they were quickly pegged back by Christoph Baumgartner's header.\n\nTwo goals in three second-half minutes proved decisive as Marko Livaja and Dejan Lovren headed in at the far post.\n\n\"Austria made our lives very hard, but in the end, the win was deserved,\" said Modric. \"I am very happy that we are in the top four.\"\n\nDefeat relegated Austria to League B.\n\nThe Netherlands made sure of top spot in Group A4 with a 1-0 win over Belgium thanks to Virgil van Dijk's header 17 minutes from time.\n\nThe Dutch just needed to avoid defeat by a three-goal margin after winning 4-1 in Brussels earlier in the group.\n\nA Belgian revival never looked likely. Van Dijk settled the game when he was left completely unmarked to head in a corner inside the six-yard box.\n\nIn the same group, Wales were relegated after losing 1-0 at home to Poland.\n\nKarol Swiderski scored the only goal in Cardiff from Robert Lewandowski's cushioned through ball.\n\nTurkey were already guaranteed promotion from League C, but were still embarrassed by a 2-1 defeat to the Faroe Islands.\n\nThe Faroes led 2-0 through Viljormur Davidsen and Joan Edmundsson before Serdar Gurler's late consolation for the side ranked 83 places higher in FIFA's world rankings.",

    "The Netherlands Returns 343 Pre-Hispanic Artifacts to Panama": "The Netherlands has returned a trove of pre-Hispanic artifacts to Panama, aiding the country as it works toward its goal of reclaiming looted cultural heritage from international collections.\n\nSome 343 ceramic objects were returned on August 29 in what Panama’s Foreign Minister, Erika Mouynes, has called the “largest repatriation of archaeological pieces in the history of Central America.” The Foreign Ministry also reported that another repatriation of heritage objects is set to be received from Italy.\n\nAccording to the ministry, this past March, Panama’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Elizabeth Ward, discovered the ceramic artifacts in the collection of the Leiden University, which supported their return. They will join the collection of the Reina Torres de Arauz archaeological museum in Panama City.\n\nThe Minister of Culture, Giselle González Villarrué, said in a statement that “the recovery of this Panamanian cultural good shows with facts, the fulfillment of our responsibility and commitment to rescue our identity, of our history as a source of social cohesion and collective pride.”\n\nHe added that “the archaeological assets recovered, as well as those that rest in different museums in the country, serve as an economic engine for cultural tourism that we develop, hence the importance of preserving them, restoring them and providing them with the value that allows an exhibition of these with their historical context.”",
    "‘It definitely isn’t flat’: Netherlands mountain trail proves an unlikely success": "The Netherlands, so the guidebook notes, has been “popularised as a flat land full of cheese and clogs”.\n\nEnthusiasts behind the Dutch Mountain Trail, a 63-mile (101km) hike across seven glorious peaks – two of which are made from the spoil of old mines – merely ask, only a little tongue in cheek, that the world stops being so narrow minded.\n\nEmerging from a local branch of an annual festival celebrating mountain films and culture across the globe, the “alpine” walk in the lowlands was first thought up in 2020 as the climate consequences of travel became ever-clearer and Covid made it difficult to get to the more traditional European summits.\n\n“That means not flying all over the world to chase your big mountains but also to look in your backyard,” said Toon Hezemans, 60, one of the creators of the trail in South Limburg, the southernmost region of the Netherlands, jutting into Belgium and Germany.\n\nA route was devised and word of mouth did the rest. It was an immediate success. An estimated 17,000 Dutch and German copies of a guide to the hike have been sold so far. This November, an English-language version will be published.\n\nAs to the potential issue of the lack of actual mountains in Europe’s flattest country, Hezemans, an artist by profession, questioned the very definition. “That’s a very interesting one,” he said, mentioning a Hugh Grant comedy, The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, But Came Down a Mountain.\n\nIn the movie, Welsh villagers are furious when English cartographers declare that their “mountain” is in fact a hill as it doesn’t meet the 1,000ft (305 metres) threshold. The locals build a mound on top of the summit to cheat the system.\n\nThe Dutch Mountain Trail in south Limburg. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Observer\n\nFor Hezemans and Andrew Davies, 65, his conspirator and the translator of the guidebook into English, that is not what a mountain is about. “I don’t think you ought to take 1,000ft as a definition because the word in Dutch is berg, which has a slightly different definition,” said Davies, who moved to the Netherlands from Manchester 38 years ago.\n\n“It depends on the surrounding,” insisted Hezemans, while overlooking the scenic valleys from a bench on the Eyserberg, a peak about 200 metres above sea level. “This one in the Himalayas won’t be a mountain. But you can see the church steeple of the Vijlen, they call themselves the only mountain village of the Netherlands, and they actually have a football team who recently played in the international mountain village football championship.”\n\nWith alpine people it is, he said, a matter of shared perspectives. A mountain is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n“OK,” he added, walking on, “maybe there aren’t mountains here but it definitely isn’t flat.”\n\nSouth Limburg is the country’s most elevated region, with deep(ish) valleys carved out by fast-flowing rivers and streams, and the trail criss-crosses the borders with Belgium and Germany. You are never more than six miles from an international border.\n\nThe walk, which Hezemans insisted can actually be arduous at points, starts at Eygelshoven railway station, near the town of Kerkrade, with the first goal being to reach the top of Wilhelminaberg, about 225 metres above sea level, a former spoil heap of the Wilhelmina coalmine, which was operational between 1906 and 1969.\n\nAfter that, the walker heads to the foothills of Schneeberg, whose highest point is over the border in Germany and literally translates as “snow mountain”. Its place in the Dutch Mountain Trail is, Hezemans admitted, a bit of cheat.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has a very nice meadow and alpine flowers blooming there.”\n\nNext up is Gulperberg (155 metres above sea level): “That’s really a mountain, with a statue of Mother Mary on top, looking over the town of Gulpen – maybe the most mountainous mountain, with a cone shape.” Then it is Hakkenberg (a little over 200 metres above sea level), where “the half-timbered houses in the valley make the ‘mountain experience’ complete”, according to the walk’s guide. This peak did not have a name until Hezemans named it after a path to its top.\n\nThe Dutch mountain trail is being pushed as an alternative holiday experience to Amsterdam. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian\n\nThe trail then crosses into Belgium, where, during the first world war, the border was marked by a 206-mile high-voltage fence, from Vaals to the North Sea coast, known as the “wire of death”. The sixth peak is Voerstreek, which in the 1970s was the scene of clashes between French- and Dutch-speakers over the area’s language.\n\n“Tourism saved the area, as at some point they realised the battles weren’t helping attract tourists,” said Hezemans.\n\nThe trail’s final summit is D’n Observant in Maastricht, a manmade spoil heap from the upper layers of Sint Pietersberg, which over the centuries was extensively quarried for its marlstone.\n\nHezemans admitted to being a bit bemused when prospective walkers writing on a dedicated Facebook page ask whether they should bring ropes or wonder whether they should risk an outbreak of vertigo. “That I don’t get,” he laughed.\n\nPassing by on her third day of the walk, Esther Ruijtenbeek, 46, a textile designer, was just over 30 miles into the trail and said she had two blisters overnight and the heat was proving a challenge. But a Dutch mountain trail? “I am a little sceptical perhaps,” she laughed. “It is good preparation for mountain hiking.”",
    "Coinbase enters the Netherlands with central bank approval": "The United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase continues its aggressive expansion in Europe, with the latest regulatory approval coming from the land of tulips.\n\nCoinbase officially announced on Thursday that it had received registration from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the central bank of the Netherlands. The regulatory approval allows Coinbase to offer its retail and institutional crypto products in the Netherlands.\n\nAccording to the official DNB records, Coinbase is one of the major international exchanges approved by the Dutch central bank to operate cryptocurrency services alongside smaller local crypto firms. Coinbase Europe Limited and Coinbase Custody International are listed on DNB’s public register as crypto service providers.\n\nThe Dutch regulator is supervising Coinbase Europe and Coinbase Custody in compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act and the Sanctions Act.\n\n“The crypto services of Coinbase are not subject to prudential supervision by DNB,” Coinbase said in the announcement. Financial and operational risks related to crypto services are not monitored, \"and there is no specific financial consumer protection.”\n\nThe news comes shortly after DNB published guidance dedicated to policy on sanctions screening for crypto transactions on Sept. 16. In the Q&A document, DNB warned about various risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including anonymity.\n\nCoinbase’s entrance into the Netherlands comes in line with the company’s aggressive expansion plans in Europe. The crypto exchange initially announced its intention to expand its reach in Europe in June, citing the impact of a major decline on crypto markets.\n\nIn July, Coinbase obtained the Crypto Asset Service Provider approval from the Italian AML regulator, Organismo Agenti e Mediatori. The exchange is planning to register in countries like Spain and France.\n\nAccording to the latest post, Coinbase now serves customers across almost 40 European countries through dedicated hubs in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Germany. “Additional registrations or license applications are in progress in several major markets, in compliance with local regulations,” the firm said.\n\nRelated: Coinbase is fighting back as the SEC closes in on Tornado Cash\n\nCoinbase’s global expansion comes amid the company facing many issues. The crypto exchange posted major losses over two consecutive quarters in 2022, with Q2 losses netting $1.1 billion. That was the largest loss since Coinbase listed its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in April 2021. To cut expenses, Coinbase cut 18% of employees in June.\n\nIn July, U.S. authorities arrested a former Coinbase manager, alleging that the exec was involved in insider crypto trading. Another two lawsuits in the United States also claimed that Coinbase was making deceptive claims about its business practices.",

    "FIBA: Israel plays the Netherlands on Saturday": "Israel will play the Netherlands tomorrow at 3 p.m. ET in their second match of EuroBasket Group D play. Let’s break down Israel’s last game, look at the Netherlands’ roster and more.\n\nThe Israel men’s national basketball team upset Finland in their first match of EuroBasket 2022. Washington Wizards forward Deni Avdija scored 23 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in his first major tournament for a national team.\n\nעבודה מצוינת DENI!!!!!\n\nThe Israelis won’t have much rest before facing off against the Netherlands, who are coming off a 100-76 loss to Serbia earlier today. The result should be no surprise, considering that recent NBA MVP Nikola Jokic plays for the Serbs. The Dutch don’t have any NBA talent and most play domestically in the BNXT League, which also includes teams from Belgium.\n\nThe one player who is on an American team at any level right now is Syracuse forward Jesse Edwards, who is still too undeveloped at the moment. That said, there are some others who have played college basketball in the States in the past. Starting center Matt Haarms played at Purdue and BYU from 2017-21 and was considered a possible NBA draft prospect. Olaf Schaftenaar played college basketball at Oregon State from 2012-16.\n\nThe Netherlands’ starting point guard, Keye van der Vuurst de Vries, made himself available for the NBA Draft this year though he wasn’t selected. He’s just 20 years old and played on four straight Belgian or BNXT championship teams with Filou Oostende. In fact, he was the Finals MVP this past season for the Belgian-only tournament in the league.\n\nI won’t write off a team before it hits the court because of a lack of NBA players or familiarity. But my feeling is that Israel shouldn’t have much trouble beating the Netherlands and getting a much-needed 2-0 record in group play tomorrow.\n\nTo this point in BF history, most things we mentioned in the Dutch language had to do with Belgium when Emma Meesseman played for the Mystics. Now, I guess we’re going to use that for the country we associate the Dutch language with the most — right at the source!\n\nAbout the Netherlands\n\nCapital: The Constitution states that the capital is Amsterdam. However, the seat of government is in The Hague.\n\nThe Constitution states that the capital is Amsterdam. However, the seat of government is in The Hague. Population: 17.7 million\n\n17.7 million National Anthem: Het Wilhelmus (The Wilhelmus)\n\nMost well-known companies from the Netherlands: The Netherlands is the lowest ranked team in Group D, but it is otherwise one of the most powerful countries in the world. Heineken, Unilever, Philips, IKEA, and Ahold Delhaize are among the many global companies headquartered here. Shell was also founded here though it’s now headquartered in the UK (h/t CDKA). The Netherlands is also known as one of the European Union’s tax havens, so major American companies also host their European headquarters in the country like Uber and Nike.\n\nThe Netherlands is the lowest ranked team in Group D, but it is otherwise one of the most powerful countries in the world.

Attractions I would like to see in the Netherlands: I would like to go on a private boat tour along the historic city center of Amsterdam and see its four most notable canals: The Singel, Herengracht (Lords’ canal), Keizersgracht (Emperor’s canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince’s Canal) on a summer weekend afternoon.\n\nI would like to go on a private boat tour along the historic city center of Amsterdam and see its four most notable canals: The Singel, Herengracht (Lords’ canal), Keizersgracht (Emperor’s canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince’s Canal) on a summer weekend afternoon. Other things the Netherlands is known for to Americans: The Netherlands colonized what is now much of New York City and New York state in the 17th century. They are also known for their socially tolerant culture compared to most of the world, even western countries. Finally, the Netherlands is where the US ended the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom with the Treaty of Ghent* which was signed in 1814 and ratified in 1815. In short, the Netherlands is arguably the country with the strongest relationship with the United States, all things considered. And then, there are the klompen (wooden shoes), windmills and land reclamation.\n\nThe Netherlands colonized what is now much of New York City and New York state in the 17th century.

    "Queen Of Netherlands Visits With Texas A&M-Galveston Faculty To Discuss Climate": "Queen Máxima of the Netherlands visited the Greater Houston area last week to discuss climate concerns and flood mitigation. Four Texas A&M University at Galveston faculty members were involved in her exclusive visit.\n\nThe Galveston Campus’ Sam Brody, professor in the Department of Marine and Coastal Environmental Science (MCES) and director of the Institute for a Disaster Resilient Texas (IDRT), interacted with the Dutch queen and her royal contingent on multiple occasions during her visit.\n\nThanks to Brody’s extensive research on flood mitigation strategies and urban planning, he was chosen to moderate a speaking engagement and discussion with the queen, also including Galveston Campus faculty researcher Jens Figlus, and IDRT’s Yoonjeong Lee. Absent due to health reasons was MCES Professor and George P. Mitchell Chair Bill Merrell, originator of the Ike Dike, and instigator of building a coastal spine in Texas similar to the Dutch’s Maeslant barrier.\n\n“I actually presented a book to the queen, a compendium marking our 13-year collaboration with the Dutch,” said Brody. “It traces all of the threads of our intellectual exchange focused on this project, our kind of symbiotic educational relationship that all started thanks to Dr. Merrell.”\n\nBrody said in the decades since the “massive coastal resiliency project” was sparked in the mind of Merrell, hundreds of Dutch and American students have enjoyed the benefits of the National Science Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) educational exchange program\n\n\n\nThe coastal flood risk reduction program allows for Aggie by the Sea students, as well as those from the University of Houston, Rice University, the Delft University of Technology and more to explore the many synergistic components of flood risk management.\n\n“Overall, it felt celebratory. It’s a historic time to celebrate how far we’ve come, to talk about the future, the important role of research, and how education stimulates massive projects and undertakings,” Brody said.\n\nHe emphasized to the queen the importance of recognizing the power of scientific research in the context of academics informed by very real-world issues.\n\n“I traced the story of how this now-$30 billion project, the Ike Dike, sprang from the mind of a Galveston professor, and from an applied research setting,” he said. “Our campus – even though it’s relatively small – is playing a central role in driving this whole project.”\n\nBrody said the queen and her ministers were especially interested in the natural aspects of the coastal spine proposal.\n\n“They were enthusiastic about having dunes and other ecologically restorative considerations built into the design of the barrier,” he explained.\n\nBrody reflected on the nature of the visit and the growth of the partnership with the Netherlands.\n\n“We really want to keep this collaboration going, this transfer of knowledge. I think we’d be wise to get the private sector involved. Mainly though,” Brody laughed, “I was trying really hard to not step on the queen’s shoes, while also instilling the fact that the literal Queen of The Netherlands would not be here talking to me, visiting us, if Dr. Merrell hadn’t taken such a global interest in this work all those years ago.”",
    "Vote to join the Netherlands, Dutch satirist urges Russians": "A video by Dutch satirist Arjen Lubach encouraging Russians to vote to become part of the Netherlands has been watched by millions of people – and lots of viewers seem to support the idea.\n\nThe video, prompted by the forthcoming referendums organized by Russia in occupied parts of Ukraine, has also reached a Russian audience – and is circulating on Russian Telegraam groups, the AD said.\n\n‘If he [Putin] can do it, we can do it too,’ Lubach said, introducing the clip on his daily Avondshow.\n\nРеферендум о присоединении России к Нидерландам. Какая хорошая идея! Голосуйте ЗА, дорогие россияне. Пора!pic.twitter.com/X8Rm723CG0 — Olaf Koens (@obk) September 22, 2022\n\nIn the video, Lubach urges Russians to vote to become part of the Netherlands because of the long history between the two countries. ‘Our king Willem IV is your king as well,’ he says. ‘In 1816, Anna Paulowna, the daughter of tzar Paul 1, married Willem II, one of Willem IV’s ancestors.’\n\nPossible names for the new province could include Rusburg, Rustrecht, Gooi-en Russia, East-Holland, Frusia, or Over-Russel,’ the video suggested.\n\nSupport\n\nRussian nationals have been quick to support the initiative on YouTube. ‘As a Russian citizen I would definitely vote “yes” just tell me where to put my signature, time to restore the justice,’ said Viktor.\n\n‘I’m Russian and I vote for Holland,’ said Pekta. ‘When do I get my passport?’\n\nAnother viewer pointed out that there were more links between the two countries than Lubach had mentioned. ‘You forgot to mention that the former capital of the Russian Empire was inspired by Netherlands, even the name Saint Petersburg came from Dutch. We literally have an island named New Holland here!,’ wrote Vera.\n\nLubach first went global with the video, America First, Netherlands Second – an introduction to the Netherlands for Donald Trump when he became president in 2017."
