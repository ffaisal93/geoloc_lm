    "A Look At PauknAir Flight 4101's Crash In Morocco": "The story of how a Spanish BAE 146 crashed in North Africa, killing all passengers and crew.\n\nExactly 24 years ago yesterday, a PauknAir British Aerospace 146 with the registration EC-GEO crashed short of Melilla Airport (MLN) in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on the Moroccan coast. With an area of just 4.7 square miles and a population of 87,000, Melilla is one of two autonomous Spanish cities in Morocco, the other being Ceuta.\n\nThe plane involved in the crash was the seventh BAe 146 ever built, making its first flight in 1983 before being delivered new to British Airways. A year later, the plane went to Dan-Air London. It later went into storage for several years before being acquired by Spanish regional airline PauknAir in 1995.\n\nThe plane departed Malaga for North Africa early in the morning\n\nOn September 25, 1998, the plane took off from what is now Malaga Costa del Sol Airport (AGP) for the short 129-mile hop over the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the coast of Morocco.\n\nIt takes around 55 minutes to fly from Malaga to Melilla. Image GCmaps\n\nIn charge of the flight was 39-year-old Captain Diego Clavero Muñoz, assisted by 28-year-old First Officer Bartolomé Jiménez.\n\nFlight 4101 departed Malaga at 07:25 local time and climbed to a cruising altitude of 14,000 feet. The co-pilot then contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Seville, asking for clearance to descend to 7,000 feet which was approved. Two minutes later, the now inbound aircraft was cleared to descend a further 2,000 to flight level FL 50 and contact Melilla tower for instructions. During the conversation, the co-pilot informed Melilla Tower that they were 30 nautical miles out, descending to 5,000 feet.\n\nThe BAE 146 that crashed was the 7th of its type built. Photo: Uli Elch via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nMelilla Tower reported that Runway 33 was in use with visibility of five miles and a few clouds at 1,000 feet with five knots of wind. At 06:45 Moroccan time, the co-pilot told Melilla Tower that they were now at 3,000 feet, 22 nautical miles from the runway. As the descent continued, the aircraft crossed the Moroccan coast at an altitude of 1,100 feet.\n\nThe area is impacted by low clouds\n\nBecause of Melilla Airport's location on Cape Tres Forcas, visibility is often a problem as clouds accumulate in the steep valleys formed by the mountains of the cape. As the descent into Melilla continued flying under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the pilot complained of fog and could be heard saying, \"I see nothing.\" At 06:49, the GPWS alarm warned the pilots that they were dangerously close to the ground. At about 890 feet, the GPWS alarm sounded again, \"Whoop, whoop, Pull Up, Whoop, whoop, Pull Up.\" At 06:50, the aircraft impacted the ground at 886 feet, killing all 38 passengers and crew.\n\nEl 25-09-1998, hace 23 años hoy, un avión #BAE146 (EC-GEO) de la compañía española #PauknAir, se estrelló contra una montaña 8 millas al Norte del Aeropuerto de #Melilla. Era el #Vuelo4101. Murieron 38 personas (34 pax y 4 tripulantes). Hoy, descansan en Paz y para siempre ➡ pic.twitter.com/zMXkjYo58Y — Iván Castro Palacios (@ivancp25) September 25, 2021\n\nThe investigation into the crash of PauknAir Flight 4101\n\nIn its final report into the incident, the accident investigation concluded that the crash was due to impact with terrain while flying under IMC conditions. The crash was put down as being a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), listing several contributing factors, which were:\n\nThe non-application of arrival procedures, including descending below a safe altitude.\n\nPoor working communication between the captain and first officer.\n\nA non-application of guidelines regarding the ground proximity warning system (GPWS).",
    "In Morocco, a new take on working vacations": "Listen 14 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\n“Welcome to Dar Naima,” I exclaimed, as I ushered two Spanish tourists into the opulent parlor of a Moroccan guesthouse in Fez. The visitors looked slightly perplexed — not because an American was greeting them, an origin story I would later share, but because of the man lurking in the doorway, his face several shades of agitation.\n\n“He wants us to pay him, but we didn’t ask him to carry our luggage,” said one of the sisters, who were traveling around Morocco together.\n\nI explained that porters linger in the parking areas outside the medina and will cart bags through the car-free zone, sometimes without asking first. To defuse the situation, I reached into my wallet, pulled out a 10-dirham coin and paid the man. He asked for 20, but I firmly shook my head, as I had seen my host do. He departed with a huff, and our guests sank into the cushioned couch with relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than 24 hours on the job — and in the country — I was already fulfilling several of my responsibilities as a work exchange volunteer. (I presumed paying off the disgruntled porter fell under “guest assistance.”) I had flown a red-eye from Washington to Casablanca and caught about a four-hour train to Fez for the primary purpose of helping out at the hostel — plus several fringe benefits. In return for pitching in wherever and whenever, I received free accommodations, daily breakfast and a sense of contentment knowing that, in some small way, I was alleviating the pain caused by the pandemic.\n\n“We had to close for two years,” said Hannan Diab, the 42-year-old owner who, until several months ago, had been running the property single-handedly. “It has been so hard. We need more people to come.”\n\nThe global health crisis has ravaged the travel and tourism sector, causing debilitating hardships. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the industry lost almost $4.9 trillion and 62 million jobs in 2020. In 2021, the industry recouped more than 18.2 million jobs globally, but gaps remain. For instance, the July employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 1.5 million openings in the U.S. leisure and hospitality market, a 74 percent fill rate. The American Hotel & Lodging Association does not expect staffing to return to 2019 levels for at least another two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Demand is back, but hotels can’t fill rooms, because they don’t have the staff,” said Chip Rogers, the association’s president and chief executive. “A lot of people are leaving the industry.”\n\nTo attract employees, lodgings are raising wages, offering more flexible schedules and ramping up the benefits, such as covering continuing-education expenses. Others are compensating for the labor shortage by limiting housekeeping, streamlining food-and-beverage menus and relying more on technology, such as mobile check-in, digital keys and room service delivered by robots that resemble paper shredders with personality.\n\nSmaller, independent lodgings without HR departments or a strata of managers can pursue more audacious hiring practices. Bob Monahan, who owns Hostel du Nord in Duluth, Minn., has employed former guests who overstayed their travel budgets. This summer, he welcomed a professor from Mexico City who responded to a “volunteer wanted” post on Worldpackers, a work exchange website.\n\n“He was the best employee I’ve ever had,” Monahan said of the educator, who he said plans to return for a second stint in November.\n\nThough not always advertised, many establishments around the world accept travelers as temporary workers on a quid pro quo basis. The arrangement — to change sheets or wash dishes for room and board — is a win for both sides. The hotel can plug holes in staffing, and for the traveler, the free accommodations and meals can lessen the sting of escalating expenses, which these days include such basic necessities as food and fuel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It won’t fill millions of jobs,” Donna Quadri-Felitti, the Marvin Ashner endowed director of Pennsylvania State University’s School of Hospitality Management, said of work exchange programs, “but it is a fun idea.”\n\nTo find a volunteer opportunity, you can cold-call — or email or DM — a property. I messaged Heb Hostel in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides and received this positive reply: “We ask for 20 hours of work (mostly cleaning with some reception) in exchange for free accommodation in a dorm, free laundry and access to the free food cupboard. Mostly dry foods and some veg.” For more expansive searches with a high rate of success, I also signed up for Worldpackers and its fraternal twin, Workaway.\n\n“Before the pandemic, it was more budget travelers and people on sabbaticals,” Ricardo Lima, the chief executive and co-founder of Worldpackers, said from his home in Brazil. “Now, it is especially used by Gen Z and people who are asking, ‘How can I help?’ ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorkaway, which was founded 20 years ago, and Worldpackers, which is approximately a decade younger, do not charge to browse. For no cost but eyestrain, you can scan pages of listings, which include such essential information as location, description of tasks, daily time commitment, sleeping accommodations (often shared) and preferred skills or personality type. To apply for a position, however, you must pay an annual membership fee ($49), plus create a profile that is equal parts dating bio and résumé.\n\nThe sites corral thousands of opportunities on six continents, such as helping maintain and sail an electric catamaran in New Zealand, care for rescue animals at a shelter on the Galápagos Islands or manage the social media accounts of a desert camp in Jordan. Sympathetic to the struggles of hoteliers, I focused on guesthouses and hostels needing an extra pair of hands in housekeeping or at the front desk.\n\nOn Workaway, I discovered a familiar face: a lodge and bakery in Talkeetna, Alaska, where I had spent a weekend chasing down the northern lights and baking pies. In the “Help” section, the owner wrote that she had trimmed the staff down to one (herself). I submitted a request but never heard back. The site’s support team told me this happens and to move on.\n\nSo I did, to British Columbia. I corresponded with an inn on Cormorant Island, but the manager later sent me an apologetic note informing me that our calendars were not aligned. A family near the Black Sea in Turkey invited me to their guesthouse to clean rooms, tend the garden, feed the animals and entertain their daughter, but I had to decline because of the region’s fraught political situation. I took a swig of coffee and sent out a second wave of applications — to a hostel on Scotland’s Isle of Skye, a boutique hotel in the Austrian Alps, an eco-resort in Costa Rica and a rental property owner in Greece. No matches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was about to suspend my quest when a cheer erupted in my inbox: “Andrea, you’ve been chosen to be part of Dar Naima Fes Team as a Worldpacker! Yeah!”\n\nI returned the “Yeah!” in the form of a confirmation.\n\nFor two years, no guests slept in Dar Naima’s six private rooms or eight-bed dormitory. No visitors sat down for a traditional Moroccan breakfast on the rooftop terrace. No new voices filled the 600-year-old riad inhabited by five generations of one Fez family.\n\nPre-pandemic, a staff of three cared for up to 30 international guests. The hostel reopened in March, and one employee — the tireless Amina Tawssi — has been cooking and cleaning six days a week for a trickle of primarily European visitors.\n\n“I hope we can get back to three staff in December,” Hannan, the owner, said one evening, when we were eating grapes and drinking mint tea under a periwinkle North African sky.\n\nI was the fourth laborer to land on Dar Naima’s doorstep. My predecessor, a Colombian woman who stayed for a month, taught Spanish to Hannan and produced alluring videos for the property’s Instagram account. My assets, I soon discovered, were my strong legs and native tongue.\n\nHannan put me on breakfast duty, which, as I informed guests during check-in, “is served on the terrace between 9 and 10:30.” However, when adjusted for Moroccan time and the volunteer’s jet lag, breakfast actually started closer to half past the hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe staff had previously prepared the morning meal in the rooftop kitchen, which the riad’s restaurant also used before it temporarily shuttered. (Morocco last suspended air travel in November and restored service in February.) Hannan was waiting for a part to repair the fridge. This meant that Amina had to whip up breakfast in the second-floor kitchen, and I had to scale several flights of steep steps carrying a silver tray laden with a carafe of coffee, a silver pot of tea, breads with spreads and eggs in a ceramic tagine pot. I often had to repeat trips when Amina would notice my empty hands, pantomime “tray” and point to the stairs.\n\nIn addition to serving, I was also a sous chef. My first job was to fill the tagine condiment vessels with strawberry and apricot jams and margarine. I graduated to squeezing oranges for the juice (an electric juicer, thankfully, so no wrist strain to hamper my tray-carrying duties) and slicing baguettes purchased from the charmingly gruff vendor around the corner. Amina, who was warming to my presence in her personal space, taught me a few skills along the way, such as how to make the sacred mint tea. On my third morning, she presented me with my very own apron.\n\n“This is the best breakfast I have had in Morocco,” a Russian guest named Alex said as I cleared his table. I passed the compliment on to the Arabic-speaking chef, giving a thumbs-up over the empty plates. (A possible misinterpretation of my charade: I nailed busing the tables.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannan typically did not need me again until later in the day, when I checked in guests or replied in English to booking requests. One afternoon, when we were not expecting any new arrivals, she showed me an English-language workbook. “I need help with verb tenses,” she said. Her 15-year-old son, Mohammed, joined us at the outdoor table. I quickly realized they had a firmer grasp of English grammar than I did. “I know how to say it but not why,” I admitted to my students.\n\nHannan suggested I watch YouTube videos of Molly Stone, an English as a second language educator, to improve my understanding of the language and sharpen my teaching skills. That night, as children squealed and cats howled beneath my window, I prepared for our next lesson. “Present continuous in the future,” I wrote in my notebook, which also contained a few Arabic words I was planning to try out on Amina.\n\nBetween my shifts, I wandered around the medina, forcing myself to navigate the maze of shops without the aid of GPS and testing my resolve not to buy any pottery, carpets, baskets or spices. (I aced one challenge and failed the other.) I took air-conditioned breaks at Carrefour, a French supermarket in the newer part of Fez. While there, I would pick up apples and carrots for the patients at American Fondouk, a charitable hospital for horses and donkeys along my route. I chatted with guests about their adventures to Meknes and the Merenid Tombs but never visited either. I didn’t want to stray too far, in case duty called.\n\n“I need you,” Hannan texted me one morning on WhatsApp. I turned back from my walk to receive my assignment: Transfer the information from the guests’ contact forms to the registration book. “I don’t have time to do it,” she told me, as she attempted to herd her four children like a shepherd with a rogue flock.\n\nA few days later, while at a pottery factory outside the medina, I received an urgent call from Alex, the Russian guest. He had departed with the room key. We triangulated a pickup, dispatching Hannan’s husband to the train station minutes before boarding time. I felt as if I had stumbled into a Jason Bourne plot, with less dire risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point during my two-week stay, I transcended from hired help to honorary family member. On Hannan’s day off, a Sunday, I held the riad down while she took her family swimming. She sent me a photo of a clear blue river and a promise to bring me along next time. The following weekend, she informed me that we were going to Carrefour (shorthand for the mall that also houses the supermarket) and the Atlas Mountains to visit cousins. We piled into her husband’s compact car, parents in the front, me squished in the back with the kids. Her husband stopped the car, and three of us jumped out.\n\nHannan, her 7-year-old daughter, Hiba, and I walked hand-in-hand down narrow medieval lanes to a hair salon. Hiba wanted her hair straightened for the first day of school. I waited on the couch with the moms, encouraging her through the mirror to stay strong as the stylist annihilated her curls with what looked like a ray gun. Afterward, we hailed a taxi to Carrefour — the Atlas outing had been inexplicably axed — for back-to-school shopping and ice cream, a universal ritual.\n\nHannan left me in charge of Hiba, so she could buy clothes without her daughter’s sartorial objections. Steps from home, we climbed to the top deck of a restaurant. I ordered a honey, ginger and lemon drink for myself and a pot of honey for Hiba. We curled up on one of the restaurant’s couches and watched Disney videos until work roused us from our sugar-induced stupor: A Californian wanted to settle her bill.\n\nI departed on the same morning as the last guest I had checked in, an Italian residing in Madrid. Hannan handed me a gift — a tagine condiment holder, a piece of dishware I knew all too well — and invited me to breakfast with her mother, who lived in the riad. Amina joined us, the four ladies of the manor gathered around the table one final time.\n\nOn her phone, Hannan showed me a request from a Worldpacker volunteer from Brazil. I read his profile and approved. “Can you reply to him, please?” she asked me.\n\nI started typing away in English. “We would love to have you come help out at the hostel,” I wrote, before changing the “We” to “I.”\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nPotential travelers should take local and national public health directives regarding the pandemic into consideration before planning any trips.

    "Morocco: Iconic women’s rights advocate Aicha Chenna passes away – The North Africa Post": "Aicha Chenna, the iconic women’s rights advocate who was part of the first generation of Moroccan women who raised the banner of the struggle for equality and the promotion of women’s rights in Morocco passed away on Saturday at the age of 81 and was laid to rest on Sunday.\n\nAicha Chenna was born on August 14, 1941 in Casablanca. She left to live in Marrakech before returning to Casablanca in 1953. Fatherless, she studied nursing and then worked as a health and social education moderator in the Ministry of Health. Very early, she had to deal with vulnerable women and issues that were considered as social and religious taboos. She is leaving behind a valuable legacy in matters of women’s rights as she was one of the most prominent defenders of these rights and as she tirelessly struggled and took initiatives that sought to empower women, especially single mothers.\n\nIt was an uphill task. Single mothers are ostracized in Moroccan society and so are their children born out of wedlock. Yet, Aicha Chenna managed to endure all difficulties, and out of sheer determination, she confronted all criticism.\n\nIn 1985, she founded the Association Solidarité féminine (ASF) for the defense of women’s rights and abandoned children. It was the first association in Morocco to offer training and literacy courses to give financial and professional independence to single mothers and victims of rape, often rejected by their families and by society.\n\nShe made of the advocacy for single mothers a life battle to grant these women the rights they did not have, as she fought for the status of illegitimate and abandoned children and of incest victims.\n\nAicha Chenna’s activism, recognized at the national and international level, has been supported by King Mohammed VI. She once said: “The King has shown me his blessing and has given me the key to the success of my mission. His encouragement, his high concern and his magnanimous gestures strengthen my conviction and give me every day the strength and courage to continue.”\n\nShe was awarded for her remarkable work of activism back in 2009, when she won the $1 million Opus Prize, which she said would be used to ensure that her foundation carries on its work even after her death.\n\n“Today, Morocco has lost a symbol of the feminist human rights struggle…Aicha Chenna was the mother of all, and her achievements in the human rights field will remain a source of pride for all Moroccans,” commented university professor and researcher in sociology, Somaya Noaman guessous.\n\nAicha Chenna, or the Mother-Courage, who made great sacrifices at the expense of her time and personal life for the sake of single mothers, in order to preserve their dignity, render justice for children born out of wedlock, and to reverberate the voice of vulnerable groups, especially women, will always be remembered as an icon of feminism and activism in Morocco and beyond.",
    "Morocco: Free activist Rida Benotmane immediately and drop all charges against him": "Ahead of tomorrow’s hearing by a court in Rabat on the case of human rights defender Rida Benotmane, who is being prosecuted for criticising the authorities on YouTube and Facebook, Amna Guellali, Deputy director for Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International said:\n\n\n\n“The only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos. His case is just the latest attempt by the authorities to use absurd prosecutions to silence critical voices and highlights the worrying crackdown in Morocco on freedom of expression.\n\nThe only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos Amna Guellali, Amnesty International\n\n\n\n“Rida Benotmane should be freed immediately and these bogus charges against him dropped. The Moroccan authorities must ensure that people are able to exercise their freedom of expression without fear of reprisals.”\n\n\n\nAmnesty International has reviewed court files showing that the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) in Casablanca interrogated Rida Benotmane over a Facebook post he published on 13 September 2021, which called for a public march against abuses by security forces. Police also questioned him over two YouTube videos published in August 2021, in which he denounced the authorities for ignoring people’s demands for social justice and warned against the potential use of COVID vaccine passes as a tool of repression.\n\nBenotmane was arrested on 9 September and charged the next day with “insulting a body regulated by law”, “insulting public officials while carrying out their duties”, and “broadcasting and distributing false allegations without consent” under articles 265, 263, and 447-2 of the Penal Code respectively. He was also charged with breaching the decree law on the state of health emergency. He will appear before the Rabat first instance court on 22 September.\n\nBenotmane, a member of the Moroccan Association for the defense of human rights (AMDH) and a political activist who has already spent four years in jail, is currently on hunger strike in protest at his detention.\n\nBackground\n\nMoroccan authorities have increasingly targeted dissenting voices in recent months.\n\nIn April 2022, Saida el Alami, a human rights defender and member of the “Femmes Marocaines Contre la Detention Politique” collective, was sentenced to two years in prison for posting about her ill-treatment by the police and for criticizing the repression of journalists and activists. Blogger Rabie al-Ablaq was also sentenced in the same month to four years in prison for offending the king in two videos posted on social media.",
    "Morocco combats the needs by importing more than 5 million tonnes of cereals": "In a context where Ukraine, one of the main wheat producers, is at war, and in a situation of climatic emergency, the Moroccan government has also seen an increase in cereal shortages. For this reason, Morocco has implemented a series of measures to avoid shortages and the impact on the local market. In this sense, the Kingdom has increased the number of grain suppliers.\n\nCountries such as Argentina and France will be new suppliers to the country. Both nations will join the list of more than 25 countries to which the Alawi kingdom opened up in 2021 to guarantee the supply of domestic needs. The state of grain stocks in Europe and Argentina for the 2022/2023 season would be assured, according to projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forestry. In addition, they add that the harvest data for these countries for this new year are encouraging and remain stable.\n\nTo this we must add the cereal produced within the country. According to data from the balance of the previous season, more than 34 million quintals were produced. This includes 18.9 million quintals of soft wheat, 8.1 million quintals of durum wheat and 7 million quintals of barley. The government also granted a premium for imported grain from November 2021.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - Grain\n\nThese volumes of grain can be imported thanks to the large number of global grain shippers with whom the Moroccan government cooperates. According to Intercereales (a group of French cereal exporters), \"imports of common wheat would be 4.5 to 5 million tonnes next year due to the drought. France has already delivered nearly one million quintals of wheat during the summer months, according to Yann Lebeau, head of the group of professionals in the Maghreb region at Intercereales in a press release. By the end of this year, the country is expected to receive a total of 2.5 million quintals of wheat from France. Thanks to this strategy of diversification of cereal sources, Morocco has been shielded from external fluctuations, due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which are, respectively, the second and third largest supplier of soft wheat to the Kingdom, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the collaboration of the agencies concerned and the country's government is working to meet the country's five-month consumption needs. Tensions in certain parts of the country complicate the situation. The objective of the measures imposed by the Executive is to mitigate the impact on the purchasing power of citizens due to the rise in prices and the inflation rate. The significant increase in Morocco's import bill is linked to products such as barley and soybean oil. The increase in prices rose compared to the previous year by 47.4%, in the case of barley by as much as 820 %. Foods such as sugar, tea and edible oils, which are considered staples, would be the first to be affected by the measures, according to the Royal High Guidelines. Possible scenarios for stockpiling of staple food stocks, such as those mentioned above, were also set out and an inventory of existing storage facilities for both raw materials and finished products was discussed.\n\nPHOTO/AFP - Terminal I of the port of Tangier Med\n\nIn his speech to Parliament on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the first legislative year, King Mohammed VI called for the implementation of a policy of stockpiling strategic commodities, \"we will first of all stress the necessary consolidation of Morocco's position and the imperative defence of its superior interests, particularly in the current situation which brings with it challenges, risks and threats. Indeed, the pandemic crisis has revealed the strong return of the sovereignty issue. Whether it be health, energy, industrial, food or other, the preservation of sovereignty has become the subject of a real competition, which is causing some people to react feverishly\".",

    "The Farce of Normalization: A Taste of Morocco and a Sip of \"Israel\"": "Normalizing ties with \"Israel\" is the official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions.\n\nCanada’s leading Zionist lobby group held its annual parliamentary reception on September 20, 2022, and dedicated it to the \"Abraham Accords\" and in particular, the growing ties between Morocco and \"Israel\". The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) picked up where they left off before Covid shut down such in-person events; and their Twitter feed was full of photos of various parliamentarians, including Canadian cabinet ministers, who attended the reception.\n\n“A taste of Morocco and a sip of Israel” was the theme for the night and highlighted the shameful normalization between the two. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada was there, and the Moroccan embassy itself was a cosponsor of the event along with the Israeli embassy. Interestingly, on its official Facebook account, the Moroccan embassy downplayed the other cosponsors and made no explicit mention of the involvement of \"Israel\" and its lobby group in organizing the reception, simply saying “Morocco guest of honor of the 2022 annual successful parliamentary reception, held this evening in Ottawa..”.\n\nHistorically, Morocco always had strong ties with successive Israeli governments, especially under the late King Hassan II. Ties that included information and intelligence exchange and as early as 1963, Mossad was reported to have opened an office in Morocco. Israeli intelligence officials later stated that King Hassan had passed them secret recordings of Arab leaders’ discussions at the 1965 Casablanca summit, which gave them a strategic advantage and helped \"Israel\" win the 1967 war.\n\nAnd in March 2013, Morocco acquired three Heron drones equipped with Israeli systems that had been routed through France and then transferred to the Moroccan Air Force after being painted in the appropriate colors.\n\nBut the new accord, signed in December 2020, can and will build on those ties and is hoping to cultivate $250 million worth of Israeli exports and business opportunities. Additionally, Israeli media speculated that “Morocco entered into a free trade agreement with Africa in early 2021, meaning it could also serve as a gateway to increasing trade with African countries in general.”\n\nNone of this treachery, however, seems to have disqualified Morocco as the chair of the Jerusalem Committee for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nAnd now to the “sip of Israel”, which was of course Israeli wines. Most Israeli wines sold in Canada are linked to the illegal settlement enterprise; additionally, Canada still does not require any specific labeling of which wines are settlement products. According to CIJA, attendees to the reception came from “all parties”, and included the New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh, despite his recent affirmation to “end all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements...”.\n\nDid these parliamentarians and other guests in attendance know they were legitimizing the theft and plunder of Palestinian resources? Did any bother to question the wine that was being served? Did the Moroccan representatives and other foreign dignitaries know or care?\n\nHerein lies the real reasons that the Israeli government and its US sponsor are pushing the so-called Abraham Accords. They present the lie of “friendship” between certain Arab countries and \"Israel\" to the rest of the world and use it to further legitimize Israeli apartheid and everything it stands for. Arab regimes like Morocco get added international recognition and, in this case, support for their own occupation of Western Sahara and its huge mineral reserves. And Western politicians then join in the chorus and become the cheerleaders for such policies.\n\nAnd this is why activists across the world are adamant in denouncing this new “normalization” and are clear that it is a betrayal of the long-held aspirations of the people of the region. The so-called Abraham Accords are not the “brave success story for peace” that \"Israel\" and the Zionist lobby like to portray; rather they are an official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions. We must say NO to such normalization!",

    "Is Tunisia Abandoning Morocco for Algeria?": "For decades, Tunisia has looked on, maintaining its neutral stance as both sides jockeyed for dominance. However, by appearing to have unilaterally invited Brahim Ghali, the Polisario leader and president of the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, to a conference it was holding in tandem with Japan, that neutrality has come into question. Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe Polisario Front, with Algerian support, has been fighting to secure independence for the disputed territory of the Western Sahara since 1973, a move fiercely contested by Morocco since it claimed the territory in dramatic fashion two years later, when some 350,000 flag-carrying Moroccans crossed the desert in Rabat’s “Green March” and essentially forced Spain to hand it over.

Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe details of the invitation are opaque at best. The conference, the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development, was staged in Tunisia, where Ghali flew in to be met, as with other leaders, off the plane by Tunisian President Kais Saied.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview.\n\nHis presence appeared to take many by surprise, not least Morocco, which swiftly issued furious missives of the “hurt” caused to the Moroccan people by Tunis’s action. Ambassadors were withdrawn by both countries while Morocco’s newspapers denounced Tunisia’s shortcomings.\n\nSaied and his foreign ministry claimed surprise at the reaction, citing a circular from the African Union, which extended the invitation to all leaders, including Ghali. A statement was issued by the foreign ministry, reaffirming the country’s total neutrality in line with international law, stating, “This position will not change until the concerned parties find a peaceful solution acceptable to all.”\n\nSaied’s ultimate goal remains a matter for speculation. However, with Algeria proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s seemingly endless economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algiers’ rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughts.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview. Criticism of Rabat’s deal over the territory with the former Trump administration as well as allowing access to the country’s medical facilities have led to diplomatic breakdowns with Germany and Spain, with the latter also getting dragged into a spying scandal.\n\nSpeaking just before the conference, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI used a televised address to send what he said was a clear message to the world, telling viewers, “The Sahara issue is the prism through which Morocco views its international environment.”\n\nAs recently as December 2020, Morocco’s position appeared assured. Washington had agreed to formally recognize Rabat’s claim to the Western Sahara in return for a corresponding nod to Israel. Spain and Germany, both former critics of the kingdom’s relations with the Sahrawis, had reconciled with the kingdom, supporting Rabat’s plan to establish some form of semi-autonomous government within the region, a move resisted by the Sahrawi people, who insisted on a referendum to determine the area’s fate.\n\nHowever, with European gas prices soaring, Algeria—Europe’s third-largest gas supplier (after Russia and Norway) and the Polisario Front’s chief backer—is also enjoying a diplomatic renaissance. European politicians and regional power brokers are all enjoying a renewed interest in Algiers, with Tunisia’s Saied among them. His July visit secured the reopening of land borders, closed two years earlier to contain the spread of COVID-19, allowing Algerian families to travel into Tunisia and support Tunisia’s ill-fated tourism industry. Tunis also relies on Algeria for its own gas, buying it at a discounted price, as well as receiving revenue for the transport of Algerian gas across its territory, bound for Sicily and then the rest of Europe.\n\n“The war in Ukraine and its impacts on Europe in terms of gas supplies reposition Algeria as an important player in the western Mediterranean,” Raouf Farrah, a senior analyst with Global Initiative told Foreign Policy. “Rabat is more worried about this than its ability to obtain gas supplies at competitive prices following the closure of the [Gazoduc Maghreb Europe] pipeline, which used to supply Spain via Morocco.”\n\nThe plight of the Sahrawis is one of the world’s longest-standing refugee crises. Since 1975, thousands of Sahrawis have been sheltering in the Algerian desert, waiting for the opportunity to return home. The violent campaign fought by Polisario against Rabat was brought to an approximate end in 1991 with a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, providing for a fractious peace. However, even that appears uncertain, with clashes between the Polisario Front and Morocco increasing over the last two years.\n\nWith Algiers proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algeria’s rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughtsMeanwhile, the U.N. estimates that around 90,000 “vulnerable refugees” are sheltering in the desert, relying on international aid just for their daily food and shelter. Relocating the refugees has proven a fraught problem for all concerned, with political and economic problems all serving as a break on progress.\n\nAlthough some infrastructure exists, with the refugees operating a state in exile, Bahia Awah, a Sahrawi writer and poet, told Foreign Policy—from what he described as his exile in Spain—that life remained difficult. “Weather conditions are especially adverse in this part of southern Algeria, where temperatures in summer can reach up to more than of 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), which causes casualties among the elderly, children, and pregnant women.”\n\nWhile Algeria’s clout may have been boosted for now, how much difference that will make to a dispute the U.S. government weighed in on in dramatic fashion at the end of the Trump administration remains unclear. For Jonathan Hill, a historian from King’s College London, the fate of the Western Sahara and the Sahrawis has, over the decades, morphed from a pragmatic problem to an unswerving policy position and, as such, risks becoming intractable.\n\n“The problem really is one of leadership,” he said. “In 1976, at the time of the Green March, there was a practical problem that everyone recognized needed a solution. However, with both Algeria and Morocco having relatively static leaderships, where there is little change in personnel, the dispute was allowed to rumble on to the point where the Sahrawis fate really has become a matter of faith.”\n\nHow long Tunisia’s pivot may endure is uncertain. However, the fact that Tunis made that pivot at all speaks directly to the new order now taking shape within the region—whether the Sahrawis benefit from that or not.",

    "Morocco’s Economy Is Sinking, but Its King Prefers the Bright Lights of Paris": "The king of Morocco, Mohammed VI, is a sick man. He underwent heart surgery two years ago and this year came down with the coronavirus. In recent months, he has been spending more time in Paris than in his own country – issuing instructions to his assistants and his prime minister either by phone or on Zoom.\n\nHis troubles aren’t limited to his health problems though. Two months ago, he was seen on camera in the company of friends whilst appearing to be drunk, and holding a drink in his hand. His bodyguards tried to stop the filming, but the video clip surfaced on social media.\n\nThat had been preceded by another scandal, after three German wrestlers of Moroccan origin, the Zuaiter brothers, were hosted in the royal palace and photographed in the king’s presence. That wouldn’t have prompted controversy if the brothers hadn’t exploited the photos for their own benefit – to buy land at a discount and obtain business licenses, all based on their relationship with the king.\n\nMohammed VI didn’t attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, opting to send his son, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, in the process hinting at who is expected to succeed him to the throne. The king’s advisors said that he didn’t go to London for the funeral due to his health condition. Unofficially it was also explained that he was attending to his ill mother in Paris.\n\nMorocco’s own condition is no better than the king’s. It has invested heavily in purchasing arms, missiles and other military hardware, including the Iron Dome antimissile system and air-to-ground missiles from Israel, but the country hasn’t recovered from the twin shocks of the coronavirus and a serious drought. At the beginning of the year, the World Bank forecast the annual growth of the country’s economy at 3.2 percent, but that was recently downgraded to just 1.5 percent.\n\nThe kingdom imports 90 percent of the oil and natural gas that it consumes, the cost of which has risen sharply since the invasion of Ukraine, punching a major hole in Morocco’s national budget. Tourism to the country may be gradually recovering, but revenues from the sector – $2.7 billion in the first half of this year – fell substantially lower than expectations and below pre-pandemic levels. Tens of thousands of workers in the sector had lost their jobs and many of them still haven’t returned to work. The country’s hotel occupancy rate is estimated at under 50 percent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, one can understand the massive public anger when the country’s tourism minister, Fatim-Zahra Ammor, chose to spend her vacation in Zanzibar rather than in Morocco. “The minister turned her back on her country when she went to spend her vacation in Zanzibar, where she pays her expenses in hard currency,” Ismail al-Halwati wrote in an angry article on the Akhbarona website. And he wasn’t the only one to object.\n\nTweeted footage of the Moroccan King Mohammed VI appearing to be drunk with friends\n\nOfficial figures put the country’s unemployment rate at more than 12 percent, but among young people, the figure is closer to 30 percent. Serious drought has driven people from rural areas to the cities, cutting employment in the agricultural sector, which has accounted for more than 14 percent of Morocco’s GDP, employing 40 percent of the population. According to recent surveys, outlying rural areas have lost more than 150,000 jobs to the big cities.\n\nThat also has major implications for the real estate sector, for rental prices and the cost of housing more generally. In addition, the major cities aren’t equipped to accommodate hundreds of thousands of rural migrants and provide them with health care, education and sanitation.\n\nThe real estate sector, which has served as a gauge of the country’s economic health and growth, has been showing signs of collapse. There is a housing supply, but most of it is upscale and not appropriate for middle – and lower-income people — who represent most of those seeking housing — and sales of which have dropped 17 percent in the first half of the year. The drop is also the result of the cancellation of a 50 percent exemption on registration fees.\n\nThe increased cost of construction materials, particularly iron, aluminum and cement, as a result of the war in Ukraine, has also made things worse for large numbers of people who cannot afford to buy an apartment. Now they are forced to rent at prices that are much higher than a year or two.\n\nThe situation has also translated into frustration and anger over the dramatic drop in the quality of life. In April, the government planning department published data showing that more than 76 percent of those polled reported a substantial drop in their quality of life. Eighty-seven percent expected the jobless rate to worsen, and 47 percent have needed loans to finish out the month.\n\nA year ago, the king appointed Aziz Akhannouch, who is apparently the wealthiest person in Morocco, as prime minister. His wealth is estimated at $1.5 billion, and he controls roughly 50 companies. His appointment sparked hope that his business experience and royal backing would propel the economy forward and extract the country from its crisis. Among his decisions was boosting the public sector minimum wage by 10 percent over two years to roughly $320 per month. Since then, for the first time since 2008, inflation in August surged to 8 percent over August 2021 – in the process substantially eroding the pay raise.\n\nThe hopes that the citizenry pinned on the new prime minister appear at this point to be on paper alone, and there have already been articles calling upon him to resign. In the face of the criticism, the king might accede to the demands and replace Akhannouch, who won’t offer a miracle cure in any event. But his appointment created the impression that at least the king was receptive to the public – even from Paris.\n\nWarmer ties with Israel\n\nIn the meantime, ties between Morocco and Israel have been strengthening, particularly in the military field. Morocco is interested in buying advanced Israeli military technology – in addition to the weaponry that it has already purchased. A trade agreement was signed between the countries in February and there have been visits by trade missions between the two.\n\nIn November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz’s first official visit to Morocco included the signing of the countries’ first cooperation agreement. And in July, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi visited the North African country. That was followed by a visit to Israel of Morocco’s military chief, El-Farouk Belkhir, who was joined by a military procurement delegation.\n\nThe reciprocal visits have laid the official foundation for military cooperation that in practice existed well before the signing of the Abraham Accords, in which under American auspices, Morocco followed the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in forging diplomatic relations with Israel. Morocco purchased Heron drones from Israel, which it uses to fight the Polisario Front in Western Sahara.\n\nIsrael and Morocco are hoping to increase bilateral annual trade to $500 million from $90 million last year. Those are relatively modest aspirations compared to the volume of trade that Israel has developed with the UAE, which reached $1.4 billion in the first seven months of this year. Excluding oil and gas, the goal is closer to Israel’s annual trade with Egypt -- $300 million – but there are hopes of doubling it by 2025.\n\nThe full extent of the benefits of the normalization of trade between Israel and Morocco still appears distant.",

To this end, the Moroccan authorities made more than 7,000 arrests of immigrants trying to cross the border into European territory.\n\nFor Khalid Zerouali, Director of Immigration and Border Surveillance at the Moroccan Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), this action is a declaration of intent on the part of the Kingdom with respect to its fight against this type of migration, pointing out that these figures \"show conclusive results\" on which to base this commitment.\n\nREUTERS/JON NAZCA - Migrants run towards the fence separating Morocco from Spain\n\nAlthough he added that \"the fact that there is a decrease in arrivals on the Spanish coast does not mean that the pressure here in Morocco has decreased\".\n\nIt was he himself who provided these figures in a recent interview with Agencia EFE. In addition, Zerouali stated that attempts to enter Europe irregularly via Morocco increased by 11% at the end of July compared to the same period last year.\n\nMoroccan authorities also dismantled 124 smuggling networks operating at the Kingdom's border so far this year, a figure that once again demonstrates Morocco's commitment to ending the scourge of this type of criminal activity in the country.\n\nAP/BERNAT ARMANGUE - Image of migrants near the border between Spain and Morocco\n\nBut the Kingdom's law enforcement agencies not only combat irregular migration through ground-level operations, but Morocco is also active at the regional and international level, providing advice and expertise in the fight against irregular migration.\n\n\"Morocco is a state that lives up to its duties, it has always shown its willingness at all regional and international levels to share its experience with friendly countries,\" said the IRES director.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Archive photo in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta\n\nHe also wanted to make it clear that Morocco \"does not exploit anything for political reasons\", so accusing the Kingdom of doing so \"is unfounded\".\n\nEurope also takes responsibility and is aware of the work that Morocco is carrying out, which is why last month the EU pledged 500 million euros in aid to contribute to the North African country's migration management efforts.",

The all-new Caravan Agafay will open in October as a stunning new escape in Morocco.\n\nInspired by Burning Man's imagination and spiritually connected experience, Caravan Agafay will support nomad Bedouin culture while embracing the local traditions of communal living. With a focus on an immersive glamping experience, the property will span 12 acres and feature 20 beautifully designed Moroccan canvas wall tents, all with views of the Atlas Mountains. Travelers will enjoy a gourmet restaurant using locally sourced ingredients, two swimming pools, a horse & camel stable, outdoor cinema, and a yoga/wellness center.\n\nSwimming pool at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI spoke with Oliver Ripley, the CEO of Habitas, about what inspired him to open a new property in Morocco. \"Morocco has always been a destination we wanted to bring Habitas to,\" he said. \"As a country rich in diverse culture, nature, history and with very warm and welcoming people, we felt it aligned perfectly with our vision: human connection, authentic experiences, learning, and discovery.\"\n\n\"As with all our 'homes,' the sense of discovery and exploration for our guests is crucial. Morocco embraces this with a high sense of adventure, from the cities of Marrakech and Casablanca to the Atlas Mountains, the Saharan desert to the rich coastline. While Marrakech is well known globally, Agafay is an unknown secret a short distance away.\"\n\nNomadic glamping at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\n\"Our new desert retreat is close to Marrakech and within close proximity to Europe and allows guests to immerse fully with the desert and experience local tribes, culture, and programming. The desert holds very special energy and the respect we have for her. Our guests can enjoy rich adventure programming, magical sunrises and sunsets, communal dining experiences, traditional wellness including horse therapy, and authentic connections with the local community.\"\n\n\"Caravan Agafay is just the beginning for us in this enchanting country. We are already working on several more locations in Morocco that will create connections between locals and visitors, sharing Moroccan hospitality (who are kind, welcoming people with big smiles!).\"\n\nExterior view of Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\nThe Agafay Desert is a barren, rocky landscape and one of the country’s last remaining expanses of natural desert. Visitors come for horse-riding, dune-gazing, canoeing on Takerkoust Dam, visiting local mud-built Berber villages, and marvel at the sight of nomads and sheepherders in the distance. This is the perfect escape from the bustle of Marrakech, where you can truly experience life as a nomad.\n\nA typical day of adventure in this remote area could include visiting the valleys of Imlil, Ait Mizan, Ait Souka, and Asni and trekking to the Toubkal waterfall. Visit Tahnaout town market, where they make Argan Oil from the local nuts, and take a traditional camel voyage to Moulay Brahim Valley.\n\nCaravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI am a huge fan of Habitas and its focus on creating a diverse community of people, all seeking human connection and authentic experiences while creating a better future together. With the concept of creating unique luxury resorts, they have minimal impact on the surroundings while focusing on the people to make deeper human connections. They also directly impact local communities through education, employment, and the creation of sustainable micro-economies.

The visit came at the time Morroco was seeking support to return to the AU.\n\nForeign policy experts, however, argue that the position of South Sudan would have backpedaled a decade-old policy in which African countries generally support calls for a referendum in a region Morocco claims is part of its territory.\n\n(ST)",

    "Guatemala strongly supports Morocco and decides to open a consulate in Dakhla": "Guatemala has decided to open a consulate in Dakhla, in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Morocco, thus reaffirming its support for the Moroccan proposal on Western Sahara.\n\nThe North African country defends a formula of broad autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty as the most serious and realistic option for resolving the Sahrawi conflict that has lasted almost five decades. And Guatemala agrees with this line, something that became clear after the meeting held on Thursday between Nasser Bourita, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans Resident Abroad, and his Guatemalan counterpart, Mario Búcaro Flores, on the sidelines of the 77th General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\n\"Guatemala has reiterated its clear position on the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, considering that autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the solution to this discrepancy and announces the decision to open a consulate in the city of Dakhla to take advantage of its economic potential and its openness to the rest of the African continent,\" according to a joint official statement issued after the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.\n\n\"The concepts of sovereignty, peace and territorial integrity are very important to us. We support Morocco's position on this issue and we will continue to support Morocco forever\", the head of diplomacy of the Central American country said in statements made to the press and echoed by media such as Atlas Info.\n\nMario Búcaro Flores highlighted \"the reforms undertaken by Morocco under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and its important role in the resolution of various problems in Africa and the Arab world\" with a view to pacifying the Maghreb region and the Middle East.\n\nPHOTO/TWITTER/MAROC DIPLOMATIE/@MarocDiplomatie - Mario Búcaro Flores and Nasser Bourita\n\nFor his part, Nasser Bourita highlighted \"the efforts of the Government of Guatemala led by His Excellency the President of the Republic, Alejandro Giammattei, aimed at carrying out reforms in the country and strengthening its role at regional and international level to promote peace\".\n\nMorocco and Guatemala showed great harmony on various international issues and announced the intention to 'boost bilateral cooperation in the areas of tourism, training and energy, with special emphasis on agriculture and fertilisers (where Morocco plays an important role), at a time when the world is facing a major food crisis', as reported by Atlas Info.\n\nThis step is also a major boost for Dakhla, which is receiving significant support for its development. This has been demonstrated by the boost in investment that the area is receiving, for example with the holding of the Dakhla International Investors' Forum on 18 and 19 September.\n\nGuatemala thus joins the list of countries that have decided to open consulates in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Morocco, making it the 29th country to carry out this operation. Other countries with great international weight have already taken this decision, such as the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPHOTO/TWITTER/MAROC DIPLOMATIE/@MarocDiplomatie - Flags of Guatemala and Morocco\n\nThe Alawi kingdom is receiving strong international backing for its formula for resolving the Sahrawi conflict, based on broad autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty and respecting UN resolutions. This great diplomatic support had its key moment when Donald Trump's US administration recognised the Moroccan sovereignty of the Sahara in December 2020, something reaffirmed by Joe Biden's government, in exchange for Morocco establishing diplomatic ties with Israel following the dynamic of the famous Abraham Accords sealed in September 2020, by which various Arab countries such as the Emirates and Bahrain established political relations with the Israeli state under US mediation with a view to pacifying the Middle East and promoting the region's economic and social development. Subsequently, other nations such as Germany and Spain followed suit and recognised the Moroccan initiative as the most \"realistic, serious and credible\" way to solve the Western Sahara problem.\n\nOpposing this trend is the opposing position of the Polisario Front, which advocates holding a referendum on independence for the Saharawis, a proposal that has less significant international support, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great political rival in the Maghreb, which has even broken off diplomatic relations with the Alawi kingdom due to the political differences between the two countries, including the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.\n\nAmericas Coordinator: José Antonio Sierra",

Abdellatif Hammouchi and Avril Haines discussed ways to improve security cooperation at \"the level of the current strategic cooperation between the two countries\", the statement said, noting that the two countries will work harder to bring about greater \"regional and international stability and security\".\n\nPHOTO/FILE – Abdellatif Hammouchi\n\nThe meeting focused on the major threat posed by links between terrorist groups and criminal organisations, including the issue of cybercrime, as well as other forms of cross-border criminality.\n\nCybersecurity was therefore another issue that came to the fore as cybercrime is a major concern in today's age of new technologies. Indeed, the Moroccan authorities pay a lot of attention to this aspect and the General Directorate of Information Systems Security (DGSSI) neutralised more than 500 cyber attacks in 2021, as Morocco World News recalled.\n\nHammouchi and Haines discussed ways to improve bilateral cooperation between Moroccan and US security and intelligence services and the challenges to be faced to preserve security, the statement said.\n\n🇲🇦🤝🇺🇸 Les #USA considèrent le #Maroc comme un allié stratégique en matière de sécurité.

The Alawite kingdom is seen as a relevant actor, and this has led the US giant to seek closer cooperation with Morocco in the security and intelligence fields, and even in the military sphere, something that has been exemplified in recent years by the African Lion military exercises in which both the Alawite kingdom and the US have taken part, along with other African nations.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - African Lion Exercises\n\nAbdellatif Hammouchi himself travelled to Washington in mid-June to meet with US intelligence and security officials in working sessions to discuss the current challenges to regional security in Africa, the Middle East and the world at large, with the worrying presence of jihadist terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in critical places such as North Africa, the Sahara and the Sahel.

    "A journey through Morocco’s vanishing oases": "Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nShare this story\n\nHalim Sbai remembers a time when the date palms were green and lush. The music teacher and conductor has lived in the oasis of M’hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco for most of his 52 years.\n\nDecades ago, he recalls, a river flowed through the oasis year round. Gazelle and sheep would drink from its banks, shaded by the dense palm groves. Now there is no steady rush of water. The ground is cracked and parched.\n\nFIRST: The last group of palm trees in the Tanseest Oasis. SECOND: Dead palm trees at the edge of the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane.\n\nSeated in his home on a colorful rug, over a snack of tea and dates, Sbai says his oasis faces catastrophic change. “The droughts are more and more frequent. The palm trees surrounding the oasis are dying one after the other.”\n\nEvery year, he says, the oasis gets smaller. Hundreds of brittle palm trees now border M’hamid el Ghizlane. Part of the village is buried under sand, and once-rich agricultural lands have been abandoned.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nA ‘broken’ system The crisis facing this oasis is no anomaly in Morocco, where droughts made worse by climate change are destroying once-robust ecosystems. Oasis habitats are multilayered. Date palms provide shade for other arable crops, like wheat and vegetables. Livestock graze on the land and provide for the communities. “These are systems that resisted all impacts of climate change across time,” said Youssef Brouziyne, the Middle East and North Africa representative of the International Water Management Institute. He noted that scientists study oases to understand how to make other ecosystems more resilient. But the lack of rain, as well as new intensive farming systems, have endangered the balance. “It’s broken,” he said. “When the palm tree dies, the oasis is gone.” — Aomar Boum\n\nOutside farmers have scooped up cheap land and introduced agricultural methods that suck water away from native plants. Families who worked the land for generations have lost their livelihood and left their homes.\n\n“When the palm tree dies, the oasis is gone,” said Aomar Boum, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles focused on the Middle East and North Africa. “These traditional settlements are connected to dynasties and histories and are left with no one to take care of them.”\n\nThere used to be hundreds of families in the village of Ait M’hanned, next to the southern oasis of Tighmert; only four remain, according to Mohammed Zriouili, a resident in his late 50s.\n\n“There is no more work,” he said. Most of his neighbors who used to farm have moved north.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nIt may only get worse. By 2100, annual rainfall is expected to decline by 30 percent in Saharan regions, home to many of the country’s oases. The drying soil has contributed to the deaths of an estimated two-thirds of Morocco’s 14 million date palms in the past century.\n\n“Date palms are very heat-tolerant crops, but their productivity may decline when temperatures exceed certain thresholds or hot conditions prevail for extended periods,” said Fatima Driouech, a Moroccan climate scientist and the vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s working group I.\n\nThe shrinking of these oases is another grim omen for a warming world.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat could be lost For centuries, Moroccan oases were part of the trade route that connected sub-Saharan economies to North Africa and the Mediterranean. This fostered a unique mixture of Amazigh, Jewish, Islamic, Arab and African identities imbued in all aspects of the communities, from farming techniques to music, Boum, the anthropologist, said. Oases were exoticized by colonial literature as places of respite: a cold pool of water for the desert traveler to drink from, the glittering shadow of palm leaves promising safety and shelter from the brutal Saharan heat. But really, Boum said, “these are some of the harshest places to live in.” (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) “These are systems that resisted all impacts of climate change across time.” — Youssef Brouziyne\n\nBoum grew up in the southeastern province of Tata, in the Lamhamid Oasis. His father used to wake up at 3 a.m. to tend to the carefully crafted canals that used centuries-old irrigation techniques to bring water from the ground to the greenery. They could harvest dates from the dense palm forest by jumping from one tree to another, never touching the ground. “Now, you have holes all over the place,” Boum said. (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) “Now, you have holes all over the place.” — Aomar Boum\n\nOlder generations in oases across the country are mourning lost traditions unique to the land they once tilled, while younger people are trying to sow the seeds of a new future. Hicham El Fissaoui, 27, who grew up in the desert city of Guelmim, is one of many who tried to find a new life abroad when opportunities ran out at home. He immigrated to France, where he lived for a year. After working difficult and poorly paying jobs, he decided to come home. His family and friends in Morocco all thought it was a bad idea. But he found a job he likes, and a way to spread joy — working as a kindergarten teacher and volunteering as a clown for a children’s organization.

Conservationists have launched initiatives to restore palm groves and improve the use of available water, Driouech said. In the town of Skoura, beekeepers work to protect the endangered yellow bee, which is vital to the area’s unique biodiversity. Potters meld red clay using tools and techniques that date back generations. Sbai, the conductor, teaches children the music of their ancestors.

But according to the Spanish daily El Economista, Abengoa intends to sell its shares in the Agadir seawater desalination plant that it built. This information comes barely four months after the end of the contractual tests on the new plant. This decision would be justified by the financial difficulties that Abengoa has been facing since 2016. This led to the company being placed in receivership in February 2020, according to the Spanish newspaper.\n\nA 30-year PPP at stake\n\nSeveral groups and investment funds have already shown their interest in the Spanish giant Abengoa. This is the case of its colleague Acciona or the French group Engie which is implementing a desalination project in the Casablanca-Settat region. When contacted by AFRIK 21, Abengoa officials did not confirm this share sale project. But they do not deny the existence of a transaction in progress for Abengoa’s factory in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nIn addition to the construction of the desalination plant, Abengoa was to operate the Agadir desalination plant over a period of 30 years under the terms of a public-private partnership (PPP) signed with the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (Onee) and the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fishing, Rural Development and Water and Forests.\n\nAbengoa financed the desalination project for 41 billion Moroccan dirhams (nearly €3.9 billion) with its local partner InfraMaroc, an investment fund launched by CDG Capital and backed by Morocco’s Caisse de dépôt et de gestion (CDG). The new facility is capable of supplying 275,000 m3 of water per day, divided between the needs of the population of Greater Agadir (150,000 m3 per day) and the irrigation (125,000 m3 per day) of agricultural land. These plantations are located in the Chtouka plain, a large market gardening area. This capacity is expandable to 400,000 m3 per day.

This matter does not conceal any hidden side or sensitive underside, except for a few marginal associations such as ATTAC.\n\nIn February 2019, law 62-17 on the administrative supervision of ethnic communities and the management of their lands was promulgated.\n\nThe injustice towards women, who did not have access to ownership of Soulaliyate land, is finally lifted.\n\nThanks to this new law, rights claimants, men and women, who until now only had the right to use the land, are now be able to become owners of this land.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 4,631 ethnic communities and nearly 10 million people are concerned by the measure.\n\nThe Soulaliyate land reform is likely to generate sustainable development at the territorial level, thanks to Moroccan human capital, an idea that some French media and the Forbidden Stories consortium do not like particularly, and prefer to defend the economic hegemony of France, which draws on African resources.",

    "Morocco, A Unique Bucket List Experience.": "Unique, extravagant, and epic travel destinations are in.\n\nWhile trending destinations seem to vary somewhat depending on the publication or who you talk to, one theme stays the same. Travelers post COVID are looking for that unique, bucket list, epic destination. “Exotic and unusual” destinations are requested, as well as those that “have it all,” meaning culture, history, fun, nightlife, culinary experience and romance.\n\nFriends and family reunion trips are increasingly popular and there is also an increase in milestone celebrations with extended family. Guests are booking longer trips than before COVID as well, making up for lost time when they were unable to travel. Many are still wary of destinations that are too crowded and want to book accommodations that give them space from other guests. Searches for “epic” destinations are trending, as travelers are ready to step out of their comfort zone and book those adventures they have been talking about for years. All the Adventure You Can Handle in One Country.\n\nThe Medina in Marrakech\n\nAs I researched the trends, one unique destination popped for me. Morocco. Morocco is the land of mint tea and tagines, where the epic Atlas Mountains rise up with the most incredible shades of crimson making them appear almost like an illusion. These provide jaw-dropping backdrops to fabulously luxurious Hotels, Guest Homes and Riads. Moroccan cities have fascinated Westerners for centuries with its exciting cacophony of sounds, colors and smells that welcome visitors upon their arrival. I don’t know of any other destination in the world where you will find a more eclectic mélange of experiences as in Morocco. In the medinas the sounds of merchants selling their wares and the aromas of mouthwatering tagines brewing is a heady mix of all things magical. Here you will find Berber, Arabic, Jewish and Moorish cultures, oriental spices, city garden as well as desert landscapes and glamorous hideaways… all with that seductive French accent.\n\nAn Exotic Gateway to The Old and The New.\n\nFez Gate to the Medina (Old City)\n\nAli Ben Youssef Medersa El Badi Palace Kasbah\n\nMorocco is an exotic gateway to the African continent and its breathtaking landscapes and cultural heritage make it an exciting destination for even the most discerning and well-seasoned traveler. A handcrafted journey will introduce you to the cultural and historical sites of this magical country, while cities such as Marrakech, Fez, Tangier, and Casablanca, offer a balance of ancient traditions and modern-day conveniences.\n\nAfter an exciting day of taking in the historical sites stretching back nearly 1,000 years, you return to jaw dropping luxurious accommodations that won’t disappoint. Marrakech offers some of the most luxurious accommodations in the world. From beautifully decorated hotels to gorgeous guest homes, Riads and even luxury tents. These “tents” by the way, take glamping to a whole other level. Fun Fact: Strictly speaking, a Riad is a house built around a patio garden and the word actually refers to the garden rather than the house, while Maison d’hôte is French for “guest house”.\n\nCulinary Experiences.\n\nThere is no shortage of luxury restaurants for your dining pleasure in Morocco. The high-end Hotels and Riads all have fabulous restaurants that are often managed by well-known chefs who serve the finest fare either obtained fresh from the local markets or flown from Europe. You will find that the high-end restaurants will satisfy the most discerning of palates, and if you are a foodie like me, do make time for a Moroccan cooking class. There are several cooking schools, Riads and restaurants that provide the opportunity for visitors to learn how to recreate their favorite food at home. Known as one of the world’s top cuisines, Moroccan food is a mix of flavors and cultures. Sweet mixed with savory, meat and fruit, deliciously spiced vegetables, all capped off with pots of sugary sweet mint tea. Click HERE for a link to foods you must try while in Morocco.\n\nThe Pearl of Morocco.\n\nIf you have a limited time to visit Morocco and have to choose one city, it should be Marrakech. This city is a pearl polished by history and hospitality and imbued with timeless tradition, refined luxury, cutting-edge couture and Moroccan mystique. While you will find well-known name brand shops in the new city, some of the most exciting finds will still be handmade and antique items available in the old and new souks. A shopper’s paradise! Known as the ‘ochre’ or ‘red’ city thanks to its rosy-hued 11/12th-century walls, an exuberant Marrakech exudes exhilarating exoticism, and boasts a lively and alluring nightlife. This thousand-year-old trading post harbors a rich and turbulent history brimming with breathtaking architecture.\n\nA Beautiful Oasis.\n\nDar Ahlam Oasis Kasbah Tamadot\n\nWhen you head just few hours out of Marrakesh, and you’ll find a completely different landscape. South of the High Atlas Mountains, this sun-kissed stretch of dusty desert is broken up by sand-colored kasbahs and palm-fringed fortified villages. On the Western side of the High Atlas Mountain, there is Kasbah Tamadot which is a retreat belonging to Sir Richard Branson and quite stunning. When you get closer to the desert on the Eastern side of the same range you will find Kasbah Dar Ahlam and you can choose to stay in the Kasbah (which is a renovated fortress) or one of their luxury tents and enjoy a romantic dinner set up in the middle of an oasis. Dar Ahlam means Home of Dreams.\n\nThe Sahara\n\nExploring the desert of southern Morocco in a private tented camp has to be one of the most rewarding experiences ever. For many, the real reason to come to Morocco is to experience the raw untouched wilderness of the desert and to immerse themselves for at least a few days in the extraordinary environment of the Sahara’s indescribable, yet severe natural beauty. Stay at least one night, but I recommend two or three. If you need a time-out from the world for a while, this is the place to be.\n\nTrekking Mount Toubkal\n\nMorocco is home to the highest peak in North Africa, Mount Toubkal rising to 4,167-meters above sea level. During winter months its snow-covered peaks beckon savvy trekkers and the ski resort at Oukaimeden lures skiers from all over the world to try Moroccan powder. Once you traverse the High Atlas and come out on the other side, several hours of driving will take you straight into the Sahara Desert where you can take a camel or 4×4 excursion into the dunes.\n\nHistory\n\nMany cities and villages in Morocco boast homes that are thousands of years old. In cities such as Marrakech and Fez, these ancient homes that are located in the medina, (the old town) can date back centuries. Dozens of riads, which are restored old homes, can be found throughout the country. Many retain the old charm and style while providing you with modern-day boutique amenities.\n\nThe Cities.\n\nFez Gateway to the Sahara Chefchaouen Casablanca Essaouira Tangier\n\nMorocco blends adventure, romance and the exotic from its proximity to Europe, foothold in Africa, and its Middle Eastern influence. Large cities like Rabat, Marrakech and Tangier resemble European cities in many ways, while rural outposts like Zagora and Chefchaouen will make you feel lightyears away! Fez is famous for its leather tannery, Tangiers was famous as a destination for artist and writers from Europe and the U.S. during the 1950’s and 60’s and Casablanca is the business center of the Country.\n\nThere is so much more to Morocco than what is in this article! It is an especially amazing wedding and honeymoon destination but more about that in a future post. Clients have booked their wedding in Marrakech and spent their honeymoon discovering the remainder of the Country. You can follow me HERE for more amazing and EPIC destinations to experience.

    "Morocco and Spain show the strength of their ties within the UN framework": "New York is the setting for the 77th General Assembly of the United Nations (UN), in which the heads of state and government of the world's nations are taking part, and this setting has served for Morocco and Spain to continue to demonstrate the good relations that currently exist between the two countries.\n\nNasser Bourita, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans Resident Abroad, and José Manuel Albares, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, held a meeting on Wednesday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in which they demonstrated that diplomatic relations between the North African and European countries are at a great moment.\n\nSpeaking from New York, Nasser Bourita described as \"exemplary and unique\" the relations of collaboration between Morocco and Spain in various areas such as migration management, for example. In a statement to the media after talking to José Manuel Albares, he pointed out that the good dynamic of the relationship in this area will have positive repercussions at the bilateral and regional level, according to various media outlets such as the Moroccan Rue20.\n\nPHOTO/TWITTER/MAROC DIPLOMATIE – Nasser Bourita and José Manuel Albares\n\nGiven the good momentum of the ties between the two nations, Nasser Bourita announced that they will continue to deepen in this line and announced that they will go further in the cooperation between the two nations with an upcoming meeting scheduled for the month of December focused on migration management and the fight against criminal networks involved in human trafficking.\n\nIn this area of migration management and border control, Nasser Bourita also highlighted the good functioning of Operation Crossing the Strait thanks to the good coordination shown by Morocco and Spain and the re-establishment of maritime connections between the two countries.\n\nFor his part, José Manuel Albares stressed that both parties continue to strengthen the Spanish-Moroccan friendship. \"We continue to move forward in the new stage. We continue to strengthen the friendship between the Spanish and Moroccan peoples,\" Albares said on the social network Twitter. He also welcomed the \"intense\" strategic partnership that unites Spain and Morocco and that opens \"a new stage\" based on \"transparency, permanent communication and mutual respect\".\n\nEn marge des travaux de #UNGA77 M.

Morocco criticised this episode and the fact that he was not duly informed by a country considered a partner and ally.\n\nFrom then on, there were episodes that increased tension between the two nations, such as the massive entry of thousands of illegal immigrants through the Ceuta border and the withdrawal of the Moroccan ambassador from Madrid.\n\nExcelente reunión con mi homólogo marroquí, Nasser Bourita, para hacer balance de la hoja de ruta acordada y seguir progresando en su aplicación.\n\n\n\nContinuamos avanzando en la nueva etapa.

This was demonstrated by King Mohammed VI's invitation to President Pedro Sánchez to meet in Rabat in April 2022. A meeting in which the road map that has been marking the steps to be taken in various areas within the relationship between the two countries was drawn up.\n\nPHOTO/FILE – Pedro Sánchez and Mohammed VI\n\nIn recent years, Morocco has received the support of important nations for its initiative to resolve the situation in Western Sahara, especially since December 2020, when Donald Trump's US administration recognised the Moroccan status of Western Sahara in exchange for the Kingdom establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, following in the wake of the famous Abraham Accords signed in September 2020, under which several Arab countries established ties with the Israeli state with a view to pacifying the Middle East and developing the region socially and economically.\n\nThis is in contrast to the position of the Polisario Front, which advocates the holding of a referendum on Sahrawi independence that enjoys less support at the international level, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great rival in the Maghreb.",
    "Connecting with the Past: Making Memories in Morocco with Touro": "This month, Dr. Karen Sutton, professor at Touro’s Lander College for Women, had the privilege of joining 35 Touro students from across all our campuses for a fascinating journey through Morocco. They explored ancient and modern Jewish history and learned about mass Aliyah as well as Morocco’s stance during the Holocaust. Dr. Sutton shares her experiences here.\n\nEducation and adventure went hand-in-hand on this exciting Touro summer trip led by Professor Simcha Fishbane. Students earned three college credits while visiting nine cities and numerous villages. We experienced varied cultures in each locale, from a tour of Rabat to a panoramic tour of Casablanca and the historic sights of Fez, including the home of the Rambam and numerous kevarim (grave sites) and shuls. I was joined by my esteemed colleagues, Touro President Dr. Alan Kadish and faculty and lecturers Dr. Israel Singer, Michael Newman and Dr. Stanley and Professor Esther Boylan.\n\nIn addition to lectures and tours, the group bonded over camel, ATV and boat rides and BBQs in the desert.\n\nJudaism in Morocco Today\n\nUpon arrival in Rabat, we were welcomed by Andre Azoulay, a leader of the Jewish community and senior financial advisor to King Mohammed VI. Azoulay briefed us on the status of the local Jewish community, which now consists of 1,800 Jews whose average age is 70, and approximately 40 school-age children who are mainly offspring of the Rabbis and mashgichim who live in Morocco. We later learned that Morocco is the only financially viable country in North Africa, largely because of this Jewish finance minister, who is also a regular shul-goer.\n\nThe current Jewish community members living in Morocco, such as Rabbi Sebbag and Rabbi Banon, inspired us with their religiosity, spirit and optimism, and their beautiful prayer service. They do not take lightly their role as gatekeepers to the 2000-year-old Jewish traditional life in Morocco, formerly home to over 350,000 Jews, including some of the most revered rabbis and tzaddikim.\n\nVisiting the Past\n\nWhile much of the Moroccan Jewish community relocated to Israel after the 1967 war, our excursion took us back in time to the first Jewish settlements over 2,000 years ago. Interestingly, Jews came to Morocco even before the Moslems, whose origins date much later, in the seventh and eighth centuries. We felt as though we were walking in the footsteps of our holy ancestors.\n\nFaculty and students, young and old, were deeply impacted upon viewing the abandoned shuls, cities and schools that once brimmed over with Jews at prayer or going about their daily routine.\n\nAs we traveled from one city to the next over long rural stretches of dry, stony dusty regions occasionally peppered with withered bushes, I shared Morocco’s Holocaust history. When faced with having to turn over Jews by order of the French Vichy government, the 30-year-old Moroccan sultan, Mohammed V, refused, stating, “There are no Jews in Morocco, there are just Moroccan citizens.” The sultan had to comply with some of the anti-Jewish laws, but Jews were not forced to wear a yellow star nor were they eliminated from professions or forced to give up their property. Not a single Jew was deported. In short, like King Christian X of Denmark, Mohammed V protected the Jews of his country.\n\nAnother vital component of our trip was connecting to the great rabbis of Morocco. Through lectures given by Dr. Stanley Boylan, including “The Rambam and the Rif living in Fez,” we were able to gain context and feel deeply rooted to our Jewish past. When we prayed at the grave sites of our most revered leaders, we understood their world views and the lives they led.\n\nThroughout the tour, our Moroccan guide and author of Jews Under Moroccan Skies, Raphael Elmaleh was able to make Moroccan history come alive. Students asked about the lasting legacy of Maimonides as well as the contributions of everyday Jewish laborers, merchants, artisans and craftsmen to Moroccan society and about the mass emigration of Moroccan Jewry. Answers were not given from textbooks, but rather by visiting, seeing and experiencing.\n\nA Modern Monarchy\n\nDr. Singer shared his analysis of the diversity of Morocco’s political and religious make-up throughout the ages. He explained that as a constitutional monarch, King Mohammed VI extends a strong arm in the governance and policymaking of Morocco. Because he has dedicated resources to improve the lot of the poor and promote women’s rights, he appears to be well loved by the masses. King Mohammed VI also established funds for the restoration of Jewish sites and has mandated Holocaust education. Like his grandfather Mohammed V, Mohammed VI is popular with the small Jewish population who view themselves as protected by his royal authority. Dr. Singer explained that his favorable attitude toward Jews is based on a multitude of factors including economics, especially industry and tourism, given the thousands of Jews who sojourn to Morocco each year.\n\n“King Mohammed VI regards Jews as cultured and educated and looks upon Israel as a successful country with thousands of startups and a booming tech sector. He sees Jews as critical to the relationships he wants to forge and maintain with Israel,” said Singer.\n\nAccording to Dr. Singer, tolerance rather than persecution accords Morocco a very high place in the Moslem world. Today, Jews enjoy full rights as Moroccan citizens.\n\nThe promotion of women’s rights was evident as we visited the Amazigh (Berber) Village in the desert, where women have started a growing business of harnessing argan oil from nuts and procuring a unique, profitable and portable cosmetic industry. While the older Amazigh women produce the oil, their daughters do the marketing and sales.\n\nAn Experience of a Lifetime\n\nEsther Boylan, professor of Jewish Studies at Touro summed up the trip as “one of contrasts, striking differences and close associations. From the impoverished Amazigh villages to the opulent edifices in the imperial cities, from the stench of the tannery to the scent of the spices and gardens… from the minarets to the winding allies of medinas, from the majestic mountains to the dry desert, from the holy places to hotels and palaces, Morocco taught us how the ancient and modern coalesce.”\n\nTamar Levine, a graduating senior who’s majoring in psychology at Touro’s Lander College for Women echoed Professor Boylan’s remarks: “It was fascinating to experience a unique culture and society that I would not otherwise have had the opportunity to explore. It was uplifting to learn about the history of the Moroccan Jewish community. It was also a great opportunity to spend quality time with other Touro students and faculty. This trip was truly an experience of a lifetime.”\n\nAs we return to the classroom in the weeks ahead, we will all surely apply the hands-on learning experience we had in Morocco to our studies as teachers, students, lifelong learners and doers. The relationships forged outside the classroom will no doubt connect us and enhance our learning. As one student stated, “we began the trip as a Touro University group and ended it more like a Touro family. “",

    "A youth between Morocco and Spain": "Young Moroccans talk to us about how they carry their sense of dual identity and their relationship with Morocco\n\nCarrying a piece of Morocco with them is one of the major defining features of the Moroccan diaspora living in the European Union. A diaspora that, as well as within Morocco, has youth as its protagonist, not only in the present but also in its future.\n\n\n\nThe recent survey commissioned by the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME) from the polling institute IPSOS, published in mid-September, once again focused the media spotlight on 18-35 year-olds. A group known in Morocco as the 'invisible electoral force'. Generally uninterested in Moroccan democratic processes, imprisoned in a sense of dual identity, which some cope with better than others, but also optimistic and hopeful of a future in Europe with opportunities they believe are out of reach in Morocco.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Moroccan youths walking in a street in the capital Rabat on September 12, 2018\n\nIf Morocco's own youth is a challenge for Aziz Akhannouch's current government, as is often raised in the Maghreb country, it is rarely seen in the same light in Spain. \"Once you finish your studies in Spain as a non-EU foreigner, it's as if for the institutions the road is over\", sums up Sohaib N., a young Tangier-born 28-year-old resident in Madrid who came here 10 years ago to study journalism in Madrid. \"Coming here for fun or for a while is easy. But to work is not so easy. Nothing is made easier by the administration\", adds the young man, who is trying to maintain his situation in Spain in a regular way, without having the slightest intention for the moment of applying for Spanish nationality.\n\n\n\n\"I've never considered asking for nationality, it's not that important to me. Having residency is enough for me\", explains Sohaib, for whom his identity is not defined by a document or a piece of paper. As he says, his upbringing has made him someone with an ambiguous identity. A childhood in Tangiers, fully immersed in Spanish culture through television, internet, school, did not make him feel like a foreigner when he arrived in Spain. And when he returns to Morocco, he feels as Moroccan as the rest. \"I feel in the middle of the two identities\", says the young journalist, a feeling he shares with 70% of those surveyed in Spain by the CCME study. A feeling that rises to 80% in France and 84% in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nThis is also the case of Meriem F., from Agadir, who moved to Spain 8 years ago for love and who says she feels more and more like a foreigner in Morocco. It is no longer just a question of how she feels she is perceived by others, but almost a question of comfort in her own country. \"Sometimes it even pisses me off\", explains Meriem, for whom the administration's services are a clear example of what bothers her most in Morocco. She is one of the 71% of the community that feels like a foreigner back in Morocco after a long period in Spain. Meriem wants to apply for Spanish nationality in two years' time. With the nationality, she wants to be able to participate in the Spanish electoral processes, in which she shows great interest, according to 51% of those surveyed by the CCME. \"Moroccans in Spain are a collective. We pay our taxes, we pay contributions. Of course I would like to be able to vote\", says Meriem, who also feels more than integrated in Logroño, where she lives. \"There are many cases of discrimination that do nothing to help Moroccans integrate. I understand that there are people who can't, but in my case I have overcome them. I no longer feel like a foreigner here\", adds the young businesswoman, who is working to make a small brand of handmade and natural cosmetic products prosper in collaboration with her mother from Agadir.\n\nHanan El. and Riyan H are the two youngest interviewees and both have Spanish nationality. Both are studying and, in the case of Hanan, also working. For Hanan, who had to ask for it, the essential thing is the freedom it gives. \"It's not just for travelling, it's for everything,\" explains the young woman, who specialises in fashion design. \"To work and to study everything is much easier if it is with the nationality\". Hanan defines that rather than having a \"double identity\", she feels that she is neither on one side nor the other. \"Most of the Moroccans I know were born here in Spain, but they don't feel Spanish. But neither do they feel Moroccan\".\n\nAP/MOSA’AB ELSHAMY - Informal school run by Moroccan fashion designer Fadila El Gadi, in Sale, near Rabat\n\nSomething that these four young people of Moroccan origin agree on is one of the most striking features of the CCME's report on the interest shown by the diaspora in Moroccan electoral processes. If they all claim to be regularly informed about what is happening in Morocco, they also assume that they have no interest in wanting to vote in Morocco or in learning more about its politics. According to the CCME study, only 9% of those surveyed in Spain indicated a desire to participate in Moroccan elections, the second highest figure of the six countries surveyed.\n\nThe gap between politics and young people crosses borders. In Morocco, the low turnout of 18-29 year olds in the elections is one of the headlines that make the front pages every time. Around 30% of the Moroccan population is in the 18-29 age group and a further 27 % is under 14 years of age. The 18-24 turnout in the September 2021 elections was only a meagre 3%. It rose to 19% for 25-34, according to figures available in the Moroccan press.\n\nIf neither residents in Morocco nor residents in Spain are interested in these processes, it is mainly due to the lack of accessibility to them. \"I have never voted in my life,\" Sohaib confesses. \"I think that I and the other young people don't feel involved\", adds the Tangier journalist. In his opinion, the political parties make no effort to present their electoral programmes. \"I don't think it doesn't do much good. That's my conviction. I have always seen it as an archaic system,\" Sohaib concludes.\n\nRiyan, 20, a student of an intermediate degree in administration, has a very similar feeling to Sohaib. \"It's not something I find accessible. That's why I'm not interested in elections in Morocco or politics in general. I would still like to see a lot of changes, especially for young people,\" says the young student.\n\nIn addition to the low interest in politics and elections, this age group also gave the government a clear failing grade. In measuring the degree of satisfaction with the reforms undertaken by the Moroccan government, Akhannouch's government received only 18% approval in Spain, the lowest next to Germany (12%) and a far cry from Belgium's 57%.\n\n\"Young people expect nothing from the government. They just want to be able to work once they finish their studies,\" says Meriem. She agrees with Sohaib, who at least somewhat optimistically believes that young people want the country to prosper as much as possible. This is also the view of Riyan, who at least has a positive idea of Morocco because of what it means to him and his family. \"The culture, our roots. Of course we like Morocco,\" says Riyan, who believes that young people only have a problem with the institutions and the economic situation, which offers fewer opportunities compared to Europe.\n\nAs for the future, the youngest of these interviewees is very optimistic, and even the hopefulness is evident in his voice. \"I am sure that soon something similar to what is happening in France or Belgium will happen in Spain,\" says Riyan. \"I really believe that in the next few years we will see ministers or senior officials in Spain bearing a Moroccan name\"."
