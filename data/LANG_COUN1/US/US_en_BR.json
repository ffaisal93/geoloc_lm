    "A Strategic Moment for the U.S.-Brazil Relationship": "Brazil’s upcoming presidential election on October 2 is not taking place in an international vacuum. To paraphrase an old saying, never entirely accurate, Brazil is not just a “country of the future.” Seismic shifts taking place around the world are placing its current importance in stark relief.\n\nBrazil is emerging as a central actor in global food and energy supply chains, on climate change, in multilateral and regional organizations, and on engagement with China in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil could certainly be more of a partner to the U.S. in addressing these issues. The bilateral relationship, however, has rarely been particularly strategic for either country. Making it more so in the context of the changing international landscape is the challenge.\n\nThe future of bilateral ties rests not only on how Washington engages with Brazil, but also on a successful democratic outcome to upcoming elections and the priorities of the next Brazilian government. The contentious campaign is certainly raising concerns internationally and within Brazil about whether the incumbent, President Jair Bolsonaro, will accept a result where his main rival, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is declared the victor. But if the door opens to a more dynamic relationship—regardless of who wins—both countries will have a rare opportunity to work together at a critical moment for the hemisphere and for the world.\n\nA more influential global force\n\nMeanwhile, global possibilities for Brazil are opening. Take, for example, the world economy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated the urgency of diversifying and increasing the medium-term availability of energy and food supplies. Brazil is a central and strategic player, both as a major energy producer and as an agricultural powerhouse. The country’s oil and gas production is now among the ten largest in the world. Brazil is also among the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, corn, meat, sugar and coffee and has a modern agricultural sector capable of expanding production to meet global demand.\n\nAs tensions with China increase and supply-chain relationships are redefined, major but non-aligned economies like India and Brazil have also become key players in the emerging trade and investment frameworks in their regions and beyond. India is increasingly influential and central to efforts by the U.S. to strengthen the broader Indo-Pacific economy by diversifying supply chains and promoting open trade, digital innovation and clean energy.\n\nThe landscape is similar in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The U.S. presented an economic agenda at the Summit of the Americas in June 2022 that emphasized innovation, fighting climate change, opportunities for near-shoring supply chains and economic growth. It is impossible to imagine moving forward strategically in the region without Brazil.\n\nBrazil, like India, can also be more of a partner in multilateral organizations at a time when China is challenging within those institutions, and there is less agreement on the rules of the game for the global economy. Brazil historically is a strong believer and actor in international institutions.\n\nMoreover, as regional trade blocs become more of a factor in the global economy, Brazil’s voice and actions may carry greater weight. The trade grouping of Mercosur, which includes Brazil, is resuming discussions with the European Union on a long-stalled trade agreement. As Brazil emerges as China’s key trading and investment partner in the region, U.S. concerns about the hemisphere’s growing ties to Beijing are only likely to be addressed fully with Brazil at the table.\n\nBrazil, like India, continues to emphasize a largely non-aligned vision of international relations. It should not have been a surprise that neither country took a strong stand on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; or that both are active in the BRICS organization which groups them with China, Russia and South Africa.\n\nBut no one serious in Brasília is suggesting following the Chinese model of development. Brazil, after all, has also begun the process of accession\n\nto the OECD. The social transformation of Brazil that began after the return of democracy requires further reforms and faster growth\n\nFinally, Brazil remains central to combating climate change globally. Concern is rightly widespread about the accelerating rate of deforestation in the Amazon. The murders this year of journalist Dom Phillips and environmental defender Bruno Araujo Pereira tragically highlighted the challenge. As the international community responds to the unprecedented impact of global warming, however, it is critical to reengage Brazil as a key partner in a more constructive and strategic dialogue than exists at present.\n\nTensions at home\n\nOpportunities for the world to engage with Brazil are significant—but taking advantage of them depends to a great extent on whether Brazil’s politicians respect whatever choice the country’s voters make in the upcoming elections.\n\nPolitical tensions are likely to heighten in the coming weeks, but it would be wrong to think there are no guardrails in Brazil’s democracy. Its legal and electoral systems are stronger than they seem to receive credit for, and there are no indications that Brazil’s military as an institution is looking to intervene on behalf of any candidate. U.S. Defense Secretary Austin visited Brasília in July to convey to his counterparts the importance of a transparent electoral process. Other high-level U.S. officials have paid visits over the past few months transmitting the same message, including Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, in August.\n\nWhat’s more, many of the sharp differences visible in Brazil’s presidential election are not reflected in national congressional or state elections, which will also be held on October 2. Since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, the country’s now more than 150 million eligible voters have favored a largely centrist mix of parties focused on transactional politics. The mix of candidates for October’s legislative and gubernatorial elections look unlikely to alter that pattern.\n\nWashington has expressed strong confidence in Brazil’s electoral system as a model for Latin America—and all hopes are that it will prevail. While the international community would certainly react against any effort to subvert the outcome, it should be equally prepared to welcome another successful democratic electoral process.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas (CDMA) in Brasilia on July 26, 2022. Photo by Mateus Bonomi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.\n\nA wide array of venues for collaboration\n\nIn the latter case, there will be the chance to reframe the U.S.-Brazil relationship to reflect both new global realities and strengthened bilateral ties, despite the ups-and-downs of the past decade. Doing so would also require recognizing Brazil as a global player, with its own priorities that do not always mirror those of the U.S. There will inevitably be tension with whomever wins the elections—but that does not preclude the U.S. and Brazil from finding common ground.\n\nThe scale of high-level dialogues and working relationships sustained by the two countries is, in fact, remarkable. There is a U.S.-Brazil Commercial Dialogue; an Energy Forum; a Critical Minerals Working Group; there is the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum and Defense Industry Dialogue.\n\nSome channels work better than others, but the institutional framework is deep—to which can be added several important recent agreements. Brazil in 2021 became the first Latin American country, and one of only a dozen globally, to sign the Artemis Accords, which promotes the peaceful and transparent use of outer space. This followed a long-sought Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA), approved in 2019, which permits U.S. space launches from Brazil’s Alcântara Space Center.\n\nBilateral cooperation on pandemic response and medical research is long-standing and cutting-edge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has worked in Brazil for almost twenty years, where the National Institute of Health (NIH) also has its largest Latin America research portfolio. Cooperation can be traced back decades to the early stages of the HIV/AIDS and Zika pandemics and has continued more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nU.S.-Brazil cooperation on environmental protection continues, too—though it is falling far short of its potential. People-to-people ties are stronger than often recognized, with Brazilians among the top ten visitor streams to the United States. Brazil remains a major trading partner for the United States. Though China is now more important to Brazil for trade, the portion of high-value exports destined for the U.S. is critical—while U.S. investment in the country is still higher than China’s. Brazil remains an important participant in international peacekeeping and is now a major non-NATO ally, creating a new platform for greater strategic engagement between the two countries.\n\nLooking ahead, there is nothing wrong with the U.S.-Brazil relationship maintaining a strongly economic cast. But issues of energy, climate change, food production, digital revolutions, pandemic responses and Chinese investment and trade practices have all become profoundly geopolitical in today’s uncertain world. Addressing them requires cooperation from a wider set of partners than those included in the U.S.’s traditional alliances.\n\nThe Biden administration is currently involved in multiple bilateral dialogues with India and collaboration through the Quad discussions. It is time to approach Brazil with the same strategic mindset and seriousness of purpose.\n\n—\n\nMcKinley is former U.S. ambassador to Brazil (2017-18).\n\nBerg is director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
    "'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Discusses Brazil's Fragile Democracy & Puerto Rico's Power Crisis": "The latest episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver dedicated most of its runtime to showcasing how Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently up for Presidential re-election, is trying to undermine the country’s voting system by suggesting that if he loses next Sunday, it will be because there’s something wrong with the vote counting.\n\nBefore the main story, though, Oliver drew some attention to the fact that Ron DeSantis flew a slate of illegal immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard, in a stunt that put the Florida Governor under heavy fire. To add insult to injury, the show highlights the fact that the political move might have been pitched by Fox News – and sloppily executed. We also learned you can always count on Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny to protest effectively about the country’s constant power outages. In addition, we were reminded that singer and songwriter, Adam Levine, is really bad at sexting, and that, in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, the British people managed to out-queue every queue that the world has ever seen.\n\nBack to one of the world’s biggest countries, John Oliver kicked the segment off by showing that in Brazil, everything goes when you’re vying for a public office – even nunchucks. And it’s all downhill from there: the show exhibited clips that illustrate how Bolsonaro is pretty much inciting a response akin to Donald Trump's supporters attempting to take over the Capitol on January 6, 2021, should he lose the election.\n\nRELATED: 'SNL' Sets 'Top Gun: Maverick's Miles Teller as Season 48 Premiere Host\n\nLast Week Tonight did not shy away from the shortcomings of Bolsonaro’s presidency. On his watch, Brazil handled the pandemic in disastrous ways, which led to the death of almost 700,000 people. When questioned about it, Bolsonaro stated that “we’re all going to die anyway”, all the while refusing to admit that COVID-19 was a real and serious problem. The Amazon rainforest also took a huge hit during his government, with deforestation reaching an all-time high with 1,000 fires being reported daily.\n\nThe “Brazilian Trump” saw the result of his terrible management in polls: former president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva has been leading by a 10% margin, and has a real shot at winning next Sunday if the polls are correct. The problem is, if Bolsonaro indeed loses, he has a whole army – literally the Army – standing behind him, in what could potentially result in a devastating military coup for a country that rid itself of dictatorship not that many years ago. No amount of nunchucks will be able to save the Brazilian population if this comes to pass.\n\nYou can watch the full episode below:",

    "Brazil’s Global Ambitions": "Introduction\n\nAs Latin America’s largest and most influential country, Brazil has long played a leadership role in the region, throwing its economic and diplomatic might behind hemispheric integration efforts. It has also increasingly sought a bigger voice for developing countries on the world stage. In addition to its active membership in the United Nations and other major multilateral institutions, Brazil has worked closely with countries such as China, India, and Russia to develop alternative forums.\n\nHowever, a decade marked by economic upheaval and corruption scandals that implicated much of the political establishment has hindered its goals. President Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a “Brazil above everything” slogan that he argued would help reclaim the country’s sovereignty, but critics say his approach has exacerbated domestic inequalities and led to growing international isolation.\n\nWhy does Brazil matter in world affairs?\n\nBrazil is the largest and most influential country in South America, accounting for about half of the continent’s population, landmass, and gross domestic product (GDP). It is the fifth-largest country in the world and the sixth most populous, with an estimated 214 million people. Brazil plays a major role in world trade: it is a leading producer of soybeans, beef, and iron ore. Moreover, the two-thirds of the Amazon Rainforest that fall within its borders make it central to the global fight against climate change. After the United States, Brazil has the largest military force in the Western Hemisphere, though it has historically relied on soft-power strategies, including foreign aid, to exert its influence.\n\nBrazil wields considerable political and economic clout beyond Latin America. China and the United States are its top two trading partners, and the country has forged closer political and military ties with Russia. It has also asserted itself in nuclear talks with Iran despite objections from the United States. Brazilian forces have at times led peacekeeping missions in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the country has hosted international sporting events, including the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nHow have Brazil’s foreign policy ambitions evolved?\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It maintained its monarchy until 1889. The foreign relations of its early years were largely preoccupied with regional upheaval, including war with neighbors Argentina and Paraguay. World War I marked the beginnings of Brazil’s role on the world stage, as it was the only Latin American country to participate and the largest South American delegation involved in the negotiations that created the League of Nations in 1920. Brazil’s military contributions to the Allied powers during World War II and its cooperation with the United States during the Cold War drew it closer to the West, even as it advocated for noninterventionism and neutral international institutions.\n\nThis tension grew after Brazil’s republic gave way in 1964 to a repressive military dictatorship, which shared Washington’s fears about communist influence in the region. By 1979, an ailing economy drove the regime to begin a slow process of political liberalization that culminated in the transition to a civilian-led democracy in 1989. This political reform was accompanied by an opening of the heavily state-led economy. Between 1995 and 2010 under Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (commonly known as Lula), Brazil solidified its reputation as an emerging power with one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. It was under Lula that Brazil “had this really ambitious idea that almost through sheer force of will, it would become a major power,” says Dartmouth College’s Andre Pagliarini.\n\nBrazilian foreign policy emphasizes diplomacy and multilateral institutions. To date, Brazil has participated in fifty UN peacekeeping operations, and it has offered expertise, equipment, and scholarship opportunities to postconflict countries [PDF] including Angola, Mozambique, and Timor-Leste. It has pushed to increase the role of lower income countries, often referred to as the Global South, in global governance in other ways, too: it is in the Group of Twenty (G20), a grouping of the world’s largest economies, and it helped found the alternative economic bloc BRICS alongside Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Brazil is also regularly elected as a non-permanent member to the UN Security Council, and it has joined calls to expand permanent council membership to better represent today’s global distribution of power.\n\nWhat role does Brazil play in regional affairs?\n\nBrazil has long pursued a leadership role, at times butting heads with the United States and navigating tensions with other regional powers. It has largely focused on furthering development and regional stability through economic integration and involvement in multilateral institutions.\n\nIt is a founding member of and among the largest donors to the Organization of American States (OAS), the Western Hemisphere’s premier diplomatic forum. It is also the driving force behind the Mercosur trade bloc, in which it seeks to unite its economy with those of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. With a combined GDP of roughly $2.2 trillion in 2021, the bloc is one of the world’s largest. Yet, Brasília previously led the opposition [PDF] to a failed U.S. proposal for a hemisphere-wide trade bloc, arguing that the United States’ heavily subsidized agriculture would give its exports an unfair advantage.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil’s stance toward the region’s authoritarian governments has tested its commitment to diplomacy. Under Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff, Brazil sought closer trade and energy ties with the socialist government of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. But Bolsonaro has joined most of the region in refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, and tensions have escalated as the Brazil-Venezuela border has become a hotspot for crime and violence.\n\nRelations with Cuba have likewise worsened despite years of Brazilian efforts to expand oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and increase aid to the island. In 2019, Bolsonaro became the first Latin American leader in nearly three decades to vote against an annual UN resolution condemning the U.S.-led embargo on Cuba. The following year, Brazil withdrew from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), citing the growing authoritarian influence of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\n\nHow has Bolsonaro governed Brazil?\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain who spent twenty-seven years in Brazil’s Congress, won the 2018 presidential election riding a wave of antiestablishment fervor. Campaigning as a right-wing, socially conservative nationalist, he promised to tackle crime and corruption and right the economy in the face of a series of crises, including a presidential impeachment, a deep recession, a historic corruption scandal, and a sharp rise in violent crime. His controversial moves have included abolishing dozens of civil society groups, cutting funding for federal education, relaxing gun ownership laws, and attacking LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessors, Bolsonaro has embraced anti-globalist rhetoric and has said that international norms and institutions threaten Brazil’s sovereignty. This has led him to distance Brazil from the United Nations; encourage development in the Amazon Rainforest; downplay the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; and threaten to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris Agreement on climate, though he hasn’t followed through. Furthermore, his administration’s moves to isolate former partners, such as Venezuela, have been paired with efforts to form closer ties with like-minded right-wing leaders such as former U.S. President Donald Trump, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhat are relations like with the United States?\n\nThe relationship dates to 1824, when the United States became the first country to recognize Brazil’s independence. In the twentieth century, Washington wielded a strong influence over Brazil’s development, including by backing the 1964 military coup and later supporting the country’s democratic transition and economic liberalization. Still, Brazil has at times acted as a countervailing force against U.S. interests. In addition to rejecting the U.S. hemispheric trade proposal, Brasília opposed the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and condemned the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the left-wing Lula and Rousseff administrations, Brazil’s pursuit of closer relationships with U.S. adversaries such as China, Cuba, and Iran also became a source of tension.\n\nBolsonaro’s 2018 election marked a sharp turn toward the right and the beginning of efforts to grow closer with Washington. Bilateral relations were particularly amicable under the Trump administration. In recognition of their partnership, Trump designated Brazil a major non–North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, granting it access to certain U.S. economic and security programs. In 2020, the two leaders signed a limited trade deal.\n\nHowever, under President Joe Biden, Washington and Brasília have increasingly diverged on major issues, including climate action and Biden’s global effort to combat authoritarianism. Bolsonaro has even made unsubstantiated allegations that Biden committed fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Still, there is potential to deepen the partnership on several fronts, says Brazil-based journalist Catherine Osborn, including the leaders’ pledge to prevent further deforestation of the Amazon.\n\nWhat are Brazil’s other major bilateral ties?\n\nChina. Beijing elevated its relations with Brasília to a comprehensive strategic partnership—the highest classification that China awards its diplomatic partners—in 2012. China has since become Brazil’s top trading partner, primarily due to exports of soybeans and iron ore; in 2021, bilateral trade reached a record $135 billion. Though not a participant in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Brazil is one of the largest recipients of Chinese infrastructure funding in South America. Between 2007 and 2020, Brazil received more than $66 billion in Chinese investment. Brazil is also one of a dozen countries in Latin America that have granted Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications giant, access to its 5G network. Bolsonaro campaigned on ending Brazil’s dependence on China, but the COVID-19 pandemic underscored its continued reliance, as Brazil almost exclusively used Chinese-made vaccines in the early months of global vaccination efforts.\n\nEuropean Union. The European Union (EU) is a major destination for Brazilian agricultural goods, especially soybeans, fruit, and coffee; Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain are the largest European importers. Since 1999, Mercosur has been negotiating a free trade agreement with the bloc, which, if accomplished, would be the EU’s largest trade deal. However, ratification efforts have stalled amid opposition from several EU members. They object to illegal logging in the Amazon, though Brazilian officials assert that these environmental concerns mask EU member states’ desires to protect their agricultural sectors from competition.\n\nRussia. Brazil is Russia’s primary trade partner in Latin America. Over the past twenty-five years, Russian exports to Brazil have grown at an annual rate of 11 percent, reaching $2.2 billion in 2020. Russia has invested billions of dollars in Brazil’s oil and gas sector, infrastructure, and electronics industry, and the two countries collaborate in several multilateral forums, such as BRICS and the G20. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated relations. Brazil has twice voted in support of UN resolutions condemning Russia’s violation of international law, though Bolsonaro has said Brazil will remain neutral in the conflict. At the same time, leading Brazilian lawmakers have criticized Western sanctions against Russia, which they say are contributing to global shortages.\n\nWhat is the state of Brazil’s economy?\n\nWith a GDP of $1.6 trillion in 2021, Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and accounts for almost 30 percent of the region’s economic output. In 2016, it overtook Venezuela as the leading producer of crude oil in South America, and it is the world’s top exporter of beef and soybeans; other major exports include iron ore, sugar, and coffee. It is also a major manufacturer, though in recent decades its economy has shifted toward services.\n\nBrazil is considered a mixed economy that has relatively high tariffs and several state-owned enterprises, most notably the oil and gas giant Petrobras. This is the legacy of import substitution industrialization, or ISI, an economic strategy adopted in the 1930s that used protectionist policies to increase domestic manufacturing. But in the wake of economic crises in the 1970s, policymakers introduced reforms to address growing debt and soaring inflation. These included the 1993 Real Plan [PDF], which established a new currency initially pegged to the U.S. dollar to tame inflation, as well as measures to open the economy to trade. Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 further accelerated Brazil’s integration into the global trading system, though the country retains some aspects of trade protectionism through Mercosur’s common external tariff.\n\nBy the 2000s, Brazil had become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. However, falling commodity prices and the series of high-profile corruption scandals helped bring about Brazil’s worst-ever recession starting in 2014. And more recently with the economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the country continues to struggle with limited growth and double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil remains one of the world’s most unequal countries.\n\nWhat other challenges does Brazil face?\n\nWith general elections set for October 2022, the next administration will be constrained by worsening domestic troubles. Bolsonaro’s primary opponent in the elections is former President Lula, who has promised new approaches to the country’s challenges. These include:\n\nCorruption and political polarization. Brazil ranked 96 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2021. Bolsonaro campaigned on rooting out corruption in the wake of the scandals that led to the impeachment of Rousseff and imprisonment of Lula. In 2019, Bolsonaro signed an anti-crime bill that introduced harsher punishments for corruption, but critics say little progress has been made, and his own administration has been beset by corruption allegations. Election watchdogs worry that Bolsonaro, who has often alleged electoral fraud, will dispute the election results in October should he lose.\n\nClimate and the environment. Deforestation of the Amazon, which hit a fifteen-year high in 2021, has sparked international concern. Many scientists criticize Bolsonaro’s environmental policies, which include opening up the rain forest to more commercial development. By contrast, Lula has proposed creating “green jobs” in the Amazon to replant trees, as well as reopening the Amazon Fund, through which countries previously paid Brazil to monitor and combat deforestation. Still, about 35 percent of energy consumed in Brazil comes from low-carbon sources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind.\n\nCrime and violence. At 22 murders per 100,000 people, Brazil has one of the highest homicide rates in South America; the country also suffers from high rates of robbery, kidnapping, and gender-based violence. Many experts attribute Brazil’s crime rate to wealth inequality, a lack of economic opportunity, and arms and drug trafficking. Bolsonaro has kept up the government’s long-standing “tough on crime” approach, which includes harsh drug laws and strict sentencing.\n\nCOVID-19 policy. Brazil is still grappling with the effects of the pandemic, including economic contraction, increased poverty, and an education crisis that has primarily affected Black and Indigenous communities. More than 680,000 people in Brazil have died, one of the world’s highest per capita death tolls. Global health authorities have criticized the Bolsonaro administration, which downplayed the severity of the virus and opposed lockdown measures. Also, the government’s immunization campaign stumbled over concerns about the efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine. More recently, the government has prioritized U.S.-made vaccines. By late 2022, more than 80 percent of the population was fully vaccinated.",

    "Brazilian election will determine the future of the Amazon rainforest": "The re-election of president Jair Bolsonaro would severely harm the Amazon rainforest, while his rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is promising to reverse much of the recent environmental damage and meet climate change targets\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva (left) and Jair Bolsonaro are the main presidential contenders in the Brazilian election Foto Arena LTDA/Alamy\n\nThe upcoming Brazilian election will decide the fate of the Amazon rainforest, ecologists have warned, as the country looks set to choose between re-electing current president Jair Bolsonaro or his rival and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nSince Bolsonaro took office in 2019, deforestation records have repeatedly been broken as his administration pursued a policy of environmental deregulation. Now, ahead of the 2 October poll, the Amazon is under increased threat as land-grabbers are exploiting what could be their final opportunity to clear trees without retribution, says Philip Fearnside at the National Institute for Research in Amazonia.\n\nThe number of fires in the Brazilian Amazon usually increases in June, when ranchers take advantage of a drop in rainfall to clear land. But even for the dry season, the level of blazes in the Amazon this year has shocked conservationists: 31,513 fires were detected by Brazil’s national space agency in August, the highest number in 12 years and almost half the number seen in the entirety of 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People realise they can get away with ignoring all the current environmental regulations under Bolsonaro, but the end of his first term is looming and many assume he may not be re-elected,” says Fearnside.\n\nIssues like soaring inflation and hunger levels are high on the political agenda, but the vote is also a referendum on the future of the Amazon, say researchers.\n\n“I don’t say this lightly as a scientist, but this is the most important election ever in Brazil for the Amazon and its survival,” says Erika Berenguer at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe amount of forest lost in the Amazon is now 74.65 per cent higher than when Bolsonaro took office, with 13,000 hectares cleared in 2021 alone, the largest annual figure since 2008.\n\nThis deforestation has pushed the Amazon to a tipping point, say ecologists. Unless this is halted, the rainforest will no longer be able to store enough moisture to support itself and will become a savannah.\n\nExperts blame Bolsonaro for the destruction. The president has stripped environmental regulations, appointed military officials who seek to develop the Amazon to run environmental institutions and publicly encouraged colonisation of the forest. “The Bolsonaro administration has been a complete disaster for the environment,” says Fearnside.\n\nBolsonaro’s main opponent, Lula, was president from 2003 to 2010 and leads the latest polls with 41 per cent to Bolsonaro’s 37 per cent. To win in the first round and avoid a run-off poll, scheduled for 30 October, a candidate must gain 50 per cent of the votes.\n\nRead more: Global forest destruction continues despite COP26 deforestation pledge\n\nFormer governor of the state of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, and senator Simone Tebet are also in the presidential race, but are outsiders, polling 8 and 6 per cent, respectively.\n\nLula says he will reverse the environmental damage by dissolving many of Bolsonaro’s decrees, appointing experts to environmental agencies and purging Indigenous reserves of illegal miners.\n\nThe former president has also proposed more ambitious measures, such as the creation of a carbon-pricing scheme, a ministry dedicated to Indigenous peoples and a National Climate Change Authority to ensure Brazil’s policies are in line with its Paris Agreement targets.\n\nConservationists have raised concerns over mega-dams constructed when Lula was in power, but the former union leader has a strong track record on defending the Amazon: deforestation plunged 72 per cent between 2004 and 2016, when Lula and then Dilma Rousseff – his successor as both leader of the Workers’ party and president – were in power.\n\nLula’s administration made Amazon conservation a central goal for all government ministries, says Suely Araújo at the Climate Observatory in São Paulo. As well as stepping up forest monitoring, they sought to tackle the causes of deforestation by promoting sustainable production and formalising land ownership.\n\nThe task this time would be more complicated. Growing mining communities depend on the illicit gold they extract from Indigenous reserves, new roads have been constructed and regions of the Amazon have become lawless.\n\nRead more: Deforestation in Brazil has rocketed since Bolsonaro became president\n\nIf elected, Lula’s strategy will have to be more ambitious this time round, says Izabella Teixeira, the candidate’s adviser on the environment and Brazil’s environment minister from 2010 to 2016.\n\nAs well as military operations to clear the Amazon of illegal miners, loggers and ranchers, the government has to better regulate food and gold markets, incentivise sustainable production and use technology to make agriculture more sustainable, she says.\n\n“I think that Lula is very cautious to understand that this is a huge challenge and is completely different than it was in the past,” says Teixeira.\n\nLula would unite the government with the private sector, scientists and civil society to tackle the root causes of deforestation, Teixeira adds. He would also seek to restore the international relationships and conservation funding that have been lost under Bolsonaro, making Brazil a global leader on tackling climate change, she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolosonaro has played down the growing deforestation. He told the UN General Assembly in New York on 20 September that the Amazon is as pristine today as it was in the 1500s. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up to our free Fix the Planet newsletter to get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox, every Thursday",

    "Brazil’s Catholic Church frowns on proposals to legalize homeschooling": "SÃO PAULO – Facing opposition from both the Brazilian bishops and the National Association of Catholic Education, conservative Christian groups are pressuring President Jair Bolsonaro and lawmakers to legalize homeschooling.\n\nBrazil’s Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that although homeschooling was possible, specific legislation was necessary to allow it.\n\nSeeking a second term in elections scheduled for next month, Bolsonaro has met with advocates of homeschooling on two different occasions since the end of August.\n\nIt is estimated that around 30,000 families in Brazil educate their children at home, despite the legal ambiguity surrounding the practice.\n\nWithout specific legal protection, they risk being charged by the authorities with the intellectual neglect of their children.\n\nIn May, a homeschooling bill endorsed by Bolsonaro passed in the Chamber of Deputies, but still must be approved in the Senate.\n\nAlthough the Catholic Church in other countries has been supportive of homeschooling – or at least neutral on the subject – the church in Brazil has been firmly opposed to the legislation.\n\nAccording to Ascânio Sedrez, an experienced principal of Catholic schools in São Paulo and a member of the National Association of Catholic Education (ANEC), homeschooling “is a bad idea on several levels and seems especially inappropriate in the current Brazilian situation.”\n\n“We have just witnessed firsthand how most families clearly were not able to handle the learning process of their children at home during the pandemic. Now those people want to take education to families again,” Sedrez told Crux.\n\nIndeed, educational assessment data released by the government on Sept. 16 showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a brutal impact on the literacy development of elementary school students. Experts fear the possible consequences of such deficiencies for future learning.\n\nSedrez argued that the Bolsonaro administration has been continually dismantling previously consolidated educational policies with the aim of “reducing costs with schools and opening the way for their privatization.”\n\nHomeschooling in that sense is, at the same time, an excuse for Bolsonaro’s free market agenda and a way of “showing to his constituents that he is a pro-family president, given that he supports the rights of families to educate their children at home,” he said.\n\nAlthough homeschooling is mostly supported by Evangelicals and Pentecostals, many conservative and traditionalist Catholics also prefer educating their children at home.\n\nIn the politically charged scenario in Brazil since Bolsonaro’s election in 2018, many conservative Catholics have been increasingly suspicious of schools, frequently perceived as places of ideological indoctrination by left-wing groups. That has been a top reason for the new interest in homeschooling.\n\n“Schools combat mostly the Catholic Church and its 2,000-year thought. It is sad to see that the episcopate is aligned against the possibility of a truly Catholic education for our children,” said Ricardo Silva, father of a one-year-old son.\n\nFor two years, he and his wife have been members of the Society of Saint Pius X, a traditionalist fraternity founded by Archbishop Michel Lefebvre in 1970 that is in irregular communion with the Vatican. Silva is worried about secular education, “which attacks the church and struggles against its doctrine, at the same time relativizing the knowledge in several areas,” he said.\n\n“The most important thing about homeschooling is that I will be able to teach my son about the church doctrine the way it used to be taught till 60 or 70 years ago. Besides, learning at home is faster and more efficient than learning at school,” Silva said.\n\nHe said that he does not fear his son will lose anything by not going to school because his family is able to provide a good environment for socialization.\n\n“I believe families should have the right to teach their children at home,” he said.\n\nSedrez said homeschooling “appears for some people as a way of preserving a Catholic identity that has been perverted by the world.”\n\n“But it is part of an ideology that opposes public schools and universities. It opposes everything that can lead to emancipation,” he added.\n\nMany private companies have been giving signs that they are ready to get into the market of educational systems to help families in homeschooling.\n\n“They know there is money in it. Many of those families have financial conditions of hiring a tutor. It is really an elitist project,” Sedrez said.\n\nAuxiliary Bishop Joaquim Mol Guimarães of Belo Horizonte, one of the members of the episcopate who has been following the debate on homeschooling over the past few years, argued that it is never a good solution, given that it disregards relevant economic disparities in society.\n\n“That is a rather excluding and elitist project that may have terrible consequences if the poor end up being put aside – like they are in other aspects,” he told Crux.\n\nGuimarães, who is the president of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, stressed that both families and schools have fundamental roles in the learning process, but “schools can at times supplant the families that lack the conditions to adequately offer the basic elements of education.”\n\n“Schools have an indispensable relevance because they put children side by side, something that is primordial for human development in learning projects guided by well-prepared teachers,” he said.\n\nSedrez emphasized that a truly Christian educational perspective has to consider that “ours is a gregarious species, so education must be a collective experience.”\n\n“Besides, Catholics need to be educated for common life – in community and in society as a whole,” he said.\n\nThe parents’ ability to properly teach their children is another concern among education experts in Brazil.\n\nAccording to Guimarães, good teachers are trained to help students think about reality and its meaning.\n\n“We cannot be sure that family members, even though they have studied to have a career in this or that field, have the conditions and the pedagogical resources necessary to teach all subjects,” he said.",
    "How Latin Grammy-nominated Brazilian artist Gabeu turns sertanejo into queernejo : NPR": "Challenging traditional sertanejo, Brazil's Gabeu creates space for queer love songs\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pedro Nekoi for NPR Pedro Nekoi for NPR\n\nIn celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, NPR Music is spotlighting a series of artists across Latin America who are engaging with their musical heritage in unique ways. From reworking conservative genres for new eras, to teasing out modern sounds from old-school instruments, these artists represent the wide range of experimentation that makes up contemporary Latin music.\n\nIn certain parts of Brazil, it's nearly impossible to escape the sound of sertanejo. Deep in the countryside, in the small towns that line soybean farms and endless stretches of land, you won't find bikinis, coconut water or samba for miles. This is the land of country music and cowboy hats. \"It doesn't matter where you are — every dive bar or restaurant will be playing it,\" says singer Gabeu, who grew up in Franca, a small city in the state of São Paulo. \"That or a duo will be performing sertanejo songs live.\"\n\nMelding elements of rock, pop and forró, the melodic genre is often touted as Brazil's alternative to American country music. But it's also more complicated than that. \"Unlike country, sertanejo is distinctly Latin American,\" says Gabeu, speaking via Zoom from his living room couch in São Paulo. \"It draws inspiration from Paraguayan genres [such as the guaranía or the polka], for example. Maybe that's why it's hard to fully explain what it is.\" What is certain, however, is that it is the biggest genre in the country. Consistently topping the national charts, sertanejo is an increasingly popular — and lucrative — industry. Last year, 60% of the top hits played on Brazilian radio fell under the genre.\n\nPart of what makes the genre so successful is that its artists are decidedly earnest. It's common in sertanejo for lovelorn musicians to sing about longing and heartbreak — experiences people often relate to. But not everyone can see themselves in these stories. Growing up, Gabeu, the son of well-known sertanejo artist Solimões, could never relate to the straight, heteronormative ballads around him. So on his 2021 debut album AGROPOC, which earned a Latin Grammy nomination this year for best sertaneja music album, he set out to change that by singing about finding queer love in the country's largely conservative heartland. Part of a new scene called \"queernejo,\" Gabeu, 24, is among a group of artists leading the charge in the creation of a new kind of sertanejo — one which carves out space for more than one kind of love story.\n\nThat starts with flipping the image of the macho cowboy on its head. For as long as Gabeu can remember, sertanejo singers have been straight. And while they may no longer look exactly like they did in the '90s — women, for example, now hold an increasingly larger stake in the genre — conventional gender stereotypes and heteronormativity still loom large. \"These days the look can feel more modern for men, it's more polo shirts and jeans, less traditional\" says Gabeu. \"Maybe a cowboy hat or a big belt buckle once in a while.\" But, at its core, the genre's relationship with traditional gender dynamics and aesthetics has largely stayed the same, he explains.\n\nGabeu started feeling like the odd one out in his city when he was a teenager. The longer he spent at sertanejo shows and drinking in the barzinhos around town, the more he realized these spaces weren't meant for him. \"I was beginning to understand my sexuality and just couldn't see myself in any of it,\" says Gabeu, running a hand through his short, flame-colored hair. \"That's when I started listening to American pop.\" Finding Lady Gaga helped. \"I loved all the divas, but she was the main one for me,\" he adds with a laugh. \"At one point, I really was that annoying fan.\"\n\nMoving away from Franca to study film in São Paulo was another turning point. \"While I was there, I started getting to know queer artists who were daring to try their hand at genres that weren't pop: people from working class neighborhoods that made hip-hop, queer musicians from the northeast making brega funk,\" an energetic style of dance music born in Recife, Brazil. It soon became clear that if they could do it, he could do it too.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe way Gabeu sees it, sertanejo has a lot to gain from mingling with other genres, from pop to American country to tecno brega. \"I wanted AGROPOC to be playful,\" he says. \"Every song points in a different direction.\" Lyrically, Gabeu's strength lies in his ability to craft evocative scenes out of personal experience — a characteristic shared by the best sertanejos. \"How much longer do we have to love in the dark?\" he asks in the track \"Amor Rural\" over a jangly guitar lick. \"Every piece of this farm is hiding the truth.\"\n\nAGROPOC opens with a fake radio message broadcast in an imaginary world. \"This is AGROPOC, the most popular sertanejo radio station in the country,\" says Gabeu in the first track. It's wishful thinking, he tells me, but not necessarily impossible. In 2020, Gabeu and non-binary sertanejo artist Gali Galó launched the country's first queernejo music festival, Fivela Fest. Bringing together live performances and talks, it sought to introduce the genre to a wider audience. \"People like Alice Marcone, Reddy Allor and Zerzil performed,\" says Gabeu. \"It wasn't hugely popular, but we managed to reach our audience.\"\n\nFor Gabeu, it's impossible to separate the onset of queernejo from Brazil's broader political situation. Over the course of the past four years, a remarkable number of sertanejo artists have spoken out in favor of Brazil's far-right, anti-LGBTQ+ President Jair Bolsonaro. \"That really messed with me,\" says Gabeu.\n\nIt was also about what the president represented to Gabeu. \"I remember having a horrible experience around the time Bolsonaro was elected at a Shania Twain concert in Barretos.\" During the show, Twain invited a gay couple onto the stage and one of them proposed. \"I've never heard so much booing in my life,\" the artist says.\n\nIn some ways, the genre's support for the president is still ongoing. In 2018, leading artist Gusttavo Lima declared his support for the president in a video in which he is seen shooting a rifle. Ahead of the presidential election on Oct. 2, the duo Mateus e Cristiano launched a jingle for Bolsonaro's campaign.\n\nStill, the scene is changing. \"In some ways, queernejo was born out of this gigantic need to redefine the genre's relationship with Bolsonarismo,\" says Gabeu. \"It's also why we try to reclaim symbols too, even when it might seem like we're leaning on stereotypes: I want people to look at a cowboy hat and not see a Bolsonaro supporter.\"\n\nThis feels like a distant reality, but recent strides made by queer country artists in North America such as Orville Peck, whose song \"Dead of Night\" scored a highly-discussed scene in the HBO hit series Euphoria this year, make him hopeful. For Gabeu, there's no reason queernejo can't enter the Brazilian mainstream in the same way one day.\n\nFor now, however, his focus is reaching queer Brazilians who, like him, grew up thinking sertanejo wasn't for them. \"There are so many people in the LGBTQ+ community living in the countryside,\" he says. \"How crazy is it to think that this is the first time they've been able to see and hear themselves in the genre?\" It's no surprise many might feel inclined to change the radio station when sertanejo plays. But, if they hear a queernejo song instead, they might be inclined to keep listening.\n\nCarolina Abbott Galvão is a researcher at Monocle magazine.

    "Religion is shaping Brazil's presidential election – but its evangelicals aren't the same as America's": "Eds: This story was supplied by The Conversation for AP customers. The Associated Press does not guarantee the content.\n\nAmy Erica Smith, Iowa State University\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) With one week to go before Brazil’s presidential election, the two front-runners are battling for the religious vote.\n\nLast month, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro told an evangelical church service that the presidential palace had been “consecrated to demons” under previous presidential administrations – a gibe against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, and his center-left Workers’ Party.\n\nLula is running again in this year’s election, whose first round is Oct. 2, 2022, and has joined the fray. In his official campaign kickoff in August 2022, for instance, he alleged that the right-wing current president, Jair Bolsonaro, is “possessed by the devil.”\n\nLula has been heavily favored to win the election and retake the office he held from 2003 to 2010. In polls, he currently runs about 15 percentage points ahead of Bolsonaro.\n\nReligious voters are an important part of the story. Bolsonaro – whom international media dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics” for his persona as a conservative firebrand, his anti-democratic streak, and his ability to attract a Christian base – garnered 70% of evangelical support in the 2018 election. Scholars, including me, argue that without the evangelical vote, he would have narrowly lost.\n\nHowever, as a political scientist who has written a book about religious politics in Brazil, I see these comparisons between the U.S. and Brazil as also glossing over key differences. Yes, Bolsonaro and Trump are very similar in how they use religion. Yet the ways evangelical communities work and how religion shapes politics is different in each country – and my own research suggests that conservative Christians will not be as consistent a base for Bolsonaro as they are for Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nWho’s who\n\nOne key difference is the language used: who “evangelicals” are in the first place.\n\nIn Latin America, traditionally a Catholic stronghold, the Spanish and Portuguese term “evangelico” is applied to nearly all non-Catholic Christians, including Protestant denominations that are usually classified as “mainline” or even “progressive” in the U.S. Estimates indicate that around a third of Brazilians identify as evangelical today, up from just a few percentage points in 1970. In the same period, the percentage of Catholics has fallen from over 90% to right about half.\n\nBy contrast, in the U.S. the term “evangelical” is reserved for theologically conservative Protestant groups, as well as Christians who have had a “born-again” experience of religious awakening. Americans also increasingly apply the term “evangelical” in a political sense, to refer to predominantly white political conservatives who are affiliated with Protestant churches.\n\nAs a result, the group of people termed “evangelicals” is much more diverse in Latin America than in the United States – and it’s politically quite diverse, too. All this said, many evangelicals in Brazil do have some tendency to adopt theologically conservative beliefs, such as interpreting the Bible literally.\n\nDozens of parties\n\nA second major difference is the lack of strong partisan affiliation on Brazil’s religious right. Since the 1970s, many Americans are used to associating evangelicalism with the Republican Party. The founding of groups such as Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority helped spur evangelicals to become a strong base for political conservatism.\n\nHowever, there is no political party in Brazil that can claim such a strong link to evangelicals as a whole. Brazilian politics is famously fragmented, especially on the right, and there are dozens of parties in Congress at any given time. Many parties – mostly conservative ones – court evangelicals, but none have shored up strong loyalty across the wide spectrum of evangelical denominations and churches.\n\nJair Bolsonaro personifies this weak partisanship. Bolsonaro ran for the presidency in 2018 under the Social Liberal Party, but then left the party to attempt to form his own party in 2019 after taking office. Those efforts ultimately failed, and he joined the Liberal Party in late 2021.\n\nEvangelicals may support Jair Bolsonaro, but polls have shown they have little loyalty to whatever party he is affiliated with at the moment. As a result, the president cannot count on his voters to also elect his political allies. Ultimately, this very weak partisanship in the electorate weakens presidents, since they have to negotiate with a highly fragmented Congress.\n\nKey issues\n\nA third difference between evangelicals in Brazil and the U.S. relates to their views on political issues. Like their counterparts in the U.S., religious conservatives in Brazil feel very strongly about issues related to sex and gender. In a striking parallel to recent controversies in U.S. public schools, Brazilian evangelicals mobilized politically over the past decade to oppose efforts to teach children and teenagers tolerance on LGBTQ issues.\n\nHowever, Brazilian evangelicals are much less conservative than their American counterparts on many other issues. This is particularly the case for topics on which U.S. evangelicals often follow cues from the Republican Party. For instance, my research shows that Brazilian evangelicals from a wide range of denominations are highly supportive of environmental action such as preventing deforestation.\n\nMany Brazilian evangelicals have historically tended to come from poor areas and communities of color, leading them to support issues such as welfare policy and affirmative action. About 1 in 3 Brazilian evangelicals identifies as white, versus 2 in 3 in the U.S.\n\nAs a result, they are likely to be attracted to President Bolsonaro for his conservative stances on gender and sexuality. However, they may penalize him for his very weak record of environmental protection as well as what is generally recognized as poor performance on the economy and COVID-19.\n\nTea leaves\n\nWhat does this mean for the upcoming presidential election? Bolsonaro is again attracting evangelicals, though not yet as strongly as in 2018. New evidence indicates that only about a quarter of evangelical churches are getting involved in the campaign so far this year – a substantially lower share than what my co-authors and I documented in 2018.\n\nHowever, particular churches are still taking a strong stance. Brazil’s most politically engaged Pentecostal church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, is urging its followers to begin a monthlong “fast” from secular news sources. This will presumably increase the political influence of church leaders, including the church’s head, Bishop Edir Macedo, who is an ardent Bolsonaro supporter.\n\nLike their U.S. counterparts, Brazilian evangelicals tend to be highly religious and believe that religion should influence politics. What that means in 2022, however, is harder to divine than ever. After Bolsonaro’s four years in office, evangelicals may well judge him by his track record, not just by his promises – which could be both a blessing and a curse for him.\n\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

    "Will Brazil’s COVID disaster sway its presidential election?": "Brazilians have recognized the more than 600,000 people in their country who have died of COVID-19 with a display of white handkerchiefs.Credit: Buda Mendes/Getty\n\nAccording to official government statistics, more than 685,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, placing it among the nations with the most fatalities. As infections skyrocketed in Brazil between 2020 and 2021, the country spread the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus beyond its borders, exporting the virus ten times more often than it imported it, according to a study published in Nature Microbiology last month1. The results suggest that the nation — Latin America’s largest — was a COVID-19 epicentre, and that policies implemented by its government, and its leader Jair Bolsonaro, failed to curb the virus.\n\nThe report comes as Brazil gears up to elect its next president in October. Bolsonaro is up for re-election and faces 11 challengers, including former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who led the nation from 2003 to 2010. It remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro’s questionable pandemic response will work against him during the election. Public-health researchers have decried his refusal to implement lockdown measures, his spreading of misinformation about vaccines and his backing of ineffective drugs such as hydroxychloroquine to combat COVID-19.\n\n‘We are being ignored’: Brazil’s researchers blame anti-science government for devastating COVID surge\n\n“For most of the pandemic, the government did not offer a coordinated response, giving room to a wave of disinformation — at times spurred by leaders in the federal government,” says Otávio Ranzani, an epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo and at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.\n\nMany of the presidential candidates, including Bolsonaro, are promising to bolster Brazil’s health system, known as SUS. But the country is also now grappling with other issues, including food security and economic inflation, which could trump pandemic concerns when Brazilians head to the voting booth. According to a recent study from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a higher-education think tank based in Rio de Janeiro, one in three Brazilians could not afford to eat properly in 2021 — the highest proportion in more than a decade.\n\nStill, it’s exciting that health care is being discussed in this presidential election, says Rosana Onocko Campos, president of the Brazilian Association of Collective Health in Campinas, São Paulo. “It is the first time I’ve seen the great majority of candidates say they agree that an increase in federal funding for SUS is needed,” she says.\n\nVirus exporter\n\nAccording to the Nature Microbiology study, SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Brazil mainly from Europe in early 2020, before the country had implemented any response measures. But between then and September 2021, the nation spread the virus to many countries; the highest number of virus exports went to other South American nations, ten of which border Brazil (see ‘Super spreader’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo draw these conclusions, the team sequenced 3,800 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from infected people in 8 Brazilian states and one neighbouring country, Paraguay. The researchers also analysed genome sequences in the popular data repository GISAID — more than 13,000 from Brazil and about 100 from Paraguay — to understand which coronavirus variants were prevalent, and at what times, between 2020 and 2021. And they compared their sequences with more than 25,000 global sequences to draw conclusions about viral spread. They found that Brazil had most often exported the Gamma variant, which first emerged within its borders.\n\nThe main point of the study, says lead author Marta Giovanetti, a visiting virologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, “is to discuss the role of populational mobility and the emergence of the first variants of concern” in Brazil.\n\n‘The perfect storm’: lax social distancing fuelled a coronavirus variant’s Brazilian surge\n\nTo Marcelo Gomes, a public-health specialist and computational scientist, the findings make sense, because COVID-19 infections in Brazil remained at a consistently high level from 2020 through September 2021, making transmission to other countries possible. Gomes is based at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, of which the institute is a part.\n\nThe SUS was overwhelmed by COVID-19, revealing a resource deficit, Onocko says. “We need to requalify services and personnel to increase technical capacity for faster service [and have] better coordination among the federal, state and local governments. It will take an extraordinary effort,” she says.\n\nPromises, promises\n\nAcknowledging that the SUS was overworked during the pandemic, Bolsonaro has promised a 250% increase in funding for health-care workers if he is re-elected. He and Lula — who are leading the polls — have pledged to bolster Brazil’s post-pandemic response, and Lula wants to improve women’s access to public services for the prevention and treatment of disease.\n\nHow these promises would be implemented and paid for isn’t clear to many researchers, however. “The proposals are superficial and don’t go into concrete steps on how they will face the challenges we have,” says physician Gonzalo Vecina Neto, who directed Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLatin America’s embrace of an unproven COVID treatment is hindering drug trials\n\nVecina worries that even though the candidates have acknowledged the impact of the pandemic, and made various pledges in response, public-health concerns are being overshadowed by the economy and other issues during the run-up to the election. “The sensation I have is we are forgetting what happened”, he says, “and we are now facing new outbreaks such as monkeypox without having learned enough from the pandemic.”\n\nOthers agree. Ranzani says he wants to see more emphasis on strengthening the SUS and Brazilian research in election discussions. “It is fundamental for us to face what the pandemic has caused and still causes.”\n\nThe Brazilian presidential election takes place on 2 October. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the vote, the two front-runners will advance to a run-off, which will take place on 30 October.",
    "Why Brazilian football fans are ditching the yellow jersey": "Once an icon of unity and luck, the association of the shirt with Brazil’s far right has led football fans to give up on it.\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil – Higor Ramalho, an ardent football fan, plans to resume his regular trips to football stadiums as worries over the spread of the coronavirus ease, restrictions are lifted and the nation gets into the World Cup spirit.\n\nHowever, the famous yellow jersey associated with the Brazilian national team has been hanging in his closet since June 2018. The last time he wore it was on his birthday. He does not know when, and if, he will ever wear it again.\n\n“Wearing the yellow jersey was a moment of pride for me,” the 33-year-old told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It was a symbol of victory. I used to wear it not only while watching matches but also on regular days. Now, I have stopped wearing it for political reasons. The current president, along with his supporters, turned the yellow jersey into a political campaign and a symbol of their political party.\n\n“And as I don’t support their political ideas, I refuse to be mistaken as one of them.”\n\nThe yellow jersey, known as the “canarinho jersey”, has not always been the Brazil national team’s shirt.\n\nIt was designed in 1953, three years after the World Cup final heartbreak at the hands of Uruguay in the Maracana. At the time, the national team wore white.\n\nThe national football governing body, along with a newspaper, launched a competition to design a new uniform for the national side, the condition being the new kit should have the colours of the national flag as the current did not carry “the idea of Brazilian nationality”.\n\nMore than 300 entries were submitted. The winning submission was by Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a Brazilian who felt torn by the 1950 result given that he was born on the border with Uruguay.\n\nFast forward many years, including a record five football World Cup wins and two Copa America triumphs, the yellow jersey had become a symbol of optimism, luck and unity among football fans.\n\nThe number 10 worn by Pele during his mesmerising years on the pitch, Ronaldo’s number 9 when he became a World Cup winner and Romario’s number 11 during his dazzling World Cup 1994 run all became part of Brazil’s rich and successful history on the pitch.\n\nBut the shirt’s adoption in political campaigns, most recently by President Jair Bolsonaro and his right-wing supporters prior to his 2018 election win, forced a huge number of fans to give up on it.\n\nAnalysts say those same iconic moments of Brazilian football are being used off the pitch to promote ideas antithetical to the unity that made the national team, and the country, famous.\n\n“Football is something iconic for Brazil, it is what brings everybody together most of the time,” Isabela Guedes, 25, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“When they [right-wing supporters] take something so meaningful for the country and use it with political intentions, it is like they are stealing it from us. I don’t feel comfortable hanging a flag on my window during the World Cup because I will be mistaken for people with completely different political views.\n\n“They have taken the flag and yellow jersey and turned them into political symbols.”\n\nCo-opting the jersey did not start with Bolsanaro supporters. In 1970, the military dictatorship used the national flag and the team’s image, associating the essence of Brazil with the team, according to Carolina Fontenelle, a researcher at the Laboratory of Media and Sports Studies at UERJ.\n\nGeneral Medici, Brazil’s military leader at the time, also played a big role in the removal of the national team coach ahead of the 1970 Mexico World Cup.\n\nWith time, and these efforts, a strong connection was formed between Brazilians and their team’s jersey, she added.\n\n“Since then, the yellow jersey has been perceived as a symbol. People look at that jersey and wear it with pride because they feel part of a group,” Fontenelle told Al Jazeera.\n\nBefore that, during the 2013 riots protesting a rise in the cost of living, corruption and police brutality, the jersey took on another aspect.\n\n“People part of the riots were also wearing it. There was a high number of people on the streets protesting against many things, including the money spent on the World Cup 2014. In 2018, we had the far-right wearing the jersey,” Fontenelle said.\n\n“So those who don’t agree with it start to feel ashamed. The jersey gives a feeling that you belong to a group and this feeling is lost when it is being used by a political group that doesn’t defend the minorities.”\n\n“During the 2014 elections, the campaign of [centre-right candidate] Aecio Neves hijacked the colours of the Brazilian flag,” Fontenelle said.\n\n#GiveBackOurFlag\n\nJust over two years ago, a campaign, led by writer and filmmaker Joao Carlos Assumpcao, demanded the national football body abolish the famous yellow jersey and bring back the white and blue kit.\n\n“We’re in a ghastly situation with a horrendous government that has stolen our flag,” Assumpcao had said at the time.\n\nSeveral pro-democracy groups, including the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, tried to dissociate the colour with the far-right campaign.\n\nIn 2020, following campaigns by Bolsonaro supporters on the Supreme Court and Congress, it urged its readers to wear yellow as part of the dissociation campaign.\n\n#DevolvamNossaBandeira (#GiveBackOurFlag) also got the backing of several political figures.\n\n“Football is for everyone, I don’t like it [the jersey] being used by people who promote racism, sexism and discrimination,” Ademir Takara, the librarian and historian at the Museum of Football in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The shirt is the opposite of that. It represents unity and it’s not being used for that purpose. There’s an affectionate relationship between people and the shirt – the beautiful game attached to something it represented.\n\n“From 2013, it has become a political thing more than ever before. It’s being used by people with different ideas who wanted something to unify them and the shirt was the easiest and strongest thing they saw.”\n\nEarlier this month, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters flocked the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, among other cities, as part of a campaign push ahead of the October elections, just a month ahead of the Qatar World Cup.\n\nMany of them wore the yellow jersey.\n\nFormer president Luiz Inacio Lula, tipped to win next month’s polls, lashed out at the demonstration on the anniversary of Brazil’s 200 years of independence.\n\n“7 September should be a day of love and union for Brazil. Unfortunately, that’s not what is happening today. I have faith Brazil will recover its flag, its sovereignty and its democracy,” Lula tweeted.\n\nWith love for the jersey, football fan Marina Moreno told Al Jazeera how “frustrated” she was “to see the yellow jersey becoming a symbol of the current government”.\n\n“Today, it is almost impossible to not associate it with the current president and his supporters. It’s automatic and it’s frustrating. I don’t support the current government and I don’t want to be mistaken for one of his supporters so I decided to don’t to wear it any more.”",

    "Neymar Is Still a Singular Star, but He Has More Help on Brazil": "For now, at least. As the roar that had met Neymar’s name subsided, the announcer still had one player left to introduce. “Numéro vingt,” he said — “Vinicius Junior.” The cheer that followed was not quite so loud as Neymar’s. It did not last quite as long. But the difference was not so stark as might have been expected.\n\nWith two months to go before the World Cup, Tite, the Brazil coach, would not have it any other way. It has been 20 years since Brazil was declared champion of the world; miss out again in Qatar, and the wait for a sixth crown will match the lacuna between the third and fourth.\n\nMore troublingly still, in the past four tournaments, it has not really gone close: beaten comfortably by the French in 2006, the Dutch in 2010 and the Belgians in Russia four years ago. The team made the semifinals on home soil in 2014, of course, but the less said about how that particular story ended, from a Brazilian point of view, the better.\n\nThat defeat, though, highlighted the problem that has beset Brazil for the past decade. Neymar was missing with an injury as Germany etched a scar on the national psyche in the Maracana in 2014 (joined on the sidelines, not insignificantly, by Thiago Silva). In his absence, Brazil seemed bereft, adrift, unable to conceive of how to win the game without its leading man, the player to whom the team, as much as the country, was in thrall.",

    "Brazil will channel 2002 vibes to try and end World Cup trophy drought": "Brazil's hopes of breaking their World Cup drought this year are high. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the summer of 2002, under a sweltering Japanese heat inside the International stadium in Yokohama, Brazil dazzled the footballing world by becoming the most successful nation in the history of the men's World Cup, beating Germany 2-0 and earning their fifth trophy. Blessed with an embarrassment of riches -- from Rivaldo to Ronaldinho, Cafu and Golden Boot winner Ronaldo \"O Fenomeno\" Nazario -- it was the perfect conclusion to a perfect tournament. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men had emulated the legendary 1970 victory, having also won every match in the competition, and gave Brazilians a sense of redemption against mighty Europe after losing to France four years earlier.\n\n\"I feel pleasure, a joy that the people of Brazil are feeling now,\" Scolari said after the match. \"The joy of knowing we did our job, but it was full of very hard work. Brazil back as world champions -- that is not something we can forget.\"\n\nBack in Brazil, people on the streets celebrated for days, joyful at not just the victory but the fact that the Selecao was finally back where it belonged: at the top of soccer royalty. (Speaking of royalty, Japan's emperor Akihito couldn't attend the ceremony due to national custom, but it didn't matter to Brazilians as Pele, their footballing king, handed the trophy to Cafu instead.)\n\n\"It was an amazing thing that happened in my life. From the combination of the players we had, the generation [of those players], the way we won it... I can't fully describe how I felt that day but it was a very special day for me,\" Kleberson, who was a member of Scolari's historic squad and is now working as an assistant coach at defending MLS champions and newly crowned Campeones Cup winners NYCFC, told ESPN. It was the midfielder's decisive run and pass to Ronaldo (which included a lovely dummy from Rivaldo) that secured the second goal against Germany. \"The fact that I shared this with the best players in the world, it was a powerful moment in my life,\" he added.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nBrazil out to end World Cup trophy drought\n\nTwenty years later and, as a new World Cup appears on the horizon, Brazil are still holding on to those memories from Japan and South Korea, hoping to use them as fuel as their drought continues. Should they lose in Qatar, it will mark 24 years without winning the coveted trophy and, even though there has been some success (three Copa America titles and an Olympic gold medal) and some gigantic failures (see the 2014 World Cup semifinals), two decades without lifting the most valuable piece of silverware in the game is just not acceptable for Brazilians.\n\n\"We know it's been a long time since we have won it. We were close in 2006, and also in 2010, and of course the result at home against Germany... no-one wants to remember that,\" Kleberson says of the 2014 nightmare when Brazil lost 7-1 in the semifinals at the Mineirao stadium in Belo Horizonte. \"I believe, however, that it's all about the generations and a lot of things change. A lot of Brazilian players have changed during those times and thanks to the younger players now, those playing in Europe, Brazil has a great chance again to win the World Cup. It's a process and we need to continue this process in order to see Brazil play the way it can.\"\n\nThis process under Tite has generated some impressive players to choose from. So much so that there is an erratic sense about his squad selections. At least from an offensive standpoint, there are too many cooks in the kitchen and Tite -- entering his final World Cup as manager -- has to get it right. But one thing is for sure, this Brazilian side, which eased its way into qualification in record form (10 wins, three draws, 30 goals scored and only five conceded) has the potential to overwhelm anyone in Qatar. And it's not a stretch to say that the talent not only matches the 2002 squad, but could very well surpass it.\n\n\"This [current] squad is bringing back a lot of the same style from before when we had Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo in the team, we now have players like Neymar, Vinicius Jr., even Rodrygo... they're bringing so much talent to the team,\" says Kleberson. \"But I don't think we should compare too much. It's two different squads. The players from 2002 were of a different generation to what we have now. Brazil, I think ultimately want to play with freedom, one-on-one on the field, with really creative, fast and powerful players.\"\n\nNeymar is one the keys to success. Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images\n\nNeymar leads the way\n\nAll of these attributes begin with the team's obvious leader, Neymar Jr., who is the undoubted headliner of this squad.\n\n\"Neymar Jr. is the best player in Brazil and maybe in the world. The way he plays, with passion and how he contributes on the pitch,\" says Kleberson. \"He can bring a lot of qualities for Brazil and I think he is probably going to push himself and Brazil a lot in order to have the perfect World Cup.\"\n\nEven with the likes of Champions League winners Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, or the showmanship of Raphinha or Antony, this is Neymar's team and just like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he represents the final chapter of current World Cup nobility, knowing full well that younger stars are ready to take over. This might not be his last World Cup, but it might be his last to fully take centre stage, and just like Kleberson states, from a contribution perspective, it's coming at the perfect time.\n\nUnder new PSG manager Christophe Galtier, Neymar is having one of his best campaigns -- he leads the scoring charts with seven goals and is tied with Messi with seven assists from seven Ligue 1 appearances. He tops the list for direct goal contributions in Europe's Big Five leagues but, more importantly, Neymar is playing like the Neymar we knew from his Santos days: Free, brave, uncompromising. This is similar to Ronaldo in 2002, who after recovering from injury, decided to wave goodbye to any inhibition. Hence \"that\" haircut, I guess.\n\nOnly three goals behind Pele (77) for the all-time national scoring record, Neymar could have more than one reason to celebrate in 2022.\n\n\"I don't think it will be Neymar's last World Cup, because I think he can play for a long time,\" Kleberson says. \"But I believe he's going to be putting a lot of work in to be at the top and help Brazil win the World Cup. I am looking forward to seeing him be successful in 2022.\"\n\nplay 0:42 Laurens: Close Atletico's stadium after racist chants Julien Laurens calls for Atletico Madrid's next home game to be played without a crowd after fans shouted racist chants about Vinicius Junior during Sunday's Madrid derby.\n\nVinicius Jr. needs to keep dancing\n\nSpeaking of working towards the top, nobody in the game seems to be earning it more than Vinicius Jr. these days, and just like his idol Ronaldinho during the 2002 World Cup, he enters Qatar at 22 years old, ready to take some of the burden from the shoulders of his other idol, Neymar.\n\nHowever, Vinicius Jr. is not coming to this World Cup as a young prodigy ready to make an impact on the game. He's there already. A two-time champion in LaLiga and Champions League winner with Real Madrid, the young forward from Rio de Janeiro is already a star.\n\nThere's something else, however, that might motivate him at this World Cup, and that's the willingness to rewrite the script for Afro-Brazilians. After the grotesque racist remarks made by Pedro Bravo, president of the Spanish Agents Association, about his goal celebrations, Vinicius Jr. responded via social media.\n\n'As long as skin color is more important than the brightness of the eyes, there will be war.' I have this sentence tattooed on my body. This thought is permanent in my head. This is the attitude and philosophy I try to practice in my life. They say happiness is upsetting. The happiness of a Black Brazilian successful in Europe upsets much more! But my desire to win, my smile and the sparkle in my eyes are bigger than all of this. You can't even imagine. I was a victim of xenophobia and racism in a single statement. But none of this started yesterday. Weeks ago, they started criminalizing my dances. Dances that are not mine. They belong to Ronaldinho, Neymar, (Lucas) Paquetá, (Antoine) Griezmann, João Félix, Matheus Cunha... they belong to Brazilian Funk and Samba artists, to reggaeton singers and to Black Americans...they are dances to celebrate the cultural diversity of the world. Accept it, respect it. I'm not going to stop. The script always ends with an apology and an 'I've been misunderstood', but I'll repeat it for you, racist: I will not stop dancing. Whether it's in the Sambadrome, in the Bernabéu or wherever.\n\nThe reaction from the soccer world was overwhelming as Brazilian stars of past and present, including Pele, Ronaldo and Neymar, stood behind their compatriot with words of support. Last Sunday, Gabriel Jesus even performed Vinicius Jr.'s celebration after scoring for Arsenal against Brentford. When Rodrygo opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the derby against Atletico at the Metropolitano, he was joined by Vinicius Jr. by the corner flag and proceeded to dance. Atletico responded to the racist chants by their fans before the game.\n\nThis collective moment of unity from the national team of past and present, from teammates and others from the Brazilian national setup -- mainly made of afro-Latinos -- is more than just words of encouragement for the Real Madrid star. It's a call to action, a battle cry and perhaps a taster for what's to come in November. Let's hope the world is ready for more dancing.\n\nQatar 2022 will be Tite's last World Cup. Edilzon Gamez/Getty Images\n\nTite's selection issues\n\nFrom a selection perspective, here's the problem for Tite -- and it was similar for Scolari back in 2002 -- who do you leave out?\n\nGabriel Jesus is not in the squad for the September friendlies, and neither is the well-liked and often-selected Philippe Coutinho. The latter is not as shocking due to recent subpar performances with Aston Villa (although he improved this past weekend against Southampton) but Gabriel Jesus' absence is perplexing, considering how well he has started with the Gunners.\n\nAfter announcing his squad, Tite stated in a news conference that these omissions are in order to allow other players -- such as Flamengo's Pedro, who leads scoring in Copa Libertadores -- to show what they can do. It's still slightly confusing, however, as this is the final break before the World Cup and you would think that Tite, a glutton for detail, would also want to encourage fluidity and chemistry before heading off to Qatar. Regardless, barring any injury setbacks, Gabriel Jesus should still have a seat on the plane in November, though we might not be able to say the same for Coutinho or other players such as Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nTaking a wider look -- just like 2002 with then-31-year-old Cafu, 30-year-old Rivaldo and 29-year-old Roberto Carlos -- there is valuable experience in this current squad. Alisson Becker (29), Casemiro (30), Thiago Silva (38) and Marquinhos (28) are all well-travelled and will be important voices in the dressing room.\n\nMany often question Brazil's defensive issues, specifically out wide, but this side actually defends very well. Conceding only five goals to get to the World Cup, especially in South America, is not an easy feat and this team are once again emulating another blueprint from the 2002 campaign. In Japan/South Korea, Scolari's side emphasized the need to be collective together, on and off the ball; not only did they end the competition in perfect fashion, but they showed their defensive fortitude against some very tough opposition -- allowing just four goals in total, and only one in the knockout stages.\n\n\"I know Tite really well and I know how much he works with the guys at the back,\" Kleberson says. \"The great players we have at centre-back, they're very experienced. Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, sometimes Eder Militao. They give something different to Brazil in terms of defending. But our goalkeepers are also amazing. Two starters in the Premier League (Alisson for Liverpool and Ederson for Man City), then the rest are top in Brazil so they give a lot of consistency for the team. That's why Brazil conceded only five goals in qualifying.\"\n\nThe upcoming World Cup, for better or worse, is unlike no other. Not only are countries dealing with having to stop domestic competition midway through the season, but they also have less time to fully prepare for it as a squad. Brazilians, however, won't care as the time to reclaim the World Cup trophy is right now.\n\n\"We know Germany has a good team. France has a good team. We know Argentina always plays very well at the World Cup but for me I think Brazil has a very good chance just because of the way they are preparing, performing and even talking,\" Kleberson adds. \"They have a lot of players who can play. I think for a long time Brazil hasn't had a team where they can build really, really good players, and that's what's going to make a really powerful Brazil. I believe in Brazil. I hope at the end of the year, we can have this title and win the World Cup.\"\n\nAfter his success in 2002, Ronaldo was asked how much he wanted to win the World Cup? How often did he imagine lifting the trophy? \"I used to visualize the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air. It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it,\" he told reporters. \"I wanted to become a world champion so badly. Achieving that goal, winning the biggest prize there is to win in football, made me ecstatically happy.\"\n\nIt's time for this current squad to share the sentiment.",

Given we had the first LatAm Tech Week here in Brazil with several events, high quality content and intense networking - I will start out with the usual market overview but then jump to a description of everything that happened. The news and deals of the week will be consolidated at the end, instead of doing on a day by day basis. Hope you like it!\n\nDespite the global tech market correction, recent political transitions, rising internet adoption and a growing pool of tech talent are causing a surge of private market activity in Latin America. This week, Pitchbook & Intralinks released a new market brief called Private Investment in LATAM: An Emerging Market's Response To Global Headwinds. It is no news that VC activity skyrocketed globally last year. Latin America was no exception, with deal value more than tripling YoY. Several high profile investment firms are turning to the region, as other emerging markets (such as China) become more challenging to invest. LatAm startups are grasping the attention of global investors, with 2022 having the highest cross-border deal value from non-Latin American investors year-to-date (YTD) than any year prior to 2021. Although it is highly unlikely that venture dealmaking will match the unprecedented levels generated in 2021, there are still a lot of deals happening in the region with investment sentiment becoming “cautiously optimistic”. The region faces significant challenges in the near term (such as Brazil’s upcoming elections); however, the development of its tech ecosystem is a positive signal for investment activity and investors will continue to seek opportunities in this emerging market.\n\nSpeaking of Brazil, Sling Hub & VC Fellows released their new Startup Index. Using the Sling Hub Platform intel, they gathered 3.7 million pieces of data from the Brazilian innovation market and calculated the relative weight of each of these variables. The result is a robust statistical measure that tracks the ecosystem's evolution, enables quick analysis, and helps to predict trends. The image below shows how the index evolved through time. If you want to understand more on the weights of the different variables, and some conclusions drawn from the calculation, go to the link above and download the August 2022 Report.\n\nOn to a less optimistic view, Pitchbook also released its Q3 2022 report on Down Rounds, Impacts, and Exit Opportunities. The decline in public markets has left many private startups with extended valuations and no exit opportunities in sight. VC investor advice shifted from growth at all costs to a focus on breakeven. However, just 6% of completed rounds in 2022 have been at lower valuations than the company’s previous investment, the majority of them occurring at the late stage. Analyzing historical data, companies taking on a down round often continue to grow. Only 13% of companies raising a down round from 2008 to 2014 were unable to raise a new round or exit immediately after the down valuation investment. Nearly 20% of post-down round exits occur via PE buyout, which is a significantly higher proportion than what is seen in the broader venture exit dataset. Nevertheless, as a natural mechanism of a market, down rounds remain unavoidable for some companies within VC. They will likely increase in years after significant market growth, but data shows that these rounds aren’t a contagion and are limited to a few companies within a certain market. I always end on a positive tone :)\n\nWomen’s Update: This week QED Investors, Canary and Itau BBA joined forces to host a Women Founders & Investors breakfast in Brazil. The result was a group of 60 women of different nationalities networking, exchaning experiences and lessons and showing that we are super important to the tech ecosystem!\n\nLatAm Tech Week:\n\nThe 2022 report was launched live (video in the link above) during Canary’s and Atlantico’s Tech Summit.

    "Brazil's Bolsonaro unleashed": "Brazil's Bolsonaro unleashed\n\nFollow Ryan on Twitter | Follow Suzanne\n\nGlobal Insider podcastis back with daily episodes this week.\n\nGood morning from New York, where it’s Day 2 of the U.N. General Assembly high-level week.\n\nToday will see the general debate kick off at around 9 a.m. ET with an address by everyone’s (not-so) favorite bad-boy president, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and a series of other leaders speaking throughout the day.\n\nThe other main attraction is a global food security summit co-hosted by the European Union, United States and the African Union. That event was an EU proposal, but the Americans were keen to have a bite of the pie, dangling the prospect of an appearance by President Joe Biden. However, the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II messed that plan up.\n\nBiden arrives at 5:30 p.m. to JFK airport. And his first event, after skipping today's food security summit: a Democratic National Committee reception...\n\nBut, to set you up for today’s food summit, Ryan sat down with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.\n\nPOLITICO EXCLUSIVE — SPANISH PM PEDRO SÁNCHEZ\n\n‘RUSSIA AT WAR WITH ALL OF EUROPE’: Sánchez told Ryan in a wide-ranging interview that Russia’s VladimirPutin is at war not only with Ukraine, but with the whole EU: “He’s using energy as a war tool,” Sánchez said, because he is threatened by the bloc’s values.\n\nEurope’s energy system is now “a market that doesn't function,” Sánchez said, requiring creative new policies that would have been unthinkable just a couple of years ago. But those policies must not be used to push back climate targets: “Don't use this energy crisis to block moving forward on the climate crisis,” he said.\n\n\n\nBetter together: Overall, Sánchez believes Putin is pushing the EU closer together, and that the bloc is learning from each successive crisis: by pooling debt, defense resources and energy investments. “Learning from the pandemic model, why don't we centralize gas purchases, as we did with the vaccines?” Sánchez asked.\n\nWary of extremes: A social democrat, Sánchez sees dangers in the rise of Europe’s far right, and said center-right parties need to ask harder questions about their relationship with far-right parties: “What do they expect from the far right?”\n\nShaking things up: Asked if he thought the next NATO secretary-general should come from an EU country, Sánchez replied: “Indeed.” The Spanish PM also urged a U.N. shakeup — “the situation created by Russia in Ukraine is major proof that we need strong reform of the U.N. system” — and promised greater engagement with Latin America under Spain’s 2023 Council of the EU presidency, including a summit with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.\n\nDrama back home: Sánchez urged Catalans to “be patient” about dialogue between Barcelona and Madrid, saying “we need to find alternatives, different solutions to solve this crisis,” other than Catalan independence activists demanding secession while the population is deeply divided.\n\nIn a separate interview with U.N. Playbook editor Emma Anderson, Catalonia’s pro-independence President PereAragonès said that while his side had “not recovered the trust” lost amid the Pegasus surveillance revelations, he felt continuing the negotiations with Madrid was nevertheless “more important than the situation of the individual rights that we have.”\n\n“The talks will take time. It's not an issue that will be solved in two or three months, we know that,” Aragonès said.\n\n(Listen to more from the interview here, or read more here.)\n\nSpanish food for thought: Sánchez, a force behind today’s U.N. food security summit, said he will be telling the assembled leaders “we have to respond multilaterally to this food crisis,” including support for the U.N. secretary general’s work to broker the Black Sea grain export deal with Russia and Ukraine, but said “we need to avoid overlap in different initiatives.” There’s no avoiding a price tag: The EU is set to announce plans to spend €600 million on combating the food crisis. And national governments need to be prepared to fund changes to their food systems at home, Sánchez said.\n\nTHE FOOD PLAN: That €600 million plan will essentially deploy money that would otherwise have flowed back to EU countries under the bloc’s European Development Fund. The money is destined for so-called ACP countries — African, Caribbean and Pacific — but is now being primarily redirected to African countries, particularly in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.\n\nWHAT WE'RE WATCHING\n\nALL EYES ON DISRUPTIVE BOLSONARO: Brazilian President JairBolsonaro opens the speakers’ list this morning in the U.N. General Assembly hall. And one knock-on effect of Queen Elizabeth’s funeral Monday is that Biden will not be there to follow directly after him at the podium as normally expected for a U.S. president. Whatever sense of protocol Biden’s presence might have instilled in Bolsonaro is lost.\n\nHere’s a reminder of what he got up to in London, where he joined the queen’s funeral and commemorations: The Times writes that \"not all those invited respected the apolitical nature of the occasion. President Bolsonaro, facing a re-election fight in Brazil next month, held an impromptu rally at his embassy … railing from the balcony against gender ideology, drugs, abortion and his Latin American neighbours.\"\n\nNotable: If Bolsonaro could get from London to New York to take up his usual Tuesday morning speaking slot, so could Biden. He chose not to.\n\nOthers choosing not to come at all: China’s XiJinping, India’s NarendraModi and Russia’s VladimirPutin … who all managed to make it to a summit in Uzbekistan last week.\n\nGuterres speech preview: Expect U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to push leaders on climate in his opening speech today, calling for a windfall tax on the profits of fossil fuel companies to be redirected to the communities suffering most from the impacts of global warming and the energy price crunch, our colleague Karl Mathiesen reports. This comes ahead of a leaders’ climate roundtable on Wednesday.\n\nContext: The fight for the creation of a dedicated fund to pay for damages caused by climate change will intensify at UNGA as vulnerable countries seek to lay down a marker ahead of COP27 climate talks in November.\n\nHOW TO WATCH:Here’s the full speakers’ list. And here’s the livestream.\n\nDOES DEMOCRACY DELIVER? USAID Administrator SamanthaPower told POLITICO ahead of a 1 p.m. rally for democracytoday (U.S. State Secretary AntonyBlinken will headline with Power): \"We can’t just talk about the benefits of democracy — people need to feel and see democratic dividends in their daily lives.” She wants corruption fighters to feel that their efforts pay off in voter support, and urged assistance to “burgeoning democratic bright spots,” including from the private sector and foundations.\n\nBILATERAL WATCH: Some important one-on-one meetings are happening on the sidelines today: Two-week-old U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss is set to meet France’s Emmanuel Macron at around 11:15 a.m. Also, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nTransatlantic doubts: Truss is due to meet Biden on Wednesday for her first big bilateral with the U.S. president since she became British leader. But she admitted on her way over to New York that a U.K. trade deal with the U.S. is unlikely to happen for many years to come, according to our colleague Esther Webber, who is traveling with the new British prime minister. Biden has previously said a U.S.-U.K. trade deal won’t happen if issues related to the Brexit deal’s protocol for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. are not resolved. Refresher on the latest in that row here.\n\nRendezvous for two: The French president is today also set to meet Iran’s President EbrahimRaisi (more on him later) as well as Lebanon’s Prime Minister NajibMikati. Macron and Biden are expected to meet Wednesday, according to an Elysée official.\n\nDROP OUT: The President of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader has canceled his trip to UNGA after Hurricane Fiona ripped through the country.\n\nNO IRAN DEAL HOPE\n\nTop EU diplomat Josep Borrell played down expectations of a breakthrough on the Iran nuclear deal this week, telling POLITICO's Suzanne Lynch that he does not believe a meeting with Tehran’s President Ebrahim Raisi would be productive. Raisi is in town this week, and as always, Iran is using the annual U.N. shindig to try to highlight its stance on the never-ending negotiations on the nuclear deal.\n\nFinal sprint: Borrell said the EU has been pushing all parties “to finally run the last 10 meters” in the process to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement. But he said he did not predict any major progress soon on this issue amid the ongoing EU-led negotiations. More from Suzanne here.\n\nBorrell’s comments to POLITICO got short shrift from Russia’s representative in Vienna, who accused him of “finger-pointing,” and putting too much blame on the Iran side.\n\n\n\nALL ABOUT UKRAINE\n\nWARTIME UNGA: There is one global conflict dominating the agenda this week at the UNGA — the war in Ukraine. Kyiv’s Foreign Minister DmytroKuleba has been doing a round of meetings: from U.S. House Foreign Affairs Chair GregoryMeeks, to EU foreign policy chief Borrell, to an appearance at the European Council on Foreign Relations on Monday. The U.N. Security Council is due to hold a session on Ukraine Thursday\n\nHolding Russia accountable: One issue that Ukraine is pushing this week is how to hold Russia accountable, particularly in light of the fresh discoveries of atrocities in the eastern city of Izyum last week. As Suzanne writes in this piece, while world leaders have been quick to condemn Russian actions, and the U.S. stated that it is more evidence of war crimes, what is less clear is how the international community plans to hold Russia accountable.\n\nWar tribunal: Ukrainian official AndriySmyrnov told POLITICO that Kyiv wants an ad-hoc special tribunal, based on the Nuremberg trials model after World War II, to ensure that the Russian leadership is held to account. But the U.S. and other countries are less keen, preferring the International Criminal Court option. In a sign of growing support, Borrell also told us he is open to a special tribunal, though let’s see if he can bring other EU countries on board.\n\nCollecting the evidence: Playbook hears that Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany are hosting an event on Thursday at German House here in Manhattan to look at the whole issue of war crime accountability. Already, the ICC, Ukrainian authorities and various NGOs and agencies have begun documenting war crimes in the country — the aim now is to cooperate more fully.\n\nRelevant photo gallery: The “Russian War Crimes” exhibition, put on by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, also had Davos-goers riveted in the summer. The opening drinks are Wednesday at 5.30 p.m, and the exhibition officially runs from Thursday to Oct. 2 at the Ukrainian Institute of America, 2 East 79th Street.\n\nMORE BAD NEWS FOR PUTIN: Having been recently rapped on the knuckles by India’s Modi and China’s Xi, now Putin is facing heat from Turkey. In an interview with U.S. broadcaster PBS, Turkey’s President Erdoğan said Putin must return all land that Russia has occupied — including Crimea. More here.\n\nINTERVIEW — WERNER HOYER, PRESIDENT EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK\n\nEIB is the world’s biggest multilateral development bank in the world, with a balance sheet of around $600 billion / 600 billion euros. Hoyer, the bank’s chief, has been participating in UNGA since the 1990s, when he served as Germany’s deputy foreign minister.\n\nWaiting will kill Ukraine: “The reconstruction of Ukraine cannot wait until the war is over.” The biggest parts of Ukraine are free, liberated, or have never been affected directly by the war. economic activity in the free parts of the country is amazing and needs to be supported as well. Not only the military side.”\n\nHoyer would know: “EIB has been involved in Ukraine basically since the independence of Ukraine. And then in 2014, we took the very tough decision to move out of Russia, after its annexation of Crimea. Others did not take it so seriously. We did.”\n\nIs Ukraine competing with the rest of Europe for rebuilding cash? “Absolutely. The political leaders in Europe are in a very, very, very difficult situation. And the expectations of their people are enormous.”\n\nRebuilding at mercy of recession forces: “The European Union needs more investment, not less.”\n\nWhat will investors tolerate on energy and climate? “I think we underestimate private sector potential … I remember a Davos climate meeting three or four years ago sitting with President Ramaphosa and Chancellor Merkel and the head of a big Swiss commercial bank. I said, ‘what the heck are you doing here?’ They said, ‘well, my asset holders expect me to be here.”\n\nTODAY’S AGENDA\n\n— General Assembly opening debate, 9 a.m.\n\n— French President EmmanuelMacron meets Iran’s President EbrahimRaisi, 9:15 a.m.\n\n— U.K. Prime Minister LizTruss meets French President EmmanuelMacron, 11:15 a.m.\n\n— Global Food Security Summit, co-chaired by European Council President Charles Michel, 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\n— Concordia Summit, livestream here.\n\n— ”Shaping an Africa-led Just and Equitable Energy Transition” event organized by the U.K. and Rwanda. European Commission Executive Vice President FransTimmermans participating.\n\n— Clinton Global Initiative. It’s Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s morning to shine. Hillary is speaking about “Unfinished Business: How We Can Improve Economic Outcomes for Women” — and at a plenary session called “Home,” exploring “how to foster community and belonging in an increasingly unstable world.”\n\n— Climate Week NYC.\n\n— Countdown to COP15, with speakers including European Commission President UrsulavonderLeyen (via video), FransTimmermans, German Chancellor OlafScholz and U.N.

Watch the panel moderated by Ryan.\n\nREAL-TIME DIPLOMACY: U.S. Secretary of State AntonyBlinken hosted Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan and Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov for the first direct talks since fighting erupted in recent days, killing around 200. Refresher on the conflict here. Next steps: Another meeting by end of the month.\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL: Columbia University is hosting its own World Leaders Forum with the leaders of Chile and North Macedonia, as well as the leader of Belarus’ democratic opposition, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Registration here. Livestream and YouTube here.\n\nGLOBAL FUND TREATS ETHIOPIA LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL: At fundraising events for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which hopes to raise $18 billion at an event Wednesday hosted by Biden, there's controversy about the reception given to Ethiopia. At one event Monday, Health Minister Lia Tadesse spoke about the work to strengthen the country’s health system, our colleague Carmen Paun reports. Anyone following would not have been able to tell from her remarks that there’s a civil war in her country, where millions of people are being denied access to food and health care — because that never came up. And hospitals have been damaged as a result of that war. So much for strengthening national health systems!\n\nA Global Fund spokesperson told Carmen the event was focused “on private sector partnerships in the context of the Global Fund Replenishment.”\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “The greatest service we can do to her memory, and the presidents she met, are to continue this network of democratic values. This sense that we make a choice — we choose freedom, we choose consensus, we choose open debate. Those are the words that she herself used.” U.K. Ambassador to the U.S. Karen Pierce, on Queen Elizabeth II, at the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen Awards event at the Cipriani on Wall Street, Monday night.\n\nEU FOREIGN MINISTERS: EU leaders may just be arriving from the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, but New York was teeming with EU foreign ministers Monday. Borrell chaired an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in the evening, while U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland attended a meeting of EU political directors. And though the EU’s mission to the U.N. was a hotbed of high-level problem-solving and discussions, there was one problem they couldn’t manage to solve: the wifi.\n\nSPOTTED: The Atlantic Council gave out its Global Citizen Awards at Cipriani Wall Street in New York on Monday night. Honorees included Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, outgoing Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Academy Award-winner and humanitarian Forest Whitaker. The evening also featured tributes to the late Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan and 2016 Global Citizen Award recipient, as well as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn the crowd: Indonesian FM Retno Marsudi; Finnish FM Pekka Haavisto; Swedish FM Ann Linde; Norwegian FM Anniken Huitfeldt; World Economic Forum founder KlausSchwab; Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg; Atlantic Council CEO FredKempe; businesswoman and philanthropist Adrienne Arsht; British Ambassador Karen Pierce; Finnish Ambassador Mikko Hautala; the Wall Street Journal’s VivianSalama; Foreign Policy's publisher Andrew Sollinger; POLITICO’s SuzanneLynch; The Washington Post’s John Hudson and LallyWeymouth; former Prime Minister of Australia KevinRudd; and CEO of Edelman, Richard Edelman.\n\nTHANKS TO: Clea Caulcutt, Esther Webber, Cristina Gonzalez, Carmen Paun, Emma Anderson, James Randerson and Ben Pauker.\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the POLITICO newsletter family: D.C.

    "The color of politics in Brazil": "Six years ago, when Brazilian politician Antonio Carlos Magalhães – popularly known as ACM Neto – marked the race “mestizo” on an official form that all candidates must fill out before an election, nobody paid any attention. Now, however, as he aspires to be elected as Governor of Bahia – the state with the highest Black population in Brazil – he has, once again, chosen “mestizo” from the available options. And this has caused an uproar.\n\nWhat began as a local controversy has turned into national news, dominating social media. It reflects the extent to which social sensitivity about skin color has changed in recent years.\n\nAll Brazilian citizens or residents must declare to the authorities whether they are Black, mestizo, white, Asian, or Indigenous. There are no guidelines: each person defines themselves as he or she wishes. And, in a country as mixed as Brazil, this creates strange situations. Over time and without the need to give explanations, any citizen can change their race.\n\nThis racial declaration has been mandatory for politicians since the municipal elections of 2016. Thanks to this rule, we now know that hundreds of federal deputies who aspire to re-election in the October 2 general elections have declared that they are of a different color than four years ago: 42 parliamentarians who were white have become Black, and 29 who were Black have become white.\n\nBrazil will soon hold general elections to elect the president – with Jair Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva as the favorites – the Chamber of Deputies, the regional parliaments and a third of the Senate. If candidates do not win in the first round, there will be a second round held on October 30.\n\nACM Neto has also recently added the word “Jr.” to his initials, because he belongs to one of the deep-rooted family clans of Brazilian politicians. His family also owns one of the main television stations in Bahia.\n\nAs Neto is comfortably leading the race for Governor of Bahia – the state that was the main point of entry for slaves forcibly brought from Africa to Brazil – the opposition was quick to criticize him on the racial question. He has been defiant, defending himself in a local TV interview, showing up at the studio with a striking tan:\n\n“I consider myself a mestizo. You can put me next to a white person: there’s a big difference. Black, no, I would never say that I am Black,” he replied to the journalist. His new look was compared to older, whiter photos of himself on social media, leading to a torrent of jokes and memes. Scrutiny has only increased: his vice-gubernatorial candidate – who has also declared herself a mestiza in the past – had to think better of it. She changed her declaration to “white.”\n\nThe controversy has been growing, with the effect being felt in the polls. ACM Neto has dropped six points in the past month, while his main adversary, Jerónimo Rodrígues, of the Workers’ Party (PT), has risen by 15 points, according to the pollster Datafolha. In any case, the right-wing ally of incumbent President Bolsonaro is still leading the race in Bahia. But it is no longer clear if he can win in the first round.\n\nBeyond the opportunism of some politicians, or even students who want to take advantage of socio-racial quotas implemented a decade ago in public universities, there is a greater racial consciousness in Brazilian society, where mestizos and Blacks account for 56% of the population. The number of Brazilians who are proud of their color continues to grow.",

One Supreme Court judge, Alexandre de Moraes, has had at least five people jailed without a trial after posting content on social media that allegedly “attacked Brazil’s institutions,” and also handed down legal orders to social networks forcing them to remove thousands of posts the judge found objectionable. Legal experts told the Times that Moraes’ overreach, presented as justified pushback on attacks against democracy, may actually be pushing Brazil further down an antidemocratic path.",
    "Exclusive: Brazil admits to problems with coffee crop views, plans revision": "Coffee berries are seen on a tree at the Biological Institute plantation in Sao Paulo, Brazil May 8, 2021. REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli\n\nSAO PAULO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's government admitted that its estimates for coffee crops over recent years have problems and need improvements to better reflect the reality, since the numbers for production have been smaller than the sum of local consumption plus exports.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Thursday, the director of Agricultural Policy at Brazil's food supply and statistics agency Conab, Sergio De Zen, said that due to those discrepancies there is a process going on do revise numbers and methodology for Conab's coffee crop forecasts.\n\nConab's coffee numbers for Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter, have for years been subject of debate among coffee traders and analysts, who generally consider production estimates to be too low.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nTrading houses and independent analysts usually have higher crop numbers for Brazil than Conab.

There is a clear supply gap when they are compared (see table).\n\nSource: Brazil coffee consumption data from ABIC, export numbers from Cecafe\n\nWhen numbers for local consumption plus exports are compared with crop projections for the last five years there is a large deficit of more than 32 million bags.\n\n\"We've done that calculation before...\" the director said, admitting to the problem.\n\nStock numbers could help solve the equation, but Conab has stopped publishing those.\n\n\"We have not publish them because the supply balance calculation does not make sense,\" he said, confirming the gap.\n\nDe Zen said, however, that stocks at farms are not negligible and could help to solve the S&D equation, but he said the number and quality of answers to the stocks poll was low.\n\nThe director said that Conab plans to revise the numbers for the crops in recent years in the same way it did with soybean data in 2020, when the revision resulted in millions of tonnes added to the S&D table.\n\nHe partially blamed the problems to the bad state of Conab's structure when the current government took over four years ago.\n\nHe said Conab is hiring people to boost the coffee projection, adding that it will use satellite data to better measure planted area and improve agricultural yields calculation.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Roberto Samora; additional reporting and writing by Marcelo Teixeira in New York Editing by Marguerita Choy\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Brazil’s polarized election campaign sees ex-leader Lula on the cusp of a remarkable comeback": "Supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro listen to his speech at the Ministry Esplanade on Sept. 7, 2022 in Brasilia. Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubt about the validity of the country's electronic voting system ahead of the first round of elections, ratcheting up fears that he may refuse to accept defeat if the vote doesn't go his way — much like his political idol, former U.S. President Donald Trump. The first round of Brazil's presidential elections, scheduled for Oct. 2, sees Bolsonaro come up against his political nemesis and former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in what has become Brazil's most polarized race in decades. Lula has consistently been polling comfortably ahead of the far-right former army captain in both the first round and an expected run-off, although some opinion polls have shown the incumbent narrowing the deficit in recent days. \"This trend of Bolsonaro narrowing the distance from Lula will keep going in the next few weeks probably,\" Adriano Laureno, political and economic analyst at consultancy Prospectiva in Sao Paolo, Brazil, told CNBC via telephone. Bolsonaro, who is running under the banner of the Liberal Party, has previously said he would be prepared to accept the result of the election whoever wins — but not if there is any indication of voter fraud. Since coming to power in early 2019, the scandal-hit president has faced widespread criticism for his response to the coronavirus pandemic and his environmental track record, while also facing numerous calls for impeachment.\n\nBolsonaro has been described as the \"Trump of the Tropics\" by the country's media. Andre Borges | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nPolitical analysts said Bolsonaro's criticism of the country's respected electronic electoral system, which has never detected significant fraud, was likely designed to mobilize his supporters ahead of the first round of voting. \"Bolsonaro's rhetoric has been that he will accept the result but only if the result is clean and transparent. So, what he is really saying is that he doesn't rely on the electoral system, he doesn't rely on the Supreme Court and as a result, he does not seem in the mood of relying on the electoral system as a whole,\" Laureno said. Indeed, even after winning the 2018 election after a second-round run-off, Bolsonaro vociferously made baseless allegations of voter fraud and suggested he should have won outright in the first round. \"Even an election that he won, he questions [the result]. So, imagine what will happen if he loses,\" Laureno said. Bolsonaro has long embraced comparisons to Trump, being dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" by the country's media. And it is thought he may now be drawing from the former U.S. president's playbook in seeking to call into question the democratic process.\n\n'Climate of hatred'\n\nA return to office for Lula, who led Latin America's biggest country from 2003 to 2010, would mark an extraordinary political comeback. The former metalworker was jailed in 2017 in a sweeping graft investigation that put dozens of the country's political and business elites in prison. Lula was released in Nov. 2019 and his criminal convictions were later annulled, paving the way for him to seek a return to the presidency.\n\nCommenting on violence on the campaign trail, da Silva described a \"climate of hatred in the electoral process which is completely abnormal.\" Michael Dantas | Afp | Getty Images\n\nAna Mauad, assistant professor of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia, told CNBC that there are expectations among Lula's supporters and within his Workers' Party that he could win in the first round, although she does not believe this will happen. Asked whether she then expected Lula to secure victory in the second round, Mauad replied, \"Yes, definitely — if we have a second round. And I am more of a pessimist in that sense because Bolsonaro is calling his supporters and increasing the tension between supporters from both candidates.\" In one of the latest instances of the mounting political tensions in Brazil, authorities reported last week that a Bolsonaro supporter stabbed to death Benedito Cardoso dos Santos, a 42-year-old backer of Lula. The incident occurred in Mato Grosso, a large state in west-central Brazil. Commenting on the violence, Lula told reporters in Rio de Janeiro on Friday that there was a \"climate of hatred in the electoral process which is completely abnormal.\"\n\nA new pink tide?\n\nBrazil's presidential elections come at a time when Latin America's new so-called \"pink tide\" appears to be gathering pace. Left-of-center candidates have won elections in Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Honduras in recent years, while leftist leader Gabriel Boric secured a historic victory in Chile last year, and Gustavo Petro became Colombia's first leftist leader in June. The growing leftist bloc echoes a similar regional political shift seen two decades earlier. \"This is a Latin American tradition, right? We had this left-wing wave back in the 2000s when Lula was first president in Brazil in 2003,\" Mauad said. \"But what is happening right now is a very different moment for Latin America.\"\n\nChile's leftist leader Gabriel Boric rose to prominence during anti-government protests. Anadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nMauad said it was difficult to call Latin America's leftist resurgence a new pink tide because the new group of presidents sweeping to power — inspired by Chile's Boric — place climate policies and gender issues at the forefront of their campaigns. \"That marks not only a generational difference but also the perspective of what it means to be left and progressive in Latin America right now,\" Mauad said. \"We had a more organic left if the first wave in the 2000s and 2010 because most of them were these charismatic leaders. They were this left based on ideas of industrialization and development of the region,\" she added. \"Boric represents this more progressive left in the region. I think Lula right now and some parts of his party are saying, 'look we need to be closer to Boric and not to Petro or [Argentinian President] Alberto [Fernandez].'\"\n\nThe fate of the Amazon\n\nAlongside key electoral issues such as rising inflation and the health of Latin America's largest economy, the fate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is in sharp focus. That's because deforestation in the rainforest, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth,\" has skyrocketed under Bolsonaro's presidency. Deforestation was reported to have broken all records in the first six months of 2022 amid a dramatic uptick in Amazon destruction and attacks on Indigenous communities. Lula has pledged a major crackdown on Amazon crime if elected, while Bolsonaro — despite widespread criticism for his destructive policies — has outlined proposals to halt deforestation in the rainforest.\n\nExperts say Amazon fires are caused mainly by illegal farmers, ranchers and speculators clearing land and torching the trees. Douglas Magno | Afp | Getty Images\n\n\"I think a major part of the debate is about the credibility of the candidate's management of society. The economy in Brazil is really starting to struggle now in the aftermath of the pandemic. Lula, of course, has a good track record in that respect and Bolsonaro much less so,\" Marieke Riethof, senior lecturer in Latin American Politics at the University of Liverpool, U.K., told CNBC via telephone. \"I think among the lower income voters, the candidate's ability to offer some kind of social policies and financial compensation is also going to be really important,\" Riethof said. \"Bolsonaro offered compensation during the pandemic, but the question is would he continue doing that? Or are voters more likely to get it from Lula?\"",

    "Bolsonaro's gun laws arm Brazil's brazen bank thieves": "UBERABA, Brazil, Sept 21 (Reuters) - In August last year, Brazilian farmer Reinaldo Huijsmans reported a break-in at his house in the town of Maracaju, where thieves stole six legally registered weapons, including a T4 Taurus assault rifle.\n\nHuijsmans, 39, is one of hundreds of thousands of Brazilians now registered to own guns, a group whose ranks have surged six-fold since far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was elected in 2018 and began loosening gun laws.\n\nTwo months later, Huijsmans' T4 turned up 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away, in the hands of a heavily-armed gang of alleged bank robbers ambushed and killed by cops near the city of Varginha, in Minas Gerais state, according to an inventory of weapons apprehended from the gang seen by Reuters.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe unexpected journey of Huijsmans' assault rifle, which Reuters traced using the T4's serial number provided in his original statement to police, has not previously been reported.\n\nIts presence in the hands of a group of alleged bank thieves highlights what Federal Police and public security experts say is an inevitable consequence of Bolsonaro's gun liberalizations: the criminal use of Brazil's fast-growing stock of legal weapons.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that legitimately acquired high-caliber weapons are leaking onto the black market.\n\nWhile the fragmented structure of Brazil's security forces makes it difficult to tally how many such weapons have appeared at crime scenes, over a dozen federal and state police officers told Reuters that an increasing number of legally bought firearms are being used to commit crimes across the continent-sized nation.\n\nMany of those have reached the most violent criminals in Brazil, the country with the world's highest number of murders.\n\nThe men holed up in Varginha were part of a new breed of bank robbers conducting a wave of high-impact assaults across the interior of the country, police say. Known locally as \"novo cangaco\" gangs, these specialized crews terrorize cities, blow up bank safes and use human shields to escape, often stealing millions of dollars, Reuters reported in a related story. read more\n\nBolsonaro, a nationalist former soldier, has made it easier for Brazilians to bulk-buy firearms by registering with the army as hunters, marksmen or collectors, known as \"CACs.\" With his encouragement, nearly 700,000 Brazilians have now accredited as CACs, up almost 500% since 2018.\n\nBolsonaro says those weapons are being bought by \"good\" Brazilians, helping to reduce the murder rate, which has fallen steadily since before he took office, from 27 per 100,000 in 2017 to 19 last year. Experts dispute his theory, warning there is a strong long-term link between gun deaths and the number of firearms in circulation.\n\nIn July, Reuters reported that Brazil's Federal Police disapproved of Bolsonaro's gun policies, arguing they would put more weapons in the hands of criminals. read more\n\nThere are now signs those fears are becoming a reality.\n\n\"We constantly have issues with weapons bought by people with CAC permits,\" said one senior Federal Police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive subject. \"Sadly, we're going to have problems with this for decades.\"\n\nBolsonaro's office did not respond to a request for comment. The Federal Police directed questions to the Army, which grants CAC permits. It, too, did not respond.\n\nNEO-BANDITRY\n\nNamed after \"cangaceiros,\" the ragtag bandits who roamed the arid northeast in the late 19th century, Brazil's \"novo cangaco\" gangs have benefited from Bolsonaro's looser gun laws, according to police probes and interviews with officers involved in gun control and organized crime investigations.\n\nIn December last year, a group disguised in police uniforms robbed nearly 4.5 million reais from an armored truck in the southern city of Guaiba. Investigators located one of the weapons used in the assault - a Brazilian-made IMBEL 7.62 mm assault rifle - and found it had been bought by a 36-year-old CAC permit-holder paid 2,000 reais to buy the weapon on behalf of the gang, according to Rio Grande do Sul state civil police.\n\nIn July, police in the southern city of Itajai arrested three alleged bank robbers suspected of stealing around 230,000 reais in two bank heists. The group, which police said was planning another imminent assault, was found with two pistols, a shotgun and two T4s - all of which were legally acquired by one of the CAC-registered gang members, Eduardo Ferraz, the lead detective on the case, told Reuters.\n\n1/3 A banner with a photo of Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is seen at the Tatico Brasil Security training center, which provides training for private security guards, some of whom will serve in banks, in the Uberaba city in Minas Gerais state, Brazil August 4, 2022. REUTERS/Leonardo Benassato Read More\n\nOf all the weapons now available to Brazil's gun fans, the T4 has emerged as the weapon of choice for its gangsters.\n\nManufactured by Brazilian gunmaker Taurus SA (TASA3.SA), the T4 hit the local market in 2019 as a direct result of Bolsonaro's newly liberalized gun laws. It has been a huge success for the company, which has sold around 60,000 units of the 5.56 mm semi-automatic carbine, helping to lift its share price around 350% since the start of 2019.\n\nBefore the looser rules, an imported 5.56 mm assault rifle equivalent to the T4 cost 60,000 reais on the black market, according to Ivan Marques, managing director of The International Action Network on Small Arms.\n\nBut now, Marques said, anyone registered as a CAC can legally buy a T4 \"for 16,000 reais with a factory guarantee.\"\n\nHalf a dozen federal officers told Reuters that Brazil's gangs - and particularly Sao Paulo's First Capital Command (PCC), South America's most powerful criminal franchise - are increasingly using legalized gun-owners as straw buyers to replenish arsenals that, one officer said, will last \"a hundred years.\"\n\nA common tactic used by gangs - as seen in the case of Huijsman's T4 - is to steal weapons from CAC permit-holders' homes.\n\nBut sometimes, police say, the legal buyer is in on the ruse. Last month, Sao Paulo state civil police said they had arrested a CAC permit-holder with 700 5.56mm rounds in his car. He confessed to having sold weapons to the PCC that he had previously reported as stolen.\n\nHuijsmans told Reuters he was an innocent victim of a burglary. Jackson Frederico Vale, the detective probing Huijsmans' case, said he didn't suspect the farmer of foul play.\n\nIn other cases, gangsters are withholding their criminal pasts when they apply for CAC permits, banking on overworked army bureaucrats to wave through their applications.\n\nIn July, Federal Police in the Minas Gerais city of Uberaba arrested a well-known local criminal with family ties to the PCC for failing to alert army CAC certifiers to his criminal background. The 36-year-old, who had previously been charged with murder, drug trafficking, and theft, was found with seven firearms, including a T4.\n\nNOVO CANGACO\n\nSituated on a major cocaine trafficking route between Paraguay and Brazil's Atlantic ports, Uberaba and nearby towns in Minas Gerais have proven fertile ground for \"novo cangaco\" raids. The wealthy beef-farming city has suffered two major bank robberies in the last five years, including the 2019 assault of its main Banco do Brasil branch.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2021, Minas Gerais military police and Brazil's Federal Highway Police carried out two raids against alleged bank robbers hiding out near Varginha, killing 26 of them. No cops were injured, with the lopsided toll leading to accusations of illegal executions that are now being probed by the Federal Police.\n\nAs justification for the raids, Minas Gerais military police briefed reporters that the gang was about to rob 65 million reais ($13 million) from Varginha's Banco do Brasil. They also said they believed the alleged robbers were the same crew that had hit a Banco do Brasil branch in the city of Aracatuba a few months earlier, although they presented no evidence.\n\nMany of the 26 people killed were career criminals, with checkered pasts including murder, theft and drugs charges, according to investigators. At least four were from Uberaba.\n\nA Federal Police officer involved in the investigation of the killings agreed the crew was planning a robbery. But the officer, speaking anonymously to discuss an ongoing probe, said the target was an armored vehicle carrying 20-30 million reais.\n\nAfter the raids, police combed through the gang's arsenal. They found a .50 machine gun, capable of taking down a low-flying helicopter, two 7.62 mm assault rifles, and around a dozen 5.56 mm carbines - including Huijsmans' T4.\n\nMarques, the gun expert, said Huijsmans' rifle wouldn't be the last legally acquired firearm to turn up at a crime scene.\n\n\"It's certain that many of those weapons which entered circulation in the last four years will end up in the hands of criminals,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 5.1964 reais)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Brad Haynes and Frank Jack Daniel\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Destruction of Brazil’s forests and Indigenous Peoples’ lands highlighted in New York City ahead of Brazil President’s speech at the UN": "Destruction of Brazil’s forests and Indigenous Peoples’ lands highlighted in New York City ahead of Brazil President’s speech at the UN\n\nThe Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), Defend Democracy in Brazil Committee (DDB-NY), Greenpeace Brazil and Greenpeace USA projected images of record deforestation, forest burnings, and Indigenous Peoples’ resistance to the assault on their lives in midtown Manhattan on the cusp of the UN General Assembly, Climate Week NYC and Brazil’s presidential election. In the first half of September alone, at least six Indigenous Peoples were killed in the violence in Brazil, with the most recent assassination of Indigenous leader Victorino Sanches of the Guaraní-kaiowá on 13 September 2022.\n\nThe projection calls out Brazil’s Head of State — who is set to open the UN General Assembly on September 20 — for anti-Indigenous and anti-environmental policies that have led to an explosive increase in deforestation along with violence against Indigenous Peoples and environmental defenders.\n\nRecent data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show that 7,135km2—an area nine times the size of New York City—of the Amazon was deforested from January to August 2022, the highest rate ever recorded for this time period. In August alone, 33,116 illegal fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest level in 12 years.\n\nThreats to Indigenous Peoples’ lives are an urgent climate issue. Repeated studies have demonstrated that forests and other ecosystems are best protected when Indigenous land rights are respected.\n\nDeforestation is pushing the world’s largest rainforest toward a tipping point, where the rainforest would no longer be able to sustain itself, climate scientists have warned. Beyond the Amazon, other ecosystems across Brazil are under threat by historic highs of deforestation for industrial agricultural production. Land dispossession, violence and human rights abuse are deeply connected to the expansion of industrial agriculture and mining in Brazil. Indigenous Peoples are on the frontlines of these attacks and have been under siege by the Brazilian government’s actions to promote land invasions and impunity to criminals.\n\nIndigenous Peoples are the most threatened for trying to protect their lands and their rights. In 2021, Indigenous Organization CIMI identified at least 305 cases of land invasions impacting roughly 226 Indigenous lands across 22 states in Brazil. This number of cases represents a three fold increase of land invasions reported in 2018 by CIMI. In 2021 alone, 176 Indigenous Peoples were murdered in Brazil. In June 2022, Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips were murdered for protecting the Amazon.\n\nDinaman Tuxá, Executive Coordinator at APIB said: “Indigenous Lands are the most preserved areas in all of Brazil, but this does not translate into our rights being protected. Every day we see violence increasing, Indigenous Peoples being murdered and the destruction of our territories happening at an accelerated rate. These attacks are results of the weakening of Indigenous and environmental policies by the current government of Brazil. We demand the immediate demarcation of our lands and full protection of our rights and lives, as this is the only way in which we can continue to contribute to the fight against the climate crisis”\n\nCarol Pasquali, Executive Director at Greenpeace Brazil said: “What happens in the Amazon doesn’t stay in the Amazon. All over the world, we are already seeing the impacts of the climate crisis. Further allowing deforestation puts biodiversity, the lives of Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities, and the global climate at risk. World leaders must be accountable and put people and the planet first always. We need our forest standing and its people protected from those who want to make short-term profits off of it.”\n\nNatalia de Campos, co-coordinator at DDB-NY, said: “It is crucial that we raise the voices of Brazilian indigenous leaders on the attacks and devastation they experience and fight first-hand, and in the heart of Manhattan, the financial capital of the world. This year we Brazilians hope to change the course of continuous dismantling of social and environmental policies, with our national congress and presidential elections. Brazilian biomes are essential to keep all of us alive. Greed and mismanagement are killing all biomes, and many of their defenders. If we don’t hear from the people who risk their lives to keep the world alive, we will cease our existence. We are here to stand with them, as they fight for their rights, which are our rights too.

    "Brazil Is Suffering a Wave of Violence. It’s Bolsonaro’s Fault": "On Sept. 9, a rural worker was fatally stabbed during a political discussion with a supporter of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right President, in the midwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul. A little over a month ago, in the southern state of Paraná, an armed bolsonarista invaded a children’s birthday party and executed the child’s father in front of his entire family. The images of the crime, recorded by a security camera, shocked the country.\n\nThere are also cases where violence was only avoided by luck, or a lack of opportunity. A few days ago, while campaigning in the street, myself and my colleague Ediane Maria of the Socialism and Liberty Party, were threatened by an armed man who declared himself a Bolsonaro supporter when we passed him a pamphlet from our election campaign. The incident took place in São Bernardo do Campo, a city in the state of São Paulo, and is already under investigation by the Public Electoral Ministry.\n\nThese episodes, scattered across Brazil, are nothing new: they are just the latest in an extensive list of acts of political violence engendered by President Bolsonaro and his aggressive rhetoric toward those who disagree with him.\n\nLong before reaching the presidency, Bolsonaro was already known in Brazil for his right-wing positions and for his ideological alignment with the military dictatorship installed by the 1964 coup that ousted the left-wing João Goulart, and which was backed by the U.S. government. Defending the shooting of left-wing opponents on the campaign trail in 2018 and saying in 2014 he “wouldn’t rape” a female colleague “because she didn’t deserve it” are just a couple examples that illustrate the authoritarian personality of Bolsonaro, an ex-soldier.\n\nAware of this history, Brazil’s economic elite still chose to back Bolsonaro in the 2018 elections, supporting the fraudulent arrest that year of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that would bar him from the race. In doing so, they cleared the path for the election of a man that they thought they could control over the next four years.\n\nRead More: Lula Interview on Exile and His Bid for Brazilian Presidency\n\nBut since arriving in the Palácio do Planalto, Bolsonaro has only become more brazen in his authoritarian overreach. His aggressive and irresponsible speeches have escalated a climate of violence and encouraged millions of supporters across Brazil to violently confront those who disagree with them. In this climate, Lula, who has since been acquitted of the corruption charges and is Bolsonaro’s main rival in the upcoming October general elections, recently had to reinforce his security detail with snipers for a campaign rally, after identifying bolsonarista threats.\n\nAfter four years of attacks on our institutions and values, it doesn’t seem surprising that Bolsonaro now threatens Brazilian democracy itself. In this, he is the image of his idol, former U.S. President Donald Trump. More than just an inspiration, Trump is the ideological north star of Bolsonaro’s political movement. Bolsonaro has repeatedly questioned the reliability of our internationally praised electronic voting machines, and said that he will only accept the result of the elections if they are “clean”; in other words, if he wins.\n\nMore from TIME\n\nUnlike Trump, however, Bolsonaro commands backing from some sectors of the military, many members of which serve in the President’s administration. Few people still minimize the risk of a Bolsonaro coup, though some still believe his worrying statements are just a big bluff. I fear that Bolsonaro, once he is defeated at the ballot box as polls expect, will seek to rupture our democracy—and resort to violence to do so. The whole question is whether he will have enough support to carry it out. Today, by all indications, he wouldn’t. But that should not make us underestimate the risk.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bolsonaro’s allies in the Armed Forces have managed to force the Superior Electoral Court to allow them to do a “parallel inspection” of the electoral process, opening the door for them to question, within a weakened institutional framework, a vote against the President on Oct 2.\n\nAt the same time, Bolsonaro and his sons are doubling down on his strategy. They have intensified their links with criminal militias, according to Brazilian newspapers. (Bolsonaro denies any ties to militia groups.) And they have also called on the President’s supporters to arm themselves, to unite in the streets and resist defeat in a vote that Bolsonaro has tried to sow doubt over.\n\nRead More: What To Know About Brazil’s Crucial Election\n\nIf that happens, there is one thing that can ensure democracy and prevent violence: social mobilization in the streets. We would have to lead and redouble peaceful protests until Bolsonaro leaves the presidential palace.\n\nThe streets are also key, at this moment, to increasing Lula’s margin of victory that will make it harder for Bolsonaro to spread lies about the legitimacy of the vote. By talking face to face with undecided voters, we will fight for victory—victory for a democratic and anti-fascist country, where differences are resolved through dialogue and not with bullets.\n\nOnly then will we put Brazil back on a path of democracy and social justice. Only then will the Amazon and our biodiversity be safe from the ravages of deforestation. Only then will Brazil be respected and admired on the international scene again. There are only a couple weeks left for the most important elections in our country yet.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

But the heavy military presence was deeply controversial. That's because Bolsonaro has not clearly stated whether he would leave office peacefully if he loses. If Bolsonaro is defeated by Lula, then tries to cling to power, analysts say he would lean on the military for support. And some of his supporters are OK with that.\n\nGILBERTO DE ANDRADE: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: Among them is Gilberto de Andrade, a 74-year-old former soldier who served in the army during Brazil's military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985. Andrade says he would feel fine if Brazil's military intervened to keep Bolsonaro in power. Another fan of military action is Magno Becerra, who is wearing a T-shirt that said, we are ready for war.\n\nMAGNO BECERRA: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: He says it's time for a general overhaul here. Let the armed forces take over the country.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language).\n\nOTIS: Fears that the armed forces will intervene in the event of a Lula victory have also been fueled by Bolsonaro's close ties to the armed forces. He's a former army captain. His running mate is a retired general, while his government is filled with ex-military officers. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro has spent the past year bad-mouthing Brazil's electronic voting system and claiming that the military should help oversee the vote count. What's more, authorities recently raided the homes of several Brazilian businessmen who, in text messages, appeared to back a military coup to keep Bolsonaro in power. But some Bolsonaro supporters on the beach, like Patricia Monerat, claim that would never happen.\n\nPATRICIA MONERAT: No, I don't think so. It's a democracy, and we are going to be with Lula if he wins. We are going to understand, and it's a democracy.\n\nOTIS: Due to technical problems, Bolsonaro's speech was not televised. And unlike past addresses, he made no mention of deviating from the democratic process. John Otis, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Brand New GOL Boeing 737 MAX Arrives In Brazil": "Boeing Stock Code: BA Date Founded: 1916-07-15 CEO: Dave Calhoun Headquarters Location: Chicago, USA Key Product Lines: Boeing 737, Boeing 747, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787 Business Type: Planemaker\n\nLast week, Brazil's largest domestic airline, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes, got just a little bit bigger. The airline received its thirty-seventh Boeing 737 MAX, a continuation of its fleet renewal strategy.\n\nThe latest GOL Linhas Aéreas (GOL) aircraft departed the US on Wednesday from Seattle Boeing Field (BFI) at 14:33. The first leg of the Boeing B737 MAX 8's ferry flight took 7:11 hours to cover the 3,600 miles (5,800 km) to the Dominican Republic, landing in Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ) at 00:44 AM on Thursday. After 52 minutes on the ground, it departed at 01:36 AM and landed in Brazil at Belo Horizonte's Tancredo Neves International Airport (CNF) at 09:13 AM.\n\nChina's loss is Brazil's gain\n\nThe second leg of the B737 MAX 8 delivery flight took 6:37 hours, flying from Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic to Belo Horizonte in Brazil. Data: Flightradar24.com\n\nGOL will be the first operator of the aircraft, registration PS-GPH and MSN 44310, but it was initially destined for Urumqi Air, a Chinese low-cost airline owned by Hainan Airlines. Urumqi Air did not take it up, and with the current hiatus affecting Boeing deliveries to China, it has been delivered to GOL in Brazil. Planespotters.net lists the 737 MAX 8 as being 2.9 years old, so the upside is that another of Boeing's long-parked 737 MAXs has found a new home and is soon to enter commercial service.\n\nGOL is working through a fleet renewal program, bringing in MAXs to replace its existing Boeing 737NGs. According to ch-aviation.com, GOL has 21 B737-700s with an average age of 18.3 years and 87 B737-800s that, on average, are close to 12 years old. The airline is totally invested in the 737 MAX, with outstanding orders for 66 737 MAX 8s and 25 737 MAX 10s that will sit alongside the existing 37 MAX 8s now in the GOL fleet. In a recent investors update, GOL said it plans to end this year with a fleet of 44 737 MAX 8s and 92 737NGs and return 19 older aircraft.\n\nFind the latest South American aviation news here\n\nFreighter conversions for 737-800s\n\nThe Boeing 737-800 dominates GOL's present fleet, with some now destined for freighter conversion. Photo: Boeing\n\nMore fleet expansion is planned from GOL's entry into the freighter business in partnership with the e-commerce platform Mercardo Livre. The agreement was announced in April, and GOL said it would convert up to 12 737-800s into BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter) aircraft. The 737-800s will come from GOL's fleet and, when fully converted, will have the capacity to carry up to 24 tons of cargo. The airline's in-house MRO business, GOL Aerotech, will do the conversions in Confins, Brazil. Ch-aviation.com data shows that GOL has one B737-800(BCF) already in service.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, GOL carried 6.03 million passengers, had net revenues of BRL3.24 billion ($616 million) and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of BRL50.8 million ($9.66m). This was a vast improvement from the second quarter of 2021, when it carried 2.92 million passengers, had revenue of BRL1.03 billion ($196m) and a loss of BRL765 million ($145m). GOL's per day aircraft utilization in 2Q 2022 was 10.2 hours compared to eight hours last year, and it recorded 45,538 departures this year, more than double the 19,662 in 2Q 2021.\n\nHow was your experience on one of GOL's MAX 8s?\n\nSource: aeroin.net",
    "Check Out The Stunningly Gorgeous Volkswagen SP2 That Was Sold Exclusively In Brazil": "We would forgive you if you’d never previously heard of the Volkswagen (VW) SP2. It was a distinctive domestic sports car that called Brazil its home - and very few managed to sneak out of the South American country. The two-door coupe began exiting the production door in 1972, which was a time when Volkswagen hardly touched the sports car scene.\n\nThe Volkswagen SP2 did questionably have quite a resemblance with Alfa Romeos from that era, with its cool curved and flamboyant design. Perhaps you’ve heard of Volkswagen Do Brazil? No, probably not. This South American company had a respectable level of independence, meaning that it was able to self-engineer and manufacture exclusive Volkswagen vehicles, specifically for the growing Brazilian market. Maybe you’re wondering why this spectacular vehicle was developed and designed in Brazil only, and that’s because at this time it was a closed country. The reason behind its long term importation barrier was down to the attempt to stimulate self-regulation within Brazil. Cleverly, Volkswagen Do Brazil created one of the most beautiful sports cars of its time, and it’s time to check the SP2 out.\n\nRelated:Volkswagen SP2: A Detailed Look At The Rare Hidden Gem\n\nThe Volkswagen SP2 Has A Look That Impressed All\n\nvia Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis gorgeous piece of spectacular design was available in three main colors; cream, red, and light blue. All shades came equipped with a striking black and red stripe slashing down the car's side profile, and spectacular it was. The SP2's elongated bonnet and 'set-back' look screamed sports car, along with its elaborate boxy lights and rigid nose. To look at the VW SP2, it was unmistakably a gearhead's dream car. What wasn’t there to love about it? Talk to any sport car enthusiast, and they’ll tell you that a vehicle's look has to be special, and the VW SP2 seemed to have the edge.\n\nOpen the door, and things only get better. Volkswagen Do Brazil had kitted the SP2 with impressive red leather seats, further adding to its racetrack feel. The VW SP2 instantly gave off that racing feel, its looks practically dragged drivers into its seats to start it up. Four small and 2 large clocks covered the raised dashboard, sitting above its stereo, and air-conditioning system setup. Where design was concerned, during the 1970s, the VW SP2 had it all. Its look was lavish and excessive, but take a seat inside, and you felt comfortable and excited for what were to come next.\n\nRelated: Forgotten Classic Car: The Brasília Was The Volkswagen Beetle For The Brazilian Market\n\nThe Volkswagen SP2: Did Its Sport Appearance Match Its Performance?\n\nvia Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn one word - no. The Volkswagen SP2 followed the previous model, the SP1, in an attempt to add some oomph to its lacking power. A minimalist 1.7-liter Volkswagen flat-four engine sat inside the VW, only producing a measly 75 horsepower. Yeah, the VW SP2 could toddle its way up to 60mph, but it did take 16 seconds. It's easy to see why this vehicle held the nickname 'pancake', and 'Sem Potencia', which translated into 'without power' in Portuguese. Surely this motors has to make you wonder of what could have been, had it produced better statistics in the performance department.\n\nSadly, there was hardly an attempt to fix the lack of power issue that the SP2 had, which ultimately led to its short 4-year production life, with just over 11,000 units built in total. Volkswagen did receive some pressure to release a version of its SP2 to supply Europe and other parts of the world. VW opted not to do this, but instead signed an agreement with Porsche to develop a newer VW sports car, which is now known as the Porsche 924. The VW SP2 lived on in its neighboring cousin, displaying a similar mouth-watering side silhouette.\n\nRelated: See This Lost Collection Of Classic Vehicles In Texas Including A Saved Vintage Volkswagen Bus\n\nThe Volkswagen SP2 Lives On\n\nvia Volkswagen\n\nMany may say that the VW SP2 could have been Brazil's very own answer to the Porsche 911, yet it sadly failed due to its lack of power and poor performance. Despite this, car enthusiasts could not resist the SP2's gorgeous look, and in recent years it has grown to become a cult classic - with owners even adding modern performance parts to its engine to bump its power output up. In a recent auction, an SP2 sold for $44,000, and that goes to show that its gorgeous look is still highly sought after.\n\nThe Volkswagen SP2 had a faultless design, its elongated look sure turned heads when it cruised down the street, but these heads shortly turned back after realizing they could probably walk faster than it could build speed.\n\nNobody can deny that the look of the Volkswagen SP2 is stunningly gorgeous. Fitted with a new engine and some slight performance modifications, this would have been the ultimate perfect sports car of its day - and for days to come.\n\nSources: Volkswagen",

    "Figueiredo/Moreno Unification Bout Targeted For UFC 283 In Brazil": "The fourth chapter of the storied rivalry between reigning UFC Flyweight Champion Deiveson Figueiredo and interim titleholder Brandon Moreno is reportedly close to being finalized for UFC 283.\n\nFor the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the world in 2020, the MMA leader is set to return to Brazilian soil for the pay-per-view event scheduled for January 21, 2023.\n\nWith it, the promotion will no doubt be bringing a host of intriguing bouts, featuring local fan favorites. It appears one of the fighters competing in front of a home crowd at UFC 283 will be the flyweight king.\n\nPer Claro Sports’ Rodrigo Del Campo González, a unification showdown between Figueiredo and three-time opponent Moreno is being targeted for the UFC’s return to Rio de Janeiro early next year.\n\nCan confirm final arrangements are taking place for Brandon Moreno vs Deiveson Figueiredo IV to unify the UFC's 125lb title on Jan 21st 2023 at #UFC283. First show in Brazil since March 2020, 1st in Rio since May 2019 and the 4th fight between in little over 2 years. pic.twitter.com/Ntnc5uXU3E — Rodrigo Del Campo González (@RodDelCampo) September 26, 2022\n\nFigueiredo & Moreno Look To Settle It In Unique Tetralogy\n\nShould the fight be confirmed, it would mark an unprecedented fourth bout between the elite flyweight duo in the space of just over two years, all of which had the 125-pound gold on the line.\n\nThe pair first collided in the main event of UFC 256 in December 2020. Both were returning to the Octagon on just 21 days’ notice, having had a pair of successes at November’s UFC 255 event. In a five-round classic, a point deduction cost “Deus Da Guerra” the victory, with the bout being ruled a majority draw.\n\nHaving earned a rematch six months later with his display against the seemingly unstoppable Figueiredo, Moreno made the most of his second opportunity, submitting the Brazilian via rear-naked choke at UFC 263 last June.\n\nThen, when top contender Alexandre Pantoja couldn’t make the desired date for the Mexican’s first defense, Figueiredo was drafted in for an immediate shot at redemption. He got exactly that in the co-main event of UFC 270 this past January, outpointing “The Assassin Baby” in their second 25-minute contest.\n\nNow, after Moreno set the stage with his interim title win against Kai Kara-France at UFC 277 in July, the pair are set to add a fourth layer to their feud, which has certainly played its part in reigniting the flyweight division.\n\nAnd having walked out to a chorus of boos earlier this year in California, Figueiredo will be targeting a hero’s welcome when he brings the gold to the Octagon in Brazil.\n\nHow do you think the fourth fight between Deiveson Figueiredo and Brandon Moreno will play out?",
    "For first time, Brazil's census counts Black communities founded by enslaved people": "SALVADOR, Brazil — For the first time in its 132-year history, the Brazilian census now underway includes a question counting members of the “quilombo” communities founded by runaway enslaved people.\n\nOn Ilha de Mare, an island with several quilombos off the coast of Salvador, in northeast Brazil, this chance to be counted is one step in a political transformation for which local organizers have long been fighting.\n\n“Being part of the census is a strategy for us, a strategy for resistance and change,” says 52-year-old Marizelha Carlos Lopes, a local activist and fisherwoman on the island, where 93% of people identify as Black. “One of our objectives is to escape an intentional invisibility.”\n\nHer friend Eliete Paraguassu, 42, is mounting another front in the strategy. She is the first woman from the island campaigning for a spot in the Bahia state legislature — one of a record number of Black candidates running for state and federal office in Brazil in this October’s elections.\n\nTogether, Brazil’s updated census and the rising number of Black candidates are part of a slow reckoning with centuries of slavery that ended only in 1888, making Brazil the last country in the world to abolish the practice.\n\nQuilombos were formed over centuries by enslaved people who escaped forced labor to create isolated, self-subsistence communities in remote forests and mountain ranges or on islands like Ilha de Mare.\n\nQuilombo residents now hope that a proper count of their numbers and more elected voices will open the door to improved social services and guarantees of rights for people and places long left off official maps.\n\nNational quilombo association CONAQ has identified nearly 6,000 quilombo territories. CONAQ head Antonio Joao Mendes said government recognition of the communities gained steam under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva two decades ago, when the communities won more formal land rights and support for cultural programs.\n\nLula’s presidential candidacy this year presents a stark contrast, Mendes said, with incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismantled many of those programs and slowed the recognition of additional quilombos.\n\nBolsonaro was fined 50,000 reais ($10,000) in 2017 for insulting quilombo residents, saying that “they do nothing” and are “not even good for procreating.” An appeals court threw out the case because he was a federal lawmaker at the time.\n\nOn Ilha de Mare, quilombo residents have for generations survived on the hard work of artisanal fishermen and fisherwomen.\n\nMarizelha’s 26-year-old nephew, Uine Lopes, who wakes at 3 a.m. to fish in the crystalline waters surrounding his community of Bananeiras, has proudly memorialized their tradition with a tattoo on his left arm of his grandfather casting a net.\n\nIn a city, livelihoods threatened by pollution\n\nWith no bridges to the mainland about a kilometer away, residents on the car-free Ilha de Mare get around like their ancestors: on foot, horseback and small boats. Uine Lopes says it feels like an island of calm away from the bustle and violence of the big city.\n\nIn the afternoons, women gather to scrape meat from crabs and clams caught that day, while others weave traditional straw baskets. In the evenings, neighbors often gather for dance or gymnastics classes by the seashore.\n\nYet the fishing communities say their livelihoods are threatened by pollution from a nearby petrochemical port across the bay, where a boat carrying propane gas exploded in 2013.\n\nAn industry group responsible for cleaning up the spill said it was monitoring the bay to protect surrounding communities, but Marizelha Lopes recalls losing an entire season of fishing and tourism due to contamination.\n\n“There are still no specific studies or public policies that will guarantee our safety,” her nephew said. “We have no escape route.”\n\nThe port authority did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFrustrated by a lack of answers to what she calls “environmental racism” against her island community, Eliete Paraguassu, who like Marizelha collects shellfish, is making the leap into politics.\n\nIn the run-up to the Oct. 2 vote, she has traveled to nearby cities to drum up support for her candidacy to the state legislature, with stickers declaring “My vote will be antiracist” and “Justice for Marielle.”\n\nThe latter is a reference to Marielle Franco, a Black city councilwoman in Rio de Janeiro who fought for racial justice and was shot dead in 2018, in what some have called a political assassination.\n\nHer legacy has been a rallying cry for Black women like Paraguassu. Of the 513 lawmakers elected to the lower house of Congress in 2018, just under a quarter identified as Black — and only 12 of those were women.\n\nBy contrast, 50.7% of Brazilians in the 2010 census identified in the two racial categories that the government statistics agency combines in its definition of “negro,” or Black.\n\nAlternating his time between fishing on Ilha de Mare and studying rural education at university, Uine Lopes is one of a handful of students determined to bring the fruits of their research back to the island.\n\n“We need to be aware, to vote for as many Black people as possible who are committed to the fight, who have specific visions for Indigenous communities, quilombolas, fishermen, riverside residents and so many other communities that experience a lack of state support,” he says.\n\nMarizelha did not attend school past fifth grade. But watching her nephew combine academic pursuits with service to the community has inspired her.\n\n“I am increasingly convinced that universities are important,” she said. “But our resistance and fight are what equips and prepares us for the confrontation.”\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
    "Delta Airlines Ramps Up Flights To Brazil This Winter Amid High Demand": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 2 days ago\n\nDelta Airlines is set to ramp up its total number of flights to Brazil this upcoming winter season due to high demand. The South American gem, famed for its samba dances, long sandy beaches, and colorful way of life, has emerged as a hugely popular destination for American travelers over the past few months, serving as an interesting and exciting alternative to another favorite destination of US travelers, Mexico.\n\nWith the hot season in the country set to begin in December and pleasant weather to be enjoyed at present, now is the perfect time to book those flights, soak up the sun and flee what’s set to be a cold winter back home. Here’s a look at how Delta will be scaling up their flights to Brazil over the coming few weeks, how easy it is to visit, and a reminder of the main attractions that have helped Brazil become a trending destination right now.\n\nDelta Scales Up Brazil Offerings – Information For Travelers\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the number of Americans visiting Brazil grew for two consecutive years, peaking at over half a million as more travelers became aware of what the country had to offer. Whilst the pandemic saw the number of travelers to Brazil – and every other country – fall dramatically, Delta Airlines is taking on the challenge of widening access to the masses and brung travelers numbers back where they belong with a range of extra fly frequencies and routes resuming over the next few months.\n\nIt’s particularly good news for those in the vicinity of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). The busiest airport in the United States is set to see two of its routes to Brazil benefit from increased service. In addition to a second daily seasonal flight between Delta’s Atlanta hub and Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos International Airport (GRU), seasonal flights to Rio de Janeiro’s Galeão International Airport (GIG) are also set to resume. Both of these changes will start from December 17th, allowing travelers more flexibility to travel this winter.\n\nFlights between New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Sao Paulo are also set to benefit from an increase in frequency. At present, there are three weekly flights between the two airports. However, from October 29th, this will change to a daily service, giving travelers plenty more options when it comes to flying that route. The journey will be served by Delta’s Airbus A330-300 aircraft, with a flight time of 9h 40m.\n\nWith these additions, Delta now operates 28 flights between the two countries. Travelers looking to book a return flight from Atlanta to the sunny beaches and lively streets of Rio De Janeiro in December can find several direct flights for less than $2000. Those who’d prefer a vibrant, culture-rich vacation to Sao Paulo can also benefit from a range of different trip options under $2000. For those looking to go between New York JFK and Sao Paulo, there are direct return trips available for less than $1800.\n\nLocated right on the eastern tip of Brazil, Rio De Janeiro boasts miles of white, sandy beaches packed with locals and travelers alike, lending a carnival-like atmosphere to every corner of the city. Perfect for travelers considering a change from places such as Cancun or the Dominican Republic, Rio is home to some of the world’s most recognizable landmarks, including the imposing Sugarloaf Mountain and the famous Christ the Redeemer statue, which looms over the city.\n\nA different vibe from Rio de Janeiro but still full of unmistakable Brazilian charm, Sao Paulo is the country’s cultural hub. Not only is it full of more museums and galleries than you could hope to visit, but the city is also packed full of interesting architecture, thriving nightlife, and some of the best restaurants on the continent, making it a more than worthy alternative to Mexico City. With two cities like these – not to mention the likes of Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Fortaleza, and many others – it’s easy to see why the country is so in demand. American travelers don’t need a visit to enter, but they will need to show either proof of vaccination or a negative test result (PCR or antigen) taken within 24 hours to enter.\n\nRead More:\n\nSurvey Reveals The Most Annoying Passengers On Flights\n\nTravel Insurance That Covers Covid-19 For 2022\n\nSargassum Seaweed At Low Levels In Cancun After Hurricane Fiona\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "The Most Important Election in the Americas Is in Brazil": "Former Brazilian President Luíz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula) runs about on stage at the Latin America Memorial in São Paulo. He was there on August 22, 2022, speaking at a book launch featuring photographs by Ricardo Stuckert about Lula’s trips around the world when he was the president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010. Lula is a man with a great deal of energy. He recounts the story of when he was in Iran with his Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in 2010, trying to mediate and end the conflict imposed by the United States over Iran’s nuclear energy policy. Lula managed to secure a nuclear deal in 2010 that would have prevented the ongoing pressure campaign that Washington is conducting against Tehran. There was relief in the air. Then, Lula said, “Obama pissed outside the pot.” According to Lula, then-U.S. President Barack Obama did not accept the deal and crushed the hard work of the Brazilian leadership in bringing all sides to an agreement.\n\nLula’s story puts two important points on the table: he was able to build on Brazil’s role in Latin America by offering leadership in far-off Iran during his previous tenure as president, and he is not afraid of expressing his antipathy for the way the United States is scuttling the possibility of peace and progress across the world for its own narrow interests.\n\nThe book release took place during Lula’s campaign for president against the current incumbent—and deeply unpopular—President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula is now in the lead in the polls ahead of the first round of Brazil’s presidential election to be held on October 2.\n\nFernando Haddad, who ran against Bolsonaro in 2018 and lost after receiving less than 45 percent of the vote, told me that this election remains “risky.” The polls might show that Lula is in the lead, but Bolsonaro is known to play dirty politics to secure his victory. The far right in Brazil, like the far right in many other countries, is fierce in the way it contests for state power. Bolsonaro, Haddad said, is willing to lie openly, saying offensive things to the far-right media and then when challenged about it by the mainstream media, he tends to feign ignorance. “Fake news” seems to be Bolsonaro’s best defense each time he is attacked. The left is far more sincere in its political discourse; leftists are unwilling to lie and eager to bring the issues of hunger and unemployment, social despair and social advancement to the center of the political debate. But there is less interest in these issues and less noise about them in a media landscape that thrives on the theatrics of Bolsonaro and his followers. The old traditional right is as outflanked as the far right in Brazil, which is a space that is now commanded by Bolsonaro (the old traditional right, the men in dark suits who made decisions over cigars and cachaça, are unable to supplant Bolsonaro).\n\nBoth Bolsonaro and Lula face an electorate that either loves them or hates them. There is little room for ambiguity in this race. Bolsonaro represents not only the far right, whose opinions he openly champions, but he also represents large sections of the middle class, whose aspirations for wealth remain largely intact despite the reality that their economic situation has deteriorated over the past decade. The contrast between the behavior of Bolsonaro and Lula during their respective presidential campaigns has been stark: Bolsonaro has been boorish and vulgar, while Lula is refined and presidential. If the election goes to Lula, it is likely that he will get more votes from those who hate Bolsonaro than from those who love him.\n\nFormer Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is reflective on the way forward. She told me that Lula will likely prevail in the election because the country is fed up with Bolsonaro. His horrible management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the deterioration of the economic situation in the country mark Bolsonaro as an inefficient manager of the Brazilian state. However, Rousseff pointed out that about a month before the election, Bolsonaro’s government—and the regional governments—have been rolling out policies that have started to lighten the burden on the middle class, such as the lifting of taxation on gasoline. These policies could sway some people to vote for Bolsonaro, but even that is not likely. The political situation in Brazil remains fragile for the left, with the main blocs on the right (agro-business, religion and the military) willing to use any means to maintain their hold on power; it was this right-wing coalition that conducted a “legislative coup” against Rousseff in 2016 and used “lawfare,” the use of law for political motives, against Lula in 2018 to prevent him from running against Bolsonaro. These phrases (legislative coup and lawfare) are now part of the vocabulary of the Brazilian left, which understands clearly that the right bloc (what is called centrão) will not stop pursuing their interests if they feel threatened.\n\nJoão Paulo Rodrigues, a leader of the Landless Workers Movement (MST) is a close adviser to the Lula campaign. He told me that in the 2002 presidential election, Lula won against the incumbent Fernando Henrique Cardoso because of an immense hatred for the neoliberal policies that Cardoso had championed. The left was fragmented and demoralized at that time of the election. Lula’s time in office, however, helped the left mobilize and organize, although even during this period the focus of popular attention was more on Lula himself rather than the blocs that comprised the left. During Lula’s incarceration on corruption charges, which the left says are fraudulent, he became a figure that unified the left: Lula Livre, “Free Lula,” was the unifying slogan, and the letter L (for Lula) became a symbol (a symbol that continues to be used in the election campaign). While there are other candidates from Brazil’s left in the presidential race, there is no question for Rodrigues that Lula is the left’s standard-bearer and is the only hope for Brazil to oust the highly divisive and dangerous leadership of President Bolsonaro. One of the mechanisms to build the unity of popular forces around Lula’s campaign has been the creation of the Popular Committees (comités populares), which have been working to both unify the left and create an agenda for the Lula government (which will include agrarian reform and a more robust policy for the Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian communities).\n\nThe international conditions for a third Lula presidency are fortuitous, Rousseff told me. A wide range of center-left governments have come to power in Latin America (including in Chile and Colombia). While these are not socialist governments, they are nonetheless committed to building the sovereignty of their countries and to creating a dignified life for their citizens. Brazil, the third-largest country in the Americas (after Canada and the United States of America), can play a leadership role in guiding this new wave of left governments in the hemisphere, Rousseff said. Haddad told me that Brazil should lead a new regional project, which will include the creation of a regional currency (sur) that can not only be used for cross-border trade but also for holding reserves. Haddad is currently running to be the governor of São Paulo, whose main city is the financial capital of the country. Such a regional currency, Haddad believed, will settle conflicts in the hemisphere and build new trade linkages that need not rely on long supply chains that have been destabilized by the pandemic. “God willing, we will create a common currency in Latin America because we do not have to depend on the dollar,” said Lula in May 2022.\n\nRousseff is eager for Brazil to return to the world stage through the BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), and offer the kind of left leadership that Lula and she had given that platform a decade ago. The world, Rousseff said, needs such a platform to offer leadership that does not rely on threats, sanctions and war. Lula’s anecdote about the Iran deal is a telling one since it shows that a country like Brazil under the leadership of the left is more willing to settle conflicts rather than to exacerbate them, as the United States did. There is hope, Rousseff noted, for a Lula presidency to offer robust leadership for a world that seems to be crumbling due to the myriad challenges such as climate catastrophe, warfare and social toxicity.\n\nVijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor and journalist.
