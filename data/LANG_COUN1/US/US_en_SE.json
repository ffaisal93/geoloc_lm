    "Sweden proves it: The Left must change": "Sweden has got a new government, a bourgeois one but with the addition of the far-right Sweden Democrats.\n\nWhat does this mean for Sweden and perhaps even Europe’s future?\n\nThe most interesting issues for the Swedish voters in this election was gang violence, integration and, to some extent, electricity prices. There is no point hiding from the fact that the new right-wing alliance gave the most persuasive answers, which has in turn gotten them in power, to put it simply.\n\nSocio-cultural issues are more interesting than socio-economic ones and have given the Left very little space and success. The climate crisis has been turned into a background issue by politicians as much as by the media. Greta Thunberg’s perennial attention to politicians who postpone the problems to the future is proven true repeatedly.\n\nIt is not possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nThe techno-feudal situation with surveillance capitalism and how finance and capital have gone their separate ways and the old capitalism is about to be replaced by an even more remote and oligarchic order, no one even knows about and even less can choose to pay attention to.\n\nThe forecast is that people will continue to pay attention to what concerns the first level of human needs: safety and security, money that keeps flowing in, expenses that are not allowed to increase and passable highways free of sitting climate activists, because we want to get to work on time.\n\nIt is not possible to replace natural laws and, for example, believe that people whose children have been drawn into gang violence should first start thinking about what a post-capitalist world could mean. Nor is it possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nTen years of persistent grinding on the same strategy has been a disaster for the progressives in particular.\n\nCredibility, clarity and respect for people’s concerns are some human qualities that are always needed if you want others to listen to you – this also applies to grassroots democracy.\n\nThe question then is what DiEM25 could do in this crass political market where other parties in Sweden are increasing, where dissatisfaction is increasing and voter turnout is falling.\n\nThere is widespread dissatisfaction with people who see their petrol prices skyrocket because a few politicians believe that we must reduce fossil emissions.\n\nShake hands with them and say that we also think it is unfair and that we want the policy to compensate so that you are in the same boat when we have to help each other with the climate problem.\n\nThere is a hidden dissatisfaction with immigrants and the idea that they contribute to gang violence and shootings in the suburbs.\n\nShake hands with them and tell them we make no distinction when it comes to judging murderers. We can agree that everyone is equal before the law, while also admitting that certain communities need more help than others in order to be defended from a life of crime.\n\nNo progressive needs to lose their core values ​​if they want to approach our fellow unaffected citizens.\n\nToday, Swedish young people vote for Conservatives and the Sweden Democrats, the revolution is blue and if you want to use the momentum that has been built up, it is not time to withdraw and wait for another political wind.\n\nBeing progressive needs to be redefined. Several right-wing nationalist leaders in Europe welcome the Sweden Democrats’ success as a wave of nationalism that confirms themselves. A brave new progressive force may and must change this. A new progressive objective is necessary that can carve a new space for progressive politics among the Left’s old voting base as well as become a new attractive grass root magnet placing the current guardians of political status quo in the shadows.\n\nMats Sederholm\n\nCoordinator Stockholm Local Collective\n\nMember of DiEM25 Press Team\n\nWriter and active for Klimatalliansen\n\nEmail: mats@sederholm.nu\n\nDo you want to be informed of DiEM25's actions?

    "7 Fascinating Facts About Gothenburg, Sweden’s Second City": "As Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg has a rich cultural life but a more relaxed pace than ... [+] the capital city Stockholm. getty\n\nIn many ways Gothenburg could be considered the heart of Scandinavia. It’s Sweden’s second biggest city, has a 3.5-hour ferry connection to Denmark and is just a 2-hour drive from Norway.\n\nFrom its status as a global leader in sustainability to a fascinating history of trade and innovation, there’s a lot to discover about Gothenburg. Here are seven fascinating facts about this thriving Scandinavian city.\n\nThe city isn’t actually called Gothenburg\n\nIn Swedish the city is named Göteborg, roughly pronounced yaw-ta-bore(g). This surprises many international visitors as all other Swedish cities use the same name in both languages. To add to the confusion, many business in Gothenburg use the English version in their name.\n\nThe city council has changed its mind over the years about its own branding. In 2003, it was decided to promote the name Göteborg, a decision which was reversed just six years later. Now Gothenburg is the preferred choice for all international communications.\n\nIt’s the fifth largest city in the Nordic region\n\nWhile Gothenburg plays second fiddle to Stockholm in Sweden, it’s a big player in the context of the wider Nordic region.\n\nGothenburg is the fifth largest city in the Nordic region. Getty\n\nWith almost 600,000 people living in the city and about 1.1 million people in the wider urban area, Gothenburg is the biggest Nordic city that’s not the capital of its country. It’s also significantly bigger than Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.\n\nGothenburg was built by the Dutch\n\nAlthough people have lived in the area for thousands of years, the city of today was founded in 1621 by the King of Sweden. However, the city’s early success relied on construction expertise from the Netherlands.\n\nBased on the Dutch experience of building on marshlands and constructing canals, the planning of Gothenburg’s streets and necessary canals followed that of Amsterdam and Dutch colonies of the time, particularly Batavia (now Jakarta).\n\nThe city is a leader in innovative transport\n\nIn 1927, the first Volvo car rolled off the production line in Gothenburg. Since then, Volvo went on to become a global leader in people-first and safety-first design.\n\nThe Volvo Museum exhibits products from the whole Volvo range, including cars, trucks and buses. getty\n\nWhile Volvo Cars was sold to Ford in 1999, Gothenburg remains the headquarters of the Volvo Group that continues to manufacture trucks and buses including new 44-ton electric trucks. The city’s Volvo Visitor Center and Volvo Museum tell the story.\n\nToday, Gothenburg is writing a new chapter in its transport story. Leading electric aircraft developer Heart Aerospace has chosen Gothenburg as its base to create the so-called Northern Runway, a campus of production and flight test facilities.\n\nGotheburg is twinned with Chicago\n\nOf Chicago’s 28 sister cities, Gothenburg is the only one in the Nordic region. Launched in 1960, the sister cities program works on collaborations in the areas of cultural arts and tourism, global education, government relations and international business.\n\nGothenburg is a sustainability leader\n\nA committment to sustainability is a thread that runs through every aspect of life in Gothenburg, from business to tourism. In 2021, Lonely Planet recognized Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable city break, while the Global Destination Sustainability Index ranked Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable destination five years in a row.\n\nGothenburg was the first city in the world to issue green bonds to stimulate investment in solutions to climate change. Almost all the city’s hotels are eco-certified and plans to develop a zero-emissions transport zone in the downtown district are well underway.\n\nThe city’s archipelago is vast\n\nAbout 5,000 people live on Gothenburg’s southern archipalego, but that number rises to more than 10,000 during the summer months.\n\nBoats and bicycles are the primary form of transport in Gothenburg’s southern archipelago. getty\n\nMany Swedes own vacation cottages and spend several weeks on one of the islands, while many more spend weekends there throughout the year.\n\nIn keeping with the city’s sustainability focus, the southern archipelago is entirely car-free. Ferries connect people with the mainland, while bicycles and delivery mopeds are used on the islands.\n\nWhile the islands are forward-thinking, they are also steeped in history. Mentioned in Norse sagas as ‘the river islets’, the southern islands appear to have been used as a location for fairs and duels in the Viking Age.\n\nThe northern archipelago shares much in common with its southern sibling, but has bigger islands and communities accessible by car via the car ferries from Lilla Varholmen. The weekend ferry to Hönö Klåva from downtown Gothenburg is especially popular.",
    "Sweden enters political limbo in a razor-tight general election": "Sweden enters political limbo in a razor-tight general election\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stefan Jerrevång/AP Stefan Jerrevång/AP\n\nSTOCKHOLM — Sweden awoke Monday to the prospect of weeks of political uncertainty after neither of the country's blocs secured a clear governing majority in elections that saw another boost for a far-right party that is now the country's second largest.\n\nWith more than 94% of the ballots counted, the center-right opposition that includes Sweden's second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, had a razor-thin edge over the governing Social Democrats and their allies in the center-left bloc headed by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who has not resigned.\n\nThe result was so close that the election authority said a definitive outcome would not be known before Wednesday, when the uncounted votes, including those cast abroad, have been tallied. As of now, the preliminary results make it unlikely any party will secure a majority of 175 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, Sweden's parliament.\n\n\"It's incredibly close. It's basically a coin toss with 50-50 for both sides. So, we don't know at the moment,\" said Zeth Isaksson, a sociologist at Stockholm University.\n\nThe biggest winner of the evening was the populist anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which had a strong showing of nearly 21%, its best result ever. The party gained on promises to crack down on shootings and other gang violence that have shaken a sense of security for many in Sweden.\n\nThe party has its roots in the white nationalist movement but years ago began expelling extremists. Despite its rebranding, voters long viewed it as unacceptable and other parties shunned it. But that has been changing, and its result in this election shows just how far it has come in gaining acceptance.\n\nThe Social Democrats, who have been in power in Sweden since 2014, remain the largest party with 30.5% of the vote. Andersson said it was obvious that the social democratic movement, which is based on ideals of creating an equal society and a strong welfare state, remains strong in Sweden.\n\nThe conservative bloc was led during the campaign by the center-right Moderates, who won 19%. Leader Ulf Kristersson told his supporters that he stands ready to try to create a stable and effective government.\n\nHowever, Sweden is likely to face a lengthy process to form a government, as it did after the 2018 election.\n\nAndersson, a 55-year-old economist, became Sweden's first female prime minister less than a year ago and led Sweden's historic bid to join NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.",

In Sweden, voters delivered a narrow mandate after elections on Sunday to a loose coalition of right-wing parties, including one with a neo-fascist past. On Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, a center-left Social Democrat allied to other left and green parties, conceded defeat. Her party had won 30 percent of the vote — making it still the single largest faction in parliament — but their coalition secured three fewer seats than their rivals to the right.\n\nThe kingmakers in Sweden are the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD), a party founded in 1988 by ultranationalist extremists and neo-Nazis. Over the past decade, they have moved from the fringes of their country’s politics into the mainstream. This week, they secured some 20 percent of the Swedish vote, enough to make them the second-largest party in Sweden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they may not formally be in power. Such is the political stigma around them that they may remain technically outside a government led by the center-right Moderates and Liberals, yet crucially not in opposition. Coalition politics carry many complexities and wrangling over the new government may take weeks. Whatever the outcome, it seems the far-right SD believes it has a major seat at the table in a country long known for its progressive ethos and policies.\n\n“Now we will get order in Sweden,” SD leader Jimmie Akesson wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “It is time to start rebuilding security, prosperity and cohesion. It’s time to put Sweden first.”\n\nSweden, national parliament election:\n\n\n\n100% of districts counted\n\n\n\nS-S&D: 30.3% (+2.0)\n\nSD-ECR: 20.5% (+3.0)\n\nM-EPP: 19.1% (-0.7)\n\nV-LEFT: 6.7% (-1.3)\n\nC-RE: 6.7% (-1.9)\n\nKD-EPP: 5.3% (-1.0)\n\nMP-G/EFA: 5.1% (+0.7)\n\nL-RE: 4.6% (-0.9)\n\n\n\n+/- vs. 2018 election\n\n\n\n➤ https://t.co/rsoqcYChNY pic.twitter.com/WC0LMCR1Zk — Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) September 15, 2022\n\nAkesson’s triumphalism has echoed across the continent. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally Party, hailed the SD’s success as a sign of nationalist resurgence. “Everywhere in Europe, people aspire to take their destiny back into their own hands!” she tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLe Pen, of course, knows her share of false dawns, having been repeatedly thwarted in elections no matter incremental gains in defeat. But far-right parties have in the past decade been the beneficiaries of the collapse of the so-called “cordon sanitaire” set up by more mainstream parties to block them from winning power, entering governing coalitions in Swedish neighbor Finland, Austria and Italy. And even when not in government, their agendas have made their way into governance — the center-left government in Denmark, for example, checked right-wing nativism by adopting the anti-immigration policies of their rivals.\n\nItalian elections later this month are expected to deliver perhaps the most emphatic victory for a European far-right party: The Brothers of Italy, which draws its origins from Italy’s neofascist movement, is currently leading in the polls and its leader, the charismatic Giorgia Meloni, is poised to be become prime minister with the backing of a number of other right-wing parties.\n\nAkesson doesn’t have the political alliances that Meloni does but shares an antipathy toward migration, Islam and the spectral “globalist” establishment that far-right campaigners across the West have harnessed in their bids for power. “They don’t include Islam in Swedishness,” said Andrej Kokkonen, a professor of politics at the University of Gothenburg, to my colleagues. “You don’t get to be a Swede and a Muslim at the same time.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They have few new solutions for today’s destructive economic and environmental crises,” wrote Pankaj Mishra for Bloomberg Opinion about the far right. “They can, however, channel social unrest to their advantage by reheating identities of race, religion and ethnicity, and retailing myths of national greatness.”\n\nFar-right Italian politician Alessio Di Giulio posted a video last week with a Roma woman, telling voters that if they cast their ballots for the party in the election later this month they’ll “never see her again.”https://t.co/lO4OFSe5eV — Axios (@axios) September 15, 2022\n\nAhead of the election, Andersson pointed to the toxicity of the SD’s legacy. “There are rightwing populist parties in many European countries, but the Sweden Democrats have deep roots in the Swedish neo-Nazis and other racist organizations in Sweden,” she said last week on the campaign trail in an interview with the Guardian, highlighting an alleged incident where SD campaigners celebrated the Nazi invasion of Poland during World War II. “I mean, it’s not like other parties.”\n\nBut that has hardly dented their appeal. The SD emerged as a major political force in Sweden, siphoning off rural votes that once would have gone to parties on the other side of the political spectrum. “Treating nationalists as pariahs has not prevented their rise,” observed the Economist. “On the contrary: elections in Europe now are often a case of loudly pitting the mainstream against the supposedly unpalatable and hoping that not too many voters pick the ‘wrong’ side. Simply hoping the nasties go away has not, in fact, made them go away.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more mainstream parties on the right, finding accommodation with the far right has become, in some instances, the only path to power. “If you want a government that is not based on the Social Democrats you need to cooperate with the SD,” said Anders Borg, a former finance minister for the Moderates, to my colleagues. “I cannot see any other viable election strategy.”\n\n“In Sweden,” he added, “we isolated the SD and yet they grew to 20 percent as a lot of ordinary voters drifted toward them. At the same time, the SD has moved away from a fringe position toward being a more ordinary political party.”\n\nThat is the narrative surrounding other ascendant far-right parties in Europe, including Meloni’s Brothers of Italy. Meloni angrily rejects accusations of fascism and has cast herself as part of the political mainstream — cooling her Euroskepticism, supporting sanctions against Russia and prioritizing, at least for now, economic relief for Italians over a hysterical culture war.\n\nIf the Italian right wins power, Meloni will have to translate all the years of populist rabble-rousing into effective governance. That’s no small matter given the thicket of problems facing her debt-ridden country. “I cannot say that, faced with such a responsibility, my hands aren’t shaking,” Meloni told my colleagues.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech?

Dzisiaj jest dzień takiej nadzieihttps://t.co/VFER1wme9V — wPolityce.pl (@wPolityce_pl) September 25, 2022\n\nMorawiecki’s predecessor as prime minister, Beata Szydło, who is now a PiS MEP, also tweeted congratulations to Meloni and FdI in Polish, English and Italian. Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski.

Jaka partia tacy sojusznicy. — Agnieszka Pomaska (@pomaska) September 25, 2022\n\nBoth PiS and FdI are part of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR), which seeks reform of the EU in the direction of a looser union of sovereign member states and opposes further integration.\n\nIn recent years, PiS has also sought to forge closer links with Salvini’s Lega party, as well as other right-wing and far-right forces in the EU, such as France’s Marine Le Pen.\n\nHowever, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: Santi_ABASCAL/Twitter",

    "How The Local Sweden uses product thinking to remain \"useful\" to readers": "News organisations around the world are starting to pay attention to their readers’ needs and adopt a user-first model.\n\nThat is the case for The Local, a news outlet for English-speaking expats, published in nine European countries.\n\nIts Swedish edition uses reader surveys and audience data to create editorial products that its readers want and need.\n\nRead more: How BBC World Service engages younger audiences by fulfilling six reader needs\n\nSure, \"product thinking\" is a piece of jargon. What it really means, according to Paul O'Mahony, editorial product manager at The Local Sweden, is simply to make sure the publication is useful to its readers.\n\n\"Why do people buy products? It’s to fill a need or solve a problem in their lives,\" he said in a Journalism.co.uk podcast.\n\nThe \"product\" in product thinking can be anything, from a new article series to a podcast or a comic. The key to success is to provide your readers with valuable information they cannot find elsewhere.\n\nThe Local's membership is a good example, giving subscribers unlimited access to all nine editions. Throughout the pandemic, the news website has become a go-to source of coronavirus updates where authorities do not communicate in English a lot. Subscriptions have grown from 13k to 50k over the past two years.\n\nEditions from different countries collaborate all the time, swapping tips and stories, so individual publications can benefit from a much larger pool of audience data. One example of a successful new product launched in several countries is the \"Word of the day\" series that explains a local word to foreigners.\n\nAnother example is a monthly \"What changes\" article series where The Local Sweden informs foreign residents about upcoming changes in legislation or other areas of public life that could affect them. Originally created in France, the series was a hit with existing users and it also helped convert new readers into subscribers.\n\nProduct thinking is not limited to written articles. Podcast \"Sweden in focus\", created a year ago, answers listeners' needs with a solutions mindset. At a time when the right-wing populist parties are on the rise, O'Mahony is looking at projects that worked elsewhere and lessons we can learn from them.\n\nPodcasts are good for subscription conversions too; 65 per cent of listeners are paying members, of whom 60 per cent say the podcast makes them more likely to renew their membership.

The make-up of its team gives the publication a head start as most journalists are expats themselves and can use their experience to figure out what the readers may need.\n\nSurveys, on the other hand, tend to ask practical questions and often help journalists unearth new topics or angles they did not think about before.\n\n\"We had an email from a reader last week who said the cost of living made them reconsider their subscriptions.

    "Right-wing nationalism comes to ... Sweden?": "As we look ahead to midterm elections, where election deniers are on the ballot in 27 states, it’s still mind-blowing to consider how we got here in just a few years. And the answer, most bluntly, is a rise in right-wing nationalism.\n\nAfter lying dormant for some time, the contours of this new and arguably ascendant movement are by now well-known. There are many characteristics, most of which are deeply troubling if you’re a fan of democracy, including but not limited to:\n\nA preference for national, religious and ethnic purity; an antipathy for migrants and immigrants; an open hostility to the press and a desire to punish critics; and an apologist or even approving approach to authoritarianism.\n\nWhile all of that easily describes the right-wing nationalism stoked and nurtured by Donald Trump here in America, it also describes a stunning surge of authoritarianism in other countries, most notably Brazil and Hungary, where leaders Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orban, respectively, have puppeted Trump’s strong-arm nationalism to considerable success.\n\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, from Boris Johnson and now Liz Truss in the United Kingdom to Marine Le Pen in France, right-wing nationalism is getting a bigger audience, not a smaller one.\n\nThis is disturbing enough. Whether in Latin America or Europe, an embrace of nationalism, and in some cases fascism, recalls some truly horrific moments in world history.\n\nBut what if I told you right-wing nationalism was also winning in some less expected places — say, Sweden?\n\nYes, the same Sweden that American liberals and progressives have long called an egalitarian utopia.\n\nThe same Sweden that consistently ranks among the happiest, the freest, the most liberal, friendliest to immigrants, freest for journalists, the least racist and safest for LGBTQ travel countries in the world.\n\nLast week, this same Sweden held general elections to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag, or legislature. The right-wing Sweden Democrats won a net gain of 11 new seats, for a total of 73, surpassing the moderates to make it the second-most popular party in the country behind the left-wing Social Democrats.\n\nThis was shocking for many Swedes and election watchers, according to Elisabeth Asbrink, author of “Made in Sweden: 25 Ideas That Created a Country.” The success of the Sweden Democrats, she writes in The New York Times this week, “marks the end of Swedish exceptionalism, the idea that the country stood out both morally and materially.”\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nAs she describes it, the party’s origins date back to 1988 and a neo-Nazi group called BSS, or Keep Sweden Swedish. The far-right movement has “profited from the country’s growing inequalities, fostering an obsession with crime and an antipathy to migrants.”\n\nShe notes how the party’s chief of staff in the Swedish Parliament declared that critical journalists should be “punished” and were to be considered “enemies of the nation.”\n\nThe country’s defense minister called the party a security risk, due to its neo-Nazi ties.\n\nEarlier this year, the party’s leader, Jimmie Akesson, refused to choose between President Joe Biden and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis all sounds very familiar to us: It echoes the climate we’ve been living in here in the U.S. for the past six years during the rise of Trump.\n\nIt was once easy to think of this new political populist era as a uniquely American response to uniquely American problems. Trump was, after all, a uniquely American invention, and he was both benefiting from and leaning into uniquely American divisions and grievances.\n\nBut clearly we aren’t as special as we thought. A rise in populism in India and Pakistan, as well as Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France and now even Sweden is proving the movement is global, and so is its appeal.\n\nTo call it merely nostalgia is to divorce it from the racial, ethnic and sexual anxieties that inform right-wing nationalism and make up many of its punitive policies. But a desire to return to some long-gone way of life is a common thread across international borders.\n\n“Back to red cottages and apple trees, to law and order, to women being women and men being men,” as Asbrink describes it in Sweden.\n\nThe reaction to this voting block sounds familiar, too: “Individuals leaning toward the Sweden Democrats … have felt stigmatized … This has not only fed the party’s self-image as a martyr but also nurtured even more loyalty among its supporters,” Asbrink writes.\n\nPerhaps it’s some consolation to know the U.S. isn’t the only democracy in jeopardy — that we aren’t uniquely susceptible to these dark impulses, that this isn’t one of those “only in America” problems.\n\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that none of this is good.

    "U.S. ambassador: Finland and Sweden in NATO by Christmas": "U.S. ambassador: Finland and Sweden in NATO by Christmas\n\n“Finland is the most prepared to join NATO of any nation in modern history,” said Douglas Hickey, U.S. ambassador to Finland. “They see it as they’re going to defend someone else as well as themselves.” | U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Yvonna Guyette\n\nWith help from Lawrence Ukenye and Lee Hudson\n\nSubscribe here | Email Alex\n\nHELSINKI, Finland — Finland and Sweden will become official NATO members by Christmas, the U.S. ambassador to Finland predicted in a conversation with reporters and experts.\n\nOnly three of NATO’s 30 members are left to ratify the two countries’ accessions to the alliance. Slovakia is expected to give the green light while Hungary and Turkey continue to string the applicants along. The general assumption is that they both will wait until 2023 to make a final decision, with Turkey remaining in a holding pattern until after general elections in June 2023.\n\nBut DOUGLAS HICKEY, who was sworn into his role in April, said he’s optimistic NATO will have 32 members before the year is out. Conversations he’s had with his Hungarian counterpart in Helsinki led him to believe a positive vote will soon come, he told the group, warning the situation could change. But Hickey believes Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN doesn’t want to be the lone holdout, incentivizing him to move quickly on the issue.\n\n“I don’t think he wants to be on an island too long,” he told your host during a meeting as part of a trip organized and sponsored by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Time was of the essence, he implored, especially after Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN ordered a partial mobilization of his military and threatened nuclear use. “We have to get this done. We have to stabilize this situation.”\n\nWhen Hickey was approached about becoming the ambassador to Finland, he called his friend JOHN KERRY about what the role would entail. The former secretary of State’s reply was “Russia, climate and NATO,” Hickey said. The climate portfolio takes up some of Hickey’s time, but Russia and NATO have dominated his agenda.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed Finland to join the alliance after decades of maintaining a relative independence, namely to maintain cordial ties with its neighbor. (And for good reason: Russia has invaded Finland three times over the past century.)\n\nThe majority of the alliance welcomed the reversal, but Erdogan claimed that Helsinki and Sweden were harboring terrorists and inconsiderate of Turkey’s security concerns. The three sides hammered out their issues (read: dealt with Erdogan’s tantrum) during the June NATO Summit in Madrid.\n\nThat pleased Hickey, who relayed that Turkey’s antics left Finland feeling like it “got punched in the face.”\n\nThe bruises might still be healing, but that isn’t affecting Helsinki’s push to be an official NATO member or making Washington rethink its full-throated support. Hickey boasted about how Finland will be “accretive” to the alliance with a Navy built for littoral combat, complementing much of NATO’s blue-water fleets, and an Air Force that will soon include the F-35.\n\n“Finland is the most prepared to join NATO of any nation in modern history,” Hickey said. “They see it as they’re going to defend someone else as well as themselves.”\n\n\n\nThe Inbox\n\nUKRAINE PLEADS FOR TANKS: Ukraine is asking urgently for modern tanks to help their forces seize on rapid gains in the northeast and take additional territory, but the West is dragging its feet, Lara reported alongside our own PAUL McLEARY and ERIN BANCO.\n\nThe tanks have shot to the top of Kyiv’s wish list as Ukraine presses its gains in the northeastern Donbas region amid the shocking Russian collapse this month. The request took on new urgency this week after Putin announced that he would mobilize 300,000 additional troops for the fight in Ukraine, a major escalation of the campaign.\n\nThe more modern American-made M-1 Abrams and German-made Leopard tanks would add a powerful punch that could help Kyiv’s forces capture and hold more ground, compared to the old Soviet-era tanks they currently operate, say experts and Ukrainian advisers. But top national security officials in both countries have hesitated to provide the tanks, in part due to the training and logistics challenges involved, according to U.S. officials, Ukrainian advisers and congressional aides.\n\nThe M-1s, for example, are a completely different system than the Soviet-era tanks Ukraine currently operates, and require significant maintenance and logistics support.\n\n“It’s a pretty high hurdle to get Ukraine not only U.S.-made tanks but the parts to maintain them,” said one U.S. official, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing conversations. “You don’t want to give them something that’s going to break down and run out of gas and they can’t refuel them.”\n\nWestern-style tanks would provide a major upgrade to Kyiv’s armored force in terms of range, speed and fire control, allowing Ukrainian forces to hit a Russian target up to a mile and a half away and move before the enemy can shoot back, said retired Lt. Gen. BEN HODGES, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe.\n\nBut the training required and logistics tail — an M-1 division can consume up to 600,000 gallons of fuel a day — could hinder Ukraine’s movement, he cautioned.\n\n“These are not rental cars, there’s a lot that goes with it,” Hodges said. “You are basically adding hundreds of additional things that would have to be carried along.… You look at a U.S. Army tank company today, there are thousands of gallons of fuel following behind them every day.”\n\nIT’S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily.

It’s been a year since the Afghan air force flew dozens of U.S.-donated aircraft across the border to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan as the Taliban overran Kabul last year — and the aircraft are still sitting there. As Lara scooped earlier this week, the U.S. is currently negotiating with the two Central Asian countries to trade the aircraft for help hunting terrorists in Afghanistan.\n\nNatSec Daily obtained an early copy of a new report from LUKE COFFEY at the Hudson Institute that provides some key context for these negotiations. He notes that Tajikistan harbors sympathies for the ethnic Tajik minority that comprises much of the National Resistance Front, the opposition group based in Afghanistan’s Panjshir Province that continues to fight against the Taliban.\n\nThe Biden administration has been hesitant to support the NRF at least publicly and has yet to invite the leader, AHMAD MASSOUD, to Washington, D.C. But Coffey argues in his report that the U.S. and the international community must consider how to support the NRF, including formally transferring the former Afghan Air Force aircraft to the Tajik Air Force and helping the Tajiks develop a maintenance plan for the planes.\n\nThe long-term objective, Coffey writes, would be “to ensure that the aircraft are available for NRF use in the future.”\n\nTHWARTED ISIS SUICIDE ATTACK IN SYRIA: The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces successfully thwarted a planned ISIS suicide bomber attack on the al-Hol refugee camp earlier this week, U.S. Central Command announced today. The SDF forces interdicted seven ISIS fighters in two vehicles heading in the direction of the camp at approximately 12:25 a.m. on Sept. 20, according to a statement.\n\n\"One vehicle — rigged with explosives and personnel wearing explosive suicide vests — prematurely exploded near the Um Fakik village, approximately 12 miles northeast of the intended target at al-Hol. This explosion alerted Syrian Democratic Forces operating in the area who then arrived within minutes and surrounded the second vehicle,” according to a CENTCOM statement.\n\n\"Two men exited the second vehicle wearing suicide vests. One detonated his vest. Syrian Democratic Forces shot and killed the second man. The second vehicle was rigged with at least 50 kilograms of explosives.”\n\nFour ISIS fighters were killed in the engagement, and one is now in SDF custody. No SDF troops were killed or wounded.\n\nRUSSIAN MILITARY DIVIDED: The highest ranks of the Russian military are in disarray as Ukraine continues its rapid advances in the northeast, writes CNN’s KATIE BO LILLIS, with Putin himself giving directions to generals in the field and Russian officers arguing amongst themselves about decision-making in Washington.\n\n“Russia's military is divided over how best to counter Ukraine's unexpected battlefield advances this month, according to multiple sources familiar with US intelligence, as Moscow has found itself on the defensive in both the east and the south,” Lillis writes.\n\n“Russian President Vladimir Putin is himself giving directions directly to generals in the field, two sources familiar with US and western intelligence said — a highly unusual management tactic in a modern military that these sources said hints at the dysfunctional command structure that has plagued Russia's war from the beginning.”\n\n“Intelligence intercepts have captured Russian officers arguing among themselves and complaining to friends and relatives back home about decision-making from Moscow, one of these sources told CNN.”\n\n“And there are significant disagreements on strategy with military leaders struggling to agree on where to focus their efforts to shore up defensive lines, multiple sources familiar with US intelligence said.”\n\n\n\nKeystrokes\n\n‘IT JUST DIDN’T WORK’: NatSec Daily wants to point out another interesting tidbit from the Hickey conversation: He believes Russia did try to harm Finland in cyberspace after its decision to join NATO.\n\n“I don’t think for a minute that the Russians didn’t try,” the U.S. ambassador to Finland said. “We assume the Russians didn’t do anything from a cyber perspective,” but it’s likely Moscow did do something, and “it just didn’t work.”\n\nFinland has a very digitized society that it’s protected diligently well over the years. Recent attacks on Finnish banks, for example, didn’t have much of an effect on the country’s financial sector. It’s therefore possible Russian hackers launched serious cyber offenses, only to have them repelled.\n\nAnother possibility, per officials in Helsinki and Riga, is that Russia is just too tied up with the physical war that it can’t focus on the cyber one. Whatever the answer, many expect Russia to go big in cyberspace at some point down the line — it’s just a matter of when and how.\n\n\n\nThe Complex\n\nSHOW ME THE MONEY: Ukrainian advisers and Republican staffers are sounding the alarm this week because the Biden administration has not asked Congress to roll over authorization to ship another $2.2 billion worth of weapons and equipment for use in Ukraine after it expires at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nTop Pentagon officials stress that the money itself is not expiring, but Congress must re-authorize the ability to draw down equipment. The administration has requested lawmakers include $3.6 billion in new drawdown authority for Ukraine in a temporary continuing resolution to begin the fiscal year while negotiations continue on full-year spending bills. Congress will likely grant this request as well as attach emergency funding to the CR.\n\nThe reason the administration has not asked Congress to roll over the existing authorization is because Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee conveyed that their preference was to let the old authorization expire and instead put in a new request for additional funds, a U.S. official told NatSec Daily. Either way, the White House does not anticipate any gaps in funding for Ukraine, the official said.\n\nBut congressional staffers say it’s a bad look, and unnecessarily delays shipping much-needed aid to Ukraine. It also leaves the administration open to accusations it is trying to slow down aid to Kyiv in order to avoid provoking Putin, they say. The administration does not anticipate another drawdown before the end of the fiscal year.\n\n“All this is coming to a head when the Ukrainians have got momentum, and we’re hemming and hawing and wringing our hands,” one staffer said.\n\nDECISION TIME ON GRAY EAGLE: A bipartisan group of 17 House lawmakers sent a letter to Defense Secretary LLOYD AUSTIN Wednesday demanding that the department speed up its monthslong review of whether to supply Ukraine with Gray Eagle drones.\n\nPentagon leadership has been debating whether to send the drones since the spring, with concerns over technology transfer and their survivability keeping the issue alive, but with no resolution.\n\n“Risk assessments and mitigation should not come at the expense of Ukrainian lives,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter obtained by POLITICO, adding “should the decision be made to transfer Gray Eagles then it should be done expeditiously.”\n\nIf the Pentagon decides not to provide the technology, “that needs to be communicated quickly and clearly to afford our Ukrainian partners the opportunity to make alternative plans,” the letter said.\n\nThe letter was spearheaded by Congressional Ukrainian Caucus members Reps. MARCY KAPTUR (D-Ohio), BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-Pa.), MIKE QUIGLEY (D-Ill.) and ANDY HARRIS (R-Md.).\n\n\n\nOn The Hill\n\nREPUBLICANS SLAM LANDMINE BAN: The top Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services, Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs panels are renewing their opposition to Biden's June decision to widely limit the use of anti-personnel landmines, our own CONNOR O’BRIEN reports.\n\nSens. JIM INHOFE (R-Okla.) and JIM RISCH (R-Ind.) and Reps. MIKE ROGERS (R-Ala.) and MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas) slammed limiting the use of mines — a move by Biden to reverse a more expansive Trump-era policy — and argued landmines \"remain an important tool in modern warfare\" in a letter to Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN, SecDef Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. MARK MILLEY scooped by Connor (for Pros!).\n\n\"Considering the obvious operational benefits of anti-personnel landmines, the United States should not unnecessarily issue a policy depriving U.S. troops access to anti-personnel landmines currently in DoD stocks simply to pursue an ideal that our adversaries will not follow,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Implementing such a blanket policy seems particularly questionable when one considers that all landmines currently in the U.S. operational inventory already incorporate technologically advanced safeguards limiting harm to noncombatants.\"\n\nSPACE FORCE, NUCLEAR PICKS APPROVED: Senate Armed Services approved a swath of civilian and military nominees today, including Biden's pick to be just the second head of the Space Force in the service's brief history.\n\nSenators signed off on Lt. Gen. CHANCE SALTZMAN — now the deputy chief for operations, cyber and nuclear — to succeed Gen. JAY RAYMOND as chief of space operations, a post he's held since the service was stood up in 2019.\n\nSASC also approved Air Force Gen. ANTHONY COTTON to lead U.S. Strategic Command.\n\nAnd three civilian picks advanced to the full Senate: LAURA TAYLOR-KALE to be the Pentagon's industrial base policy chief, BRENDAN OWENS to oversee the department's energy, installations and environment programs and MILANCY HARRIS to be the Pentagon's No. 2 civilian intelligence official.\n\n\n\nBroadsides\n\nRUSSIA, US DIPLOMATS FACE OFF: Russian and Western diplomats traded barbs over Moscow’s alleged war crimes in Ukraine on Thursday during the meeting of the United National Security Council, JOHN HUDSON and MISSY RYAN report for the Washington Post.\n\n“Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s withdrawal from the Ukrainian cities of Izyum and Bucha revealed gruesome torture and murder of Ukrainian civilians that could not be dismissed as the actions of a few bad actors,” Hudson and Ryan report.\n\n“‘Wherever the Russian tide recedes, we discover the horror that’s left in its wake,’” Blinken said. ‘We cannot, we will not allow President Putin to get away with it.’”\n\n“Russian Foreign Minister SERGEI LAVROV denied the charges and accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilians in the eastern Donbas region ‘with impunity.’”\n\n“He blamed the United States, France and Germany for not holding Ukraine accountable for alleged atrocities.”\n\n“‘The Kyiv regime owes its impunity to its Western sponsors,’ he said.”\n\n\n\nTransitions\n\n— KAREN DAHUT will join Google as the new public sector CEO on Oct. 31.

    "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years": "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to correspondent Charlie Duxbury of Politico Europe, about the rise of the Sweden Democrats, from a neo-Nazi group to an influential political party after Sunday's elections.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA far-right party with roots in neo-Nazi groups is expected to play a central role in Sweden's next coalition government.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have grown more influential in recent years after it moderated some of its positions and expelled some of its extremist members. Its anti-immigration, tough on crime platform resonated with Swedish voters in Sunday's election.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury is the Stockholm correspondent for Politico Europe and joins us. Welcome.\n\nCHARLIE DUXBURY: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: I just heard A say they moderated their positions. What did they stand for in the past, and what do they stand for now?\n\nDUXBURY: Yes, so the Sweden Democrats do have roots in neo-Nazi groups of the late '80s, early '90s in Sweden. In the years since, they kind of cleaned things up and moved more towards the mainstream, but they still stand for a very hard line on immigration and a hard line on law and order. And that's what seems to have attracted voters in Sunday's vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Hasn't Sweden welcomed a relatively large number of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in recent years?\n\nDUXBURY: That's right. During Europe's migration crisis from 2015 onwards, Sweden took a relatively large number of those asylum-seekers. And the government at the time, social democratic government, was relatively welcoming in the same way that Germany was, and tens of thousands of asylum-seekers arrived in Sweden. Since then, there's been a kind of backlash in - among some groups, particularly the Sweden Democrats, who said that that was a mistake and that the integration of immigrants since then has been a failure.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, what does it mean that they did so well in Sunday's election? And how much influence do they now have? They wouldn't be leading the coalition, I guess.\n\nDUXBURY: No. So the count's still ongoing. We should have a final result by this evening. What is expected to happen is that the center-right moderate party will lead the government but will lean heavily on the Sweden Democrats, who achieved a score of about 20% of the vote on Sunday. And the Sweden Democrats will be under pressure from their own voters to show that they can deliver on some quite ambitious campaign pledges to cut down on immigration, to increase policing powers in sentencing in the courts in Sweden. So that will be a closely watched discussion over the days and weeks to come.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the center-right party that seems likely to lead the coalition in a position where they would essentially have to do what the Sweden Democrats demand on their particular issues to keep the coalition together?\n\nDUXBURY: They'll certainly have to offer some serious concessions to the Sweden Democrats to hold this loose coalition together. They may decide to offer them ministerial positions. They may decide to try and run a minority government with the Sweden Democrats outside. But either way, the Sweden Democrats are going to demand serious influence over the government in the four-year mandate period to come, and they will have to show the voters that they've achieved that.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury, correspondent for Politico Europe in Stockholm, thanks so much.\n\nDUXBURY: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "From Scotland to Sweden: How smart cities are helping residents save energy": "The university town of Umeå, in northern Sweden, is almost completely dark in winter. Encouraging residents to take public transport on cold, gloomy mornings requires some persuasion, but the city is more insightful than most about the needs of the people living there.\n\nAfter decades of applying a gendered lens to its travel surveys, the city knows that if everyone travelled like women, it would already have reached its sustainable transport goal for 2050.\n\nA bus stop was built with individual wooden pods to help women feel safer in public spaces.\n\n“It started a big discussion in Umeå,” project manager Carina Aschan says of the Station of Being, which uses distinct sounds and coloured lights to announce incoming electric buses.\n\nWhen a glassy note sounds, those sheltering in the Station of Being's rotating wooden pods know the bus to the glass factory is pulling in. RISE Sweden\n\n“It was meant to be an energy solution but it became a social solution too, and sparked a wider discussion about Umeå being innovative, and whether a city should do that.”\n\nDozens of smart solutions have been launched under an EU-funded project called RUGGEDISED, aiming to decarbonise three cities and inspire many more. As it draws to a close after six years, the question of what our cities can do for us, energy wise, has become more urgent than ever.\n\nHere are some of the brightest findings from the ‘lighthouse’ cities of Umeå, Rotterdam and Glasgow.\n\nWhat are smart cities?\n\nSmart cities sound futuristic but are built on some simple ideas around digitising our transport, buildings and other infrastructure. One way of thinking about smart solutions is working better with what’s already there.\n\nIn Rotterdam’s Heart of South experimentation area, the warmth from sewage water (which reaches up to 19C) will be recouped via a heat exchanger and stored in the thermal grid. Close by, tubes have been laid underneath the pavement to extract its heat (the concrete hits 65C in summer). In winter, warm water instead of cold will be pumped through them to melt the icy walkway.\n\nThe pavement heat/cold collector at the Ahoy centre. City of Rotterdam\n\nThere’s nothing flashy about this innovation, hidden below ground and around the back of the city’s Ahoy convention centre.\n\nBut it’s about results, and Ahoy has been fossil free since 2019. A carpet of thousands of solar panels on its roof supply the colossal energy needed for huge light shows, like Eurovision 2021.\n\nRewiring Rotterdam into a smart city\n\n“My dream is to have the built environment connected to sustainable energy sources,” Katelien van den Berge, Rotterdam’s RUGGEDISED project manager, tells Euronews Green.\n\nThe Netherlands’ second city was razed by German bombers during the second world war, so its eclectic architecture has relatively recent roots.\n\n“We do have an advantage because we have quite spacious public space,” explains van den Berge, making it easier to weave smarter infrastructure below roads and into the fabric of the city.\n\n“Rebuilding Rotterdam after World War Two, we had an empty inner city, it was all flattened and they built a district heating system” she says. “The ownership changed and the sources changed, but the system was already there, so that makes it easier to expand it.” Around 11 thousand homes are already connected.\n\nRotterdam's smart thermal grid being installed below ground. A new cinema in the Heart of South district will also be connected once it's built. City of Rotterdam\n\nHow smart solutions reduce energy demand\n\nKnowing more about the way energy flows through our cities also enables us to be more efficient in our use of it. Umeå’s most impactful solution has been better management of demand, says Aschan.\n\nAn intelligent set of sensors were installed in its university buildings, collecting data on human presence, temperature, light and CO2 levels. A smarter heating and cooling system followed which has achieved a 23 per cent drop in energy use during peak times across the campus.\n\nThe city’s university borders its hospital, and RUGGEDISED has sparked conversations between the two. Instead of building a new wing, the hospital realised it can use some of the empty university facilities at night. It may seem simple but using what is already there in a smarter way is what is needed in most cases.\n\nSmarter ways to use energy at home\n\nWheatley tenant Liz used to get up at night to run her washing machine, when electricity was cheaper. Now the new tech is saving her money and time. Peter Mohan\n\nThe main place that many city dwellers desperately need to save energy this winter is at home.\n\nThat’s not equally true across the continent. In Sweden, tenants have a right to a heated home and there’s no phrase for ‘fuel poverty’ (or warm banks). In the UK - despite Prime Minister Truss freezing bills at an average of €2,890 a year - 7 million households are still on course to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on fuel.\n\nTo alleviate the burden on some of its poorest residents, Glasgow City Council has partnered with Wheatley, Scotland’s biggest social housing group. Through RUGGEDISED, new devices have been installed on tenants’ electric storage heating systems, giving them greater control over the temperature in their flats.\n\nPeople are using around 20 per cent less electricity as a result, explains Wheatley carbon reduction and sustainability manager Colin Reid.\n\n“It allows us to interact with households, it offers them for the first time the ability to control heating in their own home when previously they were just the receivers,” he says.\n\n“It’s a courtesy for people that they can see for themselves how their home is operating.”\n\nGlasgow’s smart street\n\nGlasgow City Council is now looking at even bigger renewable energy projects, from covering capped landfill sites in solar panels to digging a borehole by the SEC. Getty Images/ TomasSereda\n\nIt’s often said that people make Glasgow and ‘people make Glasgow greener’ has become another call to action.\n\n“It’s part of the character of the city,” says Reid. “It’s got its issues and has a legacy of industrialisation, but on the whole Glasgow is a warm place. People want community with each other, so that’s a real asset whenever embarking on a just transition.”\n\nRunning through the heart of the city - along a stretch of George Street and Duke Street - is Glasgow’s flagship solution: it’s smart street.\n\nHere the council has trialled a range of measures, including lighting triggered when people walk past, a new solar canopy on the car park roof to charge EVs plus power storage, and district heating.\n\nWhen the world’s leaders descend on your city for COP, decision makers tend to take more notice, says Gavin Slater, head of sustainability at Glasgow City Council. Yet, “the city is a fundamentally better place” because of its participation in RUGGEDISED, he says.\n\nGlasgow has made great progress towards its net-zero by 2030 goal, Slater revealed. Carbon emissions have already been slashed by 50 per cent since 2006.\n\nDigital twins: How far can modelling data help cities get greener?\n\nIn Brno, the Czech Republic’s RUGGEDISED ‘follower’ city, residents can use the data platforms to see what savings they can make from installing solar panels on their roof. Euronews Green\n\nData is quickly transforming how we see our homes and streets, from an energy-saving point of view. Where there used to be one data point a year - someone coming to check your gas and electric - our homes are now a hive of numbers, notes Dr Marcel van Oosterhout from the Erasmus Centre for Data Analytics.\n\nPublic concern over how this data is used is, understandably, slowing its potential. The risk comes from how detailed a picture can fall into the wrong hands. Data about energy usage could be combined with addresses, giving a pretty clear indication of when people are on holiday.\n\nBut representatives from all three cities spoke in glowing terms about what ‘digital twins’ can do for sustainable planning. These are smart 3D models of the city that combine with real time data about how it’s functioning, explains Roland van der Heijden, programme manager for Digital City Rotterdam.\n\nThey enable residents to be brought into the planning process too. At the site of a new square, people can scan a QR code to create and judge designs, then use augmented reality to see how they will look.\n\nGeneric, scalable, maintainable data sources are key, adds van der Heijden. And it’s here that the private sector may have a big role to play. Google is drawing on huge data reserves to build up its environmental insights explorer (EIE) tool, totting up transport emissions, air quality and tree canopies.\n\nAnna Williams, a solutions lead in the tech giant’s Geo team, insists that “helping cities lower their emissions is our north star.”\n\nWhat are the limits on smartening cities?\n\nRotterdam's Ahoy rooftop. But residents with solar panels at home are currently unable to sell their energy to neighbours during peak times in the Netherlands.. Euronews Green\n\n“There’s no cookie cutter copy” to building smart cities, says Adriaan Slob, an expert at the Dutch research organisation TNO which has helped the cities with their sustainable transitions.\n\nA major challenge is that these smart solutions have to be implemented in existing urban areas, with their own messy webs.\n\nIn the Heart of South, Katelien van den Berge’s team could not get their smart electric grid off the ground. Though there are all the elements of smart lighting, electric vehicles and charging points, the city didn’t get the experimental status it needed to connect them, and a key contract bid for by energy partner Eneco was granted elsewhere.\n\n“There was no coordination between tendering on a city scale and implementing on a project level,” reflects van den Berge. And with no overall owner, there was noone to take responsibility for the grid’s success. No matter in a city as restless as Rotterdam; the team are taking their learnings to a number of other big urban development areas.\n\nWhere ambition has overreached itself, RUGGEDISED still provides some striking blueprints.

    "Sweden mulls the cost to save communities from rising sea": "The low-lying farmland around the Swedish village of Skanör is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nSKANÖR, Sweden — On January 4, 2017, a day of clear skies and light winds on Sweden’s far southwestern Falsterbonäset peninsula, the flood warning went out.\n\nRescue services scrambled to help motorists trapped on local roads after unusual winds offshore sent sea water surging toward the villages of Skanör, Ljunghusen and Höllviken.\n\nOne isolated cottage was partially submerged.\n\nBy around 8 p.m., the water was already receding, and while the villagers could breathe a sigh of relief, officials in the municipal offices the in nearby town of Vellinge were realizing that a bullet had just been dodged.\n\n“If there had been a strong onshore wind that day, it could have been a catastrophe,” said Carina Wutzler, mayor of Vellinge Municipality. “We would have seen a lot more damage.”\n\nThe pressing question for lawmakers in such areas across Europe and beyond is what should be saved and how, and at what cost to public budgets and the natural environment, from catastrophic events that are due to become more frequent as the global climate heats up.\n\n“I still get people saying that flooding is not going to happen, and I say to them it is already happening,” Wutzler said. “We need protection now, this is not something for 50 years’ time.”\n\nThe Falsterbonäset peninsula, which is covered by the Vellinge administration, is an affluent mix of high-end summer homes and commuter belt luxury living. It is one of 18 coastal spots on a Swedish government list of areas at risk of flooding as the climate warms, polar ice melts, sea levels rise and storms intensify.\n\nArguably the most vulnerable place on that list, the peninsula is a prime example of the type of low-lying European coastline, inhabited in many cases for centuries, which now suddenly faces an uncertain future.\n\nClimatologists and oceanographers are warning local lawmakers in exposed villages from Fairbourne in Wales to Germany's Halligen islands that new and potentially expensive challenges lie ahead as coastal flooding becomes more common and more damaging. Around half of the peninsula’s 8,800 homes stand on land less than 3 meters above sea level.\n\nEven under the very lowest scenarios for global greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2100, scientists expect sea level to rise between 28 and 55 centimeters. Under the highest emissions scenario, seas could rise by more than a meter. And projections from the European Environment Agency suggest that flooding events that currently come once a century to Skanör will occur six times more frequently by the end of the century.\n\nHard choices\n\nEuropean lawmakers aiming to hold back the sea generally look to the Netherlands, long the Continent’s gold standard in flood management.\n\nWith much of its territory below sea level, the country has already deployed a 3,700km string of flood defenses ranging from natural features like sand dunes to imposing feats of engineering like storm surge barriers.\n\nExperts say that as sea levels rise, a wider range of European leaders must now address similar challenges. But first, there's a more fundamental question: Should anything be done at all?\n\nIn Falsterbonäset, environmentalists had long pushed for little or no response to the rising flood threat, arguing that the area’s coastal meadows and beaches, home to many plants and animals, depended on their interaction with the sea for their existence.\n\nThe council for the county of Skåne, which includes Vellinge municipality, was also among those pushing back against building barriers through sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n\nSand dunes protecting the Swedish village of Skanör from the sea are expected to be breached more regularly over coming years | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\n“One of the big challenges, as the county council sees it, is finding space [for the barrier] without unacceptable intrusions into protected areas,” Maria Nitare, a water management official with the county council, said during a visit to Falsterbonäset.\n\nBut in 2014, Vellinge municipality decided to take a stand and began consultations for a plan to build a 20km long barrier of embankments, walls and dunes round the built-up parts of Falsterbonäset. The planned barrier was to be 3 meters high, relative to sea level.\n\nThe application was submitted in 2018 after discussions with a wide range of interested parties from local residents and business owners to oceanographers and climatologists.\n\nThe proposal was initially approved by planning authorities, but then, in a sign of what could be waiting for other Swedish municipalities facing the threat of flooding, the process stalled. There were objections from some that the barriers went too far and from others that they didn’t go far enough.\n\nOne particularly vocal group were local golf course owners, who have found to their consternation that they won’t be protected by the municipality's barriers.\n\nFalsterbonäset is home to several golf courses and is something of a national center for the sport. Visited on a recent weekday, the course in Ljunghusen was hosting a tournament for pairs of brothers to play against each other.\n\nClub manager Magnus Jivén described how in 2017, he watched in dismay as the sea crept closer to the front door of the clubhouse. To his relief, the building wasn’t flooded.\n\n“If you look at the Netherlands, they would build barriers out in the sea, but here the golf courses and the beaches aren’t being protected,” he said. “These places are some of the main reasons why people live here, so why not protect them as well as the houses.”\n\nOther objections have come from local residents who say the proposed embankments and walls will block their view of the sea as well as impinging on their privacy as people walking on the new embankments will be able to see into nearby gardens and houses.\n\n“The barrier is going to be right outside my fence,” Yvonne Lendrup, a Ljunghusen resident who has objected to the municipality plan, told national broadcaster SVT recently. “We’d really like to avoid this happening.”\n\nLjunghusen is seen as one of the most desirable places to live in Sweden. One house there recently sold for more than €5 million and on a recent weekday, two red Ferrari sports cars navigated the area’s narrow roads in quick succession.\n\nIn the early days of its flood barrier project in 2015, Vellinge Municipality estimated combined property values in Falsterbonästet at more than €5 billion and officials said prices have risen sharply since then.\n\nThe municipal council judged that if it did not provide a credible plan to protect the area over the coming decades, then residents and businesses could be expected to pull out as insurance premiums rocket and the risk of inundation intesifies.\n\nThe cost of the new flood defenses is expected to be around €19 million. Vellinge has applied to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency for funding as well as to the EU via its Life program, but has said it will cover any shortfall through its own budget.\n\nTest case\n\nFor the other 17 Swedish sites judged by the government as at risk of flooding — including parts of the capital Stockholm and second city Gothenburg, as well as smaller towns like Kristianstad — Vellinge is proving an interesting test case serving to highlight gaps in the national response to the threat of climate change.\n\nAs Vellinge worked to develop its plans for flood barriers, mayor Wutzler said she had seen “surprisingly little interest” from ministers and other parliamentarians in the capital Stockholm and called on them to engage more closely with coastal communities facing existential threats from higher seas.\n\nA first report from a government-appointed expert group said Sweden’s response to climate change must be integrated more closely with other elements of the nation’s civil defense.\n\n“We must shift the focus from problems to solutions and from planning to implementation,” the report published in February said. “The efforts that have been made so far have not been able to create the necessary changes in society.”\n\nEnvironmentalists worry that building flood barriers through coastal meadows around Sweden's Falsterbonäset peninsula will damage important habitats | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nIn June this year, the Swedish court of appeal responsible for environmental and land management ruled that construction of the barriers around Falsterbonäset could begin.\n\nWutzler said it was a relief and that construction of the first section of the barriers north of Skanör would begin within a year.\n\n“We are developing a solution so that we have an answer when we look ahead. Because when we look ahead, we see that the threat from flooding is only going to get worse,” she said.\n\nKarl Mathiesen contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of the Climate, Changed series.",

    "I don’t recognize Sweden anymore": "Jim Stenman is a Swedish-Ethiopian journalist. He has worked as a producer for CNN International in Europe and the Gulf, and reported for Reuters and the BBC World Service.\n\nAs Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson arrived in my childhood hometown of Eskilstuna recently, even she must have realized that Sweden was losing its war on gang violence.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the city had finally earned its title of “Little Chicago” — a term casually used during my teenage years, especially when describing rougher parts of town.\n\nThough I never took the analogy seriously, that day, one of those areas became the scene of sheer horror, when a woman and a young child were shot at a playground. Police have since linked the incident to gang crime, and thankfully, it didn’t result in any fatalities — both survived.\n\nWhile addressing the shooting, Sweden’s first female leader, who has been in office for less than a year, warned that criminal gangs now pose a threat for “anyone who happens to come in their way, even normal law-abiding citizens.” And she made a direct correlation between violence and a rise in the drug trade, which she vowed to have a national conversation about, and to crack down on crime by abandoning Sweden’s soft penal code.\n\nFor Andersson, talking tough on crime may be a necessity rather than a choice. Her center-left coalition government risks being voted out of office in the country’s general election tomorrow, as the vote takes place against a backdrop of a rising inflation and mounting fears over Russian aggression in the Baltic Sea.\n\nMany Swedes, as I do, feel the country’s heading in the wrong direction.\n\nA few months ago, three young men in neighboring Örebro were shot dead over the span of eight days, part of a wave of gang violence spreading across Sweden. And while I never expected the country to turn into a gangster’s paradise, it’s always been obvious to me that our approach to integration has been a ticking time bomb.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, I witnessed firsthand just how difficult it can be to become part of mainstream Swedish society. My mother, an Ethiopian refugee, certainly ticked all the “right” boxes, such as marrying a local and accepting whatever jobs came her way.\n\nStill, she was never fully accepted as Swedish, despite having a near perfect command of the language and being clearly embedded within the culture.\n\nIt seemed to me that people like her faced an element of otherness that was difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Moreover, many of my friends, some of whom were born to parents from the Middle East, chose not to identity as Swedish, despite being raised in the country.\n\nSweden, which had a largely homogenous population in the past, has faced serious challenges in welcoming non-European immigrants into its society. And I believe this may partly explain the difficult situation facing the country today.\n\nSweden experienced labor-based immigration in the late 1960s. And government data shows significant migrant arrivals from Iran in the late 1980s and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Immigration numbers then reached an all-time high in 2016, as the country, alongside Germany, opted for a largely open-border policy when it came to Syrian refugees.\n\nAs of 2021, Sweden had over 196,000 Syrian-born residents — a significant number for a country with a population of about 10 million. The total number of foreign-born people has rapidly increased over the last two decades, now amounting to 20 percent of the overall population. And though Syrians make up the largest group of immigrants, those born in Iraq and Finland also contribute to Sweden’s foreign-born population.\n\nPersonally, I don’t buy into the extreme belief held by some Swedes that immigrants largely come to our country to exploit its generous welfare system. But according to the European Commission, as things stand, the unemployment rate among foreign-born residents is more than four times that of native Swedes. It only stands to reason this breeds exclusion.\n\nAnd it’s perhaps not surprising that 2022 is on track to become the worst year on record for violence, with nearly 50 deadly shootings so far — a reality that’s proving a major headache for Andersson’s center-left coalition government, which has been in power since 2014. And her own Social Democratic party has overseen years, if not decades, of failed integration policy under previous prime ministers.\n\nOffering sanctuary to those fleeing war is always the right thing to do, but Sweden’s experiment with multiculturalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse since 2016.\n\nI’m not suggesting Syrians, or any other migrant group, should be held responsible for the rise in gang crime. It’s particularly worth highlighting that the Swedish integration model was failing long before their arrival, even causing some naturalized Swedes, including others with Middle Eastern roots, to support the far right in bid to limit further immigration.\n\nBut now, the country’s second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, is on a mission to restore what they perceive to be “traditional Swedish values.” Historically locked out of power due to other parties’ unwillingness to partner with them, they are projected to secure about 20 percent of the votes tomorrow, and they may be on track to play a key role in a possible center-right coalition that could end up ruling the country for the next four years.\n\nThis would mark their first time in government, and it would certainly prove a game-changer for the country. The party’s priorities include ending segregated neighborhoods, curbing organized crime and limiting immigration.\n\nThough I may morally disagree with closing our borders to those in need, perhaps it’s the best way to recalibrate — at least temporarily — after decades of failed policies.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to turn back the clock on immigration, Sweden must find a way to solve its integration problem before it’s too late. And the only way to achieve this is by recognizing present-day Sweden for what it really is — a multicultural society.\n\nWhile the far right is effectively pitching to make “Sweden Great Again,” I’m convinced we need to forge a more inclusive national identity that recognizes the demographic changes of recent decades, while also embracing the unique dual heritages now present throughout our country.\n\nIt is only by recognizing who we are that it’s possible to create a society that doesn’t breed exclusion or worse, crime.",
    "Sweden records deadliest gun violence year: police": "STOCKHOLM, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight people have been shot dead so far in Sweden this year, making 2022 the deadliest year the country has seen since 2016, the Swedish Police Authority said on Friday.\n\nThe previous annual record was set in 2020, when 47 people died of gun-related injuries.\n\nIn recent years, most fatal shootings occurred in the Stockholm region. The Police Authority told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter (DN) in August that the situation was \"particularly serious, especially in Stockholm, because many of the most serious criminal conflicts take place there.\" The authority said it was working \"to increase its preparedness to prevent gross violence and gang crime.\"\n\n\"Despite the fact that we have made the largest investment in history in law enforcement and have more police officers than ever before, and despite record numbers of criminals being arrested and sentenced to long prison terms, the shootings continue,\" Minister for Justice and Home Affairs Morgan Johansson said. \"This is because for every perpetrator arrested, there is at least one other who is ready to fill the shoes that become empty.\"\n\nA report presented by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention last spring showed that Sweden was the only one among 22 compared countries in Europe where the trend of fatal shootings was on a steady increase.\n\nThe rise in fatal shootings in Sweden began in the mid-2000s, but the increase gained new momentum in 2013 and has since continued.\n\nAccording to the report, eight out of ten fatal shootings in Sweden took place in a gang environment. The Police Authority identified 61 areas in the country that were \"particularly vulnerable\" to street crime and drug trafficking.\n\nCrime and gun violence topped the agenda in Sweden's recent general elections, and politicians from all major parties vowed to tackle the soaring crime levels. The elections saw the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats become the country's second largest party with more than 20 percent of popular support. ■",

The match was played at Girona in Spain.\n\nIt was the first match of the exposure tour for the Indian girls ahead of the age-group showpiece, which India is hosting in October-November. Sudha Tirkey (62′) scored the only goal for India after Sweden U-17 girls took a comfortable 3-0 lead through Ida Gramfors (44′) Sara Frigren (52′) and Selma Astrom (54′). India, however, looked promising at the start as they competed on equal terms in an intense midfield battle that saw winger Anita Kumari get an early shot at the rival goal, which was saved.\n\nMinutes later, Nitu Linda tried her luck to take a shot from the edge of the Swedish penalty area, but was blocked.

    "Heart Aerospace To Build Electric Aircraft Campus In Gothenburg, Sweden": "Gothenburg’s Säve airport will soon be home to an electric aircraft production and test flight ... [+] center. Heart Aerospace\n\nCommercial electric aviation took a big step closer to reality this week with the announcement of a new industry campus at Säve airport, a secondary airport just outside Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nDriven by investment from Heart Aerospace, the campus named ‘Northern Runway’ will include offices, production and test flight facilities for electric aircraft. The first phase should be complete by 2024, with test flights beginning two years later.\n\nInterest in electric aviation is taking off\n\nHeart Aerospace has announced several electric aircraft designs in recent years and has received investment, letters of intent and letters of support from major airlines including Air Canada and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS).\n\nCurrently in the spotlight is the 30-seat ES-30. With an all-electric range of 200km (124 miles) and a hybrid range of 400km (248 miles), it has attracted interest from airlines operating in markets with a big demand for regional aviation.\n\nAir Canada has committed to buying 30 of the Heart Aerospace ES-30 electric aircraft. Heart Aerospace\n\nAir Canada likes the concept so much it has invested $5 million into the company and placed a purchase order for 30 of the new ES-30 aircraft. SAS has also confirmed its interest in the model.\n\nFounder and CEO Anders Forslund said the new project is about much more than developing one aircraft: “We have a plan and it’s not just to build a new electric airplane, but a whole new industry. With Northern Runway we will make electric air travel a reality and preserve flying for future generations.”\n\nA new industry for Gothenburg\n\nHeart’s choice of Sweden’s second biggest city for its new campus is no surprise as the company is already based there. The Northern Runway concept will form part of a wider development area for sustainable logistics and electric mobility named Gateway Säve.\n\nHeart COO Sofia Graflund said the city has “distinguished itself” in the emerging area of electrification, pointing out the world-class research facilities in battery technology and electrification. Gothenburg is also widely known in city planning circles as one of the world’s most sustainable cities.\n\nThe company expects its new facility to stimulate new jobs and plans on growing from 130 employees today to approximately 500 by 2025.",

    "Chair of NATO Military Committee visits Sweden": "From 31 August to 1 September 2022, the Chair of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, visited Sweden at the invitation of its Supreme Commander, General Micael Bydén. The purpose of the visit was to discuss the cooperation between Sweden and NATO during the accession process and to gain more insights into Sweden’s military capabilities.\n\nThe Chair of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer started his official visit by meeting the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr Robert Rydberg, and the State Secretary of Defence, Mr Jan-Olof Lind. The discussions focused on the current security environment and the respective plans implemented to safeguard Allied and national territory as well as ongoing contributions to shared security. Admiral Bauer added that “Sweden and Finland’s membership in NATO will enable closer Baltic and Nordic defence cooperation; strengthen the Alliance’s presence in the High North and boost transatlantic security”.\n\nAccompanied by General Bydén and the Deputy Chief Joint Operations, Major General Wikman, Admiral Bauer travelled to Northern Finland, where he was able to observe exercise Vigilant Knife. Upon arrival, the Admiral was greeted by General Timo Kivinen, the Finnish Chief of Defence. On just a few days’ notice, hundreds of Swedish troops journeyed to Northern Finland where they were placed under Finnish command and trained with Finnish and British troops. The goal was to sustain immediate readiness and capability for combined operating on demanding missions. All troops showed that they are highly capable of working together under the conditions prevalent in Northern Finland. Admiral Bauer: “Never before have Sweden and Finland exercised together at such extremely short notice. What impressed me most is the vigour, passion, professionalism and effectiveness of their armed forces. NATO Allies are proud to have Finland and Sweden as their closest operational partners. And we hope to welcome them soon to our Alliance.”\n\nOn the second day, Admiral Bauer met the Commander of the Norrbotten Air Force Wing, Colonel Edström, who briefed him on ongoing air activities, including rapid response units and the monitoring and protection of Swedish airspace. “The Swedish Air Force has participated in NATO quick reaction alert exercises for over a decade. On a weekly basis, Swedish fighters fly defensive air drills with NATO fighters to contribute to the security and stability over Europe, the Baltic Sea Region and the High North”, highlighted the Admiral.\n\nAdmiral Bauer then discussed the accession process with the Head of the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters Strategic Planning Group NATO, Major General Thomas Nilsson, and the Head of Policy and Plans Department, Major General Lena Persson Herlitz.\n\nIn a joint press conference with Swedish Chief of Defence, General Micael Bydén, Admiral Bauer addressed the ongoing accession protocol for Sweden to join NATO: “Sweden is one of NATO’s closest partners. We have been working together to strengthen our shared security, we share the same values and we have high interoperability. In parallel to the accession and ratification process, the preparations military integration process have also started.

    "‘People don’t want to hear about it’: how the pandemic shaped Sweden’s politics": "In the Stockholm neighbourhood of Tensta, the pandemic has left many feeling hopeless and disenfranchised, says Fatuma Mohamed.\n\nWhile much of Sweden – including politicians – appear to have forgotten all about Covid, the health communicator and longtime resident said that many in the area are still grappling with its impact.\n\nAlthough people had been advised by authorities to work from home, many in Tensta, with its high refugee population, had no choice but to go out because of the nature of their jobs.\n\n“They didn’t have any possibility to stay at home,” said Mohamed, sitting outside Tensta Konsthall, a contemporary arts centre, where people were arriving for a coffee meet-up.\n\nTwo and a half years after the introduction of the “Swedish strategy”– the Scandinavian country’s divergent pandemic response, which kept schools open and eschewed lockdowns – the results are mixed.\n\nMental health and children’s learning appear to have been less affected than they might have been, although 2.57m infections were recorded in the population of just over 10 million and in excess of 19,900 died, with stark inequality exposed in the process.\n\nIn comparison, Norway, with a little over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.46m cases and nearly 4,000 deaths; while Finland, also with just over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.27m cases and nearly 5,700 deaths.\n\nFatuma Mohamed in Tensta, Stockholm. Photograph: Miranda Bryant/The Observer\n\nAn independent commission into the handling of the pandemic, the findings of which were published earlier this year, found that while the choice of path for disease prevention and control was “fundamentally correct”, the measures “were too few and should have come sooner”. The government, it said, should have taken control of all aspects of crisis management from the start and had relied too heavily on its public health agency, Folkhälsomyndigheten.\n\nAnd yet, as Sweden prepares to go to the polls on 11 September, in the first election since these life or death decisions were made, it is almost as if Covid never happened. Left- and right-leaning party leaders, who are in a tight race, are focusing on crime, immigration and energy prices but not Covid.\n\nFor many, this has highlighted the gulf between the living conditions of Sweden’s different communities. In Tensta, some groups of up to 10 people live in two-room flats, said Mohamed, 43, who has three daughters,\n\n“But the ‘Swedish’,” she said, miming inverted commas with her hands, “they live, maybe two or three people in eight, seven or four rooms, maybe. So they had the opportunity to have social distance.\n\n“It is not just a health problem,” she added. “This is a political problem.” Services such as banks, dentists and job centres had vanished from the area, she claimed, and many people were unemployed, splitting society into “parallel communities”.\n\n“It’s not good to have different lives in the same country. We are all the same people, we are all Swedish citizens, so we should have the same opportunity.”\n\nExperiences of the pandemic have deepened distrust of government and social services, she said. Mohamed isn’t sure how this will affect people’s votes in the election, but the rightwing anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats have become the second biggest party in the polls after Magdalena Andersson’s incumbent Social Democrats. The left, centre and green parties are saying the right things, Mohamed said, but she will be watching to see whether their words are turned into action.\n\nJimmie Åkesson (third from right), Sweden Democrats leader, visiting Linköping in April after riots sparked by a far-right threat to burn the Qur’an. Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/Shutterstock\n\n“I don’t think the people who live in this area have any trust for any party because we don’t have a good life,” she said. “Definitely, they don’t like to vote Sweden Democrats but, for the other parties, interest is not high because they think it’s the same: ‘If I vote or not vote, the result will be the same.’ Most don’t have jobs, we live cramped, we don’t have the same opportunities.”\n\nAnother Tensta resident, Liban Warsame, whose 19-year-old son was murdered in December 2020, said most people in the area felt left out of Swedish society, and that the pandemic had had a huge impact on the community. “Many older people from Somalia died because of the pandemic. In the election, we’re going to vote and we’re going to take our responsibility,” he said.\n\nHealth experts say they are disappointed by the lack of attention the pandemic is receiving and fear that lessons will not be learned from the vulnerabilities it exposed in Swedish society, especially its impact on immigrants and the elderly. Göran Stiernstedt, a member of Sweden’s coronavirus commission and associate professor of infectious disease at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute, said: “It really exposed that the risk for people born outside Europe was much greater than those born in Sweden.” The impact on the elderly was also severe, he added, including lack of medical care in nursing homes and staff left alone with no doctors.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nothing had been done to fix the issue, he felt, despite investigations. “You could expect that this would have been a great thing now in the election, but you don’t hear a single word about that.”\n\nThe fact that the Corona Commission’s report was published the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not help it gain momentum, but Stiernstedt believes there is also a psychological explanation for the silence on Covid’s impact. “People don’t want to hear about it. They want to live their normal life. And when you walk today, it’s like 2019, actually, and that’s natural. I think it’s related to human nature.”\n\nWhile Emma Frans, a researcher and epidemiologist at Karolinska Institute, is surprised by the silence around Covid in the election, she\n\nsaid: “People have had thoughts about how do we look at our elderly. And also maybe understanding how this type of health crisis affects people differently depending on who they are, their position in society and what means they have.”\n\nThe pandemic had also highlighted “outdated” perceptions of what a “traditional Swedish home” looked like, she said. “And there were problems with not getting information out to people who are not speaking or reading in Swedish.”\n\nThrough the public health agency, which was responsible for responding to the pandemic, politicians had had a “free pass” when it came to Covid deaths, said Frans. The government “hid” behind Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s former state epidemiologist, she added.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an influential independent MP. Photograph: Getty\n\nAt the Stockholm HQ of Folkhälsomyndigheten, Karin Tegmark Wisell, who became its head last November, stands by most of the major decisions made during the pandemic – including keeping schools open and not making face masks mandatory. But, she said, Covid had highlighted ongoing health inequalities, especially among immigrants, more of whom ended up in intensive care.\n\nThese problems, she said, could not be solved by a public health agency alone and needed government intervention; she said she would like to see the matter addressed more in the election. “From my perspective, that is the most important issue,” she said.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an independent politician who has played a pivotal role in the power balance of the current government, said parties weren’t criticising the pandemic response because they were part of the decision-making process. “Each of them had opportunity to say something, to do something – that is why it is passed, even if it is not over. But on class, society and employment, a lot of people still don’t feel good psychologically.”",

That could entail long-term costs for the economy.\n\n\"There is a risk that there will be a compensation economy rather than a focus on long-term structural reform,\" said Sven-Olov Daunfeldt, chief economist at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSwedes are among Europe's most well-off. The welfare system - though much less generous than it used to be - means poverty rates are well below the European average. But in recent decades, the gap between rich and poor has been growing, leaving many vulnerable to inflation that is currently at around 8%.\n\nEva Lindman Marko, a 59-year-old educational psychologist, said she got a monthly electricity bill for over 19,000 Swedish crowns ($1,765) in January - two or three times what she pays in a normal winter.\n\nPrices could be even higher this coming season - not least because of problems at the Ringhals nuclear plant.\n\nSweden's electricity comes mainly from hydro-power, nuclear and wind, with only a tiny fraction from gas. But with prices set on international markets, it has not escaped the continent-wide effects of the war in Ukraine on energy prices.\n\n\"A rise of over 100% feels brutal in itself. But the cost may be three or four times as high,\" Lindman Marko said, adding that this winter she plans to lower the thermostat at home, wear thermal clothes and go to the sauna at a local swimming pool to warm up.\n\n\"Clearly the more worried you are over, for example electricity prices, the more it will affect how you vote,\" she said.\n\nPetrol and food prices have also soared. The cost of butter is up by around 25%, meat 24% and cheese around 22% this year, according to consumer price comparison site Matpriskollen.\n\nStockholm's Stadsmission, a non-profit organization, said it had seen its membership of its Matmissionen subsidized foodshops nearly double in the first half of the year.\n\n\"It's a broad group - maybe you are a pensioner, maybe you are unemployed or perhaps have not lived for a long time in Sweden,\" said Johan Rindevall, who heads up the Matmissionen shops.\n\n\"Forty percent of our new members this year have been families with children.\"\n\nMatmissionen sells food donated by major chains to members with monthly incomes below 11,200 crowns at around 30% of the prices seen in high-street shops.\n\nPROMISES, PROMISES\n\nThe two major political blocs are rushing out promises to help consumers fight the effects of inflation.\n\nPrime Minister Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrat government has promised up to 90 billion Swedish crowns ($8.36 billion) in subsidies to ease the pain of rising electricity bills for households and businesses, on top of billions in subsidies paid last winter. read more\n\nThe Moderates, the leading centre-right opposition party, have promised income tax cuts and lower fuel prices, which they say would mean 24,000 crowns extra for working families each year.\n\nThey intend to pay for measures by cutting back on overseas aid and benefits like unemployment and sickness insurance.\n\nAs a longer term solution to the energy crisis, the centre-right plans loan guarantees of up to 400 billion crowns to support building new nuclear power stations. Like Germany, Sweden has been shutting reactors in recent years.\n\nThe Left Party, loosely part of the centre-left bloc, wants to halt electricity exports.\n\nOpinion polls don't give a clear answer as to which policy promises have caught voters' eyes, but the ruling Social Democrats have at least avoided blame for the gloomy economic outlook.\n\nThe two main blocs are running neck-and-neck though the Social Democrats are easily the largest party. read more\n\nTOUGH CHOICES\n\nWhoever wins may find it hard to live up to all their promises.\n\nThe NIER, a government think-tank, reckons the next administration will have around 120 billion crowns to play with in terms of extra spending.\n\nA chunk of that is already earmarked for defence spending as Sweden raises its allocation to 2% of GDP from the current 1% to support its bid to join NATO, and for other measures like boosting healthcare and employing more police to deal with gang crime. read more\n\nAt the same time, GDP growth is expected to slow to around 0.4% next year, according to a government forecast, and even grind to a halt completely if inflation worsens and rates rise more than currently expected. read more\n\nIncreasing public debt would \"add fuel to inflation and further raise interest rates and could also threaten public finances, threaten welfare and pensions,\" Finance Minister Mikael Damberg warned last month.\n\nDiverting cash to support households will leave less for structural reforms needed to support the shift to a \"green\" economy, to rebuild the welfare state and to meet a skills shortage in the labour market.\n\nThe Social Democrats' plan to subsidize energy bills will be paid from a fund that is supposed to be used, in part, for expanding transmission capacity - one of the major causes of record domestic electricity prices in Sweden.\n\nPlans by the right to decrease the amount of biofuel in petrol and diesel, making them cheaper, will also make it harder to reach the country's target of zero net emissions by 2045.\n\nIt is also uncertain which policies will get approval from the next parliament, given that even within the centre-left and right blocs there is much disagreement about what to do and how to pay for it.\n\n\"No responsible politician can say that they will compensate for every price rise,\" Andersson said last month.\n\n($1 = 10.7646 Swedish crowns)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Simon Johnson Editing by Frances Kerry\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Europa Universalis 4: Lions Of The North - Getting Started As Sweden": "Sweden is a powerful military nation in Europa Universalis 4, but first they need to break free from Danish rule.\n\nSweden is a powerful nation in Europa Universalis 4, but starts the game hampered by their status as a junior partner under Denmark. Any Swedish campaign starts by gaining independence, after which you can work toward establishing yourself as the premier power of Northern Europe and beyond.\n\nRelated: Europa Universalis 4: Getting Started As Denmark\n\nGaining independence is critical, so this guide will help you with the opening moves if you choose to play as Sweden. EU4's publisher, Paradox, is a Swedish company, so they've given their homeland lots of love. Under your guidance, the Swedish Empire could become mightier in-game than it was in real life!\n\nSweden's Strengths\n\nOnce it gets going, Sweden is a military power first and foremost. Their infantry are some of the best in the game, and once their National Ideas are all unlocked they get some exceptional manpower bonuses as well. In the mid-to-late game, Sweden also excels at maintaining their Stability, particularly through maximizing their Absolutism.\n\nSweden's starting territory doesn't have provinces as well-developed as Demark, but has much more land overall with plenty of the Baltic coastline and a land route into Finland. This is useful for expanding eastward once you gain independence, as you likely won't be able to match Denmark at sea but should have little trouble facing any foes on land.\n\nLastly, Sweden gets several events and missions that make it much easier to gain independence from Denmark. With just a bit of preparation you should be able to break free from the Kalmar Union with ease.\n\nRelated: Europa Universalis 4: Complete Guide To The Burgundian Inheritance Event\n\nHow To Declare Independence From Denmark As Sweden\n\nIt's best to complete the four preparatory missions that Sweden has before declaring war on Denmark. To do this, you'll need money, troops, and allies.\n\nYou can get a little extra money to start by increasing the Base Tax of Stockholm and the Production of Dalaskogen. Dalaskogen has the Falun Copper Mines, which allow it to produce more goods and put more money in your coffers. Hang onto your Military Power for now, as you'll want to research the Pike Square as soon as possible.Once the starting month has ended, check Denmark's diplomatic status. They'll have selected three nations as their enemies; usually this will include England, Poland, and/or Lithuania, but Scotland, Novgorod, and Burgundy are also options. Choose Denmark's two most powerful rivals and send diplomats to improve relations with them.\n\nThe Support Of The Estates\n\nNext, you need to get the Estates ready for war. To complete the Support From The Estates mission, at least two Estates need to have three or more privileges each. When the mission is completed, all qualifying estates will offer to help with the independence effort, but you can only choose one offer to accept:\n\nEstate Recommended Privileges Support Event Offer Clergy Oversight By The Clergy\n\nChurch Sanctuaries\n\nReligious Diplomats 200 Papal Influence.\n\nCardinal seat in Stockholm. Nobility Aristocratic Counselors\n\nRight Of Counsel\n\nMonopoly On Mining And Smelting Level 2 Commandant becomes available to hire at one-fourth the normal cost. Burghers Commercial Advisory Board\n\nIndebted To The Burghers\n\nFree Enterprise Ten free Galleys start construction, and are finished in a tenth the usual time.\n\nIf you take the Clergy's offer, you can spend the Papal Influence to get free Stability, army morale, and a tax boost.\n\nIf you take the Nobility's offer, you'll have the best possible advisor to hire and trigger Vasa's appearance (see below).\n\nIf you take the Burgers' offer, you'll be able to match or exceed Denmark's naval power, robbing them of their primary advantage.\n\nWhichever you choose, you'll be considered in debt to the selected Estate until you complete several tasks for them in the future. Until that's done, you'll suffer a minor penalty to Legitimacy and the Estate's base loyalty will be lower.\n\nOf course, you can always reject all three offers for a quick boost of twenty Prestige!\n\nFinal Preparations\n\nAs soon as you have enough money and the Aristocratic Counselors privilege is in place, hire a military advisor. Any will do, and as soon as you've done so the mission Military Advice can be completed. This automatically recruits Johan Vasa as a general, for free. As a result, you don't need to spend Military Power recruiting a general for your army. Assign Vasa to your army and drill them until you're ready to declare war.\n\nWhen your Liberty Desire reaches one hundred percent (which should be easy if you've completed all of the above steps), you can finish the Swedish Allies mission. This lets you choose between forcing Denmark's rivals to support your war or getting military buffs and an additional reward for going it alone. If you've already secured promises of aid, force the rivals to join you as well. You'll only get the benefit of going it alone if you win the war with no allies whatsoever.\n\nIf you're lucky, it's possible that Pretender Rebels will spawn in Sweden. If this happens, move your army to Finland and let the rebels take your capital. You'll suffer economically while your important provinces are in rebel hands, but when the rebels take over the country they'll automatically break you free from Denmark, skipping the independence war entirely!\n\nRelated: Europa Universalis 4: The Best Idea Groups\n\nHow To Win The Swedish War Of Independence\n\nIndependence wars put the onus on the former overlord to retake the rebel capital. That means that you're ultimately fighting a defensive war. Keep Denmark and their allies out of Stockholm, and you can eventually claim victory.\n\nSweden has great defensive terrain and fairly harsh winters; declare independence in the autumn so that by the time the Danish army and their allies arrive they'll take extra attrition from the snow. If you can cath Denmark at a time when their allies are otherwise occupied, so much the better!\n\nAs long as you've completed all four preparatory missions, you'll be able to complete the Declare Independence mission as soon as you start the war. This refunds the Stability that you lose from standing up to your liege.\n\nBefore declaring war, dock all your ships unless you took the Burghers' offer to build a fleet. Your navy will be easy pickings for the Danes otherwise, resulting in some early losses.\n\nDenmark will usually attempt to march from the south, slowly making their way toward Stockholm while Norway waits just across the border to offer combat support as needed. Let them suffer attrition until their first siege reaches a positive success chance, then attack with your full army led by Vasa to drive them off. In the meantime, watch the coastline and the eastern border for any sneaky attacks from Denmark's allies. If England attempts to make landfall, be sure your troops are there to meet them to capitalize on disembarking penalties.\n\nUnless you opted to go it alone, rely on your allies to fight off large enemy armies. A prolonged war is to your benefit, so don't be afraid to lose a fort or two that can be retaken if it means forcing more attrition and meeting the enemy on more advantageous terms.\n\nIf you're in a position to go on the offensive, make the occupation of Skaneland a priority. These four provinces directly to your south will make an excellent addition to your empire if you take them as war concessions, and doing so lets you complete a mission as soon as they become Swedish cores.\n\nNext: Europa Universalis 4: Army Composition Guide",
    "Finns, Swedes Overwhelmingly Back NATO, Poll Shows": "A new Gallup Poll released Friday confirms overwhelming support among Finns and Swedes for their nations' expected accession to NATO, while their views toward Russian leadership have turned \"profoundly negative\" as the war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nThe survey found that 81% of Finns and 74% of Swedes approve of the alliance’s leadership, while their approval of Russian leadership dipped to a miserly 6% in Finland and 2% in Sweden.\n\nIn releasing the survey, Gallup noted that both countries had been cautioned by Russia against pursuing membership in the alliance. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said there would be serious consequences if its two Nordic neighbors were to take that step.\n\nThose threats proved to be largely empty, observers have noted. But Moscow has long warned against NATO expansion and cited Ukraine’s NATO ambitions as one of the reasons for launching an invasion into that country.\n\nThe latest Gallup report also included figures on support for U.S. leadership among Finns and Swedes. It found that 62% of Finns and 40% of Swedes approve of U.S. leadership.\n\nThose figures reflect a rise of positive sentiment toward the U.S. in Finland from a year ago but a drop in such sentiments in Sweden. In 2021, the approval for U.S. leadership among the Finns, according to a Gallup Poll, was 52%, 10 percentage points lower than this year.\n\nIn Sweden, however, approval of U.S. leadership has dropped from 52% in 2021 to the current 40%. Gallup did not suggest a reason for the drop.\n\nRJ Reinhart, a U.S.-based Gallup analyst and author of the report, told VOA in a phone interview that Scandinavian countries’ approval of U.S. leadership has often fluctuated.\n\nHe noted both in the report and in the interview with VOA that the outcome of the war in Ukraine will likely affect opinions in Finland and Sweden of NATO’s leadership, while noting the timeline, trajectory and outcome of the war are hard to pinpoint.\n\nWhat is clear is the finding that Finns’ views of Russian leadership are “nearly universally negative,” with a mere 6% of Finns expressing support for Russian leadership and 92% thinking otherwise.\n\nThe report noted that Finns’ disapproval of Russia’s leadership dropped to a similarly low level in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nIn Sweden, Russia’s leadership has not enjoyed more than 9% approval for as long as Gallup has been asking the question, the report said. The current approval stands at a mere 2%, with 96% disapproving.\n\n“It is likely that both countries are largely positive about NATO as they see membership as a potential security guarantor against potential threats from Russia,” the report’s author wrote.\n\nFinland and Sweden simultaneously submitted their applications for NATO membership May 18, just months after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The applications followed “thorough debates across their whole societies and with large parliamentary majorities supporting the decision,” NATO has noted.\n\nThe two countries were invited to attend the NATO Madrid Summit held the following month in the Spanish capital. Accession protocols were inked July 5 after accession talks had been completed. Those protocols must be ratified by every member of NATO before the two countries can become official members.\n\nThe parliaments of Greece and Spain ratified the membership bids Thursday and Portugal’s parliament followed suit Friday leaving only three NATO members still needing to give their approval. Those three are Hungary, Slovakia and Turkey.",
    "European Voters Are Rejecting Globalism From Italy To Sweden": "Image Credit Giorgia Meloni/YouTube\n\nSeveral ruling, pro-globalist European coalitions lost control of their nations’ respective governments in elections over the past several weeks, marking a major victory for some of the continent’s more right-of-center political parties.\n\nOn Sunday, Italian voters elected their most conservative government in decades, putting Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy Party, on track to become the nation’s first female prime minister.\n\n“Partial results place the Brothers of Italy on 26 per cent, making it the leading party, with Meloni’s allies Matteo Salvini, 49, the leader of the League, on 9 per cent and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia on 8 per cent,” The Times, a U.K.-based outlet, reported. “The coalition’s combined share of more than 40 per cent is likely to translate into majorities in both houses of parliament thanks to electoral law, which benefits party alliances.”\n\nWhile speaking with a crowd of supporters in Rome, Meloni noted that the election results demonstrate that Italians “want a centre-right government led by Brothers of Italy” and that her party will govern “for all with the aim of uniting [the] country.”\n\n“The situation Italy and the EU head for is particularly complex and needs the contribution of all of us, requiring a serene atmosphere with reciprocal co-operation,” she said. “The biggest ambition we have in life is for Italians to be proud again of being Italian, of unfurling the tri-coloured flag.”\n\nThroughout the election cycle, Meloni campaigned on the slogan, “God, homeland, and family,” and has been a staunch defender of the Christian, nuclear family.\n\nThis is Italy’s new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\n\n\nI’ve never heard any politician so perfectly explain what we’re up against and why we fight.\n\n\n\nWhen you watch this video, you’ll quickly realize why the establishment is afraid of her.\n\npic.twitter.com/CswR8o3mjg — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 26, 2022\n\nIn predictable fashion, America’s corporate media has gone into overdrive to label Meloni and Italy’s new governing coalition as “far-right” and even “fascistic.” (An NBC News write-up of Meloni’s anticipated victory used some version of the term “fascism” 16 times.)\n\n“Italy election results set up first far-right government since [Benito] Mussolini,” a headline from The Washington Post read.\n\n“Far-right leader Giorgia Meloni on course to win power in Italy,” another from CNBC reads.\n\nMeloni and her party’s success in Italy is not the only instance of European voters rejecting failed globalist policies at the ballot box this year. Earlier this month, Sweden’s populist right-wing leader declared victory in the country’s nationwide elections, and leftist Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson resigned from office.\n\n“Populist Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson declared victory for the four-party bloc,” the Associated Press reported. “He said his party would be ‘a constructive and driving force’ in the work of rebuilding safety in Sweden.

The vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was high and stable prior to Omicron, but it also declined after Omicron.\n\nStudy: Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines Over 13 Months Covering the Period of the Emergence of the Omicron Variant in the Swedish Population. Image Credit: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock\n\nBackground\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), affected millions of individuals globally and warranted rapid vaccine development and deployment after its outbreak. Hence, adequate clinical trials could not be conducted to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the rapidly evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the newly developed and approved vaccines.\n\nThe study\n\nThis study aimed to estimate the time-dependent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the rate of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care units (ICUs), and fatality over 13 months after two doses of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThe study compared the time-dependent pattern of VE pre- and post-emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, differences in the VE were noted based on gender, age, and vaccine type.\n\nThe study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2022 in Sweden among populations eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. In this country, vaccination of the elderly started on 27 December 2020; the younger population was vaccinated in 2021 and 2022, during which the campaign reached a larger part of the population. The cohort comprised individuals above 12 years of age. The Swedish register data were used for estimating COVID-19 VE with lapsing time and before and after the Omicron emergence – in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease outcomes.\n\nResults\n\nIn the cohort of 9,153,456 individuals, 85% were vaccinated with a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 82% with two doses of vaccine, 45% with at least three doses of vaccine, and 15% were unvaccinated. The most vaccinated individuals (86%) were 65 or older. Most people received either mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 BioNTech, Pfizer ) vaccine. A small percentage (8%) of the study population were vaccinated twice with the AZD1222 (Oxford, AstraZeneca) vaccine.\n\nOn average, the time gap between the first two doses was seven weeks (ten weeks for AZD1222), and between the second and third doses was 28 weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222).\n\nDuring the study period, 22% of the study population were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for the first time. There were 0.9% hospitalizations, while 0.1% required ICU admission. The fatality rate was 0.2%. The VE post second dose peaked after the third week, rapidly dropping between weeks 14-17. However, the VE seemed negligible from week 18.\n\nVE among hospitalized individuals peaked at 90% in the fifth and sixth week while maintaining up to 82% from week one to 25. Meanwhile, VE after the second dose was higher and lasted longer.\n\nAfter the first dose, the acquired immunity against COVID-19 was comparatively lower, the peak VE against COVID-19 infection was less than 50%, and the vaccine became ineffective from week 30. A transient decline in VE was documented after the first vaccination at week two, relative to week one, which peaked in the following weeks. However, the VE remained below 80%.\n\nThe Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 caused the speediest fall in VE. This led to a major disparity between the pre-and post-Omicron VEs. The VE mostly remained above 85% before Omicron emergence; however, it rapidly decreased after an Omicron infection episode and remained low. Vaccinated individuals who received two doses of COVID-19 failed to remain protected against Omicron within 14 weeks after the second dose.\n\nSimilar disparities were recorded among the hospitalized groups, although the differences were minor compared to those among individuals who sustained Omicron infection. Pre-Omicron period VE against hospitalization was durable and stable – above 85%. The post-Omicron infection VE sustained at 80% until the 25th week and decreased with time. Yet, limited protection against hospitalization persisted throughout the study period.\n\nAge differences did not have much of an effect on the overall VE pattern. Of note, the VE against infection was relatively higher in individuals above 60. In addition, females expressed greater VE than males.\n\nFurthermore, mRNA vaccines had higher VE against infection compared to AZD1222. While VE against hospitalization was comparable with all the three vaccines––all of which had a higher initial VE––which decreased rapidly for AZD1222.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe gradual waning of COVID-19 VE with time warrants widespread acceptance of booster doses of the vaccines. Therefore, effective measures to encourage people for booster doses should be undertaken for enhanced population level protection against COVID-19.\n\n*Important notice\n\nPreprints with The Lancet publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.",

    "Sweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact:\n\nAdam McGibbon, adam.mcgibbon [at] priceofoil.org\n\nSweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment\n\nAt the COP26 United Nations Climate Conference in Glasgow, 39 countries and institutions signed up to the Glasgow Statement, committing themselves to ending “new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” The initiative has the potential to shift $39 billion a year out of fossil fuel projects and into clean energy if countries keep their promises.\n\nAs the deadline for implementing the Statement looms, the Swedish export credit agencies, SEK and EKN, have released an updated policy. A previously-released policy aligned Swedfund – the Swedish development finance institution – with the Glasgow Statement.\n\nSEK and EKN’s new policy ends almost all support to fossil fuels by 31st December 2022, with some limited exemptions:\n\nGas-fired power plants, new oil or gas extraction and oil refineries will still be supported if the project / company “has documented and realistic transition plans in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree target, e.g. equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or equivalent emissions reduction technologies” OR if “The transaction refers to substantial environmental or safety improvement measures while no expansion of the oil or gas operation.”\n\nUntil 31st December 2022, gas-fired power plants can be supported in “countries with large development needs or in countries where the exporter or buyer can show that the project is part of reconstruction after war or conflict.”\n\nEssentially, this means that the Swedish policy, although an improvement, does not rule out support for oil exploration and extraction as clearly as the best-practice UK and Denmark policies. However, in practice, if Sweden’s requirement for a 1.5°C transition plan is implemented with integrity and good faith, this should mean that no new guarantees can be issued for such projects. According to the International Energy Agency, to maintain a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, there can be no investments in new coal, oil or gas fields. Other research shows that on top of ending investments in new fossil fuel supply, 40% of already developed oil and gas reserves need to be left unextracted. A similar rationale applies to new gas-fired power plants: both the production and use of gas needs to be rapidly reduced to limit global heating to 1.5°C and the committed emissions from existing energy infrastructure (including power infrastructure) already jeopardize the 1.5°C target. The good news is that clean and affordable alternatives to gas-fired power exist and can better deliver on energy access needs. In 2020, the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative recommended that “financing of fossil fuel projects as a means of closing the energy access gap should be terminated,” noting that they are no longer the most effective means of providing electricity access.\n\nWhether these projects will actually be ruled out depends on how EKN and SEK evaluate 1.5°C transition plans, which leaves some uncertainty in the Swedish position.\n\nIt is concerning that EKN is considering providing export finance support to CTT Mozambique, a project to build a gas-fired power plant in the east African nation. If EKN intends to act as a climate leader and listen to the science, this project cannot be supported.\n\nAmid all this, a hopeful sign is that EKN and SEK’s ‘Scientific Climate Council’ have made public statements that should provide the Swedish export credit agencies with ample reason to not exploit the loopholes in the policy. The advisory council noted that “the price today for coal, oil and gas makes new fossil-based investments hard to justify based on a strict financial calculation,” that “natural gas should not be seen as a transition fuel” and that “In most cases, it is not possible to justify new investments in fossil-based electricity and energy production. These are long investment cycles which result in lock-in effects, which in turn undermine the possibilities to reach the 1.5-degree target and also risks the investment becoming a “stranded asset”.\n\nAs a member of the Export Finance for Future (E3F) initiative, Sweden must use its diplomatic capital to ensure that all other E3F members implement the Glasgow Statement and present their updated policies at the upcoming E3F Summit. This way E3F members can build momentum towards COP27, ensure other Glasgow Statement signatories follow suit and meet their agreed end of 2022 deadline. [This leadership is vital to mitigating the climate crisis as of all public finance institutions ECAs are still the worst performers when it comes to Paris Alignment. The G20 ECAs provide 11 times as much export support to fossil fuel projects (USD 40.1 bn/yr) as for clean energy (USD 3.5 bn.yr)].\n\nAlthough E3F was designed to “harness public export finance as a key driver in the fight against climate change” and all members signed onto the Glasgow Statement, the coalition is not yet on track. The majority of its members have not yet updated their policies in line with the Glasgow Statement, and E3F itself has not yet made ending international public finance for fossil fuels a prerequisite for joining the initiative. Sweden must use its E3F membership to raise the bar, urging all other E3F members to implement the Glasgow Statement by the E3F Summit in order to build momentum to COP27, and make fossil-free ECAs policies a requirement for new members to join the initiative going forward.\n\n###",

    "Dagen H: the day Sweden switched to driving on the right – archive, 1967": "Halting way to the right road\n\n4 September 1967\n\nStockholm\n\nCheering crowds brought traffic to a halt here today as Sweden changed to driving on the right after four years of preparations, 40 years of argument, and at a total cost estimated at double the official figure of £40m.\n\nAll traffic had to halt for 10 minutes at 4.50 this morning throughout Sweden’s 60,000 miles of roads, but in Kungsgatan, Stockholm’s Oxford Street, the wait for impatient Swedish drivers wanting to try their luck on the right was much longer.\n\nBarred\n\nThough the centre of the city had been barred for nearly 24 hours to all but taxis, buses, and cars with special permits, a solid jam developed as sightseers, cyclists, and television cameramen swamped the roadway.\n\nThe police watched dourly as long lines of traffic – headlamps glaring, horns blowing –tried vainly to switch sides in the approved manner, getting hopelessly entangled in the process.\n\nWith military helicopters buzzing overhead, order was eventually restored and “Höger-dag”, “Right Day”, as the Swedes reverently term it, returned to the clockwork efficiency which marked its planning. Some 2,000 soldiers, 6,000 civil police, 50,000 school police, and 150,000 volunteers were on duty throughout Sweden, while an army of construction workers had worked throughout the night to make the final alterations to 350,000 street signs.\n\nLast detail\n\nThough there was the occasional jam and a number of minor accidents, the Swedish reputation for thoroughness can hardly ever have been better displayed. Typical of the meticulous attention to detail was that even the elk-hunting season had been brought forward a week so that hunters would not add to the traffic problem.\n\nTo prevent accidents from absent-mindedness after the change, and intensive publicity campaign has been mounted by the government in addition to the imposition of strict speed limits. These range from 40kph (25mph) in built-up areas to 90kph (58mph) on motorways. Drivers have been advised to keep their headlights switched on night and day until tomorrow.\n\nThe testing time, police say, is likely to be in about three weeks when drivers begin to relax and forget. The attitude here to the change seems curiously ambivalent. Many drivers say they are thankful it is at last over, yet are critical of the cost of the operation.\n\nThe criticism is no doubt the sharper because of the proposed 50 percent increase in vehicle tax next year, which is widely held to be the result of “Höger-dag.” And only just over 10 years ago in a national referendum, 83 percent voted against the change. When the Bill was finally passed in the Riksdag in 1963 after a deal between the two major political parties, it was estimated that the cost would be Kr400m (£28m) to be raised by a special vehicle tax of £2 13s for small cars and £5 for large cars, buses, and lorries.\n\nCost of £80m\n\nIn 1965 the official estimate was revived to Kr600m (£42m) and is now believed that the final cost to the government is likely to exceed Kr800m (£60m) with indirect cost of at least Kr200m, making a total of £80m.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iceland now plans to change next year.\n\nThough the British Road Federation, the Ministry of Transport, the AA and the RAC, all had observers in Stockholm, there is as yet no enthusiasm from anyone for a similar move in Britain.\n\nThe cost would be astronomical – £350m was the last estimate – but even more important, the reasons which led Sweden to conform with her neighbours are not applicable. Ninety per-cent of our cars are not left-hand drive and the number of foreign and British cars entering and leaving is still comparatively small.\n\nUntil the Channel tunnel is built and until we get into the Common Market, the idea of a change is almost certainly a non-starter. Even then our insularity in every sense could well delay the move for at least a generation. But by the year 2000 even the Swedes think we will have followed suit.",
    "Sweden and the revolt against the evasive elites": "So now we know: nowhere is immune to the populist surge. Not even Sweden. Not even every European liberals’ favourite welfarist state. Once considered the happy country of Europe, an oasis of technocratic calm in an often unpredictable continent, now even Sweden has been rattled by populism. In last week’s election the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing nationalist party, emerged as the second largest party in parliament. And this has shaken not only the political class in Stockholm but liberal elites around the world. It’s a ‘dramatic shift’, says the New York Times. ‘Astonishing’, says Deutsche Welle. An ‘earthquake’, insist leftist observers. They sound like the troops of an embattled army watching their last patch of territory be conquered by the enemy.\n\nThe feeling that Sweden has fallen – and that its falling represents a blow to correct-thinking people everywhere – is palpable. We all looked upon Sweden as the ‘bedrock of Nordic liberalism’, say two writers for the NYT. And that makes its ‘move toward the more populist right’ seem especially ‘shocking’. It’s one thing for eccentric Britain to succumb to the populist bug, with our vote for Brexit, and for the crazy United States to take a temporary punt on Trump. But Sweden? That social-democratic paradise Guardian columnists dream of retiring to? Many will be asking ‘How did this happen?’, says a startled-sounding Deutsche Welle. How on earth, in this Northern European ‘bastion of tolerance’, did a ‘nationalist party’ find itself surging in the polls? The alarm of the elites is striking. And telling. They seem to be clocking, finally, that their cultural and political values are not safe anywhere. Not even in Sweden. The election results were indeed remarkable. The Sweden Democrats, a party notable for its anti-immigration and anti-Islam stances, stormed into second place. They won 20.5 per cent of the vote. Not bad for a party that only made its debut in the Riksdag – the Swedish parliament – in 2010, when it won six per cent of the vote. That rose to 13 per cent in the 2014 election and 18 per cent in the 2018 election. Now, in terms of seats in parliament, the Sweden Democrats are second only to the Social Democrats, the party that has governed Sweden for most of the past century. Imagine the EDL nipping at the heels of a Labour government in the UK.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats were part of a right-wing bloc that won the election, if narrowly. The Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat and resigned. Ulf Kristersson of the centre-right Moderate party (which won 19.1 per cent of the vote) is now the prime minister in waiting and must stitch together a government. Whether that government will include the Sweden Democrats, or whether they’ll just agitate from the backbenches, remains to be seen. For years there has been a pact in the Swedish establishment never to engage with the Sweden Democrats. That is how significant the election result is. That is why it feels like an ‘earthquake’. Because a party that was treated as a political untouchable, as so vile that a cordon sanitaire had to be put around it, is now the second-largest in parliament, with a remarkable 73 seats. No wonder the managerial elites everywhere from New York to Berlin to Stockholm are reeling. The Sweden Democrats do indeed have disturbing origins. They have their roots in neo-Nazi movements of the 1980s, rallying under the slogan Keep Sweden Swedish. But they’ve changed a great deal. Under the leadership of Jimmie Akesson, just 26 years old when he took over the party in 2005, the Sweden Democrats moved away from their ‘far-right roots’ and took a ‘more populist direction’. And they made huge inroads with certain sections of the electorate. Not the middle classes in Stockholm, of course – strikingly, they had a poor showing in the capital – but rather among what one journalist rather sniffily refers to as ‘undereducated people’ who think the ‘Social Democrats are not representing their interests anymore’. Class and education are strong predictors of who’s likely to vote for the Sweden Democrats. As a Swedish social scientist points out, ‘Voters with university degrees are strongly unrepresented among [Sweden Democrats] voters’. A poll in 2022 found that sympathy for the Sweden Democrats was far higher among blue-collar workers than white-collar workers. So 24.5 per cent of unskilled blue-collar workers expressed a preference for the party, compared with just 8.3 per cent of high-level white-collar workers.\n\nThis echoes the populist moment elsewhere in Europe, and in the US too, where education is very often a key dividing line in electoral behaviour. People who have never darkened the door of a university – and who therefore have not been so exposed to the values and etiquette of the new elites – seem far more content to turn their backs on the increasingly woke establishment and to take a chance on populist upstarts. That many blue-collar folk in Sweden are finally doing this is not surprising. It isn’t because they’re racist. They’re not drawn to the Sweden Democrats because it has some neo-Nazi cranks in its past. Rather, they are revolting against their evasive elites. Against an establishment that seems to be in wilful denial about the problems confronting society, and which will brand you a hateful bigot if you dare to raise those problems. The political life of Sweden has been defined by evasion in recent years. The establishment parties, especially the Social Democrats, flat-out refused to be honest about the social disturbances afflicting Swedish society. Crime and violence have soared. There are now so many grenade attacks in Sweden that it is the only country other than Mexico in which police record the number of such attacks. Explosions generally are rising. As a BBC report in 2019 asked: ‘Sweden’s 100 explosions this year: What’s going on?’ In 2020 alone there were more than 200 explosions and 360 shootings. Sweden is the only country in Europe in which gun murders have surged since the year 2000. Then there are the religious riots. Earlier this year there were Islamist uprisings across Sweden. In various cities, Muslim mobs set fire to cars and hurled stones at cops following a right-wing provocateur’s burning of the Koran. Sweden’s national police chief said he had ‘never seen such violent riots’.\n\nThat much of this spike in crime and rioting followed Sweden’s huge intake of asylum seekers in 2015 has made this a tetchy, touchy subject. Swedish politicians and commentators, keen to dampen down what they consider to be the racist tendencies of the Swedish masses, tended to downplay the social instability. Outside observers did likewise. Remember the trouble Trump got into when he said Sweden was experiencing some big social and cultural problems? Don’t be ridiculous, the chattering classes of the West said – Sweden is fine. But it wasn’t fine. And its problems were at least partly a consequence of a crisis of integration, of the failure on Sweden’s part to assimilate the tens of thousands of largely Middle Eastern migrants it accepted in 2015. Consider this: four esteemed social scientists in Sweden examined the rape trends of the past two decades. They found that of those convicted of rape, 40.8 per cent were Swedish-born with Swedish parents, and 47.7 per cent were born outside of Sweden. Most of those were from the Middle East or North Africa. That is something to discuss, right? Apparently not. Too often, debate was shushed, demonised. The end result was as predictable as it was dire: social instability intensified as the elites looked the other way. Eventually things got so bad that the PM, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to talk about it. We can no longer ignore the fact, she said earlier this year, that we have ‘parallel societies in Sweden’, that ‘integration has been too poor at the same time as we have had large [amounts of] immigration’. But it was too little, too late. Many voters had already turned their backs on Ms Andersson’s Social Democrat party and moved towards the Sweden Democrats, for the simple reason that they wanted someone – anyone – to talk about Sweden’s transformation from a relatively stable welfare-oriented society into a nation beset by gang violence and identitarian grievance. It was the evasions of the elite, their stricture against open, honest commentary, that encouraged many to look to the Sweden Democrats.",
    "Swedish Conservatives Close to Election Win Amid Crime Fears": "Near final results in Sweden's election Sunday show that a bloc of right-wing parties was expected to defeat a left-wing bloc headed by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. The conservative group includes a populist anti-immigration party that made its best showing.\n\nHowever, the result was so close that the election authority said it would not be known before Wednesday when some uncounted votes, including those cast abroad, have been tallied.\n\nAccording to the early count, Andersson's ruling left-wing Social Democrats won 30.5% of the vote, more than any other party. However, a bloc of four left-wing parties appeared to fall short as a whole of winning a majority of votes in the 349-seat parliament, or Riksdag.\n\nExit polls had initially predicted a narrow victory for Andersson's camp but as the evening wore on, and the vote count supplanted the exit poll, the results tipped in favor of the conservatives.\n\nEarly Monday, the conservatives appeared to have 176 seats to 173 for the center-left.\n\nIn a speech to her supporters, Andersson said that while the results were unclear, it was obvious that the social democratic movement, which is based on ideals of creating an equal society and a strong welfare state, remains strong in Sweden.\n\nThe biggest winner of the evening was the populist anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, which had a strong showing of nearly 21%, its best result ever. The party gained on promises to crack down on shootings and other gang violence that have shaken a sense of security for many in Sweden.\n\nThe party has its roots in the white nationalist movement but years ago began expelling extremists. Despite its rebranding, voters long viewed it as unacceptable and other parties shunned it. But that has been changing, and its result in this election show just how far it has come in gaining acceptance.\n\n“We are now the second-biggest party in Sweden, and it looks [like] it’s going to stay that way,\" party leader Jimmie Akesson told his supporters.\n\n“We know now that if there’s going to be a shift in power, we will be having a central role in that,\" he said. \"Our ambition is to be in the government.”\n\nThe conservative bloc was led during the campaign by the center-right Moderates, who won 19%. It was previously the country's second largest party.\n\nModerates leader Ulf Kristersson told his supporters that he stands ready to try to create a stable and effective government.\n\nRegardless of the election outcome, Sweden is likely to face a lengthy process to form a government, as it did after the 2018 election.\n\nAndersson, a 55-year-old economist, became Sweden’s first female prime minister less than a year ago and led Sweden’s historic bid to join NATO following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.",
    "Sweden on ‘high alert’ for election interference amid Russia tensions": "Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia.\n\nThe Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources following its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September.\n\nAfter a turbulent period for Swedish politics, including the resignation of Stefan Löfven as prime minister, the rise of Magdalena Andersson, the country’s first female leader, and threats from Vladimir Putin, the latest polls are exceptionally close in a highly charged campaign with a strong focus on immigration.\n\nIn what would be a seismic shift to the right, polls suggest the Sweden Democrats, rightwing populists with neo-Nazi roots, could be on track to replace the Moderates as Sweden’s second biggest party.\n\nGenerally elections have been a race between left-leaning parties led by Andersson’s Social Democrats and a centre-right coalition led by the Moderates, but even the latter party has in just a few years gone from urging Swedes to “open your hearts” to refugees to embracing the Sweden Democrats – a party whose leader, Jimmie Åkesson, has called for asylum to be cut to “close to zero”.\n\nSweden’s perceived vulnerabilities to foreign disinformation include on immigration, violent crime, schools, jobs, pensions and rising energy costs.\n\nMats Engström, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former adviser to a Social Democrat foreign minister, said while it was no surprise violent crime is in the spotlight as deadly shootings rise, discussion linking it to migration has “for years been reinforced by Russian and other troll factories”.\n\nHe said the Swedish election system was “robust” but disinformation aimed at the end of the election campaign would be much harder to counteract.\n\nMikael Östlund, a spokesperson for the psychological defence agency, said: ““We have a high alert all the time but we are aware of the fact that it might be an occasion that someone would like to harm Sweden, impact the Swedish democracy process, to do something exceptional towards the end of the election campaign.”\n\nThe cold war-era government body, intended to protect democracy, freedom of opinion and independence, was reintroduced in January amid rising fears over Russian aggression.\n\nÖstlund said it saw “increased activity” from outside the country, some of which was “quite intense”, after Sweden’s decision to apply to become a Nato member. Ongoing disinformation campaigns, understood to be coming from Russia, include claims that Sweden is a weak country and is not safe for refugees.\n\n“It’s something that we have seen before from Russian actors and also individuals,” Östlund said. “We know that foreign powers and countries that have the capacity might be interested in harming Sweden and harming the elections, or trying to widen divisions between ethnic groups.\n\n“So we are prepared for the event that during the last weeks, the closer to the election day we come, there might be something that occurs that we have quite a short time to counter.”\n\nIn the event of foreign intervention, options for countering it include going public with the breach and naming the source. A recently launched public awareness campaign warned “bli inte lurad” (don’t be fooled) and encouraged people to think about the source and publisher of information before sharing it online.

A prosecutor confirmed last week that Annie Lööf, the leader of the Centre party, was the planned target of a suspected terror attack, which killed another woman, at a political festival in Gotland in July.\n\nFrederik Bratt, the Swedish security service’s commanding officer for the election, said while there was no indication of an increased threat targeting the election, the ongoing threat of lone actors was “complex and a challenge”.\n\nEngström said if the Social Democrats held on to power after the election, it would largely be down to Andersson’s personal popularity, but if they lose the party’s focus on crime during the campaign will come under question. He said the Moderates also faced a backlash among the party’s former voters over its embrace of the Sweden Democrats, which could prove “catastrophic”.\n\n“If Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson still can form a new government, he will be very dependent on the Sweden Democrats,” Engström said. “This will affect Sweden’s policy also internationally, for example lower ambitions in climate policy.”\n\nIn Rinkeby, a Stockholm neighbourhood with a large immigrant population, Abebe Hailu, 69, was on Wednesday campaigning for the Social Democrats in front of a shipping container decorated in a poster that read “Our Stockholm region can do better”. He said the issues people care about most are welfare, schools, healthcare and jobs.\n\n“Our party thinks in the first-hand you should invest in children, before it becomes set,” he said.\n\nWelfare is the solution to problems in Swedish society, he added. “We must reduce the class gap between rich and poor and that means good schools for the children.”"
