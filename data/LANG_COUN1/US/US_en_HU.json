    "Hungary Should Guarantee Safety of Lesbian Activists During DykeMarch": "Click to expand Image Rising anger over policies of Hungary's right-wing government filled the streets of the country's capital as thousands of LGBT activists and supporters marched in the city's Pride parade in Budapest, Hungary, July 2021. © 2021 Anna Szilagyi/AP Images\n\nHungarian lesbian activists are set to hold their second DykeMarch on October 1, the final day of the EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community (EL*C) Conference in Budapest. This year’s conference, “Lesbian Resistance,” will open two weeks after Serbia initially banned EuroPride 2022, the latest in a two-year spate of attacks on Pride marches and other queer events in Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch come amid ongoing government harassment of lesbian activism in Hungary. In February, an appeals court ruled against Labrisz Lesbian Association, finding that an article in a pro-government newspaper likening lesbian activists to pedophiles did not injure their reputation. This reversed a lower court decision, which deemed the article to be unfounded and offensive.\n\nIn June 2021, a Hungarian law criminalized showing “any content portraying or promoting sex reassignment or homosexuality” to children, falsely conflating LGBT rights with pedophilia. In August 2021, a government decree restricted customer access to the children’s book “A Fairytale for Everyone”, published by Labrisz Lesbian Association in 2020, under a new requirement that children's books seen to “promote homosexuality” be sold only in “closed wrapping.” The Labrisz book retells traditional fairytales with queer, feminist characters.\n\n“Having the conference in Budapest means a lot to us,” said Dorottya Redai, an activist with Labrisz. “Labrisz has been fighting against the political oppression of sexual minority women since 1999. Under the current government, we work harder than ever. We hope the Conference will signal to the government that lesbian resistance is powerful and won’t be silenced.”\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch take an intersectional approach, demanding rights for migrants, refugees, Roma communities, and other minority groups. As such, organizers could be at risk vis-a-vis Hungary’s sweeping criminalization in 2018 of migrant and refugee rights defenders. That law, condemned by several United Nations Special Rapporteurs and held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to violate EU law, remains in effect.\n\nGiven these wide-ranging attacks on queer, feminist, migrant, and minority rights advocacy, Hungarian authorities should ensure that the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression are protected during the EL*C conference and DykeMarch, and repeal laws that criminalize the work of activists and human rights defenders.",

    "The E.U. Is Finally Standing Up to Viktor Orbán": "For more than a decade, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has been locked in battle with the European Union over the democratic rules that Brussels expects E.U. member states to uphold. His commitment to “illiberal” Christian democracy has long since become a flashpoint. An E.U. report released earlier this month accuses Orbán of transforming Hungary into an “electoral autocracy” in which the prime minister has made “deliberate and systematic efforts” to undermine E.U. values.\n\nOrbán, a talented populist who has built his public popularity by picking fights with Eurocrats, insists he is merely defending Hungarian traditional values. But he stands accused in the report of attacks on press freedom, the independence of judges and courts, academic freedom, minority rights, and the rights of asylum seekers. None of this is new, but the report dropped at a highly charged moment.\n\nOn September 15, the European Parliament voted by an overwhelmingly majority to approve that report, which not only criticized Hungary for undermining democracy and the rule of law but also the European Commission for failing to force Hungary to change course. Orbán dismissed the report and the vote as a “bad joke.”\n\nFor years, the E.U. has had few good options to force Orbán and his Fidesz party to respect the rules, because so many of its potential punishment measures against offending member-state governments require unanimous support from other EU members, allowing Orbán to rely on support from fellow populists in Poland who can use vetoes to provide him with cover. But Brussels can hold back badly needed cash from the EU budget if it can prove there is credible risk the funds will be stolen by corrupt officials within the country in question.\n\nOn September 18, the E.U. fired this shot for the first time in its history.\n\nThe European Commission formally recommended that EUR 7.5 billion in funding for Hungary be held back until its government addresses a long list of specific issues. This isn’t the only money at risk. Unsuccessful E.U. bargaining with Hungary over terms of disbursement of EUR 14.9 billion in grants and loans as part of a COVID Recovery Fund leave Budapest short of money equaling about 8.5% of the country’s GDP. That’s a big hit for a small country.\n\nOther member states will vote in November on whether to withhold these funds, and the outcome won’t require unanimity but simply a “qualified majority,” a much lower threshold that leaves Orbán without protection. If the vote is yes, as is widely expected, Budapest will have one month to respond with changes meant to meet E.U. demands.\n\nOrbán is holding a weak hand. His government is already contending with high prices, a wobbly currency, and an energy crisis. Headline inflation rose to 15.6% in August, its highest point in 24 years. Prices for staple foods like milk, bread, and poultry have surged between 40% and 65% over the past year. After an election-year spending spree to support Orbán’s most recent victory, Hungary’s budget deficit is already far worse than his government forecast. Despite that, the government has buckled to public pressure by taking on an even heavier burden. In particular, it will extend price caps on some foods and fuels until the end of the year.\n\nRead More: The E.U. Is United Against Russia, With One Exception\n\nAdding to the pressure on Hungary’s economy, fears raised by E.U. action have weighed heavily on the forint, Hungary’s currency. It’s down 16% against the EUR over the past 12 months and 37% against the US dollar. Hungary’s current account deficit more than doubled from July to August of this year.\n\nIn short, the writing on the wall is so clear that even Viktor Orbán can read it. He and his party are still plenty popular at home. He can get by a while longer by blaming the E.U. and the war in Ukraine for Hungary’s economic problems.\n\nBut a rough winter looms, as Hungary, one of the countries most deeply dependent on energy supplies from Russia, scrambles for help. Failure to get prices under control could well start to cut into his support. Hungary needs that money, and it will have to jump through dozens of hoops to get it. Orbán’s government has already moved to begin meeting E.U. demands. On September 19, it sent parliament an anti-corruption bill. More such moves are in the works or will be soon.\n\nMore broadly, this is the opening salvo in a bid by E.U. officials to become much tougher with the governments of member states that flout Union rules on core values like rule of law. Brussels doesn’t want this fight to escalate, but it knows that other members are watching to see if these newly tough measures have teeth. Orbán will try to do as little as possible to unlock the funds his government needs. The E.U. doesn’t want a crisis that inflicts pain on Hungary’s people, but its leaders know they need to send a message that will be received across Europe.\n\nThe two sides will probably reach a deal, though it will surely take time. There will be many devils in many details that must be managed. The E.U. escalation is just the opening salvo of a much longer bureaucratic battle ahead.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",
    "E.U. proposes suspending $7.5B in funding for Orban’s Hungary over corruption": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBRUSSELS — The European Commission on Sunday proposed the suspension of billions of dollars in funding for Hungary over concerns about corruption, a first-of-its kind move that could deepen the standoff between Brussels and Budapest — if it goes ahead. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The commission will ask European Union countries to approve the suspension of 65 percent of funding from three programs, amounting to roughly $7.5 billion, according to E.U. officials. But the commission seemed to leave the door open for Hungary to make reforms and keep the money in the end.\n\nThis is the first time the E.U. is using a new measure aimed at protecting its budget by making funding conditional on certain standards. “Today’s decision is a clear demonstration of the Commission’s resolve to protect the E.U. budget, and to use all tools at our disposal to ensure this important objective,\" Johannes Hahn, commissioner in charge of budget and administration said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnnouncing the possible suspension, Hahn mentioned three problem areas: systematic irregularities in procurement, problems related to the prevention of conflict of interest and issues related to Hungary’s anti-corruption framework. He noted, however, that the Hungarian side has committed to a package of 17 reform measures to address E.U. concerns.\n\nE.U. member states will have a month to decide whether or not to proceed, with the possibility of extending by two months, according to the commission. An E.U. official on Wednesday suggested the extension is likely. A qualified majority is required to move forward.\n\nThe move comes just days after the European Parliament declared the country has become “a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy” under the current government — and after years of acrimony between the E.U. and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrban, a self-styled “illiberal democrat\" who has been in power since 2010, has a long history of clashing with Brussels over where Hungary — and where the bloc itself — is headed.\n\nIn the last decade, he has gradually tightened his grip on Hungarian democracy, reining in the country’s press, undermining the country’s judiciary and squeezing civil society.\n\nEach step has been greeted with fear and frustration in Brussels, where many officials worry that the erosion of Hungarian democracy undermines the values and unity of the 27-member bloc.\n\nYet, the E.U. has struggled to respond — and has largely continued to send money.\n\nIn 2018, the European Parliament voted to trigger a rule of law probe against Budapest over what it described as “a clear risk of a serious breach” of the democratic principles underpinning the bloc. In 2020, the European Parliament approved a new regulation aimed at protecting E.U. funds from misuse in country’s where the rule of law is being undermined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, when Orban won his fourth consecutive term, he celebrated by taunting the E.U. “We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels,” he said.\n\nNot long after, the commission triggered the new measure, which is known as the “conditionality mechanism.”\n\nOn Wednesday, E.U. officials stressed that the scope of the mechanism is limited to areas directly linked to the E.U. budget and the financial interests of the E.U. — not necessarily other areas of E.U. concern such as media freedom or LGBTQ rights, despite obvious overlap.\n\nSome diplomats and members of the European Parliament worry the measures don’t go far enough and predict that Hungary will buy time by making symbolic reforms.\n\n“Cutting 7.5 billion Euros for Orban sounds like a lot. But it is not,” wrote Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament with the Greens, noting that billions will keep flowing to a “corrupt and authoritarian” system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission, he said, “is showing Orban easy way out: sham reforms.”\n\nOthers see the move as a decent step forward. “Finally, the Commission uses the teeth we gave them,” said Petri Sarvamaa, who was the European Parliament’s lead negotiator for the E.U.’s rule of law conditionality regulation, in a statement on behalf of center-right European People’s Party, or EPP.\n\nThe proposed amount “is not peanuts,” Sarvamaa said. “The real question,\" he continued, “is how the Commission will ensure that the measures are actually implemented in the Hungarian system and whether the risk of the misuse of EU funds decreases.”\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Hungary Wants to Host Italian Super Cup": "Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported over the weekend that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has offered 8 million euros to the Italian Football Federation if Hungary hosts the next Italian Super Cup (Supercoppa Italiana), according to Index, a Hungarian news site, which contacted the Prime Minister’s Office in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper, a few weeks ago, the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the idea of Budapest hosting the Italian Super Cup, and the Italian Football Federation is reportedly considering the offer.\n\nThe out-of-town venue would not be new, with Saudi Arabia hosting the 2018 and 2019 Super Cups, and the country is also planning to host the upcoming match on January 18, 2023. However, according to La Repubblica, this could easily change and the federation could decide to host the match in Hungary instead.\n\nRelated article 0:1 - Hungarian Team Beats Dull Germany in Leipzig Ádám Szalai's goal keeps Hungary in top position in the group of deathContinue reading\n\nEven though the original article mentioned Budapest as a possible venue, several media outlets reported that the Hungarian Prime Minister offered to host the match at the Pancho Aréna in Felcsút, close to his home. However, this might be an error, since the Pancho Aréna can only accommodate 3,500 people. The Hungarian offer probably stands for the Puskas Aréna in Budapest which can host more than 67,000 fans.\n\nBudapest would be a good alternative, if only because Hungary is significantly closer to Italy than Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo the fact that teams and fans would have to travel less to the Hungarian capital is not a negligible factor. The Italian Super Cup will be played between Inter Milan and AC Milan, and according to media reports, both teams would prefer Hungary as the venue.\n\nLa Repubblica reports that the decision about the football match could be heavily influenced by the result of the Italian elections on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian coalition of right-wing parties won the election by a large margin, as a result of which Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and an ally of Viktor Orban, is likely to become the next Italian prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary and Italy will play against each other today in Puskás Aréna in the Nations League.

    "Hungary decree says abortion-seekers must listen to fetal vital signs": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nPregnant people seeking abortions in Hungary will now be required to observe fetal vital signs, under a new decree passed by the right-wing government that took effect Thursday. Under the decree, issued Monday, health care providers must present women with “fetal vital signs presented in a clearly identifiable manner” before going ahead with an abortion. Doctors must sign a report saying they have done so.\n\n“Nearly two-thirds of Hungarians associate the beginning of a child’s life with the first heartbeat,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Monday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe move marks the latest effort by Hungary’s far-right to promote conservative social values. Abortion was legalized in Hungary in 1953, and pregnant people can obtain the procedure during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy for social or medical reasons. That time limit can be extended under certain circumstances, including if there is more than a 50 percent likelihood of fetal defects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHungary’s abortion law is relatively liberal compared to many other countries. But abortion rights groups say mandatory counseling sessions and other administrative barriers seek to dissuade women from obtaining abortions, even when it is legal for them to do so.\n\nThe latest amendment to the abortion rules, passed in 1992, enshrined the necessity of protecting “fetal life that begins with conception” — a stance codified in Hungary’s 2012 constitution. Medication abortion, via pills, has been illegal since 2012.\n\nThe right-wing government of Viktor Orban, who has served as prime minister since 2010, has offered financial incentives to encourage couples to have more children. But the new decree marks its first significant change to abortion rules.\n\nDuro Dora, a member of parliament from the far-right Our Home Movement who campaigned for the measure, hailed the decree as a victory on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A chance at life: from now on mothers will listen to the heartbeat of the fetus!” she wrote in a Facebook post, adding: “Let’s make it clear: our lives begin at the moment of conception and are equivalent to anyone else’s, it’s important for everyone to realize this.”\n\nMedical experts take issue with the use of the term “fetal heartbeat” early on in a pregnancy. Cardiac activity can be detected around six weeks into pregnancy. But the sound that can be observed on an ultrasound is in fact produced by the ultrasound machine, experts say — and signs of flickering reflect electrical activity produced by the embryo, not a functional heart.\n\nOpposition politicians in Hungary and abortion rights advocates condemned the decree this week. Timea Szabo, a left-wing member of parliament, called the new requirement “unacceptable” in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Aborting a pregnancy is a terribly difficult and complex decision for every woman,\" she said. “It is highly insensitive to aggravate this process with further traumatizing measures, and it puts a significant additional burden on the health system that is struggling to survive from the foundation.”\n\nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation said the requirement “has no medical purpose and serves only to humiliate women.”\n\n“It will make accessing abortion more burdensome,” the organization said in a statement. “The new legislation was issued as a fait accompli by the government in Hungary without any expert or public consultation and without hearing from women.”\n\nThe Hungarian Medical Chamber, the leading doctors’ association in Hungary, said the decree does not conflict with its code of ethics, describing the rule in a statement Wednesday as essentially an administrative change. But the group voiced disappointment at the lack of consultation with experts and societal stakeholders before the government published the new rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatent, a Hungarian women’s rights group, plans to protest the new decree on Sept. 28.\n\nThe Hungarian decree mirrors “heartbeat bills” passed in U.S. states including Georgia, Texas, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, which the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v.

    "New German chain has entered Hungary, threatening competition": "The new German chain TEDi has recently opened its fourth store in Hungary. The product categories sold in the stores are similar to those of Pepco and KiK, which means that competition might be in trouble now.\n\nTEDi offers everything from cosmetics, home furnishings, decorations and toys to office supplies and pet food. The chain might be new and Pepco and KiK might be already very well-established stores in Hungary, TEDi has a rather bright future in Hungary. Pénzcentrum has taken a look at where the competition among the industrial goods chains stands.\n\nHow many stores does each chain have in Hungary?\n\nTEDi has four stores in Hungary: in Budapest at the Savoya Park and in the XVIII. district, as well as in Székesfehérvár and Pápa. In contrast, Pepco has 223 stores in the country, and Kik has more than 100 stores, according to their website. But TEDi could soon start a rapid expansion within Europe, not excluding Hungary.\n\nWhat kind of shops are they?\n\nAccording to Pénzcentrum, it is difficult to define the exact profile of these three chains. That is because they offer practically all kinds of goods that are needed in everyday life. TEDi’s motto, for example, “Everything decoration, party, stationery and much more” does not tell us too much. The range of goods on offer is reminiscent of the once common “hundred-forint” shops, a concept that existed abroad in the same way, as one-euro, one-dollar shops.\n\nWhat will be the future of these chains in Hungary?\n\nAlthough KiK has been present in our country since 2008, Pepco, which has been expanding since 2015, has many more stores.\n\nPepco Hungary Kft., the operator of the Pepco store network, generated net sales of HUF 68.5 billion from domestic sales in its last known financial year, from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021. Its 223 stores employed an average of 2,031 people, according to its annual report.\n\nRead also: Officers in police and fire stations will freeze in Hungary\n\nKIK Textile and Non-Food Ltd, which operates KiK stores, reported net sales of HUF 23.7 billion from domestic sales in its last known fiscal year, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. Its more than 100 stores in Hungary employed an average of 601 people.\n\nHow the new TEDi stores will perform in this regard is yet to be seen. However, one thing is for sure: just like both Pepco and KiK have their own loyalty buyers, TEDi will have many as well.\n\nRead also Charming places in Budapest for International Coffee Day\n\nSource: Pénzcentrum, Store Insider, DNH",

    "Hungary Will Continue Issuing Visas to Russians, Foreign Minister Says": "Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, has confirmed that his government will continue issuing Schengen visas to Russian nationals, despite the ongoing sanctions imposed on the latter and talks for an eight package of restrictions being on the way.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“It’s a somewhat more complex and slow procedure compared to when there is such a treaty. But even when there’s no agreement, it doesn’t mean we don’t issue visas. Of course, we will continue doing so, in accordance with the procedure,” Szijjarto said in New York, attending the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe EU agreed on July 31 to discontinue the agreement with Russia, which simplified visa issuance to Russian citizens, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania later introduced restrictive measures to Russian tourists, including visa issuance, later also joined by Finland. On the other hand, Germany and France opposed a blanket ban on Russian tourists entering the zone.\n\nSpeaking regarding these measures, the Minister said that those sanctions imposed on Russia haven’t proved to be any successful, and they are, in fact, harming Europe, citing the sanctions as the reason why inflation has increased, utility bills, gas and food prices are soaring, putting the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nSzijjarto said for Kossuth Rádió, a Russian media, that an agreement reached with EU leaders in the most recent meeting for an eighth package had failed as no proposal was made, let alone a final decision.\n\n“We will not approve any decision that harms Hungary’s national interests. The security of our energy supply remains a red line. Any sanction that puts our energy supply at risk is unacceptable for us,” he said.\n\nHe also noted his disappointment for his “Western colleagues” that don’t want to negotiate, while Szijjarto values dialogue and negotiations. According to him, if the EU closes diplomatic channels, there could be no end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom is delivering 5.8 million cubic metres of gas to Hungary on a daily basis, in addition to volumes regulated in the country’s long-term contract. Hungary’s reserves now contain enough gas to cover 41 per cent of annual consumption, considerably more than the 23 per cent that Europe currently covers as a whole, as Szijjarto said.\n\nThese declarations follow the proposal of the European Commissioner for Budget, Johannes Hahn, to cut funding to Hungary, as the country is failing to align its politics with those from the EU. More specifically, €7.5 billion designated to Hungary will be cut off, as the country is also lacking in respecting democracy, in addition to refusing to impose sanctions on Russia.",

    "Hungary bestows a high honor on Jared Kushner": "Jared Kushner spoke of his grandparents’ marriage in Hungary in the ashes of the Holocaust as he accepted the Order of Merit of Hungary on Thursday. The award, presented at the Hungarian mission to the United Nations in New York, recognized Kushner’s efforts in “strengthening Hungarian-American relations and creating the Abraham Accords supporting peace in the Middle East,” according to the mission.\n\n“I was very touched when I received the notice that this was an award that was going to be presented to me. And it had a very special place in my heart because my family has a very unique history of the country that I don’t think a lot of people know about,” said Kushner.\n\nHe told those in attendance of his grandparents’ escape from Belarus, surviving as other family members were killed.\n\n“My grandmother had to witness [Jews in her town] being executed, and then clean the blood off of the floors in the town square while they made other Jews play the violin—music to celebrate what they thought was a very special occasion,” said Kushner.\n\nOnly a few hundred Jews out of tens of thousands from his grandmother’s town survived, and she went on to join the resistance fighters against the Nazis, where she met Kushner’s grandfather.\n\nSubscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate\n\nby email and never miss\n\nour top stories\n\n“They survived really through the grace of G-d, through a great miracle. The first happy occasion that they had was in Hungary. They were married in Hungary along the way. It wasn’t an elaborate ceremony. It was quick, with another 10 or 20 couples,” Kushner said of his grandparents, before their travels to a displaced persons’ camp in Italy and on to the U.S.\n\n“When I went to the White House, the first thing I brought with me was a picture of my grandparents to remind me of how fragile life is and how critical America is, as a country that can allow people who were just really up at death’s door to be able to come build a bright future, and then have their children and their grandchildren serve the country in the way that I was very fortunate to do,” Kushner said.\n\nThe ties between the administrations of U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian President Viktor Orban were particularly close. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto was the only European country’s top diplomat in attendance for the signing of the Abraham Accords, which was an effort largely led by Kushner as senior advisor to his father-in-law, Trump.\n\n“I thought that Europe would be a much more active partner in trying to resolve the [conflict] and closing the final chapter of post-World War II refugees, and trying to create security for the Jewish people so that the atrocities that occurred in Europe have a much lower probability of ever happening again. But what I found in Europe was a lot of conventional thinking,” said Kushner. “And then I met Peter. He said if we’re going to make a difference, we can’t focus on doing this the way that it’s been done in the past. Let’s think out of the box. You can consider me your partner in trying to create peace.”\n\nKushner said Szijjarto provided quality ideas and suggestions, and was Kushner’s first call whenever he needed help in Europe.\n\nFor his part, Szijjarto claimed Hungary has a substantial interest in peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, which was largely behind his efforts to move the accords forward.\n\n“In Central Europe, we pay a special attention to the Middle East because of many reasons. First, there are thousands, tens, or even hundreds of thousands of citizens of Israel with Hungarian origin. And their security and their well-being is extremely important for us,” said Szijjarto. “And the second aspect is that Central Europe is not so far from the Middle East, and the security situation in the Middle East determines and influences the security situation in Central Europe, as well.”\n\nSzijjarto, perhaps in an undiplomatic manner, expressed a hope that he will have the opportunity to work with a Trump White House again, and claimed that “if President Trump had remained in office, I’m pretty sure the war [between Russia and Ukraine] would have not broken out. And this would be a totally different, and I would say much better world than it is currently.”\n\nHe said Hungary was “crossing fingers for the success of President Trump,” though he “wouldn’t enter into this discussion too much, because that would put a suspicion on us that we might interfere.”\n\nKushner, meanwhile, pointed to Hungary’s support as evidence that the Abraham Accords weren’t just between Israel and its Arab neighbors, but were “really something that everyone wanted to embrace.” In accepting the award, Kushner noted the distinct difference between the business and the diplomatic worlds.\n\nIf you do a business transaction, usually property is exchanged. When you do a peace deal, all you do is you change people’s minds,” said Kushner. “So, they agree to think differently the next day than they did the day before, which is quite an extraordinary thing when you think about it.”",

    "Why the EU Is Getting Tough on Hungary’s Orban": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nShortly after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban notched up a fourth landslide election win in April, the European Union triggered a probe that may ultimately deprive his government of billions of euros in funding. Long concerned about what it calls the erosion of the rule of law under Orban, the EU sees getting him to change course as vital to bolster democracy and EU unity. Failure may dilute the EU, strengthen polarization or even rekindle talk of Hungary’s potential exit from the bloc.\n\n1. What’s the backdrop?\n\nSince 2010, Orban has made it harder for outsiders to hold the government to account. He’s appointed loyalists to the courts, the chief prosecutor’s office and the media authority. A big parliamentary majority allowed him to write a new constitution that opposition critics condemned as an attack on democracy and human rights. And he’s targeted minorities, including the Roma and LGBTQ communities, seeking to limit their rights. In 2019, Hungary became the first EU country to lose its rating as a full-fledged democracy at Freedom House, a Washington-based advocacy group that assesses political systems. Meantime, Transparency International, a not-for-profit graft watchdog, rates Hungary as among the most-corrupt countries in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. How did this happen?\n\nWhile governments must adopt stringent democratic criteria to join the world’s largest trading bloc, there have been few tools available to deal with wayward members once they’ve joined. The EU did try legal action, but Orban always found a way out -- dragging his feet on demands for change, cutting deals that stopped short of meaningfully rolling back his power and exploiting shortcomings in the bloc’s own legal charters. In addition, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel shielded Orban, arguing that pressing him too hard may prompt Hungary to follow the UK in its decision to leave the EU. He also found allies in Poland, where the nationalist Law & Justice party took power in 2015 and proceeded to emulate Orban’s policies. Orban has also forged ties with populist politicians elsewhere such as Marine Le Pen in France and Giorgia Meloni in Italy.\n\n3. What changed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe European Parliament voted in 2018 to trigger a rule-of-law probe against Hungary into what it called “a clear risk of a serious breach” of the EU’s democratic principles. A new legal process adopted in 2020 allows the EU to potentially cut off funding when its financial interests may be undermined. The European Commission, the EU’s executive, triggered that so-called conditionality mechanism in late April. It has until late September to make its recommendation to the European Council, where leaders of EU member states make the most important decisions.\n\n4. Is the investigation related to democracy or corruption?\n\nThe two are intertwined but the commission must limit its probe to areas that could affect the EU budget and undermine the financial interests of the bloc. So while Orban’s comments on racial purity, his clampdown on independent media or his restrictions on LGBTQ rights have triggered condemnation from others within the EU, they aren’t the focus of the investigation. The independence of the judiciary, however, is in the spotlight as it’s seen as central to a country’s ability to tackle graft and issue unbiased judgments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. How much money is at stake?\n\nThe European Commission hasn’t stated how much is at risk. The country’s share of the 2021-2027 EU budget is about 36 billion euros ($36.5 billion). There’s also Hungary’s 5.8 billion euro share of pandemic recovery funds. The EU has delayed releasing that, citing corruption concerns. The forint has been one of the world’s worst-performing currencies this year, with investors citing uncertain outlook for EU funds as contributing to the selloff.\n\n6. How has Hungary’s government reacted?\n\nAt first, Orban’s ministers attacked the EU decision to start the investigation, calling it a political move to help the just-defeated opposition. But conscious of the need to unlock EU funds, the government has offered what it’s calling a “comprehensive” package of steps to address corruption concerns, including the setting up of a new anti-corruption agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Is that enough?\n\nThat’s unclear. Orban has been adroit at outmaneuvering EU institutions over the past decade and critics see his promises of reform ringing hollow. For example, he’s pledged to make the anti-corruption agency “independent.” But other nominally autonomous institutions in Hungary are nonetheless heavily influenced by Orban and his ruling party, including the courts. This time, the EU could make the disbursement of money conditional on the actual implementation of any pledges. The commission also could recommend funding be cut or that the probe against Hungary be closed. The final decision by the leaders would come one to three months later.\n\n8. Could Hungary one day leave the EU?\n\nOrban has said he intends to keep Hungary in the EU. Its export-oriented economy relies heavily on the free movement of goods and services. The UK’s tortuous exit from the EU also showed how difficult the process of leaving can be for both sides. In addition, the conflict raging in neighboring Ukraine has given Hungarians a sense of the security provided inside the EU (as well as the NATO military alliance). But it’s hard to see Orban willingly unwinding the legal changes of the past decade and launching a spirited campaign against corruption. The ruling elite and its business allies have benefited greatly during his tenure. Hungary’s Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said last year that, if the EU keeps up its criticism, Hungary may re-evaluate its membership at the end of this decade, when it’s expected to become a net contributor to the bloc’s budget.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

So far, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has refused to send military aid to Kyiv, and he recently concluded a new gas deal with the Kremlin to help Hungary weather the winter. He’s also more open to continuing normal diplomatic relations with Russia, traveling to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, who he said helped Central Europe “rid itself of Communism peacefully, without loss of life or blood.”\n\nWithin Europe, the country stands out like a sore thumb. And with broad support for Orbán’s non-interventionist policy, the question of involvement in the war isn’t even a major wedge issue domestically. So, is it reasonable to claim that Hungary is “pro-Russia”?\n\nThe short answer is no. Hungary’s ambivalent stance is the inevitable result of a combination of domestic political influences, as well as its complex relationships with Russia, Ukraine and the West. In many ways, it is the story of the country’s recent history.\n\nThe main problem with the simple pro-Russia label is that Hungarian attitudes toward Russia and Russians are far from friendly. Perceptions of Russia are still colored by Soviet forces crushing the Hungarian uprising of 1956, just as the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia haunts Czechs and Slovaks to this day. Even Orbán himself was a fervent anti-communist campaigner in the twilight years of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nPro-Russia social currents are also arguably much weaker in Hungary than among its Slavic neighbors. Nationalist movements in Slovakia, Serbia and the Czech Republic often share a sense of ideological kinship with Russia, one linked to suspicion of the West, seeing Ukraine’s pro-Western policy as something akin to a betrayal of Slavic identity.\n\nHowever, such interpretations of the war don’t exert the same sway in Hungary because Hungarians aren’t Slavic — neither do they nurture positive attitudes to Russians in general.\n\nSo how, then, to account for the country’s current pro-Russia stance?\n\nFirst off, it’s important to highlight that Hungarians have strikingly negative attitudes toward Ukraine. While Russia has harmed Hungary at various times in the past, Ukraine is seen as wronging Hungarians in the present.\n\nRelations between Budapest and Kyiv took a dramatically negative turn in recent years, when Ukraine introduced restrictions on national minorities intended to combat Russian influence. Hungarians claim minority communities in Transcarpathia — a region of Ukraine ceded by Hungary after World War I — faced hostility because of these policies.\n\nSince then, Orbán has been accused of fostering resentment. Tensions flared in 2018 over a video that apparently showed diplomats illegally issuing Hungarian passports to people in Transcarpathia. Later, in 2019, Hungary was accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in the region, and blocked Ukraine’s NATO membership negotiations over the row.\n\nToday, from the Donbas to Kosovo, events are again proving the potency of nationalist narratives over lost territory and peoples separated by the claimed injustices of history. Yet, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the simple fact that many Hungarians have negative views of both Russians and Ukrainians is pertinent.\n\nAnd while these views have clearly influenced Hungarian government policy on both military aid and sanctions, other historical, economic and cultural factors have played their part as well.\n\nMany Hungarians worry about the gravitational pull that wars can have on neighboring countries. In the early 1990s, Hungary only narrowly escaped being sucked into the wars in the Balkans, after it was revealed that Budapest had been supplying tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles to Croat forces.\n\nOrbán’s economic model built around geopolitical ambivalence has influenced the country’s resistance to energy sanctions as well. Orbán describes Hungary as a “transit economy,” which can only thrive by drawing investment and opportunities from both East and West.\n\nIn this context, German-Russian energy cooperation is paradoxically believed to be fundamental to Hungarian national security. Orbán argues that the German-Russian energy axis remains the only way to stop Eastern Europe from becoming “dependent on the Americans” for energy and military protection. Though, his warning against American energy dominance does seem bizarre given that Hungary, Germany and others have had few qualms about relying on Russia.\n\nFinally, the economic arguments against cutting Russia off dovetails with Hungary’s growing cultural rift with the West. The progressive values rejected by Orbán are also mocked by Moscow, and Orbán has portrayed the country as emblematic of traditional mores. “Russians speak an old language. When we listen to them, it’s as if we are hearing the sounds of the past,” he said.\n\nWith Orbán presenting Western progressivism to Hungarians as dangerous, it should come as no surprise that Russia’s more traditional cultural values exert a certain appeal. As Attila Demkó, head of the Center for Geopolitics at Budapest’s Mathias Corvinus Collegium, says: “After 12 years of pressure from the EU and the West,” many Hungarians fall into the trap of feeling that “if the West is ‘bad,’ there must be some ‘truth’ in what Russia is doing.”\n\nAnd as Orbán voters believe they’ve been demonized by their supposed Western allies in recent years, why, they might ask, should they back a sanctions program?\n\nHungary’s stance on the Ukraine war isn’t based on popular pro-Russia social currents. Rather, it is the result of historical and recent political factors, many of which have been shaped by Orbán himself.\n\nSimply put, Hungary isn’t pro-Russia. But even so, President Vladimir Putin’s invasion hasn’t made it pro-Ukraine either.",
    "Russia’s Gazprom Offers Extra Gas Supplies To Hungary, Cutting Off Deliveries To Other Countries": "SOURCE:kremlin.ru\n\nHungary signed a deal with Russia for additional gas supplies in September and October. The agreement will send up to 5.8 million cubic meters of gas a day to Hungary on top of the contract quantity already in force. “Representatives of Gazprom and the Hungarian government have signed an appropriate agreement,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on August 31. The minister pointed out that in August Hungary already received 2.6 million cubic meters of additional gas deliveries per day, which will be increased from September 1 to a maximum of 5.8 million cubic meters per day thanks to the agreement with Gazprom. More gas will reach Hungary from Serbia. Under the 15-year deal signed back in September 2021, Gazprom would ship 4.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Hungary annually, via two routes: 3.5 billion cubic meters via Serbia and 1 billion cubic meters via Austria. Szijjarto traveled to Moscow last month, seeking 700 million cubic meters of gas on top of an existing long-term supply deal with Russia. Gazprom started to increase gas supplies to Hungary this month, adding to previously agreed deliveries via the Turkstream pipeline. Hungary’s chief diplomat said the country would not vote for any sanctions that will make the transport of natural gas or oil from Russia to Hungary impossible. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Hungary has obstructed the EU’s sanctions policy, notably for energy policy and military assistance for war-torn Ukraine but not only. On the same day Hungary discussed extra gas supplies with Gazprom, the Hungarian foreign minister spoke out against a possible visa ban on Russians. Hungary was one of the EU states to veto this decision. The European Union has decided not to impose a blanket ban on visas for Russian tourists, but instead to suspend a 2007 visa facilitation deal. In practice, the number of new visa applications will reduce while it will take longer to obtain visas. On August 31, when Russia announced an increase in gas supplies to Hungary, Gazprom halted natural gas supplies to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. Gazprom on August 18 said it would stop the flow of gas via the pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. German says it is impossible due to technical reasons. In recent weeks, the Russian energy major reduced the amount of gas flowing through a major pipeline from Russia to Europe to 20 percent of full capacity. Gazprom had suspended gas flows to French gas company Engie from September 1 due to failure to pay for supplies in full. This little affects France’s gas supplies. Russia now accounts for less than 4 percent of Engie’s gas imports while French gas storage facilities are now up to 90 percent full. By early November, this could be 100 percent. Unlike Germany, France has diversified its gas deliveries, taking some from North Africa and benefitting from liquefied natural gas supplies. Not incidentally, Gazprom’s recent moves have been linked to a drop in gas prices on the Amsterdam stock exchange after Germany was reported to fill its facilities faster than planned. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany, perhaps longer than until September 3. Gazprom has seen higher profits in recent months––despite the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The gas major said it had made a record €41.63 billion in net profit.",

    "Hungary breeds unquiet on Ukraine’s western front": "Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine | Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nBUDAPEST — The Western alliance is pledging to support Ukraine till the bitter end. Hungary is openly calling on Kyiv to give up.\n\nAcross Europe, capitals are funneling Ukraine weapons to fuel a critical counteroffensive. And they’re broadly insisting Ukraine will decide when it is time to start peace negotiations.\n\nNot Hungary.\n\nThough Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, it has declined to join other Western allies in providing Kyiv with military support. Instead, it has banned weapon deliveries from crossing through Hungary into next-door Ukraine.\n\nWhile Budapest has signed off EU sanctions, it first insisted some of them be watered down. And even as fighting raged in eastern Ukraine this summer, Hungarian officials traveled to Moscow to negotiate a deal for extra gas supplies.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine. The West’s focus, he said in a speech in July, “should not be on winning the war, but on negotiating peace and making a good peace offer.”\n\n“The task of the European Union is not to stand alongside either the Russians or the Ukrainians, but to stand between Russia and Ukraine,” he said.\n\nWestern assistance, he has argued, is only prolonging the conflict. “Sanctions and arms deliveries won’t lead to results,” Orbán told local radio in August. “When one rushes to put out a fire, one doesn’t bring along a flamethrower.”\n\nOrbán’s stance on Ukraine — coming as European leaders worry about war fatigue and a winter of spiking energy prices and inflation — has raised concerns in Kyiv and abroad that Hungary could prove to be the West’s weakest link as it seeks to manage the largest military crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that Budapest does not always stand alone, with other capitals sometimes sharing at least part of Hungary’s concerns. But as the EU and NATO allies seek new ways to support Ukraine in a longer-term conflict, Budapest’s reluctance will be a persistent thorn in the Western alliance’s side.\n\nOrbán “doesn’t give a damn about Ukraine,” said András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to NATO and the United States.\n\nHungary’s position on the war “is not just a nuisance — this is a threat,” he said. “I don’t think NATO or the European Union is taking this seriously. And I think it’s a mistake.”\n\nCloser to the Kremlin than Kyiv\n\nSince returning to power in 2010 Orbán has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nHungary and Ukraine may share a border, but Budapest has long put more emphasis on its relationship with Moscow.\n\n“Hungary’s Ukraine policy has always been to a certain extent subordinated to Hungary’s Russia policy,” said András Rácz, an associate fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. He pointed to energy dependency and investments in Russia as driving Budapest’s calculus.\n\nOrbán began his political career as an anti-Soviet liberal. But since returning to power in 2010 he has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin, holding frequent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and striking a controversial deal with a Russian state-owned company to expand an existing nuclear power plant. On August 26, more than six months into Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine, Hungary issued a permit for the project to go ahead.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary’s relationship with Ukraine, particularly over the past five years, has been rocky.\n\nBudapest has repeatedly clashed with Kyiv over education and language policies it says are infringing on the rights of over 100,000 Hungarian speakers living in western Ukraine. As a result, prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Budapest repeatedly blocked NATO from holding ministerial-level meetings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of Orbán’s Ukraine strategy — both before and after February 24 — is driven by Hungarian domestic politics.\n\nBlaming Kyiv — and the West — for the war plays into Orbán’s electoral narrative, said political scientist and re:constitution fellow Edit Zgut-Przybylska. “It nicely fits the Euroskeptic populism of Fidesz, claiming that the corrupt imperialist West is endangering stability in Central and Eastern Europe,” she said.\n\nAhead of an election this past April, officials from the ruling Fidesz party claimed — falsely — that Ukraine was trying to meddle in the proceedings. In his victory speech, Orbán even cited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as one of his adversaries.\n\nOrbán also seems to be playing a longer geopolitical game, banking on the rise of like-minded forces on both sides of the Atlantic, according to Simonyi, the former ambassador.\n\nThe prime minister — under fire from Western allies for undermining Hungary’s democratic institutions — often speaks about a relative decline in western power and the need to build relationships in other parts of the world.\n\nThe results of the upcoming congressional midterms in the United States, Orbán said in his radio interview, “could influence U.S. foreign policy — including on the question of war and peace. I’m counting on this happening.”\n\nSimonyi said Orbán is seeking the “best of all worlds” — an American populist, right-wing government that would leave him alone, as well as relationships with Russia and China, which don’t care what happens domestically in Hungary.\n\nWar changes everything — for a time\n\nWith the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line | Nicolas Maeterlinck/BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor the moment, however, Russia’s February assault has changed the calculus. With the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line.\n\nWhen EU leaders agreed to grant Ukraine candidate status, opening the door to eventual EU membership, the Hungarian leader did not stand in their way. And while Hungary doesn’t allow weapons to cross into Ukraine, it does permit them to transit to other NATO countries, from where they can continue their journey toward the frontline. Budapest also quietly backed using an EU fund to reimburse countries sending Kyiv military equipment.\n\nHungarian officials say their country is in line with the Western alliance. “There are many myths about the Hungarian position,” said one senior Hungarian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He described Budapest’s stance on sanctions, especially when it comes to energy, as a reflection of the country’s “geographic and economic realities.”\n\n“We were not the only ones having national caveats,” the official said.\n\nBut there are still concerns. “Hungary is performing only the necessary minimum,” said Rácz, of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I think it’s not breaking the consensus, it’s not breaking the unity,” he said. “It is weakening the unity.”\n\nOfficials fret over an alliance straining\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe | Anatolli Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe and cooled the country’s relationship with its closest ally, Poland.\n\nBut now, over six months into the war, the Western alliance’s unity on Ukraine is also straining. There are fissures between Europe’s Russia hawks — in particular the Baltic states — and some western capitals on issues such as Russian visa bans and how to proceed with future sanctions packages.\n\nThere is also, some officials say, a discrepancy between Washington’s expansive support for Kyiv and Europe’s relatively more modest assistance. And war fatigue fears are infiltrating capitals ahead of a tough winter.\n\nAmid this landscape, Western partners fret that Hungary — as such an outlier — risks undermining the EU’s unity and security policies.\n\n“The Hungarians are practicing their own imperial policy towards countries surrounding them where there is Hungarian minority,” said one Central European official.\n\n“Orbán needs to fund his generous social politics by selling out European security,” the official adding, describing the Hungarian government’s behavior “as a Russian and Chinese Trojan horse.”\n\nHungary, according to the official, will continue resisting some efforts to help Ukraine — but within the limits of how “they were acting until now.”\n\n“They are only thinking of themselves, only acting for themselves,” this person said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, meanwhile, has moderated its public criticism of Hungary over the past weeks, after vocal criticism from Zelenskyy in the first months of the war.\n\nBut concerns in Kyiv persist.\n\nHungary’s leadership has put its “political internal agenda and agenda of their Russian friends forward as opposed to unity and values — unfortunately,” said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, chair of the Ukrainian Parliament’s committee on EU integration.\n\n“There are political forces in different European and NATO countries that actually are also working to undermine the unity,” Klympush-Tsintsadze noted, adding that in Hungary, these forces are in power.\n\nThe Hungarian government’s approach, she said, “worries me — how it will further undermine the common response.”",

Whenever you think of Hungary, you probably conjure up images of horses, gray cattle, crane wells and wide lush meadows. Now it is time for Hortobágy to get a revamp, and thus, provide an even more memorable experience. The proposal’s deadline is in October, so they are still waiting for the offers.\n\nHowever, we have insight into what is being planned thanks to magyarepitok.hu. The development plan includes the restoration of the Szekérállás building. The Körszín building will be reconstructed and turned into an information point. Lastly, a comprehensive public utility upgrade can be expected.\n\nThe Szekérállás\n\nThe building is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage attribute and it is also under monument protection. While trying to reconstruct the original form of the roof and openings, they will be preserving the structure of the roof and the walls of the building. Inside, a complete modernisation is to be expected both from a utility and architectural perspective. An independent space will be made inside the building accommodating all the functions necessary to keep the building running, while the machinery will be located on the floor above.\n\nThe Körszín\n\nDuring the transformation of the building into a Touristic Information Point, it will be completely demolished. Following that, based on the needs of the new facility, it will be rebuilt in the same form. Essentially, from the outside, it will look the same, but from the inside, it will be modernised and reorganised. The new building will have 125 m² of public space and another 16 m² area inside. The surroundings will also change as new perennial plants and ornamental grass will be planted in the framework of complete landscaping. The water supply will be rethought and rainwater will be led back to the river.\n\nThe visitor centre, new roads and parking\n\nAlthough the visitor centre had been expanded and transformed in 2020, there is still some complementary work left to do. This will not be anything noticeable as most of the work had already been done. These additional upgrades will help to modernise the technical side of the building.\n\nNew parking spaces will be created along with a road leading to the local market square. This initiative also aims to finish all the necessary landscaping work to create a better environment. The whole project will affect an area of 11,600 m² to make the national park a modern and vibrant place to visit.\n\nRead also Hungary Helps: It’s factually clear that Christianity is the world’s most persecuted religion\n\nSource: magyarepitok.hu",

Our national team has worked hard for this, but it also deserves it thanks to the great development in recent years.”\n\nKirály also spoke of the Hungarian players in the Bundesliga and how it serves as an advantage for their national team.\n\n“I’m very happy that these guys are here; each of them has Bundesliga experience,” said Király. “It’s also very good for our young players. These five players know what German football has given them. If you understand that, you can counter it. We are on a good way.”\n\nOf the five Hungarian players in the Bundesliga, Király said that Dominik Szoboszlai of RB Leipzig will be their key player.\n\nHungary’s coach received praise for the recent improvements to the team from Király, who revealed what their biggest strength is.\n\n“The self-confidence of every single player has increased significantly. With Marco Rossi we have a great strategist as national coach. He’s doing a great job and has a good tactical instinct,” Király said. “Marco knows Hungarian football and our country very well. He knows where the talent is, and which experienced players he needs. He has everything under control. I’m glad we have such a clear-headed coach. His strategic thinking is always right.”\n\n“The strength of the team is their unity. This is very strong with us. The quality of the German players is maybe a bit better, but as a team we can cause problems for Germany,” Király continued. “If it works collectively with the Germans, then we must be careful. In the past few games, Hansi Flick (former Bayern Munich coach)’s players didn’t seem so focused.”\n\nSpeaking about Hungary’s chances against Germany, Király is confident of getting a result against Flick’s men.\n\n“We’re not afraid of Germany, but, as already mentioned, we’ve gained a lot of self-confidence in the past,” Király said. “The last duels were very close. Of course, as the leaders of the table, we believe in a win against the Germans.”",
    "What Makes Hungarian Blue Pumpkins Unique?": "What Makes Hungarian Blue Pumpkins Unique?\n\nIf you have ever meandered the stalls of a farmer's market and spotted what appears to be a pumpkin, but instead of its usual classic orange color, the skin appears to be a strange, ethereal, and almost eerie light grey-blue, your eyes haven't deceived you. The grey pumpkin has not been painted for a Tim Burton film or manipulated for decorative purposes, but is actually a variety of squash or pumpkin called the Hungarian blue pumpkin.\n\nAccording to Graines de Vie, this variety was discovered in Budapest by agriculturist Philippe Desbrosses in 1983, and given the name Hungarian blue pumpkin due to its unique pale blue-grey color. However, the inside of the pumpkin reveals a flesh similar to the more traditional orange pumpkins: orange-yellow. It's a delicious and atypical variety of pumpkin that is not only unique looking but also very sweet, dense, and versatile, to be used in a variety of recipes both sweet and savory.",

There are a significant number of Germans living in and around the village, many of them claiming a dual German-Hungarian identity.\n\nThe Villány wine region is one of Hungary’s prime wine tourism destinations, with the Villány-Siklós Wine Route, which has been active since 1994, linking the region’s tourism service providers. The region is particularly ideal for the Cabernet Franc grape variety, which has also given rise to the Villány Franc wine brand.\n\nFeatured photo via Pixabay",
    "Letta says Lega’s far-right stronghold town is a ‘province of Hungary’": "Pontida, a town located in Lombardy, traditionally the venue for the annual mass gathering of the far-right Lega, is a “province of Hungary”, Partito Democratico (PD) leader Enrico Letta said.\n\nLetta issued the statement to criticise Lega leader Matteo Salvini’s strong similarities with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s rhetoric.\n\nSpeaking at a PD gathering in Monza with the participation of 500 affiliated mayors, Letta said he does not want the “illiberal model” to be a reality in Italy.\n\n“Italy cannot be a country that cedes to Putin and Orbán […] We want Italy to be the heart of Europe and loyal to its alliances”, he stated.\n\nA few kilometres away in Pontida, Salvini vowed to his far-right supporters a solid and lasting right government.\n\n“This is Italy, full of hope and dreams and looking to the future,” Salvini told the crowd in the northern town of Pontida.\n\nItaly's Salvini fires up base in northern fiefdom Italy’s anti-immigration leader Matteo Salvini, who is trailing the far-right’s Giorgia Meloni in the polls ahead of next week’s general election, sought on Sunday (18 September) to galvanise his hard-right, populist, eurosceptic base.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, the right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni (Brothers of Italy – European Conservatives and Reformists/ECR) with Matteo Salvini’s Lega (ID group in European Parliament) and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (European People’s Party) is projected to win the 25 September elections against Letta’s left-wing coalition.\n\n“Me, Giorgia and Silvio agree on almost everything, and for five years, we will govern well and together”, Salvini said, stressing that there will be “no jokes and changes” on their joint “sacred” electoral program.\n\nOrbán puts the right coalition to the test\n\nLast week in Strasbourg, EU lawmakers adopted a report underlining that the Hungarian government is undermining EU values and as, therefore, could become a “hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.”\n\n“Orbán has won the elections, several times even by a wide margin, with all the rest of the constitutional arc lined up against him: it is a democratic system,” Meloni told the media in defence of the Hungarian prime minister.\n\nItaly’s Meloni backs Orbán, says Hungary is ‘democratic’ Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has won elections in Hungary and is therefore a democratic leader, the far-right frontrunner in the Italian elections, Giorgia Meloni, said on Friday (16 September), contradicting a European Parliament resolution that concluded Hungary can no longer be defined as a democracy.\n\nSalvini’s Lega also backs the Hungarian leader, but Forza Italia’s Silvio Berlusconi keeps some distance in. an effort not to break the line of his EU political family, which has kicked out Orban’s Fidesz party from its ranks.\n\nParticularly, Berlusconi said it was “undeniable” Orbán is a democratically elected leader and that he should be respected as such.\n\nBut he added: “It is crystal clear that our point of reference in Europe is the European People’s Party; it certainly cannot be Orbán.

    "Hungary and the New Reactionary Vanguardism": "THE BRITISH historian AJP Taylor believed that there was a unique historical contradiction in Hungary, claiming that the “strongest resistance, culminating in revolt, came in Hungary, where the claim to traditional rights gave a spurious air of liberalism to the defence of social privileges.” As a result, the Hungarian system was a compromise, where a blend of agrarian conservatism thrived with the traditional nationalist instinct of mid-nineteenth-century liberalism, positioned amidst surrounding imperial actors. “The central event in the history of Hungary in the nineteenth century was the compromise between the magnates and the lesser nobility; this was the essential prelude to the compromise between Hungary and the Habsburgs, which preserved the antiquated social order in Hungary until the twentieth century,” Taylor wrote, adding that “middle class, the lesser nobility, existed only in Hungary; and in Hungary the intellectuals, even if Slovak or Rumanian by origin, could become ‘Magyar’ like the gentry.”\n\nThis realism in Hungary is historical, and the country’s history helps shed some light on this unique blend of political reaction and narrow national interest. Hungary has long been an outlier surrounded by changing and fluid political actors—a rebellious but simultaneously reactionary holdover amidst a sea of imperial progress, where imperialism was often paradoxically the liberalizing progressive force, favoring industry as opposed to an agrarian localized lesser nobility.\n\nOne of the most visible features of Hungary’s reactionary governance is that it positions itself against a predominantly liberal-imperial officer class (in this case, from the European Union), which is more cosmopolitan, and overtly opposed to any nationalist or homogenous centrifugal force—thereby making the imperial edifice increasingly more authoritarian. The European Union (EU) has often been likened to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the same internal dynamics of political reaction from the days of the Habsburgs are still visible in central Europe—just in newer forms.\n\nThis particular form of political governance constitutes a form of “reactionary vanguardism.” Similar to every interesting (and influential) new social movement that is often a study in contradictions, conservatism in Hungary is at once historical with philosophical continuity, while novel in form. It is debated and implemented by a vanguard party with a determined cadre, but towards reactionary ends. This vanguardism is liberalizing (so to speak) and defies supranational—and often imperial—politics originating from both Brussels and Washington, but it is also against a certain version of social progress which is brought on by the same supranational and imperial top-down measures. It is, just as AJP Taylor once noted, a study in contradictions.\n\nENTER VIKTOR Orbán, whose very specific model of reactionary governance provides an example of what such a reactionary system might look like in operation and administration. For the ascending global post-liberal “New Right,” Hungary is what Sweden has been to neoliberalism, feminism, and democratic socialism: a functioning model. As recently as in May 2022, the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted its first international conference in Budapest. Theoretical analyses of this new emergent form of political reaction, however, are sparse. Political scientist Dorit Geva categorized it as Ordonationalism, or a form of authoritarian and hyper-nationalist neoliberalism. But that is merely a descriptive term, and does not lend much analytical or historical validity, nor does it explain Orbán’s much-vaunted family bursary programs—which are most definitely opposed to all tenets of neoliberalism. In a speech given to students in 2014, Orbán declared:\n\nWhat is happening in Hungary today can accordingly be interpreted by stating that the prevailing political leadership has today attempted to ensure that people’s personal work and interests, which must be acknowledged, are closely linked to the life of the community and the nation, and that this relationship is preserved and reinforced. In other words, the Hungarian nation is not simply a group of individuals but a community that must be organized, reinforced and in fact constructed. And so in this sense the new state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state. It does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom, and I could list a few more, but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organization, but instead includes a different, special, national approach.\n\nThat was arguably the first, but not the only or last time, that Viktor Orbán elucidated on a new form of government. On one hand, it is a system that is somewhat statist in shaping the levers of politics, the judiciary, and resources. On the other hand, the party in question is distinctly socially conservative in outlook and reactionary in tactics and approach. Non-academic literature and pop journalism also neglect the internal contradictions of a reactionary-but-vanguardist system and fail to explain Orbán’s popularity—as well as the rise of post-liberalism elsewhere in the West. In that regard, Hungary is somewhat considered a model, where a version of “National Conservatism” is currently being implemented and institutionalized (at least, according to Balázs Orbán at the November 2021 National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Florida).\n\nThere is, of course, no one comprehensive theory of reactionary politics—much less a reactionary organizing principle or theory of governance. Within the Anglosphere, the National Conservative movement that has emerged in the United States and the United Kingdom post-2016—which is especially focused on harnessing state power—has gradually devolved into two camps. The first is post-liberals disaffected with the current form of liberalism, mostly focused on free speech and the cultural revolution, who argue that real liberalism has never been tried and progressivism is a deviation from liberalism. The second consists of the true reactionaries, primarily focused on power transition and governance, who claim that progressivism is a natural and logical endpoint of liberalism. In continental Europe, while there has been a steady increase in right-wing politics, those on the Right are far from united, nor do they possess a coherent set of principles or even a unifying worldview.\n\nFurthermore, the war in Ukraine jeopardized all political alignments, with Hungary finding itself on the side of a pragmatic and status-quo favoring Germany and France, while Poland finds itself alongside the hyper-liberal Baltic states and a post-Brexit Britain pushing further brinkmanship in Europe (at no cost to itself). Immediately prior to the 2022 Hungarian election, Orbán channeling an arch-realist sentiment proclaimed:\n\nWe’re caught in the crossfire between major geopolitical players: NATO has been expanding eastwards, and Russia has become less and less comfortable with that. The Russians made two demands: that Ukraine declare its neutrality, and that NATO would not admit Ukraine. These security guarantees weren’t given to the Russians, so they decided to take them by force of arms. This is the geopolitical significance of this war. The Russians are redrawing the security map of the continent. Russia’s security policy vision is that, in order to feel safe, they must be surrounded by a neutral zone. Hitherto they’ve seen Ukraine as an intermediate zone and, having failed to make it neutral by diplomatic means, they now want to make it neutral by military force.\n\nIS ORBÁNISM a theoretically sound and coherent enough ideology that can survive and spread, either by adaptation or imitation, in the Anglosphere? At the time of writing, Orbán was facing enormous and ever-increasing pressure from centralized European institutions as well as individual progressive parties based in the western EU core—even after winning at home for the fourth time. While the Ukraine war resulted in absurd coalitions, the greater structural challenge of the EU remains the same. Outside of the war, a progressive bloc is forming within Europe: a centralizing ideological movement that prefers continent-wide campaigns against “far-right” groups, as well as actively funding and promoting abortion and LGBTQ rights in Poland and Hungary. The Hungarian government courted conservatives in the United States, but on the other hand, partly as a reaction, also was the only EU country not invited to the touted Democracy Summit in the United States. Recently, Hungarian foreign minister Péter Szijjártó complained that Hillary Clinton’s remarks regarding the Democracy Summit proved that “the event has a domestic political character, with invitations withheld from countries whose leaders had good ties with former President Donald Trump…We need nobody to judge the state of Hungarian democracy as if in a school exam.”\n\nOf all the core tenets of Orbánism, the ideas of foreign policy and control of the domestic narrative are the two most important. In his speech at CPAC in Budapest, Orbán mentioned this winning combination. “Progressives always think that foreign policy is a battle of ideologies: a battle between good and bad, in which the course of history will be decided once and for all,” Orbán said. “We need foreign policy based on our interests. Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine the victim. But at the same time we know that Ukraine is not defending Hungary.” But how to promote this narrow national interest and realism, amidst a sea of progressive internationalism?",

    "As Europe Shivers, Hungary Has Heat": "On the eve of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was widely referred to as the “sick man of Europe.\" Today, it is Europe that seems like a sick man, threatening to cut off its own life support. While the United States also seems to be struggling with soaring energy prices—one in six U.S. homes have fallen behind on their energy bills, Bloomberg reports—the pace and passion of the ritual harakiri committed by Europe is particularly remarkable.\n\n“First the food and then the morale: should one make peace with Putin in order not to have to freeze in winter?”—so went the headline of the liberal Neue Zürcher Zeitung, one of the oldest Swiss newspapers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s look at the heart of the E.U. in economic and political terms: Germany. The average German household consumes roughly 1,700 cubic meters of gas a year; according to current data from a price comparison portal, a German citizen has to pay 3,240 euros for utilities—almost three times what the price was a year ago. But another increase in prices is expected soon: from October, utility costs for Germans may increase by up to a thousand euros. RheinEnergie, which supplies the big German city of Cologne, is more than doubling the price of residential gas.\n\nGrim warnings have also been issued to German citizens. “Germany could face blackouts and power grid collapse due to electric heaters,\" warned Peter Lautz, head of the Stadtwerke Wiesbaden Netz utility company, which supplies 170,000 customers with electricity. Georg Friedrichs, head of Berlin's Gasag—one of Europe's largest regional gas suppliers—suggested that the temperature of homes should not be higher than 18 degrees Celsius (64 degrees Fahrenheit), but “the young and fit can get through the winter with two sweaters and a little climbing on the stairs.\"\n\nRest assured: German municipalities are working on a solution. The Socialist mayor of Ludwigshafen, Jutta Steinruck, has promised that people will be housed in halls used for mass sporting events and concerts where there will be heating free of charge. The management of the city of Hannover has also made a painful decision: in the future, public buildings, swimming pools, sports halls, and gyms will have access to cold water only.\n\nThe problems will not stop here. German industry is the engine of the economy of the E.U., and its emergency braking will gravely affect the rest of the continent. In 2020, energy costs for BASF and fellow German groups Evonik (worth $9 billion), Wacker Chemie ($7 billion), and Covestro ($6 billion) accounted for an average of 5 percent of their costs of goods sold, according to UBS. This year, they’ll be over 40 percent, writes Reuters.\n\nThis might lead not only to a severe setback in German industry but to widespread social tensions. In light of the current energy crisis, Nancy Faeser, Interior Minister of Germany (Social Democrats) has spoken of her fears of “radical street protests.” The German people have gotten used to a very high quality of life since the reunification of the Eastern and Western half of the country in 1990. They will not tolerate struggling with their bills for long. We can expect Germany to see mass protests like what we have seen in Czechia lately. The response of the old right is not much different from that of the new left: the Interior Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Christian Democrat Herbert Reul, called those planning to protest the rising energy prices “new enemies of the state.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind: most of the articles cited here merely assumed a reduced capacity of gas flow through the Nord Stream 1, and not the full stop. Incidentally, Gazprom has just announced the indefinite shutdown of said pipeline. The real question is not whether Germany will be able to pay for gas, but whether there will be gas at all. Yet the European tactic—with Germany at the helm, and Joe Biden’s approval in the background—seems to be arming Ukraine boundlessly, thereby prolonging the war indefinitely, sending the E.U. to its knees.\n\nWhy has the war found Europe in such a vulnerable position? If we are to believe the \"Stuttgart Declaration\"—a document prepared by twenty leading German university lecturers in defense of nuclear energy—it was the unilateral focus on solar, wind, and natural gas, that has maneuvered Germany into an energy shortage and uncertainty of supply that \"threatens competitiveness and prosperity.\" While Russia was stockpiling gold and modernizing its military, Western Europe was busy preparing for a modern “end of days” vision, the ever-delayed “Green apocalypse.\" Now Germany seems to backtrack on shutting down its final nuclear reactors and its coal power plants could be restarted soon. An energy expert told German public service media that the country will need to import more than 30 million tons of coal this winter. Germany has sizable ports, but they are overbooked, and it is questionable whether they will be able to cope with this quantity.\n\nAt the same time, rising energy prices have helped Russia earn EUR 93 billion in revenue from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days of the invasion of Ukraine—according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clear Air. The European Union obtains 40 percent of its natural gas imports from Russia, but the loss of the European market will not affect Putin sensitively in the long run, as he will probably find a ready market in China and Turkey in the coming years. As Rod Dreher has observed in these pages, slaying “Slava Ukraini” won’t help the unemployed and freezing this winter, while Putin has his “last laugh.\"\n\nThe globalist elite just doesn’t seem to care. Radek Sikorski, ex-Foreign Minister of Poland and liberal MEP, has recently summarized this view well in a lecture held at Hungary’s MCC Feszt. In my own description of the event: “Sikorski was recently in Washington and was very pleased with the elite's support for Ukraine.… There will be peace only if we help Ukraine enough for Putin to realize that he cannot win in what he is doing. The Ukrainians are fighting our fight, concluded Sikorski. According to him, sanctions always harm both sides, but the point is that it hurts the Russians. Russia should have been sanctioned much earlier and much more strongly.\"\n\nGerman Economic Minister Robert Habeck, a Green, reminds us of an impotent witch-doctor of plague-era Europe: “We still have a very critical winter ahead of us. We have to expect that Putin will further reduce the gas.\" But according to some, freezing is the new normal. “Europe is in for 5 to 10 'difficult' winters,\" Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Liberal Democrats) coolly predicted. Is it so crazy then to believe that the globalists don’t care what the people of Europe want? German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Green Party) will gladly help us settle the question (German fact-checkers have claimed that this quote was distorted in the pro-Russian media, so I have used the original German transcript here):\n\n“If I make this promise to the Ukrainians: 'We will be by your side as long as you need us,' then I would like to deliver, no matter what my German voters think, I would like to deliver for the Ukrainian population.… This means that every measure I take must last as long as Ukraine needs me.… And we now have the winter season ahead of us, where the challenge we face as democratic politicians is that citizens will take to the streets and say, 'We can no longer pay our energy bills.' And I say: 'Yes, I know, and we will help you with social measures,' but I don't want to say, 'Ok, then we will stop the sanctions against Russia.' We are on Ukraine's side.\"\n\nSure enough, recently a social package has been announced by the German government; it is worth less than one third of the Covid-19 industry relief package. Will the people accept this as compensation for such immense self-imposed damage?\n\nThe Old Testament spoke of burnt offerings to please God. The modern religion of liberalism has conjured a new term: ice-cold offerings. The people of Europe wanted to sacrifice for Ukraine, but now they are the ones being sacrificed.\n\nAmong the E.U. countries, Hungary is the only one where panic over Russian gas has not prevailed—wrote RIA Novosti, a Russian state-owned news agency. This is one of those rare cases when you can trust Russian news. In September and October, Gazprom will supply a maximum of 5.8 million cubic meters more natural gas per day to Hungary via Serbia than the amount specified in the previous long-term contract, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó recently announced. His philosophy seems to be different from that of the above-cited Baerbock: “The purchase of natural gas or the origin of natural gas is not a political position, but a hard, vital physical reality…. I cannot look at the issue of energy supply through an ideological lens. They can label me Gazprom's whatever, if that's the price to keep people warm.”\n\nHungary currently has gas stored for 76 normal winter days. Stockpiling, however, didn’t start yesterday. Nearly four billion cubic meters of natural gas were stored in the five Hungarian gas storage facilities until August, which is 226.7 million cubic meters more than the amount prescribed by the E.U. The amount stored so far is 98 percent of the annual residential consumption. This means that Hungary is the fourth best in the E.U. in terms of storing natural gas in proportion to its consumption. The government decided earlier that about 700 million cubic meters of natural gas should be procured in addition to the quantities already contracted, and the recently announced purchase from Gazprom is part of this important acquisition.\n\nThis was just one among the many steps announced this summer by the government to deal with the current energy crisis. Hungary is also considering restarting the mining and extraction of lignite and the launching of new blocks for the Mátra coal power plant. At the same time, the government is supporting a new program for the exploration and production of natural gas assets and light oil in Hungary; in some places, production will start early next year. This might come as a surprise if we think that the expression “right wing” necessarily means “small government.” However, the Hungarian right firmly believes that the power of the state is a possible means of helping the people in times of crisis.\n\nIn reaction to the rising energy costs, the Hungarian government has also decided to alter its previous utility cost-reduction program, while still preserving the core of the measure. In the case of natural gas, people will pay a reduced price up to a consumption of 1,729 m3/year per place of use. In the case of electricity, they'll pay up to a consumption of 2523 kWh/year per place of use. In the case of electricity, the reduced price is HUF 36 (8 cents) per kWh and in the case of natural gas, HUF 102 (25 cents) per cubic meter. But all families with three children or more automatically receive the reduced utility prices: there are 300,000 such large families living in Hungary today.\n\nSo how many people will this measure help? Around 1 million people living in big families will be helped, while 4.2 million out of 5.6 million electricity consumers and 2.6 million out of 3.5 million gas consumers are at an average consumption or below. In a country of 10 million people, this is a rather amazing achievement—definitely more than what many left-wing governments can boast. According to a survey commissioned by the Austrian regulatory authority, Energie-Control Austria and the Hungarian Energy and Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, Budapest remains the continent's cheapest capital in terms of utility costs. It is guaranteed that some Hungarian cities will experience similar spending and energy cutbacks as Germany, but so far, the predictions are not as grim.\n\nWhile my friends all around Europe are complaining about the previously unimaginable utility bills they are receiving, I am getting the same bills as before, even after the above-mentioned changes: around $30 for gas and around the same for electricity, altogether not more than $60. We are a normal family of three, using gas for heating, hot water, and cooking.\n\nConversations overheard on trains, while subjective, can be a good indicator of public mood. The conversations I’m hearing in Hungary revolve around people switching from holidays abroad to domestic destinations, draining garden pools, and canceling preordered designer bags. Conversations in Germany revolve around surviving the winter. Is it a surprise then that German comments in social media vastly support Orbán, saying things like: “Orbán is doing what the people elected him to do”? (If you read Hungarian, click on this excellent collection of such comments).\n\nBack in 2013 it was the European Union that took legal action against Hungary—and failed—because of the then-nascent Hungarian utility cost-reduction program. Fast forward 9 years: “Europe needs to impose a price cap on Russian pipeline gas, E.U. Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, to foil what she said were Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempts to manipulate the bloc’s energy market.” Von der Leyen is not the only one to come around. As several European states are struggling with the consequences of the sanctions, energy prices in the Netherlands have doubled in one year. The Liberal Dutch government is now planning to introduce a comprehensive family protection subsidy, modeled after the Hungarian government. Spain and Portugal, both of left-wing leadership, have also announced similar measures. Most E.U. governments are now eyeing fixed prices, tax reductions, or subsidies. There’s a Hungarian saying, perhaps difficult to translate: “Hungarians are not right, but in the end, they will be proven right.\"\n\nAt the same time, in the mind of some liberal E.U. leaders, Soviet-type reactions are sparked. Hungary has also banned the exporting of energy carriers, including firewood—drawing the ire of these politicians, who have implied on a number of occasions that energy carriers might have to be redistributed on an E.U. scale between the member states in the future. Orbán, widely labeled the “bad guy” for talking to Putin and buying his gas, might just save Europe in the end.",
    "Why the U.S. Is Being Ominously Compared to Hungary and Turkey": "First, society polarizes, often over a backlash to social change, to demographic change, to strengthening political power by racial, ethnic or religious minorities, and generally amid rising social distrust.\n\nThis leads to a bottom-up desire for populist outsiders who will promise to confront the supposed threat within, which means suppressing the other side of that social or partisan or racial divide, asserting a vision of democracy that grants special status for “my” side, and smashing the democratic institutions or norms that prevent that side from asserting what is perceived to be its rightful dominance.\n\nYou also tend to see political parties and other establishment gatekeepers, who are in theory meant to keep authoritarians from rising in politics, either weaken or become co-opted. Once populist hard-liners gain enough power to begin eroding democratic checks, such as an independent judiciary or the rule of law, it’s usually a steady slide toward democratic erosion.\n\nThis trend has really picked up speed, globally, only in the last 20 years or so. So it’s hard to say exactly how common it is for countries that begin on this path to end up like Hungary or Turkey. But very few democracies have begun to slide and then reversed course.\n\nYou have a new book called “The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World.” In your reporting and research for the book, what sorts of effects on democracy did you find social media is having? I’m old enough to remember when techno-evangelists like Clay Shirky were predicting that social media would unleash a wave of democratization in the developing world. Obviously, that hasn’t happened. Or has it?\n\nI had that same arc of initially seeing social media as a democratizing force.\n\nSo did a lot of Arab Spring activists from the early 2010s, like Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian revolutionary and Google engineer. But, within a few years, Ghonim had come to conclude, he has said in a TED Talk, that “the same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart” by “amplifying the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech.”",
    "Ryanair cancels Hungary routes over windfall tax dispute": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair announced Tuesday that it will cancel several routes through Hungary and cut flights on several more following a months-long dispute with the country’s government over a special windfall tax placed on airlines.\n\nThe Ireland-based company’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, said at a press conference in Hungary’s capital that Ryanair had planned to launch 10 new routes through Budapest and base an additional airplane at its airport this winter.\n\n“Sadly, however, those plans have now fallen at the altar of the Hungarian government’s decision to impose a ludicrous and idiotic excess profits tax on the airline sector, which has reported record losses,” O’Leary said.\n\nInstead of expanding its presence in Hungary as planned to more than 5 million passengers next year, Ryanair will eliminate eight of its previously operating 53 routes through Budapest while imposing frequency cuts on seven more, he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis will reduce the company’s yearly passenger load in Hungary from 4.5 million to under 4 million, he added.\n\nThe decision came in response to Hungary’s government fining the low-cost airline more than 750,000 euros ($753,000) in August for alleged consumer protection violations. The fine came after the company raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the government calls “extra profits” of industries ranging from airlines to banks.\n\nThe nationalist government argued that such industries have enjoyed windfall profits arising from soaring demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, and should contribute to the country’s economic recovery .\n\nBut on Tuesday, O’Leary said Ryanair had posted 1.26 billion euros in losses in the last two years, and that targeting it and other airlines with excess profits taxes was “inexplicable.”\n\n“We cannot get any explanation from the Hungarian government as to why an industry or a sector which is making record losses is being asked to pay excess profits,” O’Leary said.\n\nRyanair will appeal the “bogus” fine imposed on it by Hungary’s consumer protection authority in Hungarian courts, O’Leary said, adding that “we confidently expect we will lose,” but that the company will then appeal in European Union courts.\n\nHe also took a swipe at Hungary’s consumer protection agency, questioning its independence and accusing it of taking political cues from the Minister of Justice in imposing the fine.\n\n“It’s not too late for the Hungarian government to realize the error of their ways,” O’Leary said. “The future of Hungarian tourism and industry lies entirely on making Hungary an attractive destination and a low-cost, competitive destination here in Central Europe.”",
    "Hungary to launch national consultation on EU sanctions against Russia": "Hungary’s ruling Fidesz-KDNP party alliance is calling on the government to launch a new \"National Consultation\" on European Union sanctions against Russia, Mate Kocsis, the leader of the parliamentary group of governing Fidesz, announced on September 22 after the closed faction meeting of the ruling party.\n\nKocsis said they are asking the government to conduct a public survey so that Hungarians can have their say on the matter, making them the first in Europe who can express their opinion on the topic.\n\nKocsis said he expects from the survey that the governing parties will find out what the Hungarians think about the EU sanctions against Russia, and they will be able to refer to the opinions of the Hungarians in upcoming European debates. This is an attempt to put political pressure on the European Union, he added.\n\nThe largest opposition party DK said it is pointless to consult on EU sanctions against Russia, which the PM has approved \"one by one\".\n\nThe national consultation surveys used by the government since 2011 are widely seen as a political and communicational tool to thematise public discourse and show support for the government on a given topic. It is also a way to build up a database of supporters. As the cabinet is spending billions in surveying the public mood, the outcome of the surveys, based on simplified questions, reflects the government’s position. So far 11 such consultations were held, using billions in taxpayer money for what is in effect propaganda for the ruling party.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia is no longer a local war, sanctions have turned it into a global economic war, Hungary’s strongman told MPs at the closed fraction meeting on Wednesday. He asked the members of his faction to do everything possible to ensure that Europe withdraws sanctions by the end of the year at the latest.\n\nOrban has also signalled that he will try to oppose an eigth round of EU sanctions against the Kremlin, though up until now, Hungary has gone along with the sanctions, though it won concessions on the crude oil boycott that takes effect in December.\n\nAs inflation is reaching a multi-decade high, and the energy crisis is hitting households and businesses, Hungary’s government has ratcheted up its stance against the sanctions against Russia.\n\nViktor Orban has repeatedly blamed EU sanctions for runaway prices and said that if the sanctions were lifted, energy prices would immediately halve and inflation would fall.\n\nBut as analysts had pointed out, Hungary’s inflation had been one of the highest in Europe before the war and the government introduced price caps on fuel and half a dozen food staples before the election.\n\nOrban’s latest move to hold a survey on sanctions is another way of shifting the blame for economic woes following a procyclical and expansive fiscal policy in recent years and a pre-election spending splurge that left the state budget in a difficult position, according to analysts.",
