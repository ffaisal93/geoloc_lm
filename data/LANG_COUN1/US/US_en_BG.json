    "Former Bulgarian minister slams the country’s ‘neutral’ stance on Ukraine": "Bulgarian former foreign minister Ivailo Kalfin criticised his country’s stance in the context of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, insisting that calls for “neutrality” were completely out of place.\n\nKalfin, board member of EURACTIV.bg and Dublin-based executive director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), made the comments in an interview for Bulgarian national radio.\n\nBulgarians will vote in snap elections on Sunday, with the war in Ukraine looming large in the campaign.\n\nThe leader of the pro-Russian force “Vazrazhdane” (Revival) Kostadin Kostadinov has reiterated his demand of “full neutrality of Bulgaria in the Ukraine war, and leaders and organisations of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) too have made calls for neutrality.\n\nAccording to Kalfin, there is a mood both in Bulgaria and in other countries to stop aid to Ukraine to quickly end the war, but “this means that Russia will quickly achieve its goals”:\n\n“Obviously, Putin’s ideas are to expand the territory of Russia. This is obviously unacceptable. This is why Bulgaria should not be neutral”, he said.\n\nKalfin emphasised that Russia has lost a huge part of its influence in international relations.\n\n“One of the problems is that Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is the most authoritative organisation that should speak on such issues, including the preservation of territorial integrity. With its behaviour, Russia is liquidating this function of the Security Council, which can no longer work effectively”, he said.\n\nOn the referendums currently being organised in the four Russian-controlled regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Kalfin said that without any doubt, the international community will not accept their results.\n\nOn replacing Russian gas in Europe, Kalfin was more doubtful, claiming that it cannot be completely replaced – though “Russia cannot redirect its supplies from Europe to China and India, for example.. For logistical reasons, Russia cannot sell it there in such quantities.”\n\nHe also commented on the attempts of the caretaker government to engage in negotiations with Gazprom for resuming gas supplies, which the Russian monopolist stopped completely in April.\n\n“These attempts are frivolous. Gazprom is not a supplier of cheap gas to Bulgaria, this is not an option and will not be an alternative. Gazprom” will use the gas as a political weapon, and some political parties in our country will gladly help them play this game. In general – if you are obedient to the Kremlin, you can get some crumbs, which is insulting to Bulgaria and should not happen. I do not expect negotiations with Gazprom to lead to a result and to alternative cheap gas for our country.”\n\n(Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bg)",

    "Bulgarian Parliamentary Candidate Too Busy To Campaign As He Fights In Ukraine": "Politicians in Bulgaria are crisscrossing the Balkan country of nearly 7 million to convince voters to cast ballots for them in snap parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2.\n\nBut one candidate, Ivan Kalchev, is not on the campaign trail, but the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nKalchev traveled to Ukraine in early March to join up with the foreign legion organized by Kyiv, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\nIn fact, Kalchev told RFE/RL's Bulgarian Service that he is now taking part in the Ukrainian counteroffensive. \"Everything was very well prepared and organized and there is nothing accidental about the successes,\" Kalchev stated, adding that life on the battlefield is nothing like in the movies.\n\nUkraine's much-anticipated counterattack launched early this month has dealt not only a blow to Russia's military but provided Ukrainians with hope amid what has been a dramatic change in momentum.\n\nKalchev has been awed by the reaction of overjoyed Ukrainians in freed towns and villages. \"With joy, with pride, with tears in my eyes, I just see how these people are happy to be freed,\" Kalchev told RFE/RL from an undisclosed location.\n\nShortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to foreigners willing to help defend Ukraine and join the fight.\n\nWATCH: Soldiers from around the world continue to join Ukraine's foreign legion, motivated by the need to help with \"the most important conflict in the last 50 years,\" as one American volunteer put it.\n\nThe government even set up a website for them to join the international brigade, which is now thought to number in the thousands, with one recent estimate putting the figure at some 20,000.\n\nFighting For Reform\n\nAs Kalchev helps Ukraine reclaim its land from invading Russian forces, back at home politicians are battling for ballots.\n\nBulgaria -- a member of the European Union and NATO -- is holding early parliamentary elections on October 2, the fourth such poll in less than two years amid much political instability.\n\nThe reformist government led by Kiril Petkov collapsed in June, six months after one of its coalition partners quit. Petkov, who heads the We Continue the Change (PP) party, which came to power in November 2021, has struggled to deliver on his pledge to stamp out corruption.\n\nHe has also backed Ukraine in its fight against Russia in a country traditionally friendly toward Moscow.\n\nPetkov fired Defense Minister Stefan Yanev for his reluctance to describe the Russian invasion as a war. In June, Petkov expelled 70 Russian diplomatic staff, accusing them of working against Sofia's interests.\n\nFrom Star Student To Soldier\n\nKalchev was a star student in Sofia, graduating from the National High School of Natural Sciences with honors, before studying physics and information technology at university.\n\nAs a kid, his schoolmates called him \"Gligi\" for the necklace he wore adorned with the teeth of wild boars -- gligi in Bulgarian.\n\nIn eighth grade, he befriended Vladimir Yonchev, the founder and editor in chief of the OffNews website, https://offnews.bg/ who told RFE/RL that Kalchev was \"one of the smartest people he knows.\" Yonchev said he also studied physics, computer science, and politics, while spending his remaining free time riding his motorcycle or melding metal in the special furnace he built himself.\n\nYonchev also recalls how Kalchev's political passion led to his joining the Green Movement party in 2013, rising through its leadership ranks over the years. Members of the environmentally friendly Green Movement were at the vanguard of anti-government protests that swept Bulgaria in 2020-21.\n\nBut despite his rich and impressive background, there was one thing Kalchev lacked, especially given his current location and vocation: military training. In fact, just a week before he set off for Ukraine, Kalchev said he got his first training.\n\nIn the early months of the war, Kalchev didn't see any military action. Instead, he carried out multiple tasks, from translating -- he speaks English -- to troubleshooting -- making sure the Starlink Internet satellite connection was working -- to even evacuating the wounded, he recounted in an interview with OffNews in late June.\n\nThat all changed, Kalchev told RFE/RL, shortly after Ukraine's military launched its counteroffensive, largely in the northeastern corner of the country.\n\nRussian forces suffered a stunning reversal this month after Ukrainian troops made a rapid armored thrust with special forces in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, forcing a sometimes rushed and chaotic Russian withdrawal.\n\nZelenskiy said on September 14 that his army had liberated around 8,000 square kilometers.\n\nIt's been the swiftest advance by Ukrainian forces since driving Russian forces away from the capital of Kyiv in March, and some analysts say it has turned the tide of the seven-month invasion.\n\nFor Kalchev, modern warfare has little in common with its portrayal in Hollywood films, with lots of time spent doing nothing, just waiting.\n\nThat all changed abruptly when the counteroffensive started and sleep became much shorter, sometimes just two hours a night, Kalchev said.\n\nHe was awed at the array of military might the Ukrainians had at their disposal. \"Even in a computer game, I have never seen so many tanks and APCs (armored personnel carriers) as I saw there,\" Kalchev said.\n\nDespite the horrors of war, the reaction of those in freed towns and villages has buoyed his spirits. \"In all the villages we have liberated, people have taken to the streets, usually one main street that runs through the village. They come outside, with flags, with balloons, waving the flags, smiling at us and waving at every military vehicle that passes by,\" Kalchev said.\n\nCertain hazards remain in liberated territories, Kalchev points out, such as mines or unexploded artillery shells.\n\nIt's unclear how many Bulgarians are in Ukraine fighting on the side of Kyiv's forces. In the early days of the invasion, news emerged of a Bulgarian battalion in Ukraine. However, that later appeared to be nothing more than a social-media hoax, even though it was taken seriously enough to be debated in parliament.\n\nWith campaigning for the upcoming poll under way back home, Kalchev says he is reaching out to potential voters through a Facebook page that is maintained by his election team.\n\nKalchev is unsure whether he will return to Bulgaria by voting day on October 2, explaining that circumstances on the battlefield will probably conspire to make that impossible.\n\nKalchev is a candidate for the Green Movement, a member of the Democratic Bulgarian coalition, a grouping formed in 2018 that unites reform forces. \"The votes for us will be a test of how important geopolitics is to our voters,\" Kalchev explained.\n\nThe coalition has a pro-Western orientation and is demanding Bulgaria take a stronger stance in supporting Ukraine.\n\nTaking his cue from Ukraine, Kalchev said in a recent Facebook post that \"the counteroffensive in Bulgaria begins on October 2. Vote!\"\n\nWritten by Tony Wesolowsky based on reporting by Dilyana Teoharova of RFE/RL's Bulgarian Service",

The deal was completed in March.\n\nThe company's activities are centred on enabling digital start-ups and other businesses build sustainable IT teams to further the economic development of smaller urban areas, by meeting their needs for software and staff. The company facilitates technology projects in the areas of healthcare, renewable energy and education, with clients also hailing from the fintech, telecoms and media industries.\n\n\"Bulgaria was a logical next step for us as the market opportunities and people are a great culture and values match. We were looking to expand our presence and add EU delivery capabilities, and Bulgaria is a top contender in that regard,\" Bochev said.\n\nFounded in 2012, the Swedish company has a total workforce of around 600 and operations at home as well as in Poland and Ukraine. It was set up with a social impact in mind, prioritising the creation of sustainable teams, emphasising care for society and the environment as a key driving force.\n\nBeetroot said at the time of the acquisition of South Gate Tech that Bulgaria will be its second full-scale EU service centre, with Poland to follow in the near future.\n\nAccording to Bochev, Beetroot Bulgaria is not targeting a rapid local expansion, but is rather hand-picking a team of engineers with the goal of solidifying its capabilities, expanding its activity scope and presence in Bulgaria before looking elsewhere in Southeast Europe.\n\n\"We are always keeping our finger on the pulse to identify new opportunities, especially if we come across companies and partners that share our vision and mindset. With that said, we are committed and have a strong focus on Bulgaria specifically – we know that there’s a risk of losing a sense of quality and people-oriented attitude if we spread our attention too widely. A successful “Bulgaria story”, with measurable impact, means that we’ll be better prepared for future expansions,\" Bochev explained.\n\nLooking ahead, the consultancy sees itself opening a couple of Beetroot hubs around the country and locally launching Beetroot Academy, the company's Swedish-Ukrainian non-profit education arm.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Swedish parent company invested $50 million (51.7 million euro) in 2021, it said in a press release earlier this month.\n\n($ = 1.03355 euro)",

    "Bulgarian election woes leave power to president": "The upcoming elections, the fourth in less than two years, are unlikely to give Bulgaria a stable coalition, analysts predict, leaving the ruling of the Balkan EU member in the hands of a strong presidency and a grey undefined geopolitical zone between the West and Russia.\n\nSevere conflicts between the main political players make it almost impossible to form broad coalitions that can gather enough support to project stable governance.\n\nWhen asked if the political formula for what pundits call a “government of national salvation” after the upcoming 2 October parliamentary elections is possible, political scientist Georgi Kiryakov replied, “Bulgaria does not need national salvation.”\n\n“This is a propaganda cliché”, Kiryakov said, pointing out, “Bulgaria is not in such a dire economic, financial and social situation that it needs national salvation.”\n\nAccording to the analyst, while there are problems with inflation and some sectors of the economy because of gas prices, the situation is not “dire.”\n\n“There is a need for a stable government, including a coalition one, which is not emerging at this stage,” he added.\n\nThe latest survey by the Exakta agency shows that GERB (EPP), the party of former prime minister Boyko Borissov continues to find itself in political isolation, being blamed for corruption in the country by almost all opponents, has the support of 26.2% of Bulgarians.\n\n“We continue the change”, which gave Bulgaria its last prime minister Kiril Petkov, is second with 18.1%.\n\nThe third place is contested between the Russia-leaning Bulgarian Socialist Party (12.5%) and the anti-European pro-Russian party Vazrazhdane (9.5%), as well as the party of the Turkish minority DPS (10.3%), which relies on great support from Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin who live in Turkey.\n\nThe pro-European “Democratic Bulgaria” has the support of 7.5%, the populist “There is such a people”, which caused the fall of the last reformist government that was in office for just over six months, with 5.4%, trailed by the conservative pro-Russian “Bulgarian Rise” (4%).\n\nWith GERB politically isolated and “We continue the change” unlikely to gather enough support to form a government, political analysts assume that at the beginning of next year, the Bulgarians will be forced to vote for the fifth time and that President Rumen Radev will continue to rule Bulgaria as a presidential, instead of a parliamentary, republic.\n\nIf no stable government is formed, Bulgaria will continue to be governed by a caretaker government appointed by Radev. The country’s constitution gives enormous power to the president in a situation with an overthrown government and a dissolved parliament. At these times, he could rule the country with almost unlimited powers.\n\n“These caretaker governments have unclear goals and unclear priorities, and most importantly – they are uncontrolled. There is no direct control from the parliament and the parties, which are the representatives of the citizens,” said Kyryakov.\n\nIn his view, Radev may have the undeclared goal of leaving Bulgaria in the grey undefined geopolitical zone between the West and Russia, which benefits the regime in the Kremlin.\n\nPro-Western parties in the country strongly criticised Radev’s caretaker government for its decision to review its position towards Gazprom and try to enter into negotiations to resume suspended gas supplies.\n\nGazprom silent over Sofia’s invitation for gas talks Russian state gas company Gazprom still has not answered the Bulgarian authorities’ invitation to resume negotiations to restart gas supplies to the country. Energy Minister Rosen Hristov announced last week that entering into negotiations with Gazprom would now be inevitable after …\n\n“Disappointment with democracy and a permanent political failure, in which the people do not want to vote and the parties want to rule, are the worst scenarios for Bulgaria after the elections,” said Parvan Simeonov, a political analyst from Gallup International Balkan, in an interview with EURACTIV.\n\n“I hope it doesn’t turn out at some point that no one wants to rule, and everyone expects the president to pull the chestnuts out of the fire,” he added.\n\nSimeonov also spoke of recent claims that some parties pass the ball to the president for sole power.\n\n“It’s not a ball; it’s a hot potato; they’re looking for someone to take responsibility,” he commented.\n\n“It would be nice if people did not decide that the Bulgarian parties are impotent and decide not to vote. Especially in winter, when the quality of life is the main thing that excites them. The parties can realise this and look for compromise options,” he added.\n\n“There is polarisation in society because of the war, although it is not so great because Bulgarians are far from extremes. But it affects everyone who is operationally responsible for power,” said Simeonov. (Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bb)",

By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth. And, on this measure, the US comes just behind Cuba and just above Bulgaria. The US is “becoming a ‘developing country’,” one political historian said last week, based on this index.\n\nIf you’re reading this from the other side of the Atlantic, things aren’t much better. An analysis in the Financial Times last week found that “On present trends, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024, and the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade.” Essentially, the analysis concluded, income inequality in the US and UK is so enormous that the two nations should be classed as poor countries with some very rich people. Most of whom seem to be in the government.",

For the most part, we have firm guarantees that what was done in the post-war period in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the international community is not ready to sacrifice by not continuing any form of mission,” said Podžić, stating that Annex 1a of the Dayton Peace Agreement states that NATO is responsible for the implementation of the military part of that agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. – alliance.",

    "Bulgaria’s Ready To Negotiate Gas Deal With Russia’s Gazprom After Government Changes": "SOURCE:kremlin.ru\n\nGazprom cut the deliveries to Bulgaria on April 27 as Sofia refused to pay for gas in rubles following a new scheme floated by President Vladimir Putin. But the Bulgaria-Greece interconnector, which should bring 1 bcm of Azerbaijani gas to Bulgaria, or a third of its consumption, has not been completed yet. Azerbaijani gas will flow through the interconnector from October 1. Former Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said a day before stepping down that Bulgaria had secured seven cargo shipments of U.S. liquefied gas (LNG) to ensure gas inflows in the winter. However, Bulgaria has no LNG terminals while it is costly to regasify LNG in Greece and Turkey, adding new costs to the final price. The acting government has secured just one cargo shipment of liquefied gas. At the same time, trade unions and businesses urge the government to resume talks, saying high gas prices will eventually leave many companies bankrupt. On August 22, Deputy Prime Minister Hristo Alexiev and Energy Minister Rossen Hristov attended an emergency meeting to address the energy crisis. Bulgarian Prime Minister Galab Donev said the situation is critical before winter. Four days later, interim Energy Minister Rossen Hristov said the Bulgarian government asked Gazprom to resume talks on gas supplies. “We have signaled our readiness to negotiate and we have a set of proposals for a new contract,” the minister told in an interview with the Bulgarian TV channel Nova. He says it is inevitable to resume talks with Gazprom on gas supplies as alternative deliveries cost up to 50 percent more. Bulgaria has sealed a deal to secure 3 bcm of gas from Gazprom each year. So far it has received a third of contracted gas supplies. The government has proposed to extend the deal until either the end of the heating season or next summer. The energy minister said he did not believe that buying Russian gas meant funding of Putin’s Ukraine war. “We still buy Russian gas––but through intermediaries and we pay 30 percent more. Speaking of financing, Germany should stop buying Russian gas. Top European countries buy the same gas on these terms,” Hristov was quoted as saying. Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria Eleonora Mitrofanova said in July that gas deliveries to Bulgaria could be resumed if there was a political will from Sofia, reiterating payments should be in roubles.",

Such an action by Russia is unacceptable, especially since it is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and should strictly observe the UN Charter and not threaten any other country with military force, which is a direct violation of the Statute of the Organization\", he said and emphasized again that there is a risk to Bulgaria's national security, but \"there is no direct military threat to our country so far\".\n\nIn his words, the uncertainty also comes from the disruption of energy supply chains for Europe by Russia:\n\n\"The gas issue is one of the leading ones in the EU and raises many questions about how Europe and its citizens will face the coming winter months\".\n\nFor BNR, the acting Prime Minister categorically emphasized that Bulgaria will not recognize the results of the referendums that are being held in the four regions of Ukraine:\n\n\"These referendums violate international law, they also violate the Constitution of Ukraine. We cannot under any circumstances accept results achieved in regions where hostilities are taking place. I am also completely opposed to intimidation with the use of nuclear weapons, no matter of the deterrent effect\".\n\nGalab Donev stated that Bulgaria supports EU sanctions against Russia to continue, but:\n\n\"The EU must do its analysis so that the sanctions do not have retroactive effect on the countries of the European Union. All the sanctions that the EU is yet to discuss in order to impose, we will insist that they go through a thorough analysis to see all the pros and cons of them\".\n\nAccording to him, the caretaker government has not slowed down with its position regarding Russia:\n\n\"There should be no hasty actions when we are in conditions of military operations, which are taking place in close proximity to the borders of Bulgaria\".\n\nOur positions are in sync with our partners in the EU and NATO, he pointed out categorically and specified:\n\n\"We firmly state that we do not support Russia's military actions in Ukraine.

We are firmly against the war and we have always insisted that solutions be sought through diplomacy\".\n\nOn the occasion of the wave of citizens leaving Russia, Donev said:\n\n\"This is more of a hypothesis for Bulgaria than a real fact. There must be a unified EU response to an intensified wave of refugees from Russia. No country could handle such a problem alone.\"\n\nThere is no refusal to negotiate with Gazprom, said the caretaker prime minister:\n\n\"I wouldn't say that there is a refusal, since we have an active contract, at the operational level there is no change in the situation. There is no development in the situation between Bulgargaz and Gazprom\".\n\nAccording to him, the demand for penalties for breaching the gas supply contract is a commercial relationship and should be resolved between the two companies - between \"Bulgargaz\" and \"Gazpromexport\".\n\nThere is great interest in the announced tenders for the supply of liquefied gas, the acting Prime Minister announced and added:\n\n\"At the moment, I have no information about Gazprom participating in the tender. There are quite a few companies that are interested. At the beginning of October, the tender for the November delivery will end.\"\n\nIn October, Bulgaria will participate in the tender for the Revithoussa terminal in order to secure slots and capacities for regasification and gas storage, Galab Donev also emphasized and announced that the Interconnector with Greece will enter commercial operation from October 1.\n\n\"Bulgargaz\" will also announce a contract for the gas hub \"Balkan\" and for the supply of pipeline gas. “We are looking for full diversification to provide competitive prices to businesses and citizens. In March, the tender will end and the conclusion of a long-term contract will be made by a regular government,” said the caretaker prime minister.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR",
    "Unions urge Bulgaria govt to apply growth strategy for TCLF industries": "Employers and unions called on the Bulgarian government to come up with an industrial strategy to make use of the growth opportunities for the country’s textile, clothing, leather, and footwear (TCLF) industries. Even as the TCLF industries employ 80,000 workers in Bulgaria, employment has gone down by 20 per cent in the past four years which is a concern.\n\nIn the European Union (EU) Sustainable Textiles Strategy, TCLF industries are one of 14 industrial priority sectors, according to a joint press release by the European Apparel and Textile Confederation (EURATEX), European Confederation of the Footwear Industry (CEC), Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE), and IndustriAll.\n\nEmployers and unions called on the Bulgarian government to come up with an industrial strategy to make use of the growth opportunities for the country's textile, clothing, leather, and footwear (TCLF) industries. Even as the TCLF industries employ 80,000 workers in Bulgaria, employment has gone down by 20 per cent in the past four years which is a concern.\n\nSocial partners discussed the challenges and opportunities of the new EU Sustainable Textiles Strategy and focused on both environmental and social sustainability. They agreed that for the strategy to be successful, all stakeholders must come together, and that a level playing field must be maintained between EU (Bulgarian) and non-European companies.\n\nIn the face of tough global competition, huge investment will be needed in both technology and people to ensure that the Bulgarian TCLF sectors can become greener and more digital. The modernisation of these sectors would also help the sector to become more attractive to Bulgarian workers, thus reducing the need to hire workers from abroad.\n\nConcerns were raised by national social partners, similar to other central and south European countries, that some young workers have opted to leave for Western Europe. Proposals to tackle this issue included ensuring better purchasing practices from major fashion brands whose suppliers account for over 90 per cent of TCLF production.\n\nThe social partners voiced their hope that with improvement in the purchasing practices of brands, changes in the behaviour of consumers and measures to ensure competitiveness that benefits could be felt by both the industry and the workforce.\n\nFOSIL-CITUB and FLI-PODREPA unions called for stronger social dialogue and sectoral collective bargaining. There has been no branch agreement since 2008, and existing company accords only cover 3-4 per cent of the sector. This is far from the 80 per cent coverage mentioned as reference in the upcoming European Minimum Wage Directive. As such, the unions have agreed to start developing a work plan to increase their leverage, added the release.\n\nEmployers wanted to have regulations to combat the grey economy and unfair competition. BAATPE and BATOK associations acknowledged that social partners must increase their representativeness to have a louder voice.\n\n“The message from trade unions in Sofia is clear: we need quality social dialogue and strong collective agreements to ensure a positive future for the TCLF industries in Bulgaria. The EU’s Sustainable Textiles Strategy offers a real opportunity if managed correctly, but investments — both in technology and the workforce — will be essential. This includes ensuring fair wages and good conditions to retain current workers and attract new ones,’’ said IndustriAll Europe’s general secretary Luc Triangle.\n\n“In a context where Europe puts more focus on quality, transparency, and sustainability, Bulgarian textile companies have a future. But they need support from the authorities to make that green and digital transition, and a constructive social dialogue, which ensures long term competitiveness of the industry,” said EURATEX director general Dirk Vantyghem.\n\n“Moreover, a particular focus and attention should be given to investments on skills and lifelong learning of workers. People are the main asset for the growth and competitiveness of the footwear and leather goods industries, and the education system in Bulgaria should be able to respond to companies’ skills needs. For that purpose, adequate curricula and related training programmes should be developed and education infrastructures made available by public authorities, in particular when it comes to vocational education and training (VET),” said secretary general of CEC Carmen Arias.\n\n“Leather producers in Bulgaria and all over Europe constitute a fundamental link in the world’s most demanding fashion value chains. They also play an important societal role, as they collect and transform a residue of the food and feed ecosystem into one of the most appealing textile ecosystem materials there is. For keeping generating wealth and jobs they need support from their public authorities for solving the problems of rocketing energy costs, unfair extra-EU competition, and a difficult labour market,” said secretary general of COTANCE Gustavo Gonzalez-Quijano.\n\n\n\nThe workshop was part of an EU-funded social dialogue project ’Ensuring a Sustainable Future for the Southeast European Textile, Clothing, Leather, and Footwear Industries,’ carried out in cooperation between European industry associations EURATEX, COTANCE, CEC, and IndustriAll Europe. The two-year project covers Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia, where the TCLF industries employ over 400,000 workers.\n\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (NB)",
    "\"Politico\": No Sanctions against Russian Nuclear Energy": "Nuclear energy is unlikely to be included in the next package of EU sanctions against Russia, Politico reports, citing several diplomatic sources. And Bulgaria is one of the reasons, it is clear from the publication.\n\nOver the weekend, the European Commission organized a series of meetings with senior diplomats to hear the proposals of the member states before the package is drawn up. It is expected to be introduced this week.\n\nThe pseudo-referendums in the 4 Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia and the discovery of a mass grave with over 400 bodies in the city of Izyum have convinced many \"doves\" in the EU countries that new measures against Russia are needed, the publication states.\n\nThere was also lunch with the permanent representatives of the Community countries, sources from Brussels confirmed to Club Z. But they did not want to give details.\n\nAccording to diplomats, nuclear power is unlikely to be part of the package, although Poland and the Baltic countries have drawn up a joint proposal on the issue for the first time. It includes targeted sanctions against Russia's nuclear industry.\n\nNuclear energy is a key sector in France, but also in Bulgaria, which exports electricity to Greece and the Western Balkans, notes Politico. The ban seems problematic mainly because of the difficulties it could cause for the maintenance of the nuclear plants built in Bulgaria during communism.\n\nThe most important factor in the call for new sanctions is the US push for a price ceiling mechanism for Russian oil exports agreed to by the G7 countries. Washington wants that mechanism to be in place by Dec. 5, when the ban on sea imports of Russian crude will take effect, diplomats said.\n\nOne of them points out that the Americans demand that companies be notified 90 days in advance of the introduction of price caps. And Europe is already late.\n\nThere is also resistance to the marginal price of oil. It comes mostly from Cyprus. However, it is expected that at least this point will enter the package and it will be finalized at the informal meeting of European leaders on October 6 and 7 in Prague.\n\nTwo of the diplomats claim that the package will also include controls on the import of diamonds, semi-finished steel, machinery and chemicals.\n\nSeveral countries, including the Netherlands, propose sanctions for people helping to circumvent the restrictive measures.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/Politico, ClubZ",
    "Bulgaria And Hungary: Risks Of A Pro-Russian Alliance Inside The EU": "Then there is Mariupol, under siege and symbol of Putin’s cruelty. In the largest city on the Azov Sea, with a population of half a million people, Ukrainians make up slightly less than half of the city's population, and Mariupol's second-largest national ethnicity is Russians. As of 2001, when the last census was conducted, 89.5% of the city's population identified Russian as their mother tongue.\n\nThe martyrdom of Mariupol Between 2018 and 2019, I spent several months in Mariupol. It is a rugged but beautiful city dotted with Soviet-era architecture, featuring wide avenues and hillside parks, and an extensive industrial zone stretching along the shoreline. There was a vibrant youth culture and art scene, with students developing projects to turn their city into a regional cultural center with an international photography festival. There were also many offices of international NGOs and human rights organizations, a consequence of the fact that Mariupol was the last major city before entering the occupied zone of Donbas. Many natives of the contested regions of Luhansk and Donetsk had moved there, taking jobs in restaurants and hospitals. I had fond memories of the welcoming from locals who were quicker to smile than in some other parts of Ukraine. All of this is gone. Putin is bombing the very people he has claimed to want to rescue. According to the latest data from the local authorities, 80% of the port city has been destroyed by Russian bombs, artillery fire and missile attacks, with particularly egregious targeting of civilians, including a maternity hospital, a theater where more than 1,000 people had taken shelter and a school where some 400 others were hiding. The official civilian death toll of Mariupol is estimated at more than 3,000 . There are no language or ethnic-based statistics of the victims, but it’s likely the majority were Russian speakers. So let’s be clear, Putin is bombing the very people he has claimed to want to rescue. Putin’s Public Enemy No. 1, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is a mother-tongue Russian speaker who’d made a successful acting and comedy career in Russian-language broadcasting, having extensively toured Russian cities for years.\n\nRescuers carry a person injured during a shelling by Russian troops of Kharkiv, northeastern Ukraine. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Ukrinform via ZUMA Press Wire\n\nA bilingual nation Yes, the official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian, and a 2019 law aimed to ensure that it is used in public discourse, but no one has ever sought to abolish the Russian language in everyday life. In none of the cities that are now being bombed by the Russian army to supposedly liberate them has the Russian language been suppressed or have the Russian-speaking population been discriminated against. Sociologist Mikhail Mishchenko explains that studies have found that the vast majority of Ukrainians don’t consider language a political issue. For reasons of history, culture and the similarities of the two languages, Ukraine is effectively a bilingual nation. \"The overwhelming majority of the population speaks both languages, Russian and Ukrainian,” Mishchenko explains. “Those who say they understand Russian poorly and have difficulty communicating in it are just over 4% percent. Approximately the same number of people say the same about Ukrainian.” In general, there is no problem of communication and understanding. Often there will be conversations where one person speaks Ukrainian, and the other responds in Russian. Geographically, the Russian language is more dominant in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine, and Ukrainian in the west.\n\nA daughter of Kyiv Like most central Ukrainians I am perfectly bilingual: for me, Ukrainian and Russian are both native languages that I have used since childhood in Kyiv. My generation grew up on Russian rock, post-Soviet cinema, and translations of foreign literature into Russian. I communicate in Russian with my sister, and with my mother and daughter in Ukrainian. I write professionally in three languages: Ukrainian, Russian and English, and can also speak Polish, French, and a bit Japanese. My mother taught me that the more languages I know the more human I am. At the same time, I am not Russian — nor British or Polish. I am Ukrainian. Ours is a nation with a long history and culture of its own, which has always included a multi-ethnic population: Russians, Belarusians, Moldovans, Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Romanians, Hungarians, Poles, Jews, Greeks. We all, they all, have found our place on Ukrainian soil. We speak different languages, pray in different churches, we have different traditions, clothes, and cuisine. My mother taught me that the more languages I know the more human I am. Like in other countries, these differences have been the source of conflict in our past. But it is who we are and will always be, and real progress has been made over the past three decades to embrace our multitudes. Our Jewish, Russian-speaking president is the most visible proof of that — and is in fact part of what our soldiers are fighting for. Many in Moscow were convinced that Russian troops would be welcomed in Ukraine as liberating heroes by Russian speakers. Instead, young soldiers are forced to shoot at people who scream in their native language.\n\nStarving people ina street of Kharkiv in 1933, during the famine Diocesan Archive of Vienna (Diözesanarchiv Wien)/BA Innitzer",

    "Italy and Bulgaria: Europe’s big tests for Russian energy unity": "As Europe stares down winter energy shortages, votes in Italy and Bulgaria could test its resolve on Russian sanctions.\n\nEurope faces two choices this winter. The first is to accept gas rationing, causing likely major, lasting damage to heavy industry and hundreds of billions of euros in outlays to manage spiking energy costs and accelerate the energy transition. The second option is to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin’s destruction of the Ukrainian state and his plotting of future wars of aggression.\n\nOption two is, of course, wholly unacceptable. Yet Europe’s ability to stay united in rejecting it faces two imminent tests: elections in Italy on September 25 and then in Bulgaria a week later. In both countries, political forces that are more aligned with Putin than the rest of Europe could come to power, potentially threatening a cohesive front on the question of sanctions against Russia.\n\nLet’s be clear. Europe’s energy pain is the result of the economic war that the Putin regime is waging in tandem with its assault on Ukraine.\n\nMoscow isn’t even bothering to hide the fact any more. Whereas the Kremlin has historically denied any accusations that it uses energy as a political weapon – a ridiculous claim to any neutral observer – Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on September 5 said that gas flows would not resume through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline linking Russia and Germany with sanctions in place. It’s the single biggest source of piped gas from Russia to Europe.\n\nNever mind that Russia had originally claimed that the pipeline had gone offline at the end of August for repairs. With the pretence dropped, Putin threatened recently that Moscow would cut off energy supplies if the G7 proceeds with plans to impose price caps on Russian hydrocarbon exports.\n\nEurope must recognise that there is a reason the Kremlin is using its gas weapon more openly than ever before: It is losing both on the sanctions front and in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to an internal government document accessed by Bloomberg, Russian experts and officials are predicting far deeper damages to the economy than Putin’s government is publicly acknowledging. Sure, sky-high hydrocarbon prices have meant that Russia’s headline GDP is unlikely to contract as much as some had expected, but its telecoms sector, pharmaceutical industry, machine tooling, civil aviation and even agricultural production are being ravaged.\n\nMilitarily too, the grinding advances that Putin’s troops are making in the Donbas are coming at a great cost. What was intended to be a lightning operation to decapitate the Ukrainian government, install a puppet regime and seize wide swaths of territory has turned into a quagmire. Gains in recent days by Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kherson and near Kharkiv are shattering what little remains of the myth of Russia’s military might. Meanwhile, Moscow has reportedly had to source drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea.\n\nRussia’s supposed fraternal ally in China is unwilling to risk sanctions violations to supply it with weaponry, or to offer it access to credit. Beijing reportedly won’t even let Russia freely exchange the Chinese currency it has purchased.\n\nIt’s against the backdrop of this bleak strategic position that the Kremlin is trying to weaponise energy to the fullest extent. The Kremlin believes it can freeze Europe into climbing down on sanctions. The threat of a cold winter has already helped Moscow secure support from Hungary, which has expanded Russian gas purchases and is pressuring the European Union to lift sanctions on Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe big question: Will Italy and Bulgaria buckle next? In Italy, an alliance of right-wing parties is favoured to win a majority in the coming vote. It includes ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who remains a political force and was famously friendly with Putin. Though no longer in office at the time, his 2015 visit to Russian-occupied Crimea is the only time a former leader of a G7 state has visited the region since Putin annexed it.\n\nAlso a part of that coalition is Matteo Salvini, leader of the current largest party in the Italian parliament, Lega Nord. He too has previously praised Putin and in 2017 signed a cooperation agreement between the Lega and Putin’s ruling United Russia party. In 2019, a series of recordings revealed a close aide of Salvini’s discussing procuring Russian money for his party. He has openly called for “rethinking” the sanctions imposed on Russia amid the campaign.\n\nHowever, Georgia Meloni, who heads the ascendant Brothers of Italy party currently leading the polls, has endorsed the sanctions regime and said that she will stick by the EU and NATO in taking on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Recent polls all show Meloni gaining more than half of the right-wing vote, and potentially twice as many as Salvini’s Lega. A Meloni-led right-wing coalition would certainly have other disputes with Brussels, but it appears she recognises that she can use support for Ukraine and the sanctions to buy room for concessions on other issues.\n\nWhat about Bulgaria? The reformist government of Prime Minister Kiril Petkov was among the earliest EU members to reject Russian gas following the invasion. Petkov’s coalition collapsed amid infighting in June.\n\nThe interim government appointed by President Rumen Radev – long an advocate of closer ties with Moscow – has been willing to hold talks with Gazprom about renewing gas supplies from Russia.\n\nPolls have only marginally shifted since Bulgarians last voted in November 2021, the third parliamentary election that year. However, Petkov’s party has seen support decline of late.\n\nMeanwhile, Radev’s ally Stefan Yanev, who favours a softer stance on Russia, launched a new political party that might cross the parliamentary threshold.\n\nAs Europe picks its political future, maintaining a united front on Russian sanctions is essential to ensure victory in the ongoing economic war. Bulgarian and Italian voters will soon have their say – and all of Europe ought to be watching.\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this article referred to a slight increase in the vote share of Bulgarian Socialists, when the latest polling shows their support has fallen marginally.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "Chinese Influence in Bulgaria": "This report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.

At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, President Rumen Radev (Radev) of Bulgaria is paying a state visit to China from July 1 to 5, during which he attended the 13th Summer Davos. The traditional friendship between the two countries has continued to grow. At present, the two sides have maintained close cooperation at all levels, achieving notable results in cooperation in areas such as economy, trade, agriculture, and deepened people-to-people and cultural exchanges, setting a good example for country-to-country relations. Credit: Credit: Oriental Image via Reuters Connect\n\nThis report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nGoals and objectives of CCP malign influence\n\nBulgaria has never been among Beijing’s foreign policy priorities, and the feeling has been mutual. At the same time, China loops Bulgaria in with the European Union’s ambivalent support for US policy toward China. China’s objective is to build an influential pro-Beijing lobby and prevent Bulgaria from joining the group of China’s outspoken critics.\n\nSo far, Chinese efforts in Bulgaria have produced mixed results. Officially, their relations hit a high point in 2018, when Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hosted the 16/17+1 meeting in Sofia during Bulgaria’s EU Council presidency. The next year, at a meeting of Bulgarian President Rumen Radev and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, the two men agreed on closer ties via a “strategic partnership” between their countries. Recently, however, bilateral relations seem to be at a standstill. A couple of signs of Bulgaria’s declining interest were the relatively lower-level Bulgarian delegation that attended the virtual summit of the 16/17+1 initiative of economic cooperation, and the lack of government officials at Sofia’s public commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2021. The justice minister of the then-caretaker government sent a congratulatory statement to the event, which was organized by professor Zahari Zahariev, chairman of the national One Belt, One Road Association.\n\nThis cooling of relations coincides with disillusionment about Chinese investments in the country. Bulgaria received only 1% ($112 m) of Chinese financial flows into Central Eastern Europe from 2000 to 2020, putting it ahead of only Croatia.\n\nChina uses different tools to increase its clout:\n\nMedia and social media: The Chinese government spreads propaganda through social media and some Bulgarian-language online and print outlets that it owns or finances. For example, China Today (Китай днес) is a weekly newspaper covering Chinese domestic and foreign policy and bilateral relations, published by the same team that produces the Bulgarian edition of Russia Today (Русия днес). Other popular media websites include the Bulgarian-language China Radio International website and We Are China Facebook page.\n\nLeaders’ meetings in the framework of the 16/17+1 initiative for economic cooperation: The 16/17+1 summit in Sofia in 2018 concluded with memoranda for $1.75 bn in loans from the China Development Bank to small and medium-sized companies in Bulgaria, and investments in infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (C-CEEC) Global Partnership Center in Sofia: Announced during the seventh C-CEEC leaders’ meeting in 2019, the center was to be situated within the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. It would offer consultation and advice to government agencies and businesses involved in the 16/17+1 economic initiative and “promote(s) the C-CEEC mechanism’s principles of openness, equality, fairness, and transparency.” There is no evidence of its actual functioning yet, perhaps due to the pandemic and a protracted political crisis in Bulgaria after March 2021.\n\nDevelopment of a Bulgarian-Chinese Innovation Center in Sofia: Sofia University has volunteered to host the center, which was agreed by the two countries’ leaders in 2018 and which would focus on information technologies and health sciences.\n\nParliamentary cooperation: The parliamentary group for friendship with China is popular among Bulgarian legislators, second only to the friendship with Russia group.\n\nExchange visits/bilateral meetings: For example, the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAFIU), a Beijing-based institution of the Chinese Communist Party, has hosted several tours of China for Bulgarian leaders in fields such as academia, journalism, and business. It also regularly invites Bulgarian representatives to its international events and co-chairs similar Bulgarian-Chinese fora in Sofia.\n\nAcademic facilities: One of the main tools for reaching young people is the Confucius Institute in Sofia, the first on the Balkan peninsula and one of the first in Eastern Europe. Launched in 2006, it was designated a model for the development of Confucius Institutes worldwide in 2013. Other centers exist in universities across the country.\n\nContent-sharing agreements with local electronic and print media: 24 Chasa, one of the most widely distributed daily newspapers, regularly reproduces pieces from China Radio International. In addition, Bulgarian National Television has an agreement with China Central Television to air Chinese content on BNT 2 and its other channels, and the private TV-7 airs Chinese content.\n\nAgreements with professional organizations: Most notably, the Union of Bulgarian Journalists and the Chinese Union of Journalists agreed in November 2020 to launch a journalistic forum on solidarity and cooperation.\n\nBusiness lobbies and associations: For example, the Plovdiv-based Bulgarian-Chinese Business Development Association seeks to promote Bulgarian agricultural produce in China. In addition, a Bulgarian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce is active nationally.\n\nSources: The World Factbook 2022, (Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2020), https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/; World Bank, The World Bank Group, 2022, https://www.worldbank.org/en/home; “Friendship Group Bulgaria – China”, National Assembly of The Republic of Bulgaria, retrieved June 27, 2022, https://parliament.bg/en/friendshipgroups/2189\n\nReach of influence measures\n\nGiven the fairly limited (albeit growing) direct economic footprint of China in Bulgaria, and in particular the lack of flagship projects by Chinese state-owned companies, the impact of Chinese soft and sharp power should not be overestimated.\n\nTarget audiences and populations\n\nChinese propaganda in Bulgaria is reminiscent of the rigid Cold War stylistics and content, yet one should not underestimate its efficiency and long-term impact. China’s main focus is on issues that are generally neglected since the Cold War but are particularly relevant in Bulgaria, the poorest country in the EU. Keywords and phrases such as “peaceful coexistence,” “poverty,” “equality,” “national sovereignty,” “non-interference,” and “social justice,” appear frequently in Chinese propaganda. They do not impress the local elites but they touch on the anxieties and priorities of ordinary Bulgarians, which could help explain why a 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 55% of Bulgarians have a favorable view of China, a higher percentage than the other surveyed CEE and Western European countries.\n\nThose most vulnerable to Chinese propaganda tend to embrace euroskepticism and anti-NATO/anti-US sentiment. These are mostly either Russophiles or Bulgarian nationalists who support the Bulgarian Socialist Party or the “patriotic fringe” parties. As Chinese influence grows internationally, however, many politicians from other mainstream parties have flirted with joining the pro-China lobby. The parliamentary Bulgaria-China friendship group is one of the most popular in the legislature. And compared with other CEE parliamentary groups, Bulgarian members of the European Parliament are less critical of authoritarian regimes, including China’s. For example, only 10 of Bulgaria’s 17 MEPs voted for a European Parliament resolution condemning human rights violations against the Uyghurs in China, and only 11 condemned China’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. On the basis of these resolutions and others, the Political Capital think tank’s China-critical index puts MEPs from the Bulgarian Socialist Party among the most China-friendly mainstream parties in the European Parliament. The party’s votes are often out of step even with the Socialist and Democrats Group’s policy preferences.\n\nPhoto: Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the People’s Republic of China’s State Council of China Li Keqiang at the opening of the 2018 16+1 Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria. Credit: Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe trajectory in Bulgarian-Chinese relations mirrors the general shift in US/EU relations with Beijing. The Bulgarian government was initially a vocal supporter of some announced initiatives to benefit from investments under the One Belt, One Road initiative, since renamed the Belt and Road Initiative. But outside of some private-sector efforts, not much has materialized. In the absence of any substantial initiative as the 16/17+1 format peters out, old-style Chinese propaganda is unlikely to sway many Bulgarians. Yet, the general attitude toward China in Bulgaria remains positive, and the pro-Beijing lobby in the country remains strong, though with limited access to the mainstream political and cultural spectrum. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated Bulgaria’s political instability, with the country’s political elite divided over an approach to Russia. This leaves opportunities for China to try to win over the parts of Bulgarian society repulsed by the Kremlin’s brutal attack on Ukraine. Yet, however economically tempting, Chinese overtures to Bulgaria are likely to be met by a mainstream clearly focused on realizing Bulgaria’s EU-financed projects first.",

    "In Bulgaria, Soviet War Memorials Are Turning Into Ghosts": "SOFIA -- It's hard to miss the giant, 11-meter-tall statue that towers above Plovdiv, standing proud on top of the Bulgarian city's second-highest hill. Named Alyosha, a generic diminutive used to refer to Soviet soldiers, the giant figure honors the Red Army soldiers who fought in Bulgaria during World War II. Some sources, including the Russian Foreign Ministry, claim that Alyosha was based on a photo of a real Russian soldier who was fighting in Bulgaria at that time.\n\nWith Russia now waging an unprovoked war on Ukraine, Soviet war memorials across Eastern Europe have been attracting renewed attention, with monuments honoring the Red Army recently pulled down in Poland and Latvia.\n\n\n\nFrench artist Mitch Brezunek has found a new and unique way to confront the past: by turning Alyosha into a ghost. The digital tampering is part of his exhibition, The Ghost Is Here, which opened on September 9 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city and cultural heart.\n\n\n\nDuring communist rule, Red Army memorials were built throughout Bulgaria to honor Soviet soldiers and the role they played in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II. They were considered symbols of Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, even though the Red Army occupied Bulgaria and the Soviet Union declared war on the country in 1944.\n\nAfter the fall of communism, Soviet monuments and war memorials became lightning rods for discussion and reckoning with the past across the former Eastern Bloc. Angry at Soviet occupation and more recent Russian military interventions, many have advocated that the statues and monuments be removed -- suggestions that have attracted the ire of Russian officials and led to public and diplomatic spats. In Bulgaria, there have been several attempts to have Alyosha removed, but none was successful.\n\n\n\nWhen Estonia removed a World War II monument from the center of Tallinn in 2007, the city was rocked by violent riots, and the country suffered a massive cyberattack that was later blamed on Russian hackers.\n\nBorn in France in 1989, Brezunek has been living and working in Plovdiv since 2016. The Soviet monuments, however, made an impression on him when he first came to Bulgaria 12 years ago and started learning about the country's history.\n\n\n\n\"These monuments are everywhere here. They never go unnoticed because of their size and location. In Plovdiv, for example, Alyosha dominates the city and the sky,\" the Frenchman told RFE/RL. \"It is impossible not to ask yourself every time you see the monument: 'Why is it here? And how did it end up here and what message is it sending us?'\"\n\n\n\nIn his show, Brezunek digitally alters pictures of 12 Soviet monuments in different cities across Bulgaria, their transformations, the artist said, not just a message about the past but also a reflection on Bulgaria's present as a member of the European Union.\n\n\n\nMonuments are around us for a reason, Brezunek said when promoting the show, to remind us of the past and the mistakes we've made. \"Can we learn from past missteps and create a better future? The ghost is here to remind us that history often repeats itself,\" Brezunek says.\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition is a 7.5-meter-tall screen where a slightly smaller Alyosha is transformed into a giant ghost. The other Red Army monuments that Brezunek has digitally transformed are the Mound of Soviet Soldiers in the city of Dobrich and the Monument of Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship in the port and seaside resort of Varna. Other monuments were in Sofia, Burgas, Stara Zagora, Ruse, and Byala Slatina.\n\n\n\nPut together, they all form the last component of Brezunek's exhibition, a 3D digital map, which, in the artist's words, shows the \"two faces of Bulgaria.\" On the one side is the past, the monuments of the Soviet Army, and on the other, \"the present, Bulgaria's membership in the European Union.\"\n\n\n\nBrezunek has also been using his art to make money for Ukraine, which has been fighting an all-out war against Russia since February 24. A 3D video animation of Alyosha becoming a ghost is being sold as a non-fungible token (NFT), a unique digital collectible built on blockchain technology:\n\n\n\nAccording to the exhibition organizers, every week until November 9, each 3D artwork of the monuments-in-flux will be sold, with 70 percent of the revenue going to support artists and cultural events in Ukraine and Bulgaria.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, NFTs have become popular in the worlds of art, culture, and sport, despite regulatory and environmental concerns. \"3D is fantastic property as you don't have any physical limitations, so you can really explore a new kind of creative freedom,\" Brezunek told RFE/RL.",
    "UNGA77: Nigeria signs bilateral Protocol of Cooperation with Bulgaria": "Nigeria on Friday in New York signed a Protocol of Cooperation with the Republic of Bulgaria.\n\nThe signing ceremony was performed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, and his Bulgarian counterpart, Nikolay Milkow.\n\nMr Onyeama said that the protocol would contribute to the development and consolidation of the friendly relations between the two countries.\n\nHe said the protocol was based on the principles of mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty, independence and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.\n\nHe said that the Protocol of Cooperation would enable both countries to maintain regular consultations and mutual efforts in the peaceful settlement of conflicts and relief in humanitarian crises.\n\nHe said that the protocol covered bilateral consultations, regional and international issues of mutual interest, and bilateral collaboration with international organisations.\n\nOthers are activities relating to the implementation of projects through the Official Development Assistance of the Republic of Bulgaria.\n\n“This is an excellent initiative and it shows a close cooperation between Bulgaria and ourselves. I undertook a visit to Bulgaria a few months ago and we have an invite to their president.\n\n“We feel that Bulgaria is a very important member of the European Union and there are many areas in which we can increase our cooperation, especially in the field of education,” Mr Onyeama said.\n\nAlso, Mr Milkow said that Nigeria and Bulgaria had a good momentum in their bilateral relation recently, adding that they needed to keep it.\n\n“So, this is why we are thinking about signing a number of agreements that will pave the way for sectoral cooperation in many branches of the economy, political consultations and in every area of mutual interest.\n\n“This is the first signing of the agreement. We expect to further sign in the field of economy, commerce, finance etc.\n\n“Hopefully, during the forthcoming visit of the Bulgarian president to Nigeria, we will deepen this cooperation,” Mr Milkow said.\n\nThe ceremony is one of the bilateral breakthroughs recorded by Nigeria in the ongoing 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n(NAN)",
    "Bulgaria’s Independence Day: No Lights for the Soviet Monuments and in Protest against Russia": "On the day when Vladimir Putin surprisingly announced a partial military mobilization and veiledly threatened NATO with nuclear weapons, Bulgarian society symbolically declared itself against Russian aggression with an ultimatum to stop lighting the monuments of the Soviet Union in five of the country's largest cities.\n\nJournalists, writers and university professors got behind the \"Darkness for Light\" initiative. They categorically demanded that the floodlights of the Sofia Monument to the Soviet Army (MOCHA), infamously towering in the center of the capital, be turned off.\n\nThe Metropolitan Municipality turned off the floodlights of MOCHA (The Soviet monument in the center of Sofia) at 20:00 p.m. on September 21. Thus, Sofia welcomed its Independence Day holiday with the strong message of \"Darkness for Light\". This first symbolic step is important in the fight against the pernicious Russian influence in Bulgaria and the fratricidal war in Ukraine.\n\nPlovdiv also joined the initiative, where the “Alyosha” monument also fell into darkness. The mayors of Varna, Burgas and Stara Zagora refused to do so. The protest was covered by Ukrainian and foreign media.\n\nThe monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia with the floodlights turned off at 20:00 on the evening of September 21. Photo: KlinKlin\n\nNamed by Joseph Stalin in 1946 as the \"Monument of the Soviet Army\", it was presented in 1954. It was created by court artists of the Soviet regime in our country, such as Ivan Funev, Lyubomir Dalchev and Vaska Emanuilova.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, the citizens of Sofia unsuccessfully tried to remove this militaristic sculptural configuration, including the historical misinformation about the Red Army as a \"liberator\". The reality is different. Stalin and his troops entered Bulgaria as occupiers to install a sinister Soviet-style communist regime that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Bulgarians and the suffering of millions more.\n\nThe refusal of the capital authorities over the years to respond to the demands of its citizens to dismantle MOCHA is mainly due to the fear of the dominant pro-Russian political and economic influence.\n\n/KlinKlin\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg",
    "Bulgaria has potential to become European energy hub, says US’s Pompeo": "Bulgaria has the chance to realise its potential as an energy centre in Southeast Europe, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday in Sofia.\n\nThe former secretary of state spoke at a lecture organised by the Confederation of Employers and Industrialists in Bulgaria (KRIB) on “The geopolitical significance of Bulgaria: After the invasion of Ukraine and Bulgaria’s potential as a regional energy leader”.\n\nAccording to Pompeo, the answer to the question of energy independence lies in Bulgaria itself, including through exploiting shale gas.\n\nAccording to the geological studies of American company Direct Petroleum, Bulgaria has deposits of at least 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas, with a large part of these deposits being shale gas, though Bulgaria’s annual needs only amount to 3 million bcm.\n\nThis means there are the deposits are enough for at least 1,500 years.\n\nGazprom stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria at the end of April, and the government has yet to decide where to get the necessary quantities for the winter.\n\nEight years ago, the Bulgarian parliament vetoed shale gas extraction and exploration under pressure from civil movements, including pro-Russian groups.\n\n“Modern shale gas extraction technologies are much cleaner than Russian gas,” Pompeo said.\n\nThe former secretary of state listed a series of Putin’s statements and actions that show he is working against the West, from his 2005 declaration that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the world’s greatest tragedy to the 2008 invasion of Georgia, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe Taliban invasion of Afghanistan in 2021 was another green light for Putin to move forward with his plans to attack Ukraine, Pompeo added.\n\nRussia’s great weapon is not the army, which has turned out to be weaker than expected, but energy, which allows the Kremlin to exert influence, Pompeo also said.",

    "Bulgaria struggles with gas supply after denying ruble payment for Russian gas": "Russia halted natural gas deliveries to Bulgaria in April after the government in Sofia refused to pay in rubles.\n\nBulgaria has been almost totally dependent on imports from Gazprom for most of its gas supply: the three billion cubic meter annual imports from Russia covered nearly 90 percent of Bulgaria's gas demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nSince then, Bulgaria has been struggling to find alternative options like Azeri gas or LNG gas from the United States to cover its needs.\n\nWhile large parts of the industry do not rely on gas, there are several big enterprises that are fully dependent on natural gas.\n\nExperts fear that sharp price hikes or lack of supply would force them to limit production or stop work and add to the economic woes.\n\nThe head of the Bulgarian Industrial Capital Association Vassil Velev estimates that a shutdown of these enterprises would mean that some 250,000 workers will lose their jobs.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the poorest among the European Union's 27 members, surging energy costs are forcing families to cut extra spending ahead of the coming winter months to make sure there is enough money to buy food and medicines.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, more than a quarter of the seven million Bulgarians can't afford to heat their homes - which is the highest number in the EU.\n\nHaving to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, many financially strapped households will be unable to keep their homes warm this winter and risk falling into energy poverty.\n\nStatistics show that even middle-income households could struggle to pay their utility bills.\n\nScarcely insulated buildings, low incomes, and surging energy prices are the main causes of energy poverty.\n\nIn Sofia, where almost half a million households have central heating, the number of those who decided to switch to other heating options jumped after the announcement of a 40 percent price increase.\n\nAcross the country, nearly half of the households use firewood in winter as the cheapest and most accessible fuel, but the rising demand and the galloping inflation have driven prices up above last year's level.\n\nAuthorities are trying to lessen the financial burden on low-income households, mainly pensioners and the unemployed, by providing an energy allowance to buy wood for their stoves.\n\nOther government-sponsored protective measures include export limits for wood-processing companies and regular deliveries of firewood for the domestic market.\n\nRead more:\n\nPipeline gas supplies to Pakistan are possible: Russia’s Putin\n\nUK to hold emergency mini-budget on September 23: Sources\n\nEU countries to ask UN rights council to monitor Russia: Diplomatic sources",
    "In Bulgaria, An Open Road For Putin's Favorite Biker Gang, The Night Wolves": "SOFIA -- They played a role in Russia's seizure of Crimea, preach an extremist brand of Russian nationalism, spew hate toward minorities and other \"outsiders,\" and are chummy with Russian President Vladimir Putin whose government has reportedly showered them with millions of dollars of Russian taxpayer money for many years.\n\nFor their thuggish role in Crimea in 2014, when members set up road blocks and provided other support for the Moscow-orchestrated takeover of the Ukrainian peninsula, Russia's Night Wolves have been sanctioned by the West.\n\nIn July, top bikers, including leader Aleksandr Zadostanov, better known as \"The Surgeon,\" were added to the EU's blacklist in the latest round of sanctions to punish Russia for its unprovoked, full invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhile the bikers are finding roads closed to them across Europe, it's not a dead end everywhere. Enthusiasts linked to the Russian gang can also be found in Bulgaria, which is both a member of the European Union and NATO but has traditional ties with Russia.\n\nThe Night Wolves in Bulgaria are highly visible, often posing for pictures with the Russian ambassador, herself a controversial figure who has faced calls to be sent packing for her agitating inside Bulgaria. The bikers often attend events organized by the Russian Embassy in Bulgaria. And the Bulgarian Orthodox Church has also given its blessings to the bikers.\n\nDespite the group's pariah status across the EU, though, Bulgarian officialdom appears unconcerned, raising nary a protest, let alone any calls for them to hightail out.​\n\nThe origins of the Night Wolves date back to the Soviet era, when in 1983 they became the first official bike club registered in the U.S.S.R., at the time largely involved in arranging illegal rock concerts in the Soviet Union. Besides Bulgaria, the Night Wolves are reported to have branches in Germany, Serbia, Romania, Australia, Slovakia, Belarus, the Philippines, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. In 2018, the Night Wolves were reported to have more than 5,000 members in Russia and elsewhere.\n\nOn paper at least, the Bulgarian bikers do not appear formally linked to the central Night Wolves branch in Russia, which has been slapped with Western sanctions. Many are members of other groups that have informal ties to their Russian leather-clad colleagues, although a few clubs use the Night Wolves name. An unidentified member of one of the local clubs told the Bulgarian news website 24 Chasa that they were told \"from Moscow\" not to talk to the media.\n\nBut the monitoring of messages from members of some of these Bulgarian clubs on social media indicates that ties with Russia are close, with missives often referring to them as \"brothers.\"\n\nThe Kremlin-friendly Bulgarian bikers made their last public appearance in Bulgaria on August 21, when they had a photo-op at the Liberty Memorial, a 31-meter-high obelisk built to memorialize the famous battle of Shipka Pass, a turning point in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.\n\nThat 19th century conflict paved the way for Bulgaria's liberation after five centuries of Ottoman rule, and to this day many Bulgarians feel historical gratitude for Russia's leading role in that struggle.\n\nAmong those gathered around the obelisk that day was controversial Russian Ambassador to Bulgaria Eleonora Mitrofanova, who was pictured in a crowd including what appeared to be Bulgarian Orthodox priests holding up a Russian flag. While a Bulgarian banner was obscured behind the small gathering of people, the Russian flag was prominently displayed in the foreground.​\n\nThe event took place a day after official celebrations to commemorate the historic battle, with Mitrofanova noting on her Facebook page that the Russian Embassy had not been invited.\n\n\"These are our compatriots, Bulgarian bikers, representatives of the Night Wolves club, representatives of Bulgarian public organizations. This is very pleasant, especially in view of the fact that a day ago official events were held, to which we were not invited,\"Mitrofanova wrote on the Russian Embassy's Facebook page.\n\nA seasoned Russian diplomat, Mitrofanova was appointed as Moscow's ambassador to Bulgaria in January 2021. Her brief time spent in Bulgaria has been marked by controversy. On February 25, just a day after the start of the Russian war in Ukraine, Mitrofanova met with Nikolai Malinov, a former Bulgarian lawmaker and the head of a pro-Russian lobby group in Bulgaria. In 2019, Malinov traveled to Moscow to personally receive an award from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMitrofanova has often used social media to insult the country, referring to Bulgarians as hospital \"bedpans,\" accusing them of being lackeys of the West. The comment triggered outrage across Bulgaria and an official note was sent to the Russian Embassy demanding an apology and the offending social media posts be taken down -- neither of which the embassy did.\n\nIn March, Stefan Tafrov, a Bulgarian politician and a former ambassador to the UN, called on the Bulgarian government to expel Mitrofanova, saying that her actions and words contradict the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which, among other things, offers diplomats immunity from local law.\n\nOn June 28, Bulgaria expelled 70 Russian diplomats, an unprecedented move by Sofia, halving the size of Moscow's diplomatic corps in the Balkan country.\n\nWeeks earlier, Mitrofanova and members of Bulgaria's Night Wolves were at the Monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia on May 9, the day Russia marks the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Controversially, members of the Bulgarian bikers' club were tasked with upholding \"security\" at the event.\n\nIn 2017, the Bulgarian bikers joined the bona fide members of the Russian Night Wolves on their controversial journey across Europe to Berlin, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.​\n\nAt the time, the president of the Sofia Night Wolves Club, Dencho Zlatanov, said, \"Our aim is to follow the route of the Soviet Army, to honor the heroes who were killed and to demonstrate to youngsters that such a war existed.\"\n\nA year earlier, during their \"Slavic World 2016\" sojourn across Europe, Russian Night Wolves bikers clashed with anti-Putin protesters in Burgas, a city on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast.\n\nThey have also been supportive of certain Bulgarian politicians. In 2017, the bikers attended the inauguration of Rumen Radev as president -- largely a ceremonial role in Bulgaria -- whom they called \"our president.\"\n\nRadev, who won a second presidential term in November 2021 with the backing of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), is viewed as a Kremlin-friendly politician, whose labeling of the Crimean Peninsula as \"Russian\" at the time of the election triggered \"deep concerns\" in Washington.\n\nCrosses, icons, and Orthodox symbols are brought in abundance to events organized by the Night Wolves. Regardless of the ideology they propagate, they are in the good graces of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.​\n\nThe church has heaped praise on the bikers in social media posts, praising them as \"an example of fraternal friendship, unity, and mutual help.\"\n\nThe bikers also received an Orthodox icon from Simeon Nikolov Dimitrov, the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, at a ceremony on July 16, according to a posting on Facebook.\n\nRFE/RL's Bulgarian Service tried but failed to get comment from the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Efforts to reach the Bulgarian Night Wolves were also unsuccessful.\n\nIn Russia, the Night Wolves have been used as a tool of the Kremlin. Leader Zadostanov was given a medal by Putin for the bikers' role in Crimea in 2014. The group has also reportedly received Kremlin financing in the past. The jailed opposition politician Aleksei Navalny published a report in 2015 showing the Night Wolves had received more than $1 million in taxpayer-funded state grants in recent years.\n\nThe bikers have used those funds to stage over-the-top patriotic events liketheir pyrotechnic-filled take on the Ukraine conflictin 2014 in front of a crowd of some 100,000 in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol.\n\nBased on reporting by Genka Shikerova from RFE/RL's Bulgarian Service with writing and additional research by Tony Wesolowsky."
