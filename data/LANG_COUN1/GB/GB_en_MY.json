    "Neo-colonial designs on Malaysia": "European legal and financial instruments and institutions should not be manipulated to violate the sovereignty of Malaysia from behind the fig leaf of a spurious claim to Malaysian territory by the so-called Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II.\n\nWhile the claim is lacking in historical, legal and political veracity, as well as being thoroughly expedient, its absurdity is underscored by Kiram's demand of an estimated RM66.4 billion for \"unpaid yearly leases\" from Malaysia, after an annual payment of RM5,300 was stopped less than 10 years ago. Exactly how 10 years of RM5,300 amounted to RM66.4 billion is unclear. It smacks, nonetheless, of attempts by the Kiram family and its backers, Therium Capital Management Ltd., to get a quick pay day. Besides trying for a quick pay day, the Sultan's claim has also paved open a way for European colonial intervention in Malaysia, through processes that should have become redundant when the European empires around the world collapsed.\n\nMalaysia is a sovereign and independent country, in which private European legal corporations have no jurisdiction. A line has to be drawn under the Kiram family's spurious claim to Sabah. The claim is invalid, as there never was a time when Sabah was not an integral part of independent Malaysia. It was, also, never the property of a single family. To claim this is just absurd, and potentially disastrous. In fact, Britain, as the last colonial power in Malaysia, should carry much of the burden and political responsibility for the disaster it left behind when the British left Malaya.\n\nREAD: Aramco CEO says Europe's energy crisis plans only short-term solution\n\nAs for the claims of financial compensation by the Kiram family, it has to be exposed for what it is: a claim based purely on greed and an insidious demand for easy money. What is more deleterious is that the European backers of the spurious claim have found – as has been demonstrated by European colonialists over decades – a docile body of former colonial \"subjects\" in the Kiram family, which can be used to tap into a rich seam of money. This is perfectly consistent with the dissolution of empire (politically), but the retention of de facto-type of empire through European legal and financial institutions. In other words, the colonialists may have left, but they want their laws and financial practices to prevail in Malaysia. This is as unacceptable as it is offensive. Malaysia is a sovereign and independent country; it cannot be held accountable to legal norms of foreign countries, especially not those of its former coloniser.\n\nWe should be clear: the Kiram family is being led by a firm, a European firm, Therium, that is primarily a \"global provider of legal finance\", as its website makes clear, which extends European legal instruments, principles and practices across the world, notably in former European colonies, like Malaysia. British legal firms, especially, use instruments via the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – which is a formal body of advisers to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom – to interfere in Commonwealth countries, and use the UK Supreme Court as a kind of \"court of last resort\" to discipline and punish former colonies. The Sovereign of the UK has no legal or political rights in Malaysia. The Kiram family, led by Therium, and using European legal instruments and institutions, is nothing but colonisation by different means, and should be rejected outright.\n\nThis type of financial imperialism, and the enduring inequalities between the former colonial empire-builders and colonised, continues to define global inequality and power relations. Today's inequality between these rich (former colonial powers) and poor (formerly colonised societies) is the path-dependent outcome of a range of historical processes. With respect to Europe and South-East Asian countries, companies like Therium are simply the extension of European colonial legal and financial instruments and institutions to the former colonies.\n\nIt is notable that Therium has operations in the UK, Europe, the Asia-Pacific Region, the United States and Jersey (a tax-haven for shady dealings, that was part of the British empire – and under constant scrutiny for its shady dealings), and from whence it stretches its legal tentacles to resemble European colonialism. Malaysians have gotten rid of their political colonisers, but the financial imperialism attempts continue – emboldened, in this particular instance, by the Kiram family and their spurious claims to Sabahan resources.\n\nREAD: Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral starts at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe Kiram Family Claim\n\nTherium has found a sufficiently docile body in the Kiram family which, quite ironically, has turned to its former colonial masters, the Europeans, to settle disputes that are a legacy of, especially, the British Empire in South-East Asia. The family claim has to be seen in the context of European, especially British, imperialism and colonialism. The claim is completely illegitimate, based purely on monetary gain, and ill-informed. Therium will be the only financial beneficiary in this process, and that fact has to remain in focus.\n\nThe actual claim is deeply lacking in historical and legal validity. In January 1878, the Sultan of Sulu granted and ceded of \"own free and sovereign will\" Territories and Lands on the Mainland of the Island of Borneo to Gustavus Baron de Overbeck of Hong Kong and Alfred Dent Esquire of London, as representatives of a British Company. This grant was to remain effective \"forever and in perpetuity all the rights and powers belonging to us over all the territories and lands\", for which the Sultan of Sulu would receive compensation of five thousand dollars a year. An important caveat was inserted: \"In case any dispute shall arise between His Highness, the Sultan, his heirs or successors and the said Gustavus Baron de Overbeck or his Company, it is hereby agreed that the matter shall be submitted to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Borneo.\"\n\nThese material facts are straightforward and incontestable. They are legally binding, as the Sultan of Sulu stated the land should be transferred and held \"for ever and in perpetuity\" by the British Company. Consequently, at Independence, all land in Malaya held by colonial Britain, including Sabah, became part of present-day Malaysia. That a single family, the Kirams, now backed by a European legal institution, has conjured reason to stake a claim to Sabah, is not just illegitimate, historically ignorant and politically ill-informed and downright expedient, it is absurd. Ultimately, it is part of the mess that the British left behind in Malaysia.\n\nThe Kiram family claims to Sabah are a perfect opportunity for former European empires to continue forcing their legal and financial instruments and institutions on Malaysia. This should be rejected by all parties, as it may set a nasty precedent for post-colonial societies around the world.\n\nOPINION: Britain is haunted by its violent colonial past\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",

    "House of the year, Malaysia: CIMB": "With the dawning of 2021, investors in Malaysia were cautiously optimistic that the worst of the pandemic was behind them but, as the year unfurled, it quickly became clear that recovery was going to be a slow process. Amid the persistent market turmoil and prolonged lockdowns, CIMB’s market-making and structuring capabilities continued to prove their worth.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic came as a real shock to the whole banking system. Faced with large-scale lockdowns and uncertainty as to when this would all end, some banks pared down their risk. But in CIMB’s case, we adapted and learned fast, and by the end of the year we had a strong liquidity position and were continuing to quote prices in the market,” says Chu Kok Wei, co-chief executive officer of group wholesale banking.\n\nAs a result, CIMB was able to maintain a leading position in the market and even strengthen its footprint in certain asset classes.\n\nRising rates\n\nCIMB’s strength in interest rate structuring has been particularly appreciated by clients, as clients have started to prepare for rising interest rates around the world.\n\n“In the last one year the overall market sentiment has changed,” says Chu. “We had many clients who were looking to lock in fixed dollar rates or even local ringgit interest rates, due to the higher interest rate environment that was taking hold from the end of last year.”\n\nAs the MYR interest rate curve has steepened, CIMB’s sophisticated warehousing capabilities have also allowed the bank to bring more competitive and advanced pricing to clients.\n\nAn example of this is the Callable Islamic Range Accrual (Cira) note, linked to the Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate. This product was originally launched in 2020, and proved a perfect fit for many of the bank’s clients during Covid by offering a safe harbour via exposure to traditionally stable MYR rates.\n\nAt the end of last year, with a rate-hike cycle widely expected to start in 2022, CIMB sensed an opportunity to improve pricing. At the end of March, CIMB was able to offer a profit rate of 4.28% per year, for a five-year Cira product, non-callable for six months. This was 2.48% above prevailing deposit rates at the time.\n\n“Given our warehousing capabilities we are able to provide very competitive pricing versus the market, and so we have seen an increase in the number of clients and new funds coming to the bank to buy our products,” says Chu.\n\nAs a result of this attractive pricing structure, volumes for Cira during the awards period under review increased by 576% compared to the previous 12 months.\n\nBut the strength of CIMB’s success is more than that. Not only does it offer its own products to the market, but other banks often turn to it for price-making on this.\n\n“Other banks have also reached out to us to hedge their issuance of the same product, so I would say that a lot of the other transaction volume seen in the Malaysia market is also coming back to CIMB itself,” says Chu.\n\nNew structures\n\nIn terms of new product launches at CIMB, one that has done particularly well was in the forex space: a Sharkfin structure that provides a variable yield linked directly to the movement of the underlying currency.\n\nThis principal-guaranteed product is intended to be fairly short-term – between six and 12 months – and can be adapted to the customer’s preferences by tweaking tenor, strike levels and currency pair. The product knocks out and pays the client a fixed coupon if its value dipped beneath a certain level.\n\n“This was the first time we had offered this kind of product to private banking clients in a principal-guaranteed format, and it filled the gap on our product shelf,” says Chu. “We have a lot of short-term products for forex, and many longer-term products for fixed income and rates, but we needed a product to fill the six-month to one-year tenor, and that is where this product fits in.”\n\nCredit\n\nOn the credit side, CIMB has been looking at ways of offering clients extra leverage.\n\nThe bank recently developed a product to provide investors with leveraged exposure to specified bonds on a non-recourse basis, with an option to buy at a tenor shorter than the underlying bond’s maturity. The product features various protective provisions including an early termination trigger that aims to mitigate the issuer’s risk while allowing sufficient scope for the investor to participate in the upside.\n\nCIMB says it has received a lot of inquiries from clients on this new product, although no trades have yet closed.\n\nAnother development was to allow the use of credit-linked notes (CLNs) as collateral for portfolio financing. This has enhanced the appeal of such notes for clients and contributed to the revival of CLN issuances that was seen at the start of the year.\n\n“We are confident these products will help to grow the business franchise and meet clients’ demand for leveraged tools to manage their investments,” says Chu.",

    "Swedish firms optimistic about outlook in Malaysia, survey shows": "KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 26): Many Swedish firms are optimistic about the overall economic outlook in Malaysia, with expectations of increased turnover and plans to increase their investments in the country in the next 12 months, according to a survey contributed by Team Sweden.\n\nTeam Sweden comprises the Swedish Trade and Invest Council (known as Business Sweden in Malaysia), Sweden's Embassy in Malaysia, and the Malaysian-Sweden Business Association (Masba).\n\nOf the 41 companies which completed the Malaysia Business Climate Survey 2022, being conducted during the second and third quarters of this year, 80% of those polled expect turnover to increase in the wake of a resumption of business activities.\n\nThe survey report was launched on Monday (Sept 26) by Team Sweden, represented by Swedish Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr. Joachim Bergström; Trade Commissioner of Sweden to Malaysia, The Swedish Trade & Invest Council, Emma Broms; and Masba president Carl Malmqvist.\n\nThe report noted that 54% of companies expect to slightly or significantly increase their investments, compared with 39% in the previous survey done in 2020.\n\n“Only 10% of companies plan to reduce investments, compared to 14% previously. This is a strong sign of confidence in Malaysia and demonstrates that despite the impact of Covid-19, Malaysia will continue to be an attractive destination for Swedish companies to invest and grow in Asia,” said the report.\n\nIt observed that Swedish companies experienced higher profitability in 2021, than in 2019.\n\n“66% of the Swedish companies [were] profitable in 2021, compared to 61% in 2019. Similarly, the number of companies operating at a loss has decreased from 20% in 2019 to 7% in 2021,” said the report.\n\nMost respondents have a neutral or positive perception of the current business climate in Malaysia, with 46% “neutral” and another 44% perceiving the climate as “good” or “very good”.\n\nComparably, the number of companies expressing that the business climate is “poor” or “very poor” decreased to 7% in 2022, from 11% in 2020.\n\nAbout 53% of the companies that responded to the survey have more than 1,000 global employees.\n\nThe respondents come from a wide range of industries. Industrial companies represent the largest sector at 47%, followed by professional services at 38%, and consumer companies at 16%.\n\nWhile most Swedish businesses in Malaysia remain focused on Peninsular Malaysia and have limited activities in Sabah and Sarawak, two out of three respondents have a plan to grow their business in the two Borneo states.\n\n“Some see great potential in the area, while others are more sceptical of the opportunities. Several respondents stated that they have not investigated the region yet, but that they see the growth and need to start developing a presence soon,” the report said.\n\nThis report also highlighted that Swedish companies perceive “personal safety”, “access to distributors”, and “service providers” to be key advantages in doing business in Malaysia.\n\n“However, concerns and challenges highlighted in the 2020 survey remain in place today. The lack of transparency, unsatisfactory labour market regulations, and finding skilled labour locally continue to be big struggles for Swedish companies present in Malaysia,” it added.\n\nA number of companies expressed concerns regarding the ability to bring in specialised staff from abroad.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the companies that experienced difficulties in bringing in specialised staff from abroad were also more likely to respond that they would not invest more in Malaysia, indicating improved visa arrangements would go a long way towards attracting more Swedish investment,” the report said.\n\nSome 77% of the companies surveyed said they had not experienced bribery or fraud, and 86% said they had not witnessed human or labour rights abuse.\n\nIn total, there are about 90 Swedish companies based in Malaysia.\n\nIn her presentation, trade commissioner Brooms said Swedish exports to Malaysia amounted to US$400 million in 2021, while Malaysian exports to Sweden reached US$600 million.",

    "Malaysia is the latest country to launch a ‘digital nomad’ visa": "Want to work remotely from Kuala Lumpur or Langkawi? Here’s what you need to know\n\nEver fancied living and working in Malaysia? Living it up in a snazzy Kuala Lumpur high rise, chilling out in a Penang beachside resort or packing up your laptop and heading for the lush Cameron Highlands? Well, here’s your chance. Malaysia is the latest country to launch a ‘digital nomad’ visa for remote workers – and it’ll be one of the most accessible schemes in the world.\n\nMalaysia’s new ‘digital nomad’ scheme is called the DE Rantau Nomad Pass and it’s designed to appeal to people who work remotely and can therefore live anywhere. Currently, remote workers from certain countries can work in Malaysia for up to 90 days, but under the new rules you could soon stay for up to two years.\n\nAnd, excitingly, Malaysia’s scheme will come with one notable upside that’ll make it accessible to plenty of potential applications. The scheme will be open to those earning just $24,000 (£21,000) per year, which makes it quite a bit more affordable than a few other similar schemes. (To qualify for the Costa Rican digital nomad scheme, for example, you need to be earning $36,000 (£30,000) per year.)\n\nTo be eligible for Malaysia’s DE Rantau pass, you’ll need to be either full-time or part-time employed, either on contract or as a freelancer, and be able to show proof of three months of employment.\n\nThe scheme is primarily aimed at people working in the IT industry, but there are no actual restrictions on who can apply.\n\nYou’ll be able to stay in Malaysia with the DE Rantau pass for up to 12 months, with the option to extend for another 12. The initial visa fee is 1,000 ringgit (£190, £220) and if you want to bring along any ‘dependents’ (spouses or children), they’ll cost an extra 500 ringgit (£95, $110) each.\n\nIf you’d like to find out more, further details are available on the official website here – applications open on October 1 2022. See you in KL!\n\nNow, check out all these dreamy destinations offering digital nomad visas.\n\nPlus: Colombia’s new digital nomad visa looks VERY tempting.",

    "Evolution of tours in Malaysia": "LETTER | Here is a first-hand account of looking back at the past and taking a glimpse into the future on the evolution of tourism in Malaysia, focussing on tour businesses.\n\n1959\n\nTrade Ministry initiated Tourism Department.\n\n1960s\n\nIn 1960, Mayflower Tours was founded. In 1963, Tan Chong set up Acme Hire-N-Drive - the pioneer car rental company. In 1965, it operated BM 9070 and BM 9429 - the first tour buses in Malaysia. In 1973, the two companies merged to become Mayflower Acme Tours.\n\n1972\n\nTourism Department was converted to Tourist Development Corporation (TDC) but was wrongly named, just like Kuala Lumpur Tourist Association in 1963. Both organisations should have used tourism instead of tourist. TDC introduced licensing of tourist guides in 1975.\n\n1973\n\nI joined Mayflower as a tourist guide cum limousine driver, and drove VIPs and visitors travelling on independent tours. My first day was spent observing a tourist guide conducting a full-day sightseeing bus tour around Kuala Lumpur. On my second day, I was assigned to conduct the same tour all by myself although without being trained as a tour guide or having prior experience.\n\nBut I managed to perform well, thanks to several factors. Like many of my peers in those days, I studied in English-medium schools and excelled in geography and history. I spoke English while working in several large motor firms and later when selling life and general insurance.\n\nPassengers were mainly hotel guests and receptionists were paid commissions for booking tours. I saw the potential of these daily sightseeing bus tours, but Mayflower was too busy with inbound and outbound tours, airline ticketing and car rental. Later, a small new company concentrated on daily bus tours and made a fortune from shopping commissions over the years.\n\nFor more than 50 years, daily bus tours operate from both Kuala Lumpur and Penang. But sadly, they are still not available in many destinations. And as long as daily bus tours are not operating from a city, tourism around the area will remain in its infancy. It would be too costly for visitors to charter a taxi or tour car or van for sightseeing within the city or travel overland to another.\n\nThe first tourist that I handled was an elderly Argentinian doctor who could only speak Spanish, but I could not. Her sightseeing tour plus arrival and departure transfers were provided using a touring car that I drove. After escorting her to the check-in counter for her departure flight, I chose to wait, for sentimental reasons, until the aircraft finally took off before leaving Subang Airport.\n\nI also remember very well the first tour group that I handled. Upon reaching the airport for the departure flight, the tour leader disclosed that she has never met a tour guide who is more sincere, not knowing that it was my first tour group. I managed to cover up because my English was clear and easily understood. But I became jaded within two years of hearing myself parroting.\n\nMost of my tour groups were Americans while those on independent tours were Australians. During this period, my colleagues were busy with Australian groups that would also travel overland from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Our Japanese-speaking tourist guides became very rich from shopping commissions, as gold jewellery here was very much cheaper than in Japan.\n\n1975\n\nI accepted an offer to work in the office as a tours coordinator and communicating with foreign tour operators was mainly via snail mail and rarely used facsimile or telex machines. Then, the cost of making long-distance phone calls could possibly wipe out meagre profits.\n\nI also handled tour coach charter bookings and the rate was RM500 per day. Then, new double-storey link houses was selling for below RM28,000. Today, the same house has a market value of around RM840,000 or 30 times more, whereas coach charter rates have only about doubled.\n\n1980s\n\nIn 1987, the Culture, Arts & Tourism Ministry was established and TDC was absorbed into the ministry, which set up the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB) as its marketing arm. Tour Operating Business and Travel Agency Business (TOBTAB) regulations were also introduced requiring all travel and tour businesses to be registered with the ministry.\n\nOver the next 20 years, the ministry would be tight-fisted on issuing TOBTAB licences, forcing people with financial resources and wanting to venture into travel businesses on their own to buy over existing companies that were either dormant or faring poorly.\n\n1990s\n\nThe first Visit Malaysia Year (VMY) was in 1990. It was so successful that we got greedy and held another one within four years. In 1993, MTPB held a “Make it Malaysia 1994” campaign by inviting leading outbound tour operators from around the world to revisit our country.\n\nThis was because they were the ones that determined what tours are to be contained in their annual catalogues. And if one or more tour packages were to include Malaysia in the itinerary, then their customers will get to visit our country. If none, we would be left out or bypassed.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to get foreign tour operators to sell Malaysia was to invite them to come and experience what we have to offer. Leading outbound tour operators could travel to anywhere in the world for free, as there was no shortage of businesses eager to host them.\n\nIn 1993 for example, MTPB extended invitations to top American and Canadian tour operators, Malaysia Airlines issued them complimentary return airline tickets, Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents’ members provided complimentary airport transfers and sightseeing tours, and Malaysian Association of Hotels’ members offered complimentary suites.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2004, the name was changed to Ministry of Tourism after the culture and art portfolios were moved to another ministry. Following 50 years of independence, we celebrated VMY 2007 and before that, TOBTAB licences were liberalised, allowing many to join the tourism bandwagon.\n\nIn 1990, Malaysia received less than 7.5 million foreign tourists. The number rose to 10.2 million in 2000 and almost 21 million in VMY 2007. Subsequently, the number kept rising every year until we reached a record high of 27.44 million in VMY 2014.\n\nWhile inbound tours plateaued from 2015 to 2019 with an average of 26 million arrivals per year, the travel agency business was crushed after airlines stopped paying sales commissions in 2008. Until then, commissions were five percent for domestic flight tickets and nine percent for international.\n\nWhen travel agencies started charging service fees to survive, customers learned to book flights on their own, as online reservations have been simplified. By then, airlines were confident that they could deal directly with almost all their passengers, rendering travel agencies dispensable.\n\n2010s\n\nBudget carriers have allowed many people in Malaysia and around the region to travel cheaply by air, both domestically and internationally. And cruises have grown popular just as the size of passenger ships has grown from below 100,000 gross tonnages to several hundred thousand.\n\nInternational travel was at its peak during this period, with outbound tour operators making a killing, even though a large number of Malaysians travelled overseas by making do-it-yourself arrangements. And inbound tour operators were geared for a record year in VMY 2020.\n\n2020s\n\nThe world came crashing down after Covid-19 struck in early 2020 and international travel was the worst hit after borders were closed for leisure travel and domestic tourism was severely impacted by internal travel restrictions.\n\nWhile many inbound and outbound tour operators could lay off staff, those saddled with tour vehicles had no income to repay hire-purchase loans or for leasing. Worse, unutilised vehicles continued to depreciate and could not be sold off because there were no buyers.\n\nTravel arrangements in future\n\nTour operators that run tour vehicles to provide transfer and sightseeing services will continue to be needed, while those acting as middle persons will be phased out by the latest technology - just like most travel agencies in 2008 and film cameras replaced by digital cameras in smartphones.\n\nGiant online travel agents have long cornered the market for booking flights and hotels, and e-hailing apps for transport services upon arrival.\n\nSuper apps of the future would offer all-inclusive value packages with options for transport, meals, accommodation and entertainment at every destination for travellers to enjoy to the hilt, similar to the all-you-can-eat buffet concept.\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini.",

It represents a concerted effort by the government in defining its approach for the energy sector with an aim of driving the country towards benefiting from and embracing the energy transition megatrend. The NEP covers all energy sources including both renewable and non-renewable sources, and also covers the use of energy across all sectors of the economy. To ensure the effective implementation of the NEP, the government will establish a National Energy Council (chaired by the Prime Minister) which will be responsible for steering the agenda under the NEP.\n\nWe set out below a summary of some of the targets, action plans and initiatives under the NEP, relating mainly to the areas of renewable and alternative energy, grid systems, mobility trends and greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") reporting.\n\nNEP Targets\n\nThe NEP prescribes certain targets (benchmarked against 2018) which are intended to usher the nation towards being a low carbon nation by 2040, some of which are as follows:\n\nto increase the total installed capacity of renewable energy from 7,597MW to 18,431MW and to increase the percentage of renewable energy in the total primary energy supply from 7.2% to 17% (to consist primarily of 4% solar, 4% bioenergy and 9% hydro);\n\nto reduce the percentage of coal in installed capacity from 31.4% to 18.6%;\n\nto increase the percentage of electric vehicle share in the country from less than 1% to 38%; and\n\nto increase the percentage of residential energy efficiency savings and industrial and commercial energy efficiency savings from less than 1% to 10% and 11%, respectively.\n\nNEP Action Plans and Initiatives\n\nHighlighted below are some of the initiatives that the government has committed to undertake in respect of the following ten action plans (out of the thirty-one that are set out in the NEP):\n\nEnhance and unlock potential of solar resources\n\nMaintain a long-term pipeline of large-scale solar projects , with indicative total package and lot sizes, optimised between large solar parks and smaller scale packages.\n\n, with indicative total package and lot sizes, optimised between large solar parks and smaller scale packages.

More importantly, the NEP sets the tone for the development of the energy sector in the next two decades and is anticipated to have a major impact on the entire energy value chain, from production and generation up to distribution and usage by the end users.\n\nThe relevant government agencies and regulators are also expected to issue a deluge of guidelines, policies and regulations in the near future, which will undoubtedly have an outsized effect on the evolution of the energy ecosystem. Industry players and stakeholders are encouraged to keep an eye out for any such developments and to align their strategies and approaches in order to fully benefit from what would likely be a seismic shift in the energy landscape.\n\nShould you require further information on the National Energy Policy or any other matter pertaining to projects, energy and infrastructure, please feel free to reach out to our team at your convenience, through the Christopher & Lee Ong partners listed hereunder.",
    "Malaysia’s China Dilemma": "Decades of progress are expected to yield the desired outcome in charting Malaysia’s own autonomous and independent orientation of survival and interests but as a middle power, there are structural limitations on its true capacity.\n\nIts military posture is comprehensively defensive in nature, with manoeuvres and strategic orientations based on an integrated and credible defensive force that is both deterring and effective in warding off threats. Malaysia’s foreign policy orientation has for decades upheld the sanctity of centrality and non-alignment deemed as the best basis in safeguarding its interests. These two critical aspects of security and foreign policy have for years been in the doldrum of public interests, where there is a disconnect between the masses and the resonance in defence and security affiliation. Critical conduits of the South China Sea dispute and its importance to its economic and security considerations, among others, have taken the path of ideological and country-based support and affiliation, superseding Malaysia’s own core interests and role in charting its best returns. Some see China, being the inevitable neighbour to Malaysia and the region as a long term curse, while to others, it brings a welcomed assurance and stability.\n\nExternal observers remain puzzled by the predominant public ignorance on the importance of the South China Sea to Malaysia’s economic survival, seeing how the prevailing revenues from oil and gas are derived from its assets in this region, apart from marine resources and others. Decades of consistent stability in income and revenue have created complacency in creating a future driven strategic protection of its assets and potential, taking the spectre of resources and sovereignty for granted with the reliance and trust put on its policymakers with the policy orientation of being central and friendly to all nations, as the main bulwark of its survival and asset protection.\n\nChallenges and threats to its resources by intrusive measures and tactics by external powers, including China, have not been given serious attention that warrants a strong deterrent measure. Alone as a country, there is insufficient capacity to forge sufficient tools for its own economic development and in defending its interests and survival. In the economic sphere, prevalent dependence on regional and global architectures increasingly shaped by Beijing’s economic agenda remains ingrained. Out of sheer urgent and desperate scramble for market, trade, capital, access and resources, Kuala Lumpur faces no option but to leverage on the easiest source of support readily provided by Beijing, from BRI to RCEP. On security and defence fronts, the lack of long term strategic and future driven planning especially in jettisoning the entrenched reliance on Beijing is laid bare, afraid to pivot to the superior forces of the West, and trapped in developing its own internal defensive capacities.\n\nIn facing imminent risks and threats to Malaysia’s interests and assets, especially in the South China Sea, are the Malaysians adequately able to create credible and effective deterrence measures against Beijing? What will be the responses of ASEAN that Malaysia has pinned so much effort on in building its role and influence? Will ASEAN and other regional players be beholden to the threats and greater chips and cards if Beijing in economic retaliations? All these remain critical pondering points for Kuala Lumpur as it juggles its position, now trapped between a rock and a hard place. Beijing seeks to exploit ASEAN’s centrality, which translates to a free hand for it to continue the current test and build approach. This involves testing the responses and extent of retaliation of regional players, all while continuing its building of more offensive military and power projection capacities in the South China Sea.\n\nChanges over the decades in Malaysia’s foreign policy orientation from being pro West to non-alignment has produced mixed results in some parameters, and dwindling prospects in others. It is crucial at the new juncture of facing conventional and non-traditional threats in deciphering the question of the cost benefit analysis of this stand. How are the impact and outcome being measured and on what grounds and basis they are considered? What will be the real calculated impact on the ground for both the public and the nation of the orientation pursued? Are the Malaysians better off and more secure or otherwise? Will Malaysia’s current close partners that have been relentlessly pursued, especially Beijing and other players in the Middle East, provide the expected restraints or overtures and returns in the events of conflicts?\n\nShort term gains and dependence based on its current economic state and political necessities might render its overtures and continued dependence on Beijing and others to be inevitable, especially when the returns are enticing and lucrative. To jettison its addictive and easy dependence trap, long-term strategic calculations must supersede current financial gains alone, where future stability in the returns and impact of the right partnership based on proven track record and pillars of values, trust and principles matter more in essence.\n\nFor this, great wisdom and strategic manoeuvring are crucial, in ensuring the sustainability of its assets and to diversify its defence and policy allies and partners. Malaysia’s military and security scope are limited to cautious pandering, with participation in military exercises and arms purchases, together with locally advancing military complex forming the conventional basis of its military and security ventures. To ensure its future transition in power parity and in readying for future vulnerability and risks, it is a calling to recalibrate its security postures and to seek concrete and resilient defence partnerships based on trust, values and lasting principles. Its current FPDA partnership must be upheld and strengthened, notwithstanding the arguments against FPDA’s role and impact. Its ASEAN gamble must be reassessed, taking into account future resilience and influence, especially the returns of assurances that it will derive from an uncertain fate awaiting ASEAN. The grouping remains a future lost cause barring any credible and lasting reforms in this approach, and lacking an effective deterrence tool and waning effectiveness and influence, ASEAN’s future lustre is contingent upon it deciding to continue its centrality and hands-off approach or to be bold in a new agenda setting.\n\nIn fearing upsetting Beijing and not to be seen to pivot away from its enduring path of non-alignment, Malaysia is reluctant to engage in any deeper defence and military partnership with the West and Washington unlike the Philippines and Singapore, out of the main basis of maintaining its autonomy and independence in policy orientation. The real impact on its future survival in the case of a full-blown conflict in the region that threatens its sovereignty and survival, amidst the centrality approach, is worth a proper re-evaluation. At what expense will its shunning of deeper military and security partnerships with established powers like Washington be, in the event of the country needing the right and urgent support in deterrence measures and in conflict management?\n\nWhile there is no permanent friend or enemy in the global geopolitical arena, a friendship in disguise and a wrong enemy for target are the recipe of a strategic misstep and backfire. It is of utmost importance to note, that China’s future regional and global hegemonic ascension is not cast in stone, and conversely, America’s perceived decline and loss of power comparatively is not inevitable. For now, the region and in most part Malaysia itself, are driven by this notion of growing multipolarity dictated by Beijing, and casting their bets on the periphery of China’s rise in preparing for the future where Beijing’s influence and dominance in almost all sectors of growth are perceived to be inevitable.\n\nThe outcome of this global rivalry with increased bipolar power competition with shifting geopolitical architecture is far from sealed. It is easy to discredit and write off Washington’s future power resilience, and the Malaysians and the regional players might find themselves on the wrong footing, at their own larger collective expense. It will be too late to be mired in the lost opportunities by then, where the fall-out from the potential full-blown conflict would change the dynamics of regional and global trust. Most importantly, the trust and balance of power will be permanently redrawn.\n\n[Photo by World Bank]\n\n*Collins Chong Yew Keat has been serving in University of Malaya for more than nine years.

    "Malaysia supports Bucharest Declaration on ‘Building a Better Digital Future for All’": "KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 25): Malaysia, in principle, supports the aspirations of the Bucharest Declaration on “Building a Better Digital Future for All”, which affirms the country’s collective commitment to universal connectivity and sustainable digital transformation.\n\nCommunications and Multimedia Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa said it has been Malaysia’s top priority to accelerate the deployment of a robust network and prepare the nation for transition to digital economy and to this end, it has declared communications as a utility, similar to water and electricity.\n\n“We have also launched high-level national agendas under the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDIGITAL) and National Digital Network (JENDELA) to ensure coverage and quality of broadband to transform Malaysia into a digitally-driven, high-income nation and a regional leader in the digital economy.”\n\nHe said this during the Ministerial Roundtable session at the International Telecommunication Union Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 (ITU PP22) in Bucharest, Romania.\n\nHowever, Annuar said while ensuring universal access, and equitable and inclusive use of telecommunications and ICTs towards digital transformation to empower people, the access and adoption of digitalisation for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), particularly in developing economies, need to be addressed.\n\n“Hence, a major part of digital transformation in Malaysia involves driving the active e-commerce adoption and digitalisation of our MSMEs. The digital economy is a primary component of Malaysia’s economic strength,” he said.\n\nCurrently, the digital economy contributes 22.6% to the national gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected to reach 25.5% by 2025.\n\nAnnuar said to drive the digital economy contribution, the government had introduced the National eCommerce Strategic Roadmap (NESR) 2.0 to facilitate cross-border digital opportunities that prioritised participation of local businesses and MSMEs in eCommerce, targeting 875,000 MSMEs to adopt eCommerce by 2025.\n\n“It is Malaysia’s view that universal connectivity and sustainable digital transformation go beyond rolling out enabling infrastructure and technologies.\n\n“We are committed to working together towards realisation of the five commitments and the 10 key principles outlined in the Bucharest Declaration on ‘Building a Better Digital Future for All’,” he added.\n\nAnnuar is leading the Malaysian delegation at ITU PP22 in Bucharest, Romania from Monday (Sept 26) until Oct 14.\n\nITU PP22, which will be participated by 181 countries, is very special and significant for the country, as Malaysia will bid for a seat in the ITU Council under Region E (Asia and Australasia) for the 2023-2026 term.",
    "DRR team mission to Malaysia": "DRR team mission to Malaysia\n\nLast Friday 2 September a Dutch Risk Reduction-Team (DRR-Team) from the Netherlands presented the preliminary results on flood mitigation in Malaysia following their two-week mission.\n\n“The floods of December 2021 in Malaysia left almost 50 dead, required the evacuation of about 400,000 people, and resulted in an overall estimate of RM6.1 billion in financial losses. Unprecedented volumes of rainfall left areas on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia under almost four meters of water and turned roads into rivers.” (Source: Report ISEAS – YUSOF ISHAK INSTITUTE).\n\nMany countries around the world face severe water threats. And due to climate change and a fast growing world population, these threats are becoming even more urgent. There is a growing need for advise on how to build a sustainable and safer water future. To meet these needs with a swift response, the Dutch government has initiated the DRR-Team. This team of experts advises governments free of charge on how to resolve urgent water issues related to flood risks, water pollution and water supply. Furthermore, it gives advice on how to prevent calamities or to rebuild after water related disasters. The DRR-team visited Malaysia between August 22 and September 2 and consisted of five experts, led by team leader Marco Hartman. Marco is a senior consultant Water and Climate and at HKV, and has previously advised in a DRR-Team in Myanmar, Bulgaria and Albania. The team will advise the Malaysian government on developing a strategy for dealing with persistent flooding problems across the country.\n\nMarco Hartman states: “It was a pleasure to work with skilled and motivated Malaysian experts and the DRR team is grateful for their support during field visits and workshops.”\n\nThe team visited sites at Sabak Bernam district, they had a look at the badly affected Kuala Langat riverside and they looked at Putrajaya wetlands, an example of a successful nature based solution implemented in an urban setting.\n\nThe team presented several challenges related to land use planning, data and modelling and the time frame needed for implementation of sustainable long term flood risk management. They also highlighted opportunities to make a start with a pro-active approach in Flood Risk Management.\n\nThe DRR team is in the process of preparing a final report that includes possible follow up actions which will be handed over officially to the Ministry of Environment and Water Malaysia at ASIAWATER on the 9th of December.",
    "‘Grief and memory’: Challenging Malaysia’s historical narratives": "A new documentary performance seeks to unpick the official narrative on the multiethnic Southeast Asian nation’s road to independence.\n\nThree Malaysian artists take turns scribbling symbols and motifs with chalk on a blackboard floor that doubles as a stage, singing and telling stories. A screen hung behind the stage shows live interview footage, helping take audiences on a multimedia journey that transcends traditional theatrical performance to shed light on the skeletons in the closet of Malaysian history.\n\n“We wanted to critically bring on stage the tools of the documentary or supposed ‘truth-making’ world – various cameras and media techniques such as the green screen,” director Mark Teh, a member of the Kuala Lumpur-based collective Five Arts Centre, founded in 1984, told Al Jazeera of his latest play A Notional History (2019). “The performers do everything in our show: there are no blackouts or backstage for them to hide, no stage managers to come in and transform the set.”\n\nA Notional History made its debut in Malaysia earlier in July to sold-out venues after a two-year delay because of COVID-19 performance restrictions. It features performer and musician Faiq Syazwan Kuhiri of punk band Terrer, journalist Rahmah Pauzi, and prominent political graphic designer and illustrator Fahmi Reza.\n\nMixing audiovisuals, shared perspectives, and what Teh defines as “social acting” — non-actors who perform as a version of themselves — the play digs deep into the Malaysian history of inherited memories and official narratives, and what happened during the Malayan Emergency.\n\nThe 12-year conflict, which began under colonial rule and ended in 1960 after Malaysia had become an independent nation, remains a controversial topic. The war was largely fought in the jungles between the pro-independence communist fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army, and the soldiers of the British colonisers.\n\n“I can attribute it to the contested narrative and enduring campaign designed by both the British colonial government as well as the ruling government post-independence with the ultimate objective to suppress any elements of progressive and leftist political fronts in the region,” said Zikri Rahman, the programme coordinator for Pusat Sejarah Rakyat, an independent Kuala Lumpur-based organisation focused on archiving and publishing different forms of historical material from a people’s perspective.\n\n“Not only that, but the issue also remains contested as it does take a racialised turn on who can claim to be a victim during the Emergency period,” Zikri told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the country’s ethnic Chinese were relocated to so-called “new villages” so that the jungle-based fighters would not be able to come to them for food and other support, while the Malays were the target of what Zukri says was “a much subtler campaign of land redistribution and economic reform. Both communities were experiencing a violent act of displacement and dispossession.”\n\nTeaching history\n\nHistory is a compulsory subject for secondary school students in Malaysia and A Notional History was inspired by the publication of new history textbooks that were released in 2020.\n\nThe “updating” had begun under the United Malays National Organisation(UMNO)-dominated Barisan Nasional coalition that controlled Malaysia for more than 60 years after independence, but the books were only published after the 2018 general elections when the coalition lost power for the first time.\n\n“It so happened that the revisions for the Form Four textbook – which focuses on the period encompassing World War II, the Japanese occupation, the Malayan Emergency, and Merdeka (independence) – coincided with UMNO’s fall and the coming into power of the Pakatan Harapan coalition led by Mahathir Mohamad,” Teh told Al Jazeera. Mahathir himself had previously been the leader of UMNO and prime minister of Malaysia for more than 20 years.\n\n“This textbook was published in 2020, and we were really keen to compare what had changed between the revisions, and more interestingly, to consider what remained unchangeable or ‘unforgivable’ – even under a New Malaysia.”\n\nThe performance makes use of original video interviews with exiled former Malaysian communist revolutionaries. UMNO, the ethnic Malay party that has long dominated Malaysian politics, opposed the fighters from its founding in 1946, and when in power promoted a narrative that the communists, who were mostly but not entirely ethnic Chinese, were a threat to national security and order.\n\nUncovering historical erasures, exclusions, and the official narrative of the communist fight, A Notional History is another collaboration by a tight-knit group of friends and revolving collaborators who have produced a variety of theatre performances, documentary videos, art exhibitions, curatorial projects, participatory interventions, and online initiatives over the past 15 years.\n\nEarlier projects have also focused on history – after years of meticulous research – including Baling (2015-18), Version 2020 (2017-18) and Fragments of Tuah (2022).\n\nBaling was somewhat of a precursor to A Notional History, dabbling in the big unanswered questions of Malaysia’s bumpy road to independence by reconstructing and analysing the historic December 1955 negotiations between Tunku Abdul Rahman (the then-soon-to-be first prime minister of newfound Malaysia), David Marshall, who represented the then-Crown Colony of Singapore, and Chin Peng – the much feared and demonised leader of the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army.\n\nReading directly from public transcripts, Baling’s performer-researchers reflected on the meaning of freedom, loyalty, “terrorism”, and surrender.\n\n“One of the threads in Baling was to relook at the figure of Chin Peng and deconstruct or demystify this Public Enemy Number One – or Most Wanted Man in the British Empire, or Last Communist,” Teh told Al Jazeera. “Rather than focusing on his life story, we investigated how the monstrous phantom of Chin Peng had been operationalised by the British and then the Malayan/Malaysian government through propaganda and fearmongering.”\n\nTeh believes that the national hysteria around Chin Peng is a paradox - exiled across the border in southern Thailand, the communist leader was physically absent from Malaysia, but the nation went to great lengths to make him feel “present” and “dangerous”. Even in 2013 after Chin Peng’s death, the then-government refused to allow his ashes to be returned to the country.\n\nDangers of communist label\n\nA Notional History follows a similar direction to Baling by interweaving monologues, songs, and music by Terrer’s Faiq, and Fahmi’s detailed explanations of what sections of the national history textbooks misrepresent historical facts from the crucial decade before Malaysia declared independence on August 31, 1957.\n\nA screen behind the performers enhances the points of view of the non-actors with interview footage from Revolusi ’48, Fahmi’s unreleased documentary on 11 communist rebel fighters who disappeared into the northern Malaysian jungle in 1948 – a companion piece to his earlier documentary 10 Tahun Sebelum Merdeka (Ten Years Before Independence), which chronicled the Malaya-wide day of protest against Britain’s undemocratic proposals for a Federation of Malaya, and the rise of the people’s democratic movement in Malaya.\n\n“We saw these as the various different strands that contributed to Malaya’s struggle for independence, besides UMNO-Barisan National. But as Fahmi mentions in the performance, he was not able to complete the documentary as he was worried it would be misinterpreted as glorifying armed violence, and he was also concerned about the backlash – of being labelled a communist sympathiser,” Teh told Al Jazeera.\n\nA Notional History also includes footage from the 2018 public forum in Kuala Lumpur, Should We Rewrite Our History Textbooks? in which Fahmi was publicly attacked by Malaysian right-wing groups.\n\nThe episode triggered a harsh social media backlash during which the activist was called a “communist”.\n\n“Within certain contexts – such as Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia – the label ‘communist’ has been weaponised by the state and their supporters to discredit, imprison and even eliminate and murder people,” said Teh.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 lockdowns, A Notional History was presented with success at the Performing Arts Meeting in the Japanese city of Yokohama, as well as in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of thousands of people were accused of being communists in Indonesia between 1965 and 1966, and killed.\n\n“In Indonesia, the topic of communism is more charged than the other places we’ve performed at,” Faiq told Al Jazeera of the performance at Teater Salihara. “The audience’s reaction to the struggles of the [Malaysian] communists felt deeper and more immediate”.\n\nAs soon as the world began to reopen, the play made its debut outside of Asia in May 2022 at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels – one of the leading European festivals for contemporary performing arts – before finally arriving back in Malaysia.\n\n“It’s been a blessing to be able to perform it in different countries, feeling the slight differences in reactions from different places,” said Faiq.\n\n“What I’ve learned from this process is that even though the subject matter of our work has its own specificities to Malaysian history, it is also universal. […] What I wish the audience felt and saw in the performance, at least from my perspective, is to take into account the personal choices, encounters, desires, griefs and memories of these old communists based on a decision they made a long time ago.”",

Anwar said Thursday he believes his three-party alliance has a “fair chance” of winning a general election that could be called as early as November. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)\n\nBANGKOK (AP) — Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday he believes his three-party alliance has a “fair chance” of winning a general election that could be called as early as November.\n\nAnwar leads the Hope Alliance, which earlier teamed up with an ethnic Malay party led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for a historic win in 2018 elections. Anger over corruption led to the shocking defeat of the United Malays National Organization, which had ruled Malaysia since its independence from Britain in 1957.\n\nAnwar was in prison at the time on sodomy charges he said were politically motivated. He was pardoned after the polls, and was due to take over as prime minister from Mahathir. But the reformist government collapsed after less than two years due to defections, and UMNO returned to power.\n\nAnwar, 75, said in a news conference in Bangkok, Thailand, that his coalition still has strong support, while there is infighting within current Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s governing coalition and corruption within the government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“I remain optimistic,” he said. “I think we should have a fair chance” without Mahathir on the basis of the Hope Alliance’s own strength, Anwar said.\n\nHe said there is a small possibility that the election will be called in November, but it may also be held by February or March to avoid the yearend monsoon season that often brings heavy rain and floods.\n\nA general election is not due until September next year, but Ismail has come under pressure from within UMNO to dissolve Parliament for early polls. Ismail has advanced the introduction of the 2023 budget by three weeks to Oct. 7, sparking speculation that Parliament may be dissolved after generous budgetary allocations are made to win support in the polls. An election must be called within 60 days after Parliament is dissolved.\n\nAlthough Ismail is from UMNO, he is dependent on support from allied Malay parties. UMNO, which has said it will not work with its current allies in the upcoming polls, is aiming to win big so it will not be beholden to any other parties.\n\nCalls for early polls from UMNO intensified after ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak began a 12-year jail term last month after losing his final appeal in a graft case linked to the massive looting of the 1MDB state fund.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnwar said Najib, with some other UMNO ministers, last year signed an pledge to support Anwar’s bid to become prime minister but wanted Anwar to promise that he would not be convicted. Anwar said his leadership bid failed because he refused to interfere with Najib’s court cases.\n\nHe said Najib’s imprisonment was a “clear-cut case” and should be a lesson to all political leaders not to squander public funds.",

    "Embodying the spirit of Malaysia": "Malaysia has made great strides since the Federation of Malaysia was established on Sept 16, 1963, with advancements in all segments, especially real estate. The local real estate market is heavily influenced by the country’s cultures, diversity and multiethnic backgrounds, traditions and spectacular food.\n\nWe asked local developers what makes their company uniquely Malaysian, what being Malaysian means to them, and their hopes for the country.\n\nBON ESTATES SDN BHD\n\nCEO\n\nCHAN JIN-WY Our people make our company uniquely Malaysian. But this goes beyond the context of our citizenship — it is Bon Estates’ shared values, perspectives and culture that bind us. These are elements we incorporate into our work, because we know creating a satisfying environment for Malaysians means understanding a quality of life that uniquely appeals to us, while elevating it to a level that also meets the aspirations of a new generation. Being a Malaysian means the capacity to embrace a diversity of ideas, influences and experiences. Our multicultural heritage makes the word ‘diversity’ our greatest strength, as we are an amalgamation of different voices that have found common purpose and mutual respect in a place we all call home. My hope for the future of our country is harmony, which begins with better governance and accountability for all layers of society. To progress, we must first have the courage to embrace our shared history, so that everyone understands that we are all united with a singular purpose, shared goals and loyalty to each other. With this in place, together we can imagine, innovate and achieve a well-crafted nation.\n\nECO WORLD\n\nDEVELOPMENT GROUP BHD\n\nPRESIDENT AND CEO\n\nDATUK CHANG KHIM WAH\n\nWhat we do and who we are make EcoWorld a uniquely Malaysian brand. Through our efforts in nation-building and placemaking, we create environments and opportunities for Malaysians from all walks of life. We are powered by a young and dynamic team that constantly looks for innovative ways to shape the real estate industry.\n\nWe Malaysians are a passionate bunch. Nothing unites us faster and stronger than a common love for food and sports. So, like my fellow countrymen, I’m all for Malaysian food — undisputedly, the best in the world! I’m also a huge fan of football and enjoy a good badminton match.\n\nMalaysia is a truly beautiful country with so much raw potential. I hope that the country I love stays that way so that our children and their children will also be able to enjoy it. This is one of the reasons why it is so important for EcoWorld to create liveable and sustainable spaces that will last for generations to come.\n\nEASTERN & ORIENTAL BHD (E&O)\n\nEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\n\nDATUK TEE ENG HO As you know, E&O is a unique Malaysian brand. Our hotel is an emblem of Penang (and indeed, Malaysia) and its myriad cultures, while giving the briefest nod to our colonial past. The company itself features a true diversity of local talent, and we celebrate and respect our many festivals and customs joyfully and equally. Being Malaysian to me means living together happily in the melting pot of cultures — especially when it comes to the cuisine. Where else can you eat a Malay breakfast of nasi lemak, lunch of Indian banana leaf rice and top it off with Chinese bak kut teh for dinner? In the future, I hope that all Malaysians will band together to protect and nurture this beautiful country to greater heights. We are stronger together, and I firmly believe that we can do it, both for ourselves and the generations that follow.\n\nGAMUDA LAND\n\nCEO\n\nNGAN CHEE MENG\n\nI believe these qualities — sincerity, responsibility and originality — make us uniquely Malaysian.\n\nWith these three qualities guiding us in everything we do, we are able to work with nature, preserving it and restoring our motherland. With originality, we are able to bring in innovative designs and town-making concepts that suit Malaysian needs. For example, we have brought in many ‘firsts’ to Malaysia, such as New Zealand’s Skyline Luge in Gamuda Gardens, Cove Aerobar at Gamuda Cove and exciting rides and attractions at our upcoming SplashMania rainforest-themed water park to create places that our Malaysian community can be proud of, gather in and get to know one another.\n\nI have always felt that the best thing about being a Malaysian is our wonderful multicultural society. At the same time, we care for and respect each other’s uniqueness. Personally, I also like that our society has grown to become more environmental-friendly and hopefully, with time, we will all learn to appreciate and work together to protect the natural beauty surrounding us.\n\nMy wish is for our people to be more progressive; be people-centric and learn to care for each other, regardless of our differences; and grow our civic-mindedness to nurture a society that cares about the environment.\n\nHOCK SENG LEE BHD\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nTONY YU We’re a Malaysian company with a workforce that reflects the Malaysian demographic. Hock Seng Lee’s employees are 89% Malaysian. And like this country, we have a generally youthful workforce — more than 85% are under 54 years old, with the largest segment (32%) between 25 and 34 years old, which matches Malaysia’s median age of 30 years. As a Sarawakian company, we are most proud that we reflect the region’s racial make-up. Our human resource makes us a Malaysian company. Being a Malaysian means unity in diversity and a strong ‘can-do’ spirit; this is the true ‘Malaysia Boleh’ mindset. We’re a developing nation and a learning nation. Malaysians have a positive attitude, believing that we can achieve what we aim for. Being Malaysian means being excited that the best is yet to come. And while most countries are only learning to be multiracial, we’ve been multiracial and multicultural since independence. My hope for Malaysia, and Sarawak within it, is to be harmonious, hardworking and entrepreneurial. Our country is a great melting pot of Asia’s cultures, and with a colonial heritage. Like the best of Asian nations, we can marry the best of east and west; Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan come to mind. As a Malaysian company in the ambitiously governed Sarawak, Hock Seng Lee hopes to build on strong foundations for the next generation. Our company motto, ‘We’re Building Your Future Today’, is inspired by Malaysia’s progressive forefathers who gave us independence.\n\nICONIC WORLDWIDE BHD\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nDATUK TAN KEAN TET\n\nTo be Malaysian is to embrace the cultural richness and diversity that exists within the country. Malaysia is a melting pot of cultures where the population comes from individuals from all walks of life. Lest we forget our Malaysian identity, we set to emulate this same identity and implement it within the group.\n\nAs I reach the age of 60, I have had the opportunity to see Malaysia grow to where it is now — from an agricultural to an industrial country that is a top producer and exporter of various products. To be able to witness such tremendous change in a lifetime, I, too, was inspired to be part of the change and contribute to the country’s development. It is a way for me to show my respect for my home country.\n\nAs Malaysia goes through a tumultuous time amid economic hardships, my aspiration for the country is to overcome these hurdles. I believe we can get back on our feet again, as we have done before. Getting through these challenging times won’t be an easy feat, yet we can all do our part in moving forward together.\n\nWith that aspiration, I am committed to bringing our country to greater heights through our expertise in property development and our recent venture into the medical segment.\n\nJKG LAND BHD\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nDATUK TEH KEAN MING Malaysia is unique as it has a diversity of race, culture and religion. The upbringing of Malaysians in this environment has created a uniquely Malaysian talent pool. Malaysian talent are well-versed in multiple languages and well-entrenched in diverse cultural practices. Diversity of staff — each drawing their respective strengths, in a mutually inclusive environment — has become a ‘natural’ characteristic of a Malaysian company. The intrinsic ability of our talent to live and work harmoniously among these diversities and be readily inclusive to accept differences make Malaysian companies uniquely Malaysian. While making our mark, Malaysian companies with this intrinsic ability are able to go to global markets to forge excellent business ties, as these companies are readily accepted by international communities. Being a Malaysian means peace-loving, resilient and readily inclusive in accepting the co-living of diversities. The ability and willingness to accept, enjoy and celebrate cultural differences is a natural characteristic of all Malaysians. From our well-established base, I hope that the strong attributes of Malaysians can be further enhanced with ease. I hope that the country will continue to nurture the uniquely Malaysian multitalented talent who will continue to bring the country to the world stage and be proud to be a Malaysian.\n\nLOW YAT GROUP\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nLOW SU MING\n\nEstablished in the 1940s, the Low Yat Group played a key role in nation-building through the construction of several government and public institutions. After completing The Federal Hotel in Kuala Lumpur in 1957 in time for Merdeka, the company further developed another eight hotels throughout the country in the late 70s and 80s. My late father, Tan Sri Low Yow Chuan, was Fiabci Property Man of the Year in 1994 and received the Mayor’s Commendable Award for his contribution to the country at the Kuala Lumpur Mayor’s Tourism Awards in 2014.\n\nHaving travelled extensively and experienced different cultures, I take pride in being Malaysian and being able to live in a country blessed with abundance — be it natural resources, amazing cuisine, diversity of rich cultures or, best of all, warm Malaysian hospitality.\n\nWithout doubt, our future lies with our children and the youth, and how they can be nurtured to learn from history and to preserve what’s worthwhile, propelling towards a sustainable, progressive country and society in which we can all feel proud to be Malaysian.\n\nWith our talent pool of young professionals and entrepreneurs, I hope we can speed up the momentum in bringing ‘Made in Malaysia’ products and services to the global stage.\n\nMAH SING GROUP BHD\n\nFOUNDER AND\n\nGROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR TAN SRI LEONG HOY KUM One of Mah Sing’s main goals has always been to support the national agenda of providing Malaysians with quality, comfortable and affordable housing. As a responsible property developer, we strive to work hand in hand with the government in building a better nation together. Mah Sing is a multiracial company with a workforce that is ethnically and demographically diverse. Being a Malaysian allows me to live in a multiracial and multicultural country where I can interact with people of different races and cultures. This makes Malaysians more adaptable and capable of embracing and respecting our differences while living harmoniously under one roof. We are also spoilt for choice when it comes to food, whether it is Malay, Chinese or Indian cuisine. As a Malaysian, I fervently wish for the country’s economic and political stability. The economy is on the path of recovery and I am hopeful that the property development industry will also gradually improve. I hope our nation’s leaders and all of its people can work together to accelerate the economic recovery momentum and resolve the challenges that the country has faced following the pandemic, in order to build a better Malaysia for future generations.\n\nMASTERON SDN BHD\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nCHOY YUIN YI\n\nMasteron Group is a home-grown company that meets public demands within Malaysia and embraces local culture. Our property development division constantly evolves to solve the needs of Malaysian communities — our most recently launched development KR7 Residences addresses the growing local demand for future-proof homes with enhanced security and lockdown-friendly features.\n\nOur hotel division strives to preserve Malaysian heritage. We fitted out the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel Chinatown KL with distinctively Malaysian Peranakan tiles, stained glass and marble table tops, and we evoke Malaysian nostalgia through offerings like Tau Foo Fah cocktails, Peranakan afternoon tea, and walking tours around Chinatown.\n\nOur investment in the car park management business solves the quintessentially Malaysian problem of scarcity of car parks.\n\nBeing a Malaysian means that I am spoilt for choice — by the amazing food, diverse cultures and vastly different natural landscapes. Being a Malaysian also means to own one of the most powerful passports in the world, with visa-free access to 180 countries and counting.\n\nMy hope for Malaysia is to reach its full potential economically and socially, through a government that prioritises the welfare of the people, a private sector that contributes to society and works with the government to nurture and cultivate talent, and individual citizens who can love each other plurally as Malaysians, regardless of race, religion and belief.\n\nMKH BHD\n\nDEPUTY PROPERTY DIRECTOR\n\nDATUK KENNETH CHAN We have colleagues from almost all the states, including from East Malaysia. And since food is often close to our hearts, specially priced lunch sets of both halal and non-halal options had been arranged for the past two years to help our colleagues reduce their cost of living while providing them with hygienic food and helping them avoid crowded places. Being a Malaysian means being endlessly curious about each ethnicity that make up Malaysia, learning about and understanding each other. Knowing how religion may only be one part of each other’s voluntary beliefs, guiding oneself to be good and do good, yet have other interests in life, as well as daily habits, we can have so much in common. As for my hope, I grew up hearing stories of how Malaysians celebrated festivals together as a very closely knit community, but I have never experienced that kind of vibe in any public celebrations. What more with “social policing” due to technological advancements and popularisation of digital social platforms, anyone can feel empowered to judge and report any events that happened in front of their eyes (and their gadget’s lens), one can only imagine greater self-restrain and conservatism moving forward. Will we be artificially pulled further apart? I hope not.\n\nOSK PROPERTY\n\nCEO\n\nONG GHEE BIN\n\nOSK Group has come a long way. Its visionary founder, Tan Sri Ong Leong Huat, executive chairman of OSK Holdings Bhd (OSK) — who started off as a humble boy from Kampung Merbau, Perak — grew and nurtured the company from a small stockbroking house into a full-fledged investment bank over a period of four decades, before OSK Investment Bank merged with RHB Banking Group, in 2012.\n\nSince then, OSK Group has continued to grow and expand sustainably into what we are today — a diversified conglomerate with five core businesses in property development, construction, financial services, industries and hospitality. The story of OSK is truly a Malaysian dream come true — one that is about integrity, hard work and commitment.\n\nBeing a Malaysian means living harmoniously with one another, being inclusive, and drawing strength and unity from our diverse cultures and heritage. Our differences do not define us, but instead bring us closer together. We are Keluarga Malaysia.\n\nMy hope is that every Malaysian will have access to affordable and quality homes, where each of us is able to provide comfortable shelter for our loved ones, and to have a place for all of us to call home.\n\nPARAMOUNT CORP BHD\n\nDEPUTY GROUP CEO\n\nBENJAMIN TEO My late father, chairman Datuk Teo Chiang Quan, saw Paramount as an enabler in nation-building. Based on this principle, we have built schools, universities, homes and offices, guided by our vision of “changing lives and enriching communities” and driven by our core values of TRIBE (Trust. Respect. Integrity. Bravery. Energy). The Paramount culture is also anchored on staying united, taking care of each other, learning to adapt to challenges, and giving back to the community. Over the past two years of the pandemic, Paramount employees kept their jobs and construction workers were also supported when they could not work during the lockdowns. This is how Malaysians help each other, and this is also the Paramount way. My hope is for a united and fair Malaysia, where we are all Malaysians regardless of race or religion. Where good governance is practised, the rule of law is applied equally, and meritocracy is our guiding principle for decisions and policies. For a further democratisation of knowledge and ideas by leveraging technology to accelerate our progress towards becoming a developed nation. Meanwhile, being a Malaysian means nasi lemak for breakfast, char kuey teow for lunch and banana leaf rice for dinner.\n\nSELANGOR DREDGING BHD\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nTEH LIP KIM\n\nSDB was the first Malaysian company to construct and operate the world’s largest tin dredge during the tin mining days decades ago. We have a village named after us, called Kampung Selangor Dredging, which the company contributed to for the benefit of former tin mining workers and their families.\n\nFast forward to the present day, we have carved out a name as a leading boutique property developer with numerous successful projects in Malaysia and across the Causeway in Singapore. By utilising innovative design features that emphasise space, natural lighting and ventilation, our homes are built to complement the equatorial climate and meet buyers’ needs.\n\nWe emphasise on building spaces that promote communal living and our cultural diversity gives us the unique opportunity to embrace and learn from one another. Being Malaysian also means doing our part for nation-building and the less fortunate members of society. At SDB, we have a very active CSR programme to help this community, including special needs people whom we have provided gainful employment.\n\nThe younger generation needs to be empowered, as they are the ones who will be the leaders of tomorrow. As a property developer, we want to help them to realise their dreams of owning their first homes. I hope that there will be a more supportive ecosystem with the right policies and incentives to help first-time homebuyers.\n\nI also hope that society will be more accepting and inclusive, regardless of a person’s social status or background. As we strive to become a developed nation, we must develop a first-world infrastructure and mindset by empowering and rewarding people based on their efforts and achievements.\n\nSIME DARBY PROPERTY BHD\n\nGROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nDATUK AZMIR MERICAN As a leading homebuilder, our townships are uniquely Malaysian in character and composition, where we see homeowners from all walks of life. For 50 years, we have been part of generations of homeowners, and we are excited to continue expanding the Sime Darby Property family across the country for years to come. Being a Malaysian means being able to live in peace and harmony in a beautiful country rich in natural resources and greenery, and experience different cultures as well as enjoy the best cuisines in the world. Being Malaysian also gave me many opportunities for self-development and contribute as an individual, as part of a business and as an industry leader. My hope is for everyone to continue living harmoniously and for Sime Darby Property to play its role as a value multiplier for people, businesses, economies and the planet. I hope to see a more prosperous nation that is committed to fulfilling its potential, meeting its goals of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, and exceeding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pledges to become a more sustainable, resilient and inclusive nation.\n\nSKYWORLD DEVELOPMENT GROUP SDN BHD\n\nCEO\n\nLEE CHEE SENG\n\nSkyWorld, a city-centric property developer, is wholly owned and operated systematically by groups of innovative hardworking Malaysians of different races, religions and gender. I am proud to say that at SkyWorld, we engage local talent and we grow together in a conducive and sustainable environment with plenty of learning and development opportunities for everyone.\n\nBeing a Malaysian means I have the privilege to live in this peaceful, friendly, tolerant and beautiful tropical country with all my brothers and sisters of all faiths. We are so “rojak” that Malaysia has become a melting pot of cultures with delicious cuisine and celebrations almost all year round, in the most harmonious and unpretentious settings. Just look at how we celebrate our festive seasons and holidays! Also, our multilingual abilities give us greater ease to communicate locally and around the globe.\n\nI sincerely hope the Malaysian economy will return to a stronger footing soon. I wish that our government will put priority on building a stable economy and supporting a sustainable business ecosystem for the property development sector primarily, and others as well, which would greatly improve the livelihood of the rakyat in many positive ways.\n\nSUNWAY PROPERTY\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nSARENA CHEAH From our humble history as a small tin-mining company, we have advanced and risen alongside Malaysians for more than two generations. We are very proud to have a nearly 50-year history of nation-building, and helped develop some of Malaysia’s largest urban communities including in Penang, Ipoh, the Klang Valley and Johor. As a Malaysian company with a team with diverse backgrounds, we are committed to improving and enriching the quality of life of society, and contribute towards making our community and nation a better place for future generations. I like to describe us as a “living community” serving another “larger community”, one that creates resilient and thriving ecosystems where everyone can live, learn, work and play in safe, healthy and connected environments. As a conglomerate with 13 business units, our motivation is inherent and deep-rooted — it is about doing the right things the right way. We do well by doing good. Being a Malaysian means embracing and celebrating our cultural diversity, remembering our heritage and the purpose of our forefathers in building this country, and working together harmoniously as one nation. It is my hope to see Malaysians come together, and see the advantages of doing so. And only by doing so can we turn our challenges into opportunities, and transform Malaysia to achieve our fullest potential.\n\nUEM SUNRISE BHD\n\nCEO\n\nSUFIAN ABDULLAH\n\nThe fact that a part of the group is owned by the people of Malaysia means that this plays a big role in our decision-making process and the ventures that we go into. The company runs its operations by what is in Malaysian taxpayers’ best interests. Although the company has global ambitions, we aspire to be a shining example for local companies in our vision, practices, products and governance. We are also very diverse and inclusive in the composition of our workforce, mirroring the melting pot of cultures within Malaysia.\n\nBeing Malaysian is not just about knowing the national anthem, it’s also about embodying patriotism through our actions and work. It means to be able to punch above our weight and to surpass all expectations. It also means that while we are ambitious and have the drive to succeed, we do not always take ourselves too seriously and see the lighter side of life.\n\nI hope for a future where everyone, regardless of class or income level, has equity in a place where they call home. I hope that all Malaysians will eventually have access to housing with comfort, privacy and dignity, and that our country’s prosperity and the communal fruits of labour can truly be shared with everyone.\n\nS P SETIA BHD\n\nPRESIDENT AND CEO\n\nDATUK CHOONG KAI WAI S P Setia was born and bred as a Malaysian company. Our founders are Malaysian and they intentionally cultivated Malaysian values into our culture. We have also been extremely proud and passionate about promoting our culture through elements in our projects such as the design of the Peranakan Straits homes of Setia Eco Templer in Selangor, which is inspired by the vibrant Baba-Nyonya culture, and the iconic Battersea Power Station in London features Malaysia Square, which showcases our country’s rich and riveting heritage. On a deeper level, we believe what makes Malaysia stand strong is our spirit of unity amid diversity, which is why S P Setia actively works to strengthen this through community building. Each of our projects emphasises spaces for family bonding, flexibility for multigenerational living and intentional design that encourages gatherings between friends and neighbours. It’s all about creating moments of togetherness that act as the glue that bonds us together. Beyond our own communities, we endeavour to serve all Malaysians. Being Malaysian means living in the spirit of solidarity, understanding, togetherness and humanity. As a nation of diverse ethnicities and cultures, our shared values tie us as one people. It is not despite our diversity but because of it that understanding, acceptance and appreciation are values we hold dear. On the lighter side, one thing all Malaysians share is our love of food because we live in a food paradise! Nowhere else in the world are people so lucky to have such a spectrum of tastes and smells to delight their senses every day. We are a young nation with its fair share of trials and tribulations but what makes us uniquely poised to overcome them is our abundance of resources, creative ingenuity, rich ethnic diversity and vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem. To sustain our nation’s upward trajectory, we must continue to embrace the fundamental concepts of unity and diversity.\n\nYTL LAND & DEVELOPMENT BHD\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nYEOH PEI TEENG\n\nSince 1955, YTL has participated in the growth of the country, which had evolved from an agricultural and commodity-based economy to an industrialised economy by the 1990s. Starting from building ammunition depots and garrisons under British rule, we constructed public and private facilities like schools, hospitals, residential and commercial buildings, airports and power plants after independence in tandem with government initiatives to support a new Malaysia.\n\nOur company has always strived to be at the forefront of this progress. Leveraging the YTL Group’s core expertise in construction contracting and technological know-how, we continue to play our role in nation-building alongside the government’s efforts to achieve a developed nation status in the new millennium.\n\nI’m proud to be Malaysian because there is no place like home. In a country that can only be described as a melting pot of cultures, we are surrounded by a myriad of food and festivals to celebrate. More importantly, being Malaysian means that virtues like respect and tolerance are steeped within us as we have grown up embracing the uniqueness of our diversity among cross cultures.\n\nI have always admired how our people come together as one nation during sporting events or any adversity. As we continue to reflect on past leaders who soldiered on in their fight for our independence, it is the shared common hopes for this nation among Malaysians that make me proud to be Malaysian.\n\nAs we continue to progress, I hope that the three pillars that sustain nation-building — the government, the rakyat and the economy — will pursue and crystallise their full potential in this digital age to achieve our aspirations of becoming a globalised nation.\n\nIt is also my hope that our country can maintain the peace that we have enjoyed throughout our independent history and continue to safeguard our true cultural and natural heritage. Let us strive to inculcate this legacy of national unity in the minds of future generations.",
    "Mubadala Energy reports new gas discovery offshore Malaysia": "Mubadala Energy reports new gas discovery offshore Malaysia\n\nMubadala Energy, an Abu Dhabi headquartered international energy company, confirmed the discovery of a good quality gas reservoir penetrated by the Cengkih-1 exploration well in Block SK320, off the coast of Sarawak province, offshore Malaysia.\n\nPreliminary analysis shows a significant gas column of more than 110 meters within the pinnacle carbonate reef reservoir.\n\n“This discovery further cements our position in Malaysia as a reliable and trusted operator with deep technical capabilities,” said Mansoor Mohamed Al Hamed, CEO Mubadala Energy. “Gas demand in Southeast Asia continues to grow and we look forward to helping meet those energy needs, in line with our strategy to play an active role in the energy transition.”\n\nThe Cengkih-1 exploration well is located nearby the Pegaga field, one of the fields within the SK320 Block, which recently marked the successful production of commercial gas. The Pegaga field recorded the discovery of 1 trillion Cubic Feet of additional gas initial in place, following the post-drill results which confirmed a larger and better-quality reservoir.\n\nBuilding on Mubadala Energy’s strong position in Malaysia, these results also bolster the company’s strategy to expand its position in natural gas as a key bridge fuel in the energy transition.\n\nMubadala Energy is the Operator of Block SK320, with 55% participating interest in the Production Sharing Contract. The remaining 45% is held by PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd and Sarawak Shell Berhad.

    "Malaysia: UN experts denounce gender-discriminatory citizenship law": "GENEVA (5 September 2022) – UN experts* today denounced a recent court decision in Malaysia that denied women the same rights as men to automatically confer citizenship to their children, saying affected women are less likely to leave abusive relationships and their children risk statelessness. The decision contravenes Malaysia’s obligations under international law and the need to interpret all constitutional provisions concerning citizenship, and its transference, without discrimination based on sex.\n\nIn August 2022, Malaysia's Court of Appeal overturned a landmark 2021 High Court ruling which would have allowed Malaysian mothers married to foreign spouses the right to pass down citizenship to children born abroad. The country remains one of a handful in the world in which women cannot confer citizenship based on their nationality to their partners and children on an equal basis with men.\n\n“We are deeply concerned that Malaysian women are not granted equal citizenship rights, which provide them with the much-needed safeguards and protection for them and for their offspring. The right to citizenship is a cornerstone for the enjoyment of other rights,” the experts said.\n\n“Discriminatory nationality and citizenship laws embody patriarchal values that undermine women’s basic human rights and expose them and their children to harm and further discrimination. Denying Malaysian mothers the ability to pass on citizenship to their children has far-reaching negative impacts on children's rights to education, health care and freedom of movement as well as their social lives and identities,\" the experts said. “When children of Malaysian descent are banned from being part of society based on a discriminatory interpretation of the law, it does not only negatively impact them, but the community and State lose the opportunity to thrive socially, politically and economically.\"\n\nWhile Malaysian men have enjoyed the right to automatically pass down their citizenship to their overseas-born children, many binational families of Malaysian women have unnecessarily suffered as a result of long and arduous application processes under Article 15(2) of the Federal Constitution. These discretionary applications and registration procedures can take years, frequently ending in rejection with no reason given and many remaining unresolved.\n\nOn 9 September 2021, the High Court ruled in the case of Suriani Kempe & Ors vs Government of Malaysia & Ors that the word “father” in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Part II of Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution shall be interpreted harmoniously to include “mother” and that overseas-born children of Malaysian women are citizens by “operation of law.\"\n\nHowever, on 5 August 2022, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government’s appeal, declaring that the relevant provisions of the Constitution specifically refer to the “biological father” and cannot be extended to mean the “mother.\"\n\nThe law has been deemed discriminatory by a number of human rights mechanisms and concerns about denial of women equal rights with respect to the transmission of citizenship was raised in the Human Rights Council. Statelessness and denial of equal access to citizenship increase risks of exploitation, including trafficking in persons, child trafficking and contemporary forms of slavery.\n\n“We regret that the Malaysian Government is responsible for this setback instead of seizing an opportunity to make progress towards the realisation of gender equality. We call on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child by interpreting the law to ensure there is no contradiction between Article 14(1)b and Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution, as amended by Parliament to prohibit discrimination against citizens based on descent, place of birth or gender in any law,” the UN experts said.\n\nUN experts have previously called on Malaysia’s Government to ensure that Malaysian women can enjoy equal rights in relation to nationality and citizenship.\n\nENDS\n\n*The experts:Melissa Upreti (Chair), Dorothy Estrada Tanck (Vice-Chair), Elizabeth Broderick, Ivana Radačić, and Meskerem Geset Techane, Working Group on discrimination against women and girls; Siobhán Mullally, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children; Tomoya Obokata, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Felipe González Morales, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants\n\nThe Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Proceduresof the Human Rights Council.
