    "Working in Austria: Further Facilitation of the Red-White-Red Card": "Workers from non-EU countries will in future also be able to apply for a red-white-red card from within Austria. / Picture: © Vindobona.org\n\nGood news for people without Austrian citizenship who want to work here. The Red-White-Red Card, the Austrian work permit, which is sometimes difficult to apply for, will be easier to obtain in the future.\n\nQualified workers from non-EU countries who want to work in Austria will in future also be able to apply for a Red-White-Red Card from within Austria. This was decided by the National Council on the basis of a bill proposed by the coalition parties in its first session of the new 2022/23 session.\n\nUntil now, the Red-White-Red Card was issued for 24 months at a time and was subject to strict rules. It was issued exclusively for professions in which there was an acute shortage in Austria, where particularly highly qualified workers were needed, key workers, graduates of Austrian universities or start-up founders.\n\nThe application for the card had to be made before entering Austria.\n\nThe new proposals for the work permit provide that persons already residing in Austria can also apply for the Red-White-Red Card. The prerequisite for applying in Austria is that the applicants have entered Austria legally and that their stay in the federal territory is still legal. This includes people with and without a visa equally.\n\nThis means that in future, for example, skilled workers in shortage occupations or regular seasonal migrants will also be able to apply for a longer-term residence title on the spot, as the ÖVP and the Greens explained in the debate.\n\nThe amendment was also approved by the SPÖ and NEOS, although the two opposition parties see a need for further reform of the Red-White-Red Card, for example with regard to apprentices and asylum seekers.\n\nThe facilitated access became urgently necessary due to the acute shortage of skilled workers in Austria. In some sectors, the shortage has reached unprecedented heights and the economy is crying out for workers. Many of the skilled workers needed come from abroad. The Red-White-Red Card, which is difficult to apply for and administratively complex, discouraged both companies and workers from third countries from taking jobs in Austria.\n\nIn July of this year, a first reform of the Red-White-Red Card was passed, which should facilitate access to the Austrian labour market. For example, minimum requirements were lowered, such as the required language skills or the salary. Vindobona reported.\n\nAustrian Parliament",
    "Gareth Bale gives Under-21s surprise pep talk ahead of Austria clash": "The U21s have been based alongside Robert Page’s senior team at their Vale of Glamorgan base this week, with the Football Association of Wales keen to foster greater alignment between the two set-ups.\n\nThe move allowed Bale to meet the next generation of Welsh players and speak about the identity and culture of the senior team.\n\n“I had the opportunity to do a Q & A with Gareth leaning towards this angle of creating a well-cultured and a fantastic, positive and happy environment,” said new U21 boss Matty Jones, who is set to take charge for the first time since succeeding Paul Bodin.\n\n“He made some wonderful statements, which we will use going forward in what our values are.\n\n“Players quite clearly see there’s no ego and we all treat each other as family and brothers.\n\n“As cheesy as it sounds, when we are in the trenches and things are hard we are supporting each other, and there’s been some wonderful examples already of that in the first week.\n\n“I knew Gareth would be a powerful voice and he was. Being based alongside the first-team creates those opportunities, and it was a fantastic reconnection for a lot of players that we haven’t seen for some time.”\n\nRun-out\n\nThe Vienna friendly gives Jones’ side a first run-out ahead of qualifying for the U21 Euros in 2025, which begins next year.\n\n“We are in a honeymoon period, I know that,” said Jones, the former Leeds and Leicester midfielder who won 13 Wales caps before injury cut short his career at the age of 23.\n\n“But it’s been very positive. That was the main objective of this camp, as well as a clear vision of what we look to do in the long term.\n\n“We want to make the transition from Under-21s to the seniors narrow and seamless for players.\n\n“I’ve only had six or seven days to prepare for this game with the players. But I’m confident I’ve got my messages across and that it’s been well received.”",
    "Austria to release additional diesel from strategic reserve": "The government plans to release 60,000 tonnes of diesel from Austria’s strategic energy reserves to shore up market supply amid continued issues at the country’s only refinery: OMV Schwechat.\n\nIn July, the Schwechat refinery, crucial to the region, suffered a serious malfunction followed by uncertainty on when it would be back in action, prompting multiple releases of strategic energy stocks. With activities slated to be restarted in early October, Vienna hopes to shore up supplies one last time.\n\n“In this way, we want to ensure that there is enough fuel available for Austria despite the delay in restarting Schwechat,” Leonore Gewessler, minister of climate protection, said.\n\nFollowing discussions with OMV, the owner of the refinery, and Austria’s fossil oil businesses, the ministry for climate protection will push for the strategic release; a spokesperson told APA on Sunday.\n\nThus far, the Austrian government has released 212,000 tonnes of diesel, 56,000 tonnes of petrol and 45,000 tonnes of semi-finished products.\n\n“We are doing this [release] carefully and deliberately because the oil reserve is there for an absolute emergency. We must not waste it carelessly,” the minister highlighted.\n\nOne last hurdle remains: a two-thirds majority is required to release strategic energy stocks. Thus, the social democrat SPÖ or the far-right FPÖ must back the government’s proposal. Yet, either will likely want to be seen “obstructing” access to diesel.\n\n(Nikolaus J.

    "Austria 1- 3 Croatia: Luka Modric, Marko Livaja & Dejan Lovren score as Zlatko Dalic's side make Nations League Finals": "Croatia seal their place in the UEFA Nations League Finals with a 3-1 win over Austria in Vienna which also consigns the Austrians to relegation from League A.\n\nThe visitors took the lead early when Nikola Vlasic found space in the inside right channel and pulled it back to Luka Modric. Modric made one defender disappear with a magical first touch before slapping his shot past Heinz Linder.\n\nAd\n\nAustria struck back almost immediately. Marcel Sabitzer cut back onto his right foot and curled a low cross towards goal, which Christoph Baumgartner eased into the goal with a stooping header.\n\nUEFA Nations League Sosa, Majer goals propel Croatia to top of group 22/09/2022 AT 18:01\n\nIt was a tight contest from there until Marcelo Brozovic limped off with a knee injury.\n\nAt that point, the home side produced a host of chances and probably should have gone in at half time with a lead.\n\nTwo moments of real quality in the second half changed everything for Croatia.\n\nFirst Ivan Perisic floated a cross towards substitute Marko Livaja who headed back across goal to give the visitors the lead again.\n\nThey doubled their advantage four minutes later when Austria’s defence was completely bamboozled by a short corner, leaving Dejan Lovren free to head home Lovro Majer’s cross.\n\nThe home side had looked dominant until Livaja's goal, after which they fell to pieces and never looked like pulling themselves together again.\n\nTALKING POINT - Would Croatia have been World Cup contenders?\n\nRunners-up in 2018, and winners of a very tough group in the UEFA Nations League this year, it's worth asking just how far this Croatia side could have gone at the 2022 World Cup, had they qualified.\n\nIn the opening period of the match, Croatia played impressive, flowing football but the injury to Brozovic disrupted their rhythm. Even so, the visitors had the players necessary to go up a gear in the second half and pull off a win.\n\nWith France struggling, it seems fair to imagine that Croatia would have been better placed to shine in Qatar.\n\nPLAYER OF THE MATCH - Ivan Perisic (Croatia)\n\nThe visitors needed inspiration from one of their big names, particularly in the absence of Marcelo Brozovic.\n\nIn the first half Perisic was solid, but in the second he really shone. Perisic made a perfect cross for Livaja to score the vital second goal for Croatia and played a part in the third.\n\nHe continued to shine as the half wore on, showing no signs of fatigue despite his age and workload.\n\nBy the end of the match he had completed six dribbles, and had three shots. Both were the highest marks for any Croatian player.\n\nEven in stoppage time, Perisic was surging into the Austrian box to very nearly score a fourth for the visitors. His shot clipped the bar and went over, but it would have been a deserved goal after a game-changing display.\n\nPLAYER RATINGS\n\nAustria: Lindner 7, Danso 8, Schlager 7, Posch 7, Seiwald 6, Arnautovic 7, Alaba 6, Sabitzer 6, Gregoritsch 6, Trimmel 6, Baumgartner 7.

Sabitzer cuts back onto his right foot and fires in a low cross that Baumgartner guides goalwards with a stooping header.\n\n24' BAUMGARTNER SHOULD HAVE SCORED - Lovely interplay from the Austrian attack slips Baumgartner through one on one with the Croatian keeper, but his shot is pushed wide.\n\n35' BAUMGARTNER MISSES OPEN GOAL - Livakovic comes for a high ball and drops it after colliding with Baumgartner. The striker has the chance to whip it into the empty net, but his quick attempt goes over the bar.\n\n39 ' HUGE CHANCE AUSTRIA - Trimmel finds space down the right and pulls it back across the face of goal. Sabitzer arrives but his shot is blocked, as is Seiwald's follow-up shot.\n\n45' ARNAUTOVIC DENIED - A brilliant save by Livakovic parries Arnautovic's curling shot out of danger.\n\n68' GOAL CROATIA - A brilliant run from Mateo Kovacic gets Croatia forward. Possession comes to Perisic and he lifts a cross towards the far post for Marko Livaja to head home.\n\n72' GOAL CROATIA - Dejan Lovren is completely unmarked as he heads home Majer's cross from a short corner.\n\n73' PERISIC OFF THE BAR - Austria are falling apart and Ivan Perisic goes close to making it 4-1.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nAustria produced 18 attempts on the Croatian goal in a match which they probably should have won on the balance of play. Relegation is the price Austria will pay for the wastefulness on display.\n\nCroatia went the first 19 minutes of the second half without even producing a single shot, after a 35-minute spell without a shot in the first half. The visitors produced two worrying periods against Austria in which they were made to look second rate.

After winning his first game, Rangnick has now lost three successive games, and in the last five, he has drawn one and lost four.\n\nHe lined his side up with a back three against Croatia, before switching to a back four during the game. He told Kicker after the game: “We’re still struggling a bit on the wing-back positions.”\n\nRangnick had a tough job, to avoid last place in a group with France, Denmark and Croatia, so there was something inevitable about this eventual relegation.\n\nThe campaign began with a 3-0 win over Croatia in early June, so there was early reason for optimism, but Rangnick’s Austria have slumped since.\n\nIn UEFA Nations League B, Rangnick and Austria may find themselves facing more evenly matched opposition, or they could even land England.\n\nBut it does have a drawback, with Austria now falling into Pot 2 for the Euro 2024 qualifying draw.\n\nAustria will not be at the World Cup later this year, failing to qualify before Rangnick took charge.\n\nCost of dismissing Rangnick\n\nThe Sun reported last week that United’s decision to end Rangnick’s consultancy early cost the club £15 million, a staggering sum to pay in compensation.\n\nThis excessive sum highlights how badly run United have been, hiring a consultant to do a manager’s job, and then getting rid of him before he could do the job he was best at.\n\nPerhaps Erik ten Hag simply didn’t need the help, but a bizarre summer transfer window which saw United chase Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot suggested the club did need some strategic guidance.

    "Patagonia ‘goes purpose’ and Austria reveals new sleeper trains: The sustainability success stories of the week": "Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their ‘Mission Possible’ across the campaign’s five key pillars – energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and leadership.\n\nAcross the UK and the world, leading businesses, cities, states and regions are turning environmental ambitions into action. Here, we round up five positive sustainability stories from this week.\n\nENERGY: Investors secured for major new wind farm in Romania\n\nRomania has set a target for renewables to account for 30.7% of its total power capacity mix by 2030 and may well increase that target ahead of COP27, as it revises its national energy and climate plan. It is already aiming to install a total of 950MW of additional renewable energy capacity by 2024, against a 2019 baseline.\n\nIn a positive step towards these goals, two firms – Low Carbon and Rezolv Energy – have agreed to terms to develop a 450MW onshore wind farm to the east of Bucharest. Low Carbon is taking a 49% stake in the Vis Viva wind farm and Rezolv Energy is taking the remaining 51%.\n\nThe €1bn project will consist of up to 120 turbines and was originally proposed in 2017. It has already gained approval from Romania’s Ministry of Energy.\n\n“Rising energy costs, heightened security concerns, demand to meet climate targets, and stakeholder expectations, are causing a rethink on energy usage – and production,” said Rezolv Energy’s chief executive Jim Campion. “Today, private companies, as well as public utilities, are finding their traditional reliance on fossil fuels far less viable. The Vis Viva project will play a major role in accelerating this transition in Romania, whilst providing long-term, stably priced electricity to commercial and industrial consumers across the region.”\n\nRESOURCES: Allbirds debuts trainers made using plant-based leather\n\nIncreasing awareness of animal rights, human rights and environmental issues arising from the leather supply chain has led to a boom in demand for alternatives in recent years – no doubt also spurred by fast fashion retailers’ desire to produce cheaper footwear and accessories for customers on a budget. The issue with this is that most leather alternatives are pleather – plastic-based materials which are made using fossil fuels and are notoriously hard to recycle.\n\nShowcasing a different approach this week is B-Corp-certified shoe brand Allbirds. On Tuesday (13 September), the brand unveiled a new ‘Plant Pacer’ shoe using no pleather and no leather. The shoe’s upper is made using ‘MIRUM’, a material made using upcycled plant materials and materials from plants classed as renewable due to their abundance. MIRUM was created by NFW and this is the first time it has been commercially used on footwear. NFW claims that the material has a carbon footprint 88% lower than cow leather and 75% lower than the typical pleather.\n\nThe other shoe components are made using certified rubber, Lyocell fabric and sugarcane-based foam.\n\nAllbirds’ co-founder and co-chief executive Tim Brown said: “For way too long, fashion companies have relied on dirty synthetics and unsustainable leather, putting established ways of doing things and costs before the environment. We wanted to put an end to that, which led us to create the Plant Pacer.\n\n“Through the innovative use of natural materials, like Plant Leather and others, we’re going to continue stretching the limits of sustainable footwear.”\n\nMOBILITY: Plans revealed for Europe’s next generation of sleeper trains\n\nImage: Siemens\n\nEarlier this year, the edie team featured a new sleeper train from Stockholm to Hamburg in the weekly success stories roundup. While train trips take longer than plane trips, they’re a lower-carbon alternative and are becoming increasingly popular on climate grounds.\n\nNow, Austria’s national railway, ÖBB, has provided the first look at the interior of its new generation of sleeper trains, at an event in Vienna. The ‘NightJet’ trains will serve routes connecting Vienna, Budapest, Berlin, Milan, Rome and Zurich.\n\nThe first of the 33 new trains will be launched next summer and a full roll-out should be completed by the end of 2025. Each train can carry 254 passengers.\n\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: Industry marks World Green Building Week\n\nFor the past 14 years, the World Green Building Council (WGBC) has hosted a week-long event in Septemberaimed at accelerating the uptake of solutions for a more s ustainable built environment across the globe. More than 70 national Green Building Councils, collectively representing more than 36,000 members, took place in this year’s edition from 12 to 16 September.\n\nOne of the taglines for this year was Building To COP, with the sector aiming to ensure that policymakers preparing for November’s conference in Egypt are aware of the role that buildings and infrastructure must play in the net-zero transition and the wider achievement of sustainable development. Buildings and construction account for almost 40% of global annual emissions and one-third of global energy use.\n\nThe theme for this year was Building for Everyone, highlighting the importance of creating buildings and infrastructure which is accessible and creates thriving local economies and communities – not just projects that are low-carbon.\n\nThe WGBC’s chief executive Christina Gamboa said: “As we build on the successes of Cities, Regions and Built Environment Day at COP26 in 2021 and continue to advocate for climate action towards COP27, leaders must leverage the untapped opportunities of the built environment to decarbonise our economies and provide social economic benefits for those who need it the most.”\n\nBUSINESS LEADERSHIP: Patagonia announces new ownership structure that will enable all profits to go to sustainable causes\n\nIn a bold move which you’ll probably have seen news of in your LinkedIn feed this week, cult outdoor clothing and kit brand Patagonia has announced that none of its profits will be used to add wealth for shareholders of its family owners going forward. Instead, the profits will be re-invested in the business or given to sustainability-related projects working on issues such as nature conservation and restoration.\n\nThe US-based brand’s founder Yvon Chouinard announced on Wednesday (14 September) the creation of two new entities to hold Patagonia’s stock. A new Purpose Trust will hold all of the voting stock. A new Holdfast Collective will hold all of the voting stock, and will funnel profits into social and environmental profits.\n\nPatagonia has been donating at least 1% of its profits to such initiatives since 2002 and has encouraged thousands of other firms to do the same. In going further, Chouinard said the firm was “going purpose” rather than going public, and will, in essence, have the Earth as its only shareholder.\n\nRead the full story on edie here.",
    "How Sigmund Freud fled Nazi Austria, leaving siblings who perished in the Holocaust": "On March 15, 1938, three days after German troops crossed into Austria, approximately 250,000 people greeted Adolf Hitler when he appeared on the balcony of the Hofburg, Vienna’s imperial palace, to announce the political union of Austria with Nazi Germany through annexation.\n\nThe Anschluss launched mass arrests in Vienna and triggered a wave of anti-Semitic violence too. Jews were beaten and killed, their stores looted, and dozens committed suicide. As the German takeover of Austria began, Sigmund Freud was ensconced in his longtime residence and office at Berggasse 19 in Vienna’s 9th district. “Finis Austriae [the end of Austria],” the neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis observed in his diary at the time.\n\n“As a Jew, [Freud] was automatically in danger as the undisputed public face of what most Nazi officials denounced as [his] Jewish pseudoscience,” Andrew Nagorski writes in his new book “Saving Freud,” published on August 23.\n\nNagorski explores Freud’s escape from Nazi Vienna to the safety of London, which began with a train to Paris on June 4, 1938. The journey was by no means easy, however, and took a concerted effort from what Nagorski calls “an ad hoc rescue squad.” This loyal group of Freudian followers included people such as Ernest Jones, William Bullitt, Marie Bonaparte and Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud.\n\n“These were a mix of colorful personalities of divergent backgrounds and nationalities, but they all shared a common interest: a devotion to Freud and his theories,” Nagorski writes in the book’s opening chapter. “They also wanted Freud to overcome his reluctance to leave Vienna.”\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nNagorski has spent more than three decades as an award-winning Newsweek foreign correspondent and editor in Germany, Russia, Poland, Italy and Hong Kong. From 2008 to April 2014, Nagorski was vice president and director of the international affairs think tank EastWest Institute.\n\nThe Scottish-born American journalist’s other books include “1941: The Year Germany Lost the War,” “The Nazi Hunters” and “Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power.”\n\nThe Times of Israel caught up with Nagorski via Zoom from his home in St. Augustine, Florida. The conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times of Israel: Sigmund Freud coined the term “psychoanalysis” in 1896. Can you speak about how the scientific and cultural movement grew in Vienna during the early 20th century?\n\nAndrew Nagorski: It began with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. This was a small group that gathered every Wednesday evening at Freud’s residence in Vienna’s 9th district. Freud wanted to spread those ideas way beyond Vienna and Budapest, where most of the early followers were from.\n\nAlso, this early group of psychoanalysts were mostly Jewish. Freud did not want psychoanalysis to be perceived as a Jewish science. Moreover, he was conscious enough of antisemitism to know that if that happened, it would be to the detriment of psychoanalysis. He was therefore delighted when the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, who was a gentile, expressed a fervent interest to become a follower of [psychoanalysis]. But they later had a falling out.\n\nIn the book you explore how the Nazis stole some of Freud’s ideas, which seems rather odd given the fact that they publicly burned his books in Berlin in 1933.\n\nIndeed, the Nazis publicly denounced Freud’s work and psychoanalysis. But in 1936, Matthias Göring — the cousin of Hitler’s righthand man, Hermann Göring — launched the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy in Berlin. This was based on the premise that the Nazis would create their own form of psychotherapy. The idea was that it would be purged from Jewish ideas and Jewish analysts. But in doing this, the Nazis were clearly building upon fundamental ideas that had been pioneered by Freud and his followers, even though they claimed it had nothing to do with Freud or the early versions of psychoanalysis.\n\nCan you talk about Freud’s relationship with Zionism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was complicated. He was a board member of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Freud was not opposed to the notion of a Jewish state. He talked about being sympathetic to the Zionist impulse. But he also spoke about what he saw as the practical problems of a homeland for the Jews in what was then Mandatory Palestine.\n\nThis was expressed in a very famous letter which was buried for a long time in Israel.\n\nIn that letter, Freud said he did not see how Muslims and Christians would tolerate Jewish control of the Holy Land if the Zionist project were realized. He argued that it would be better to have a Jewish homeland somewhere else. But he also understood that, for historical and cultural reasons, which were fundamental to the idea of a Jewish state, this would never be acceptable to Jews. Freud therefore had contradictory impulses on this topic. He identified as a cultural Jew and was proud of his Jewish heritage. But he was an atheist with no connection to religious belief himself, even though he was fascinated by religion as a cultural subject.\n\nIn the book you discuss Freud’s sex life, although there isn’t a great deal of gossip or scandal to speak about. What does this tell us about Freud’s work and biographical story?\n\nFreud once said, “I’m all for greater sexual freedom, but I don’t make use of that sexual freedom myself.” He was a straitlaced guy. He married Martha, his wife, [at age 30] and he was a dedicated family man from this point on. Freud could talk with his patients, most of whom were very sexually active, about everything without inhibitions and judgment. But in his own life, he was very [sexually] cautious and conservative. I would even go so far as to say that he was awkward and shy around women.\n\nErnest Jones, Freud’s official biographer, is a key figure in your book. What role did Jones play in promoting Freud’s work in the Anglophile world?\n\nErnest Jones was a Welsh doctor who began reading Freud’s work in German as a young man. Jones was then introduced to Freud via Carl Jung. Jones brought Freud’s work into the English-speaking world. Previously, it was available only in German. Later, Jones became president of the International Psychoanalytical Society. Jones and Freud developed a real rapport. Jones really helped to make Freud a global figure. His three-volume biography on Freud is still the first place one should look when investigating Freud’s life.\n\nYou also explore the relationship between Anna Freud and her father. It was quite intense!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnna was the youngest of the Freuds’ six children. Freud became her analyst. He advised against this later. Then as Freud got older, Anna took care of his daily needs, in his apartment in Berggasse 19 in Vienna, and then later at Freud’s house in Hampstead, London, where he died in September 1939. Anna also played an important role in the rescue operation for the Freud family. She negotiated with the Nazis, which helped overcome the bureaucratic obstacles standing in the way of them emigrating to England.\n\nUnder what conditions did Freud eventually escape Nazi Vienna? Was it simply a question of money? Or did his social and professional connections help with the evacuation?\n\nMoney, of course, came into the equation. But it wasn’t just a question of money. When the Anschluss happened, the Nazis appointed so-called trustees for prominent Jewish families [in Austria] — particularly rich Jewish families. Freud was part of this wealthy group, although he was by no means the richest. The Nazis created what they called a flight tax. This saw them assess the individual wealth of some of Vienna’s richest Jews. In Freud’s case, they calculated that he had a net worth [in assets] of about $50,000. This included his apartment and the International Psychoanalytic Publishing House. In today’s money that amounts to about a million dollars. The Nazis then ordered Freud to pay roughly 25 percent of this sum.\n\nDid Freud pay the Nazis and where did he get the money?\n\nA wealthy woman, Marie Bonaparte, who was the wife of Prince George of Greece and Denmark, and also the great-grandniece of Napoleon. She provided most of it in cash.\n\nIn 1938 there was not a lot of countries eager to accept Jewish refugees from the Third Reich. How did Freud manage to be accepted into England?\n\nErnest Jones played an important role. He pulled every string he could in London to make sure the Freuds got entry permits into England. Jones was very resourceful and had a lot of connections in high places. But until the Freuds got on the train in Vienna, on June 4, 1938, bound for Paris, it wasn’t clear if he and his family were going to get out of the country safely. Four of Freud’s sisters who remained behind later perished in the death camps during the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Freud in close contact with his four sisters?\n\nYes. In fact, he left them a good deal of money in the hope that they could survive. Freud was very worried about his sisters left in Austria. And when he got out, he asked Marie Bonaparte, who was working to get other Jews out of Austria and Germany, whether she could try again to get his sisters out. But it was not possible.\n\nFreud lived much of his life under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed in 1918. Did his memories of its liberal and tolerant political culture influence the misguided belief he held, through the 1930s, that Austria would not be taken over by the Nazis?\n\nIt definitely played a part. Freud always held this hope that the Austrian politicians would be able to keep the Nazis and Hitler at bay. He felt the antisemitism in Vienna, which he often complained about, would remain, albeit on a modest scale. But, of course, after the Anschluss that proved to be a major miscalculation. It’s important to remember too, that Freud had no desire to disrupt his life and to become an émigré, especially as he was coming towards the end of his life.\n\nThe Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig appears several times in this book. You seem to have a keen interest in his work.\n\nI got the idea for writing this book when I was reading Stefan Zweig’s autobiography, “The World of Yesterday.” Zweig left Vienna in 1934 and died in Petrópolis, Brazil, in February 1942.\n\nZweig felt it was getting way too dangerous for [Jews] in the Austrian capital. Freud, meanwhile, stayed behind. Zweig later reconnected with Freud in London in 1938. Reading Zweig’s biographical story got me thinking about a question that really drove me to write this book: Why were so many Jews leaving Vienna at this time, and why was Freud so determined to stay?\n\nWere Zweig and Freud close friends?\n\nNo. But Zweig and Freud had a tremendous amount of respect for one another. They got to know each other fairly well in Vienna, and again in London. Freud appreciated Zweig as a writer, and Zweig appreciated Freud as the thinker of his age. Freud, after all, came from relative obscurity in his younger days to become probably one of the most celebrated intellectuals of the [early 20th] century.\n\nFreud achieved celebrity status when he arrived in London in 1938. By that stage he was already a world-famous intellectual. Why were the British so in awe of him?\n\nIn Austria, Freud developed this fame gradually. He was a well-known figure in the cafes and streets of Vienna. But in London, he was treated as a huge celebrity and his arrival was seen as a major event which got huge coverage in the British press. A lot of Brits were very proud that he had chosen to end up there. And he was bombarded with letters and invitations by numerous universities and cultural institutions. Many other famous figures in Britain at the time came to see Freud at his home in North London, including H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf and Salvador Dali.\n\nWhile researching this book did you consider what might have happened to the Freud family had they stayed in Vienna after 1938?\n\nYes, it’s something I have thought about. Freud probably still would have died before the Holocaust began, as his life ended in London in September 1939. But I would guess that had he in stayed in Vienna after 1938, he and his family would have been increasingly terrorized by the Nazis and that his wife, Martha, and daughter, Anna, would have been killed in the Holocaust.",
    "Rast got \"punished\" for conservative strategy in Austria DTM race": "After a strong second-place result in the opening race of the weekend behind Red Bull’s Nick Cassidy, Rast was again on course to finish as the highest-placed championship contender in Sunday’s second contest as he ran fifth after his pitstop.\n\nBut the track started to dry out rapidly in the closing stages of the race, putting the wet-shod Abt Audi of Rast on the back foot.\n\nAs drivers who had gambled on slick tyres started charging through the field, Rast had no pace to hold his position and slipped to 11th in less than a handful of laps.\n\nReigning champion Maximilian Gotz was later handed a 30-second time penalty for a pitstop infringement, promoting Rast up a place in the final order, but the German driver was left with only a solitary point to show for his efforts.\n\nWith championship leader Sheldon van der Linde drawing a blank on a torrid weekend for BMW, the race is seen as a lost opportunity for Rast to bridge the gap to the South African and boost his chances of a fourth DTM title with Audi.\n\nSpeaking after the race, Rast explained that he had to take the championship picture into account while choosing his strategy, and the rain tyres had appeared to be the safe bet when he stopped on lap 21 of 35.\n\n\"When you fight for the championship, you always try to keep an eye on the opponents and not take exorbitant risks. You do what the competition is doing,\" the 35-year-old told Autosport's sister title Motorsport-Total.com.\n\n“Things looked good for a long time and we were fifth.\n\n\"Only then was the track suddenly so dry that the cars with slicks came from behind and then really overtook me in the last corner, which knocked me out of the points [until Gotz’s penalty].\n\n“Today we played it safe and unfortunately we were punished for it in the end.”\n\nThe second race at the Red Bull Ring saw a wide range of strategies as the action began in wet conditions before the track started drying out, with a late drizzle on the final lap complicating matters even further.\n\nHRT driver Luca Stolz finished second after making an early pitstop on lap 7 for wets to run in clear air, while polesitter Maro Engel switched to slicks late on to snatch the final spot on the podium.\n\nRast, however, felt both strategies had their own risks and the best possible option for him was to extend his first stint and then take on a fresh set of wet tyres.\n\n\"If you had stopped early, there was a risk that it would really dry out and then you would have had to switch to slicks again,” he explained.\n\n“We didn't want to take that risk. That's why we drove a little longer and of course observed all the competition and what the others were doing. Then we drove on and were virtually overtaken by many who stopped early.\n\n\"We might have done two or three laps longer and then switch to slicks. But it was so difficult because there was no dry track before the pit stop window [was closed].\"\n\nLucas Auer, Mercedes-AMG Team WINWARD Mercedes-AMG GT3 Photo by: Alexander Trienitz\n\nAuer wouldn’t have “dared” to switch to slicks\n\nWinward Mercedes driver Lucas Auer was one of the first drivers to gamble on slick tyres after coming into the pits just two laps after Rast’s stop, having been told by his race engineer over team radio that \"we'll only score points with slicks today.”\n\nAlthough Auer fell as low as 21st after struggling on a track that was still wet at most places, the complexion of his race soon took a turn for the better and he climbed up to sixth at the finish.\n\nThe eight points he scored elevated him to second in the championship, one point clear of Rast and only 11 adrift of Schubert BMW’s van der Linde ahead of the title decider at Hockenheim.\n\nAuer said he wouldn’t have switched to slick tyres if he was making the call, but it soon became clear to him that the team had put him on the right strategy.\n\n\"That was the perfect decision,” the Austrian told Motorsport-Total.com. \"I wouldn't have dared to do that. But that was the only chance we had to pull something off today.\n\n\"I almost flew off at least three times on the first lap after the pit stop. But when the tyres then reached operating temperature, I knew: we did the right thing.\n\n\"Fourth place on Saturday was like a victory for us with the speed we had. Only Sunday in the rain I didn't deliver in qualifying. That was shit, I have to say. Also from me - just not enough.\n\n“That's why I'm happy with the race now.\"\n\nThe top five drivers are separated by just 16 points going into Hockenheim, with van der Linde sitting at the top on 130 points, Auer second on 119, Rast third on 118, Thomas Preining fourth with 116 and Mirko Bortolotti fifth with 114 points on board.",
    "Haas: Schumacher’s attitude in Austria ‘wasn’t great’": "Haas’ trackside engineering director Ayao Komatsu has opened up on a frustrating period with Mick Schumacher earlier this year in Austria.\n\nDuring the sprint race at the Red Bull Ring, Schumacher ran behind team-mate Kevin Magnussen and requested a position swap, feeling he had more pace.\n\nHowever, the team order was not issued and Schumacher ended up dropping behind rivals before the chequered flag, failing to score points.\n\nAlthough he would go on to take his best career result during Sunday’s grand prix, Komatsu revealed that Haas wasn’t pleased with the 2020 Formula 2 champion’s attitude at the event.\n\n“Mick was behind Kevin and that frustrated him,” Komatsu told Motorsport-Total.com. “His focus in the sprint race wasn’t the right one.\n\n“We talked about that afterwards. We talked before the sprint race about how we would do it as a team. But what he did after that wasn’t great.\n\n“And what he said after that wasn’t great either.”\n\nSchumacher’s future beyond the 2022 campaign is unknown, however it is heavily rumoured that he will depart Haas at the end of the year.\n\nThe German was paired with Kevin Magnussen for his second year in F1, having been placed alongside Nikita Mazepin in 2021.\n\nMagnussen boasts much more experience than Schumacher, with Komatsu accusing Schumacher of focusing too much on his team-mate.\n\n“Sometimes Mick focuses too much on his team-mate,” he said. “Then I say to him ‘look, Kevin really likes to help you and he tells you things he would never have told Romain [Grosjean] before’.\n\n“Then Mick thinks and realises the most important thing for the team is to get up in the Constructors’ Championship.\n\n“I explain it to him: ‘Mick, come on, you’re doing well, focus on your own performance and not on this thing’. And then it’s fine again.\n\n“It’s very good for Mick to have an established team-mate like Kevin. We didn’t know beforehand how good he is.\n\n“Then Kevin came along and that gave us a reference. We think that with our 2021 car we would have been safe against Williams – we could have fought if we’d had Kevin back then. Mick would have benefited from that in his development.”",

    "Bet-at-home warns of increased liquidity risk after Austria shutdown": "Bet-at-home has warned of an increased risk that it may not have sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations when they are due, after a financial year heavily impacted by its exit from Austria.\n\nThe warning comes in the context of a significant winding down of the company’s activities in other regions, most notably Austria.\n\nIn October 2021, the business lost a legal battle against a consortium of players in Austria who sought compensation from unlicensed operators. Following this, Bet-at-home announced it would be exiting the market, as well as winding down the Maltese company set up to target it.\n\nIn July, Bet-at-home announced that it had “surrendered” its GB licence, and would be permanently withdrawing from the market – this occurred in the wake of the operator’s licence suspension by the Gambling Commission for suspected anti-money laundering and social responsibility failings.\n\nAs a result of these exits, Bet-at-home has categorised its liquidity risk level as “medium”, and higher than last year, as the reduction in operations create uncertainty in the company’s cash flow, assets and liabilities.\n\nBet-at-home stated that even small negative shocks may leave the business with a shortfall:\n\n“If the bet-at-home.com AG Group is unable to provide corresponding collateral in the form of bank guarantees, existing cash and cash equivalents would have to be deposited as security,” the report states.\n\n“The remaining freely available liquidity could prove to be critical even in the event of minor negative deviations from the existing planning if, in addition, a significant reduction in liquidity were to occur due to payments to Bet-at-home.com Entertainment Ltd. and to the Maltese tax authorities.\n\nIn the context of the operator’s reorientation of strategy, Bet-at-home abandoned its in-house platform, and will be using the EveryMatrix technology stack going forward, in an effort to cut costs.\n\nHowever, there was also good news for the operator. The business revealed it was “assured” in July by the State Administration Office of Saxony-Anhalt that it will be granted an online casino licence.\n\nThe business said it expects the licence to be issued in the second half of 2022, following its application which it entered following the 2021 passage of the German state treaty on gambling.",

    "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine": "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nWhile the invasion of Ukraine led to a wave of support for NATO membership in several countries, Austrians still believe their country should remain neutral.\n\nA statue of Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, stands in front of the Austrian parliament in Vienna. To abandon neutrality would require a two-thirds majority in the National Council – an unlikely development under the current circumstances. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell The majority of Austrians do not want their country to join NATO\n\nThey expect Austria to cooperate with other European countries on defense\n\nPolitical voices calling for an end to neutrality are still a minority\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in a dramatic change of opinion in Nordic countries on the question of neutrality. For years, polls in Finland had shown that between 22 and 25 percent of respondents supported joining NATO, even after the annexation of Crimea and the secessionist uprisings staged by the Kremlin in eastern Ukraine. At the end of February 2022, however, 50 percent of the population was in favor. By June, it was 75 percent.\n\nIn Sweden, the shift was not as drastic, but nevertheless clear. In June, 60 percent were in favor of NATO accession. There, too, the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 had had little impact on public opinion. In 2017, only 32 percent of respondents wanted to abandon neutrality.\n\nEven in Switzerland, which has been officially neutral since 1815, 52 percent of respondents in a survey conducted in May and June were in favor of closer collaboration with NATO. There is a growing recognition that small countries can only defend themselves by partnering with other states – which requires, among other things, coordinating weapons systems. For the first time in two decades, the proportion of Swiss citizens supporting neutrality declined, falling to 89 percent from 96 percent in January.\n\nGrowing support\n\nMeanwhile, support for neutrality in Austria remains high and continues to rise. Ninety-one percent of those surveyed said neutrality is important to them, with 70 percent calling it “very important” and 21 percent “rather important.” In 2019, only 81 percent had said neutrality mattered to them. Asked in the most recent polls about the prospect of joining NATO, almost two-thirds of Austrians (64 percent) opposed it. Only 16 percent were in favor.\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state.\n\nThis attitude toward neutrality reflects the lack of military readiness in the population. A 2014 survey conducted in 64 countries in 2014 found that 25 percent of Western Europeans would be willing to fight for their country. The regional differences were considerable, especially those between neutral countries. In Finland, 74 percent declared themselves willing to take up arms to defend their country, in Sweden 55 percent and in Switzerland 39 percent. In Austria, the figure was only 21 percent.\n\nSurrounded by five NATO members, Austrians feel largely protected despite the war in Ukraine. The shock caused by the invasion of neighboring Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops in August 1968 has been mostly forgotten. At that time, the Iron Curtain separated Austria from neighboring countries to the north, east and south. But since the country was integrated into the European Union in 1995, and since Austrian soldiers have joined military operations in crisis areas, it has been taken for granted that Austria can rely on external help in the event of an attack. Accession to the EU alone was a clear sign of the transition to a broader interpretation of neutrality.\n\nAustrian-style neutrality\n\nIn a guest commentary for the newspaper Die Presse, top Austrian diplomat Thomas Mayr-Harting recalled that the Austrians “were always for neutrality, but not necessarily for defense on their own. Even in the years of the Cold War – and in the best days of Austrian ‘space defense’ – the (unspoken) basic assumption was always that we must be able to defend ourselves in the event of an attack from the outside until ‘others’ come to our aid.”\n\nBut if Austria relies on defense within the framework of Western states, Mr. Mayr-Harting argues, the Federal Armed Forces must be interoperable and trained according to NATO standards. The NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP), in which Austria has been participating since 1995, provides a good basis for such cooperation.\n\nEmbedded in the structures of the EU and relying on the EU assistance clause, which calls for solidarity between the member states, 55 percent of Austrians surveyed recently assessed their country’s situation as “safe” or “rather safe,” while only 20 percent consider Europe, on the whole, to be safe. Nevertheless, Austrians consider the Federal Armed Forces to be “very” or “rather important,” not least because they have proven themselves in disaster operations. In the survey, conducted shortly after the beginning of the war, 50 percent of respondents supported increasing the defense budget (which amounted to 0.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2021) and equipping the Federal Armed Forces with heavy weapons to enable it to repel attacks.\n\nThe majority of Austrians believe their country is not at risk. The 1968 invasion of neighboring then-Czechoslovakia has been mostly forgotten. © Getty Images\n\nRoots of neutrality\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state. Defense expert Franz-Stefan Gady estimates that it would take 10 to 20 years to build an operational army in Austria that could compete with that of Switzerland. Critics of neutrality accuse Austria of free riding on NATO in the field of security policy.\n\nAustrian neutrality began with the Moscow Memorandum of April 1955. To achieve the “closest conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty,” the Austrian delegation in Moscow conceded that Austria would not join any military alliances and would not allow military bases on its territory. The Austrian government issued a statement that establishes “permanent neutrality based on the Swiss model.” The Soviet Union then agreed to sign the Austrian State Treaty and consented to the withdrawal of all occupying forces.\n\nOn 26 October 1955, the Austrian National Council (Parliament) passed the Neutrality Act. But neutrality is not included in the State Treaty, and its interpretation is therefore not subject to the former occupying powers. It is not guaranteed by any international treaty.\n\nOn the other hand, the obligation to “maintain and defend perpetual neutrality” is enshrined in the constitution. It could only be repealed with a two-thirds majority in the National Council. None of the parties represented in parliament is currently calling for the abandonment of neutrality.\n\nBrussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, things were different. At that time, the black-blue coalition government led by Wolfgang Schussel of the Christian-democratic Austrian People’s Party (OVP) initiated a debate on joining NATO. The initiative failed because the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPO) rejected the motion, and an amendment or deletion of the neutrality law required their consent. When Social Democrat Alfred Gusenbauer succeeded Mr. Schussel in 2006, the topic was off the table. Only the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) insisted on joining NATO until the matter gradually faded away after significant intraparty changes. Under chairman Herbert Kickl, the FPO today has adopted a neutral, but essentially Russia-friendly, position toward the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the Russian invasion, there were isolated voices in the OVP calling for accession to NATO. However, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (OVP) stated that “Austria was neutral, Austria is neutral, Austria will also remain neutral.”\n\nForeign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (OVP) also declared that in a world “in which economic, military and intellectual conflicts have become more open, neutrality could once again be a value.”\n\nCalls for change\n\nThe SPO believes that a neutral Austria in a mediating role contributes more to peace than if it were a member of a military pact. Only the leftist liberal NEOS raises doubts whether neutrality is still the best solution for Austria.\n\nIn an “open letter to the Federal President, the Federal Government, the National Council and the people of Austria,” more than 50 Austrian security experts, diplomats, entrepreneurs, politicians and columnists called for the adoption of a new security doctrine in May. Neutrality has never been checked for its current expediency but has been “elevated to a supposedly inviolable myth,” the signatories argue. Among them are Brigadier General of the Austrian Armed Forces Walter Feichtinger and former FPO Defense Minister Friedhelm Frischenschlager, as well as far-left columnists Robert Misik and Julya Rabinowich.\n\nAustria, the letter says, has neglected increasing threats for too long. Today, the country is “unprepared, and in the most serious security policy crisis in Europe since 1945.” The signatories have different opinions on neutrality or NATO accession, but are all “convinced that the status quo of our security policy is not only untenable, but dangerous for our country.”\n\nNATO has not commented on the debate in Austria, which has not yet really begun. Brussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community. The contribution that NATO expects from the small country can be fulfilled even without accession.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that one or more parties represented in the Austrian parliament will table a motion to repeal the Neutrality Act in this or the next legislative period. This would not be the case even if the Russian war against Ukraine were to escalate.",
    "Austria will withdraw its Soldiers from EUFOR if the UN does not extend the Mandate": "Austrian Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner said that this country will withdraw its soldiers from the EUFOR “Althea” military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina if the UN Security Council does not extend its mandate, writes Austrian Der Standard.\n\nAs stated in Der Standard, an international conflict with Russia could have dramatic consequences for Austria and its army. They point out that there is a risk of ending Austria’s most important foreign mission, which is participation in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDer Standard explains that it is a UN mission and that Austria has been involved since 2004 despite its officially neutral status. Also, Austria has the largest contingent of soldiers, and has commanded the mission since 2009. The current commander-in-chief is Austrian Major General Anton Wessely.\n\nThey explain that, until now, the routine extension of the mandate, which happened at the beginning of November, was called into question because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs Der Standard has learned, the Austrian Ministry of Defense has already planned to abandon the Althea mission in case Russia blocks the extension of the mission in the Security Council. This summer, Minister Tanner’s office did a report on options in which all scenarios were presented.\n\nOptions include desertion, and military sources have confirmed that this option is theoretically and practically possible. Finally, the decision would be made by the Austrian government, as was the case with the withdrawal of peacekeeping troops from the Golan in 2013.\n\nThe government still hopes that the Kremlin will not block the extension of the mandate, but some suspect that Putin wants to create new unrest and divisions in the EU, which could easily be achieved by destabilizing the Balkans. Austrian media report that Putin could act on the invitation of the member of the Presidency, Milorad Dodik.\n\nAnother position, they state, is that Putin will not go that far because the military operation could continue even without a UN mandate, for example if the BiH Presidency requests NATO’s help despite the opposition of Milorad Dodik.\n\nIn the case that NATO is positioned without the consent of the UN Security Council, militarily neutral Austria would have a problem. Without the UN mandate, participation in the mission would be unthinkable, and the withdrawal of soldiers would be a realistic option, according to the Austrian Ministry of Defense, Der Standard learns.",
    "Archbishop Dal Toso: \"The Pontifical Mission Societies are a universal family\"": "EUROPE/AUSTRIA - Archbishop Dal Toso: \"The Pontifical Mission Societies are a universal family\"\n\nVienna (Agenzia Fides) - As a \"special network\" in the Catholic Church, characterized on the one hand by the \"closeness to the Pope\" as one of his aid organizations and on the other hand by the connection to the local Churches, which it accompanies on their missionary path: are the words expressed by Archbishop Giampietro Dal Toso, President of the Pontifical Mission Societies during the visit to Missio Austria, the direction of the Austrian Pontifical Mission Societies (PMS).\n\nThe visit, which lasted two days in the heart of Vienna, is the first to be carried out with three of the four General Secretaries of the PMS, Father Tadeusz Nowak of the Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith, Father Guy Bognon of the Pontifical Society of St. Peter the Apostle and Sister Roberta Tremarelli of the Pontifical Society of the Holy Childhood, who deepened the cooperation with Missio Austria and discussed programs and activities.\n\nThe President of the Pontifical Mission Societies expressed his gratitude for the work of Missio Austria: \"My visit is intended to express appreciation for the many initiatives that are organized in the National Direction of Missio Austria\".\n\nThe Pontifical Mission Societies are a \"unique worldwide family\" for Archbishop Dal Toso. The liveliness of the Church in many parts of the world arouses courage: \"The number of Catholics in Africa and Asia is increasing. This is a fact. Therefore, the dynamic and this spirit from the countries of the Global South can encourage us here in Europe and give us new gratitude for the faith\". The initiatives of Missio Austria are a \"key for the future of the church\", said the President of the Pontifical Mission Societies. The PMS President underlines: \"The education of priests is a crucial point, because we notice how essential and important the priests are for the people in the countries of the Global South\".

    "Information pack for British nationals arrested or detained in Austria": "Chapter 1: Key points\n\nOverview\n\nIf you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you. However, we cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: Support for British nationals abroad.\n\nThis information pack aims to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Austria and who can help. Consular staff can provide a printed copy to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.\n\nIf you are arrested or detained in another country:\n\nthe authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British embassy, high commission or consulate (and must do so if you want them to)\n\nif they do not ask, you can make the request yourself. You should do this if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance\n\nfriends or family can also contact the local British embassy, high commission or consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000\n\nIn some countries, the authorities might notify the British embassy, high commission or consulate even if you do not want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.\n\nWho we are\n\nConsular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office in the UK, and in British embassies, high commissions and consulates overseas.\n\nBritish Embassy Vienna\n\nConsular Section\n\nJauresgasse 10\n\n1030 Vienna\n\nAustria\n\nTelephone: +43 (0) 1716 13 0 (select Consular Services)\n\nFax: +43 (0) 1716 13 5900\n\nContact us online\n\nYou can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.\n\nWhat we can do\n\nThe FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. When we are notified of your arrest or detention, we will aim to contact you as soon as possible, so that we can assess how we can help you. We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions. Our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.\n\nIn Austria, notification by the authorities to the British embassy normally takes place within the first few days following a person’s arrest.\n\nOnce we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.\n\nWe can also:\n\nprovide general information about the country, detention conditions and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)\n\nprovide a list of local English-speaking lawyers and a list of local interpreters\n\nprovide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services\n\nkeep in regular contact with you, by telephone and/or letter, and visits from a consular officer, depending on local conditions and your personal circumstances\n\ntell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication which you may need\n\nput you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called Prisoners Abroad\n\nin some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards\n\nhelp to transfer money to you from your friends or family\n\nin some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK\n\nWhat we cannot do\n\nintervene to enable your release from prison or detention\n\nhelp you get special treatment because you are British\n\noffer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime\n\npay for any costs because you have been arrested\n\nforward you packages sent by friends or family\n\nprevent authorities from deporting you after release\n\nFirst steps\n\nInforming family members\n\nIf you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and provide them with information about how to contact you. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your wellbeing.\n\nIf you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider what the impact of not doing so might be. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.\n\nInforming the UK police\n\nIf you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. Information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances when information about you may need to be shared with authorities in Austria.\n\nLegal assistance: lawyers\n\nWe cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime. However, we can provide information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can also give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers.\n\nYou should consider the benefits of local legal representation and discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. We cannot pay your legal or interpretation costs in any circumstance.\n\nConsular assistance: fair treatment\n\nWe cannot get you out of prison or detention, or get you special treatment because you are British. If you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards, we will consider whether to approach the local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.\n\nOther organisations that can provide assistance\n\nWe can put you, or your family, in touch with Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity that supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.\n\nChapter 2: Detention conditions in Austria\n\nVisits: friends and family\n\nWho can visit and how to arrange visits\n\nVisiting rules differ from prison to prison (Justizanstalt) in Austria. Some prisons only allow visits on certain days of the week. Prior to visiting, you should find out whether there are any specific rules such as the number of visitors or whether an interpreter is needed etc. Your lawyer will be able to assist with this, or your family can contact the prison directly.\n\nThe number of visits allowed also varies from prison to prison and depends on the age of the prisoner, as well as whether you are on remand or have been sentenced. The length and frequency of visits will differ from prison to prison: you should ask the prison directly or alternatively your family should enquire with your lawyer.\n\nGenerally, visitors must identify themselves when they arrive at the prison by showing a valid passport. This is held by the prison until the end of the visit. Please note that driving licences are NOT an official identification document. You should arrive at the prison at least 30 minutes before your appointment.\n\nRemand Prisoners: All visitors visiting remand prisoners must obtain a visiting permit (Besuchserlaubnis) from the judge or prosecutor, who can refuse visits if they think that your case might be jeopardised. Visits to remand prisoners are usually allowed twice a week for 30 minutes per visit. If family or friends want to visit, they should contact your lawyer before travelling to Austria and ask them to request the visit from the judge in Austria. Family members will not be permitted entry to the prison without a visiting permit.\n\nSentenced Prisoners: Sentenced prisoners can be visited according to the rules in place within each individual prison. After sentencing you no longer require court permission to visit and will be able to arrange a visit directly with the prison authorities. Visits to sentenced prisoners are usually allowed once a week for 30 minutes.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to make arrangements for longer visits on compassionate grounds, for example, the distance visitors from the UK have to travel. This decision is, however, down to the facility in which you are being detained. Please contact your prison social worker for more information. You can also find further information about each prison in Austria.\n\nWhat to expect when you visit\n\nA prison guard (Wärter) might be present during the visit to ensure you are not discussing the case. If the conversation is not held in German, the judge may insist that an interpreter (Dolmetscher) is present to interpret the conversation for the prison guard. You may need to organise and pay for this. Your lawyer is best placed to find out exactly what is required and help you to make arrangements. Should you need to organise an interpreter yourself, you can find one through the Austrian Association of Interpreters and Translators and the list of local translators and interpreters. Most interpreters will require notice and should be booked as early as possible. Their services might be expensive.\n\nWhat you can take on your visit\n\nThis varies from prison to prison, but normally packages of no more than about 4-5 kg containing small amounts of confectionary, underwear, clothing and shoes. Please check with the prison authorities first. Your social worker will be able to help should you have any specific questions about what is allowed.\n\nVisits – Consular staff\n\nWe can visit you in prison if there is an important reason to do so, for example if you have serious concerns about your health or welfare. It is often easier to first arrange a phone call with us to discuss concerns and next steps.\n\nIt is also important that you write to us to establish contact. Our address is at the top right hand corner of the original letter we sent you, informing you of your consular caseworker. Please be aware that we are unable to discuss or comment on anything concerning the trial or other legal matters. We are there for your health and welfare. We normally visit once after sentencing, if there is an important reason to do so. We can visit once before sentencing if there is an urgent reason for this.\n\nYou can write to us at any time on matters of concern, but if it is urgent it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us to arrange a telephone call.\n\nEmergency trips outside of prison\n\nCertain judicial or personal matters may be so important that they cannot be postponed. If an urgent situation arises in Austria, which requires your presence outside the prison, for example a funeral or a critical illness concerning your next-of-kin, it may be possible to make an application to temporarily leave the detention facility at your own expense, accompanied by guards, if this is approved by the court.\n\nAsk the prison or your lawyer how to submit an application for this exceptional leave. The Embassy cannot influence the final court decision.\n\nPolice custody and initial arrival at prison\n\nArriving at the police station: your basic rights\n\nWhen the arrest takes place, you should be informed of your rights in a language you understand. You have the right to:\n\nremain silent\n\nrefuse to cooperate in the proceedings\n\nappoint a defence lawyer of your choice or request the help of a duty defence lawyer\n\nrequest the assistance of an interpreter\n\ninform your next-of-kin (for minors or disabled persons, the legal representative must be informed)\n\ninform the British embassy\n\nYou will be taken to a local police station where the police must inform you, in a language you understand, the reason for your arrest and that preliminary proceedings have been commenced against you. You will be questioned and asked to provide your personal details. You may be asked to make a statement. This must be done with a translator or someone who can speak English. You will be held initially for a maximum of 48 hours. You are only in custody and not yet on remand. You may have to spend one or two nights in a detention centre or an airport holding cell.\n\nIf you are given documents to sign, ensure that you understand what you are signing.\n\nWhat happens when I am charged?\n\nThe courts will inform you, your lawyer or public defender and the prison authorities of what you have been charged with. If you don’t have a private lawyer of your own you will be appointed a legal aid lawyer by the courts.\n\nAppearing at court\n\nFrom the police station, after a maximum of 48 hours, you will be taken to court where you will appear before a Magistrate (“Haftrichter”) who will discuss your case with you. The examining judge will decide whether you will be placed on remand to await your trial, be required to pay a fine, or granted permission for release. The decision will be based on the particular circumstances of your case.\n\nInitial arrival at the prison\n\nIf remanded in custody, upon arrival at the prison you will be placed into a holding cell until the prison staff are ready to register you. You will be asked to provide your personal data such as your name, date of birth, nationality and place of residence, religion, marital status and profession, allergies and medical conditions, as well as name and address of next-of-kin. Your next-of-kin will not be notified without your permission.\n\nIt is important at this stage that you notify the prison staff of any pre-existing medical conditions so that they can arrange for you to be seen by a doctor.\n\nThe prison might also ask whether you would like the British embassy to be notified. If you do wish for us to be informed, please ensure that the prison is aware of this.\n\nThe prison staff will take your photograph and you will be assigned a prisoner number. This will need to be written on all correspondence sent to and from the prison. You will then be designated a cell on a prison wing, which will depend on your circumstances and/or case.\n\nYou will visit a doctor within the first few days for a medical check-up to ensure you are fit and well. It is important that you notify the doctor of any pre-existing medical conditions. Consular staff can gain access to your medical notes from the UK if required and you provide consent for us to do so.\n\nA prison social worker will be appointed as your first point of contact for all matters pertaining to your rights, and the rules and regulations within the Austrian prison system. Please note that the majority of prison social workers in Austria do speak some English, but this will depend on the location.\n\nPre-trial detention (translated as “remand”) is governed by the Untersuchungshaftvollzugsgesetz (UVollzG) (code of pre-trial procedure).\n\nPrison: conditions and daily life\n\nAccommodation\n\nPrison conditions in Austria are generally very good. In the majority of cases, you will be sharing a cell with one or possibly two other inmates, but depending on the prison and the size of the cell, you may have to share a cell with more. Every cell has access to drinking water and a toilet and a television is common in most cells.\n\nFood and diet\n\nThe prison authorities have assured us that the food they provide is a balanced diet that meets the necessary daily nutritional requirements. Vegetarian meals are available in all prisons. A special diet can only be provided on religious or medical grounds (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure) and needs to be authorised by the prison doctor. Should you have any special dietary requirements, notify the prison upon arrival or inform the prison doctor during your check-up. You can supplement your diet by buying additional food items, such as fruit or vegetables, from the prison shop using private funds (Eigengeld). Tap water is safe to drink in Austria.\n\nHygiene\n\nEvery cell is equipped with running water and a toilet. You will be permitted to use the communal shower at least two times per week. Toiletries can be bought from the prison shop from your private funds.\n\nWork and study\n\nPrisoners on remand are not obliged to work and opportunities to work can be limited. If the nature of the work means that contact with other prisoners is required, the prison or the judge will have to approve this first. Prisoners may only be able to work once they have settled into prison life, which is usually one month after arrival. Sentenced prisoners may be obliged to work and to perform a job which they are physically fit for. Some positions may require a knowledge of German language.\n\nLearning and development opportunities may vary from prison to prison. You should ask the prison authorities what is on offer.\n\nMost prisons have some English-language books and other reading material in their libraries. If the prison gives you permission, you can order books directly from publishers and via certain authorised online platforms. With permission, you can receive English newspapers and magazines on subscription. You should explore this with your social worker and/or the prison authorities. Always confirm in advance with the prison that there is no objection to you ordering a particular book, magazine or newspaper. Reading materials sent without prior permission will be not be authorised for acceptance by the prison.\n\nMost prisons offer language courses. You can request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).\n\nExercise\n\nPrisons in Austria usually offer a limited sports and/or leisure programme. This can involve a one hour break for a walk in the prison courtyard, weather permitting, and access to sporting activities such as table tennis, football, darts etc. Most prisons also have a gym with weight training equipment.\n\nClimate\n\nThe Austrian climate is generally moderate with no excessive heat, cold or humidity. From July to August the daytime temperature ranges from 25 - 35°C and from January to February the range is from -2 - 7°C. During spring and autumn, the daytime temperatures range from 10 - 20°C. Appropriate clothing will be provided by the prison authorities.\n\nReligion\n\nAll prisoners are entitled to take part in religious services of their choice. They also have the right to receive visits from a priest, rabbi or minister of their faith. Each detention facility is staffed by prison chaplains (Geistlicher). If you are on remand and the court has placed you under a separation order, you may not be able to attend the group religious services. The minister of faith may, however, visit you in your cell instead.\n\nRules and regulations (including drugs)\n\nDrugs and mobile phones are strictly forbidden in Austrian prisons. If either are found in your possession (or those visiting you) you will face disciplinary action. This may include losing your job if you are working, or negative consequences for your release date (remission). Visits could also be suspended, and it is important to note that your behaviour whilst in detention is taken into account when considering your application for conditional release.\n\nMost prisons offer a drugs programme for those inmates with a drug addiction. This should be directly discussed with the prison doctor and prison social worker.\n\nPrison: access to help and services\n\nReceiving money\n\nThere are 2 ways you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison:\n\nprivate funds: deposited to you by your family or friends\n\nPrisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family cannot support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).\n\nThe British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.\n\nPrivate funds\n\nWhile the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family or friends.\n\nThe FCDO operates a ‘Prison Comfort’ system for money transfers to prisoners. Ask your family or friends to get in touch with the FCDO to arrange this. We cannot receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.\n\nIn Austria, prisons allow family and friends to transfer money directly into the prisoner’s ‘Eigengeld’ account, which is assigned to them when they enter prison. Find instructions on how to do this on the prison’s website or through the assigned social worker.\n\nShould family or friends wish to arrange an international transfer to this prison account in Austria, we highly recommend going to a UK bank to do this. The process is quicker but the service will incur a fee. It is essential that they specify the following on the money transfer reference:\n\nwhat the money is to be used for, e.g. Eigengeld\n\nyour name\n\ndate of birth\n\nname of prison where you are currently detained\n\nPrisoners Abroad\n\nPrisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to provide some financial assistance, depending on your circumstances.\n\nMedical and dental treatment\n\nWhile you are detained, Austria is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.\n\nThe prison doctor has an oversight of the health and wellbeing of all prisoners. As soon as a new prisoner enters a prison, they are examined by the doctor. The doctor will determine whether you require a special diet or any other form of medical treatment.\n\nIf you need medical or dental treatment, you should speak to the prison guards and your social worker about making an appointment with the prison doctor or dentist. In larger prisons, it can be difficult to get an appointment at short notice. In smaller prisons, the doctor may only visit once per week so you should submit a request as soon as possible. If the situation is urgent, you should alert your prison social worker. Prison doctors often have the equivalent status of General Practitioners (GPs) in the UK, so unusual or complex conditions may be referred to a specialist outside the prison.\n\nIf you have a long-standing medical issue for which you have received treatment in the UK, it may be useful to have your medical records sent from the UK to the prison doctor or specialist. If you have a medical condition that cannot be adequately treated at the prison itself, you may be transferred to a hospital and be placed under police guard.\n\nWith your permission, we can try to ensure that any medical or dental issues you may have are brought to the attention of police or prison doctors. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and we have your consent to do so.\n\nPsychological care\n\nIf you suffer from depression or anxiety, or you feel you need psychological help, it is important to make this known as soon as possible and consult the prison doctor. They may be able to make recommendations regarding adjustments.\n\nLetters and parcels\n\nThere is usually no limit to the number of letters you can send or receive. The prison authorities are obliged to deliver letters with the minimum of delay. Incoming mail to the prison is checked and then distributed.\n\nRemand prisoners have their incoming and outgoing mail monitored by the Public Prosecutor / Judge. The Judge has the right to restrict your correspondence or to stop the forwarding of letters, if there is a risk of jeopardising any legal proceedings. You should therefore not discuss your case in private correspondence. If a letter is withheld as evidence, you will be informed that this has occurred.\n\nIf correspondence is written in another language, it may first need to be translated by personnel outside of the prison, before it can be released to you. This procedure may cause substantial delays, particularly around peak seasons.\n\nIf you are told you are not allowed to receive letters in English, you should notify consular staff and we will communicate with the Director of the prison.\n\nOn request, prisoners can ask for writing paper or envelopes. The prison may be able to help with postage and the provision of stamps, but they can also be purchased from private funds each month.\n\nYou can receive parcels from your family, but these will be strictly controlled. It is recommended that you check with the prison authorities what can and cannot be sent to avoid parcels being returned. Find more details on the relevant page of the prison website, or through your prison social worker.\n\nParcels should be sent directly to the prison and should note the full name and date of birth of the detainee. Parcels sent to the Embassy will not be forwarded to you.\n\nTelephone calls\n\nIf you are on remand and your case is still being investigated, you may not be allowed to make and receive telephone calls. This decision lies with the public prosecutor’s office or the judge. Your lawyer is best placed to submit a request via the court for you to exceptionally make a telephone call due to the distance between you and your family in the UK.\n\nIf your sentence has already been confirmed, you will be able to make and receive telephone calls. You may need to put in a request to make a telephone call or to apply for a prison telephony account. Please consult with your social worker for further information.\n\nMaking a complaint about mistreatment\n\nIf you have been tortured or mistreated, you should inform consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and advise on local complaints procedures and support organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible take photos of your injuries.\n\nShould you decide to raise an official complaint with the prison authorities, please notify consular staff. We take all allegations and concerns very seriously and will follow up with action appropriate to the circumstances of the case, with your consent.\n\nChapter 3: The Austrian judicial system\n\nOverview\n\nThe FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.\n\nThe Austrian judicial system is very similar to that of the UK. The Austrian legal system is based on the civil law tradition and has its origin in Roman law. It consists of public law, private law and criminal law.\n\nThe Austrian Constitution establishes Austria as a representative, or indirect, democracy with a two chamber parliamentary system, in which the separation of powers principle is recognized. Most legislative power lies with the Nationalrat (National Assembly), which is elected by general federal elections every fourth year. On the other hand the members of the second chamber, the Bundesrat (Federal Assembly), are nominated by the diets of the nine autonomous Provinces (Länder). The Federal Assembly represents the interests of the Federal Provinces.\n\nRead a detailed overview in English.\n\nYour lawyer will also be able to provide more detailed information about your case and the Austrian judicial system.\n\nFirst steps\n\nWhat should happen after you are arrested\n\nA person can be taken into detention (Festnahme) on the basis of an existing arrest warrant (Haftbefehl) or into temporary detention (vorläufige Festnahme) by the Public Prosecutor or Police where grounds for the issuance of an arrest warrant exist. In addition, a general right of arrest exists where a person is caught in the act of performing a crime, if they are considered a flight risk (Fluchtgefahr), or their identity cannot be confirmed.\n\nWhen someone is arrested, they will be taken to a local police station where they must be informed of the reason for their arrest. If there is a language barrier, an interpreter must be provided.\n\nYou can expect to be brought before the court within 48 hours of your arrest, where the judge will determine whether you are to be released, fined or placed in pre-trial detention (remand).\n\nMany foreign prisoners in Austria who are not resident in country may be deemed to be a flight risk.\n\nIf you have any questions on the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer.\n\nAppearing at court\n\nFrom the police station, after a maximum of 48 hours, you will be taken to court where you will appear before a Magistrate (Haftrichter) who will discuss your case with you. Their decision on whether you will be released, fined or placed in pre-trial detention (remand) will depend on the particular circumstances of your case. Remand custody may be imposed if the person who has been arrested is strongly suspected of having committed an offense or crime.\n\nDuring pre-trial detention, the Public Prosecutor is responsible for all matters concerning the prisoner’s welfare. Pre-trial detention is governed by the Untersuchungshaftvollzugsgesetz (UVollzG).\n\nInitial arrival at the prison\n\nIf remanded in custody, upon arrival at the prison you will be placed into a holding cell until the prison staff are ready to register you. You will be asked to provide your personal data such as your name, date of birth, nationality and place of residence, religion, marital status and profession, allergies and medical conditions, as well as name and address of next-of-kin. Your next-of-kin will not be notified without your permission.\n\nIt is important at this stage that you notify the prison staff of any pre-existing medical conditions so that they can arrange for you to be seen by a doctor.\n\nThe prison might also ask whether you would like the Embassy to be notified. If you do wish for us to be informed, please ensure that the prison is aware of this.\n\nThe prison staff will take your photograph and you will be assigned with a prisoner number. This will need to be written on all correspondence sent to and from the prison. You will then be designated a cell on a prison wing, which will depend on your circumstances and/or case.\n\nYou will visit a doctor within the first few days for a medical check-up to ensure you are fit and well. It is important that you notify the doctor of any pre-existing medical conditions. If needed consular staff can gain access to your medical notes from the UK if you provide consent for us to do so.\n\nYou will be appointed a social worker who will be your first point of call for all matters pertaining to your rights, and the rules and regulations within the Austrian prison system. Please note that the majority of prison social workers in Austria do speak some English, but this will depend on the location.\n\nHow long you can be remanded in custody\n\nThere is no maximum period for being held on remand. You can be held until the end of the criminal investigation or you may be released earlier if the arrest warrant is withdrawn or your arrest is suspended. A suspension of your arrest may be conditional: for example, you may have to deposit a sum of money in bail, or you may be required to report regularly to the Police.\n\nYou may only be held in pre-trial custody for more than six months under exceptional circumstances, for example where the investigation is especially difficult or unusually wide‑ranging, or there are other important reasons that need to be examined by the Public Prosecutor or by the Court. An investigative judge must substantiate a remand period that is set to extend past the six month mark.\n\nOnce remanded in custody, a detainee will usually appear before the Magistrate for the second time (first time was 48 hours after arrest) after 2 weeks, then a month and then two months thereafter. The process can take longer where the ongoing investigations are complicated. You will then receive a date for your main trial.\n\nRead further information on the European e-Justice website.\n\nAfter you are charged\n\nOnce your trial has taken place, your remand period automatically ceases and you start to serve your sentence. At the trial, the time already spent in prison on remand is taken into consideration when calculating the sentence. Once you enter post-trial detention, you will no longer have to appear before a Magistrate as described above.\n\nPost-trial detention is governed by a law called Strafvollzugsgesetz (StVollzG).\n\nBail\n\nThe FCDO cannot transfer bail funds.\n\nBail only applies to those who are held on remand and awaiting trial. It is very rarely applied in the case of non-Austrians who are arrested as the risk of that person leaving the country is deemed to be high. Bail would only be granted if a pledge not to flee, hide or leave the domicile without the judge’s permission, or attempt to impede the investigations, is submitted to the judge. The amount of bail set is based on the financial situation of the accused, the nature of the crime and the likelihood of flight risk from Austria.\n\nInstructions on how bail can be paid are available from the Magistrate’s office (“Haftrichter”) or prison social services.\n\nIf you have been released on bail please bear in mind that you must not leave the country without the judge’s permission. Bail forfeits if you fail to participate in the proceedings or if you start serving your sentence.\n\nIf bail has been granted you will be allowed to work in Austria. You will also be eligible for Austrian benefits or financial support if you meet the individual requirements.\n\nTrial and legal assistance\n\nLegal assistance: lawyers and legal aid\n\nIf you wish to hire a private lawyer, you can find one through the embassy’s list of local English-speaking lawyers.\n\nPrisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.\n\nThe Austrian Government introduced a system in the 1970’s for assisting persons of small or moderate means by providing legal aid in civil and criminal litigation. An overview is below.\n\nLegal aid involves the remission of court fees, deposits and similar charges on the one hand and gratuitous representation by a lawyer on the other. You are entitled to legal aid in a proceeding if you cannot, without endangering your livelihood, bear the cost of litigation.\n\nA foreign national will be granted legal aid only subject to reciprocity on the part of his country. The Anglo/Austrian Legal Aid Convention of 31 March 1931, in Article II, accords national treatment of citizens of the United Kingdom as regards legal aid in the field of civil proceedings.\n\nApplications for legal assistance must be submitted to the civil court. The application must be accompanied by an affidavit specifying all details regarding the applicant’s financial position and family commitments. In some instances only partial aid is granted in light of the applicant’s financial situation.\n\nThere are instances where representation by a lawyer is even mandatory, for example where an offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than five years. Juvenile delinquents (i.e. persons over the age of 14 and below the age of 18) are entitled to gratuitous representation by a lawyer, even if they are charged with an offence which is tried in a magistrates’ court (Bezirksgericht), provided that such representation is necessary and the juvenile or his parents or legal guardians are not in a position to bear the cost of his defence.\n\nTrial\n\nOn your trial day you will be taken to the court office where your case is being handled. There will be a judge in charge of your case along with the public prosecutor and your lawyer or public defender. If you don’t speak German the court will be responsible for hiring an interpreter to assist you during the trial. In most cases, your lawyer will be able to translate for you.\n\nSentences\n\nSentences vary greatly in Austria and will depend on the seriousness of the crime. Your lawyer or public defender will be best placed to advise on length of sentences and on appeals’ processes.\n\nAppeals\n\nYou have the right to appeal against your sentence in the Higher Courts through your lawyer or public defender. Depending on the case, it is not unusual for the public defenders to appeal against your first sentence. However, the appeal process is usually very slow and can sometimes lead to the appellant’s release being delayed until the appeal is decided. In such cases you should seek the opinion of your lawyer before proceeding.\n\nReaching the end of your sentence\n\nReduction of sentence (remission) or early release (parole)\n\nIn Austria, the law makes provision for the early release of prisoners serving a sentence. The Executive Court (Vollzugsgericht) is obliged to consider automatically whether you should be released:\n\nwhen you have served half of your sentence (Halbstrafe) if the sentence was for a period of two years or less, and you have not been sentenced and imprisoned before\n\nwhen you have served two-thirds of your sentence if the above is not applicable\n\nYou may apply for early release at any time, however, in most cases you are expected to have served at least two-thirds of your sentence, which in total must be longer than two years. To benefit from early release, it is important that your conduct whilst in prison is good. Good behaviour will be taken into account when the court is considering whether someone is eligible for early release.\n\nYour lawyer or prison social services will be able to provide further information on other early release options such as:\n\n§133a StVG – Provisional refrainment from executing a prison sentence due to an existing entry ban or exclusion order (Vorläufiges Absehen vom Strafvollzug wegen Einreiseverbotes oder Aufenthaltsverbotes)\n\n§ 46(1)(2) StGB – Conditional release from a prison sentence (Bedingte Entlassung aus einer Freiheitsstrafe)\n\nClemency or pardon\n\nClemency is offered by the Federal President of Austria upon recommendation by the Federal Government. Traditionally a few hundred prisoners are pardoned at Christmas (Weihnachts-Amnestie) every year. However, this is only at the discretion of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIndividual amnesty (Einzelbegnadigung) can be applied for by the individual at the Ministry of Justice or Federal President of the Republic of Austria.\n\nFinancial penalties\n\nThis really does depend upon the case, but financial penalties are very rare.\n\nTransfer to another prison within Austria\n\nIf you have been tried and convicted you will be sent to a prison where you can expect to serve your sentence. Transfers are only permitted when there are exceptional and compassionate reasons for doing so.\n\nTransfer to a prison in the UK\n\nThere is a Prisoner Transfer Agreement (PTA) between the UK and Austria. Prisoner Transfer Agreements allow prisoners to transfer to serve the remainder of their sentence in their own country. This enables them to be closer to family and friends in an English-speaking environment and permits them to benefit from pre-release courses available in British prisons.\n\nTo transfer to the UK, you must:\n\nbe a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)\n\nnot be awaiting trial – criminal proceedings in the foreign country must be complete\n\nhave exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal\n\nhave at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer\n\nhave no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties\n\nThe offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nA prisoner does not have an automatic right to transfer. The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. Even if the sentencing country agrees to your transfer, the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family living there.\n\nRelease and deportation\n\nThis varies depending on the crime and also the normal place of residence of the person being released. There is no automatic expulsion. Depending on the crime and the sentence, a person who was residing in Austria would be released and would be able to remain in Austria. Where this is not the case, the person may receive a “Residency Ban” for either a limited period (e.g. up to 5 or 10 years) or even an indefinite period – either for the Republic of Austria only or for the whole of the Schengen area. For further information, please ask your prison social services to liaise with Immigration authorities (Fremdenpolizei) well in advance of your release. You will receive an information sheet in English explaining exactly what is expected of you following your release i.e. whether you may remain in country or how quickly you must leave Austria.\n\nSometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. You may not have lived in the UK before and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.\n\nIf you are registered with Prisoners Abroad, you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings, Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance you should tell your consular caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:\n\nadvice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area\n\nclaiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute\n\nmaking appointments with doctors and dentists\n\nputting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area\n\nLater on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.\n\nOther sources of practical help back in the UK are:\n\nYour criminal record in the UK\n\nWe will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.\n\nChapter 4: Additional information\n\nPrisoners Abroad\n\nSince 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned abroad. It is the only UK charity providing this service. It is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial. Prisoners Abroad supports your health and welfare during your imprisonment. It can also provide support on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family when you are in prison. To access any services, you must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.\n\nOnce you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner & Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information.

    "Ryanair Increases Ticket Prices for Flights to Austria": "The previously known ultra-low-cost flag carrier, Ryanair, has announced it will increase ticket prices to Austria moderately, mainly due to inflation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe company, which owns the Austrian carrier, Lauda Europe, revealed that low-cost travelling is now in the past, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n“There will be no more 10-euro tickets,” Head of Ryanair Austria, Andreas Gruber, told the Austrian press.\n\nAs The Local reveals, the average price for a Ryanair flight will increase from €40 to €50 in the future. However, despite the increase, Ryanair expects the number of passengers to remain unaffected in the upcoming months while people are looking for cheaper transportation alternatives.\n\nGruber points out that people are expected to pay more attention to the price of tickets. In addition, the number of passengers to Vienna is expected to increase from six million this year to 6.5 million the following year.\n\nStarting in November, when an influx of 50,000 to 60,000 passengers is expected, Ryanair will start operating flights from Klagenfurt, the southern Austrian province.\n\nThe company pointed out that ticket bookings have been on the rise, reaching the anticipated levels, especially for those looking to fly on the London-Stansted route.\n\n“We offer more destinations on short and medium-haul routes than AUA from Vienna,” Gruber noted, pointing out that the market share in Vienna currently stands at 25 per cent.\n\nJust recently, Ryanair announced eight new routes in the program of its flights scheduled to and from Vienna. The new routes include Bremen (Germany), Manchester (England), Copenhagen (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), Genoa and Venice (Italy), Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Sibiu (Romania).\n\nThe flag carrier revealed that it is investing €1.7 billion in the Vienna hub, with a total of 17 aircraft being stationed in Austria’s capital. The airline is expected to operate more than 600 flights per week to and from the capital and will contribute to a total of 600 newly created jobs for the season.\n\nOn the other hand, Ryanair recently reported all flights to Zaventem Airport in Brussels Airport until spring 2023 due to high fuel costs and flight tax. The Chief Executive of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, added that the winter season would be challenging for air travelling.\n\n“This winter is going to be profoundly challenging, with higher fuel costs, so an increase in airport charges like in Zaventem is not sustainable,” he pointed out.\n\nThe decision, which will become effective in late September, will impact the operation of two planes at this airport and about 15 planes at Charleroi airport that will be removed.",
    "First in: Rosewood Vienna, Austria hotel review": "Suite window view at Rosewood Vienna\n\nThe backstory\n\nListen carefully and you may hear the high notes of an aria floating around the place (this is Vienna, after all, and even the street buskers studied at a conservatoire): once upon a time, Mozart lived in an apartment at this address and composed The Abduction from the Seraglio here. But the structure itself dates from 1835, a former bank comprising four buildings huddled around a courtyard, which Rosewood has gradually transformed, adding two more floors at the top designed by Viennese design studio Kroenland (which also worked on the new Motto hotel). Soho Farmhouse designer Alexander Waterworth is responsible for the bedroom interiors, while Paris-based Atelier27 has curated the distinctive artworks that decorate the walls. Follow the corridor to the left of the check-in desk and you’ll see a number of artfully customised historic postcards and prints of Petersplatz – they belong to a former resident of an apartment here, who kindly donated his collection after moving out. The hothouse flowers of the salon – a nod to the city’s art nouveau Palmenhaus – were painstakingly painted by Viennese artist Marie Hartig, while the rooftop mural is by enigmatic graffiti artist KNARF. Quite a European collaboration, then, though the emphasis is on Viennese makers and creators. Rosewood isn’t a known brand in Austria – this is its first in Central Europe – so its arrival has sparked a lot of curiosity.\n\nThe rooms\n\nTap the remote-control and blinds will rise to slowly reveal the neighbourhood – it’s like having a royal box looking out over the city. From our room, 514 (which can be combined with 513 to make a family suite), I could look straight down to the Hofburg Palace, the Habsburg’s modest little des res in town – ever so slightly distracted by the cocktail trolley by the window. The same view was also possible from the bathtub (which doesn’t come with cocktails, though that can doubtless be arranged). Bedrooms are elegant with nothing that will scare the horses (particularly not the well-trained gee-gees of the Spanish Riding School); there are soft grey marbles and burnished orange chairs and sofas that curve to follow the walls, along with brassy Art Deco flourishes such as the sink units and marble-and-walnut drinks cabinets that take pride of place, with shelves bearing a trio of pre-made cocktails and essays by modernist architect Adolf Loos. Connecting all the spaces are fluid, linear patterns on rugs, cushions, notebooks and curtains, all by design company Backhausen, a key player in the Wiener Jugendstil (that’s Art Nouveau to you) movement of the early 20th century. And the effect that a handful of playful artworks can have in personalising a space is quite incredible. The hi-tech Toto loo (I’ve always assumed the name has no relation to Dorothy’s four-legged friend), which yawns wide open when you approach but doesn’t quite enquire how your day’s been, is still enough of a novelty to mention here.",
    "Protests erupt across Austria demanding solution to cost of living crisis : Peoples Dispatch": "On Saturday, September 17, trade unions and other working class sections hit the streets across Austria protesting the government’s inefficiency in tackling the ongoing cost of living crisis. The protests called by the Austrian Trade Union Federation (OGB) saw the participation of various groups including the Party of Labor of Austria (PdA), Youth Front, Communist Youth of Austria (KJO), Communist Party of Austria (KPO), and Links, among others. Marches were held in cities in all federal States including Vienna, Eisenstadt, Bruck an der Mur, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Bregenz, Lower Austria, and Upper Austria. According to the organizers, over 30,000 people participated in the protests, with 20,000 people having marched in Vienna alone. The protesters called on the politicians to take concrete actions to tackle the current crisis.\n\nPeople across Europe have been reeling under an acute cost of living crisis marked by soaring inflation in food and fuel prices. Due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) and the US on Russian gas exports to Europe, energy prices have skyrocketed in European countries. Profiteering by multinational energy producers and suppliers despite this crisis has worsened the situation, including in Austria. According to Statistics Austria, the inflation rate for August 2022 in the country was 9.3% and the minimum consumer basket (cost of household consumption and essential services) is around 16% higher than last year, reported Zeitung der Arbeit (ZdA).\n\nThe OGB said, “whether at the supermarket checkout or petrol pump, when looking at the electricity bill or paying rent, prices explode and with them the profits of a few companies and corporations, while many people face enormous problems.”\n\n“For months, OGB and trade unions have been warning of inflation and have presented concrete plans on how quickly help can be provided. But far too little has happened. The OGB therefore calls for rapid measures to relieve the burden. Prices of energy, housing, food, and transport must go down!” OGB added.\n\nIn order to tackle the cost of living crisis, OGB has put forth a set of demands, including an energy cap on electricity and gas bills, a special tax on surplus profits of big companies, abolition of VAT on food for a certain period, constitution of an anti-inflation commission, reduction of tax on fuel, removing VAT on public transport, massive expansion of public transport, and legislation for a rent cap.\n\nOn September 18, Tibor Zenker from the leadership of the PdA told Peoples Dispatch (PD), “The capitalist crises are leading to massive inflation in Austria. Many people can no longer afford the cost, especially for energy, but also housing and food. Wages are too low and the working class is impoverished, while capital is gaining record profits. The conservative government remains inactive. The Party of Labor of Austria calls for resistance. A general strike is needed. The demands are for wage increases above the inflation rate, state price regulations, and taxation of wealth and corporate profits. The working class is not begging for charity but fighting for its rights.”\n\nThe KJO stated, “We can hardly afford to live anymore while the capitalist class increases their profits in times of inflation crisis. The politics of begging for handouts will do nothing. Only a militant movement can counter the capitalist madness.”",
    "Austria urges its citizens to ‘make small changes’ to reduce energy consumption": "Austria is calling on its citizens to make small behavioural changes as it aims to reduce the nation’s electricity consumption by 11%, a new campaign presented by Climate Minister Leonore Gewessler on Monday stated.\n\nGewessler presented the country’s new energy-saving campaign dubbed “Mission 11” on Monday.\n\n“Today, we are launching Mission 11, and we hope as many as possible will join us,” said Gewessler.\n\nBy making “small changes to our behaviour,” the approximately four million households in Austria are encouraged to help save energy, she said, noting that despite there being other ways to reduce gas dependence by expanding renewable energy development and a “transformation of industry,” the need to remain cautious remains.\n\nThe new campaign includes tips like turning down the heating by two degrees, turning off devices completely, and taking a shower instead of a bath, covering the fields of electricity, heat, mobility and hot water.\n\nTo get through the winter, gas storage tanks are being filled, and “ideally” the upcoming winter “won’t be much different than other winters,” Gewessler added.\n\nWhile Labour Minister Martin Kocher said it was simply a matter of raising awareness, Energy Industry Secretary General Barbara Schmidt noted that while many of the recommendations are trivial and well-known, “these simple tips should be kept in mind.”\n\nThe campaign comes “months too late”, said the energy spokeswoman of the liberal NEOS party, currently in opposition. The government is also “working against the campaign with its falsely constructed electricity price cap because it is not encouraging the majority of households to save energy,” she added.\n\nAccording to environmental organisations Greenpeace and WWF, the energy saving campaign is a first step in the right direction. However, additional measures such as pushing through an energy efficiency law, are also needed.",
    "Austria v Croatia Live: Croatia look to seal top spot in Group A1 at the expense of bottom team Austria, who face relegation": "",
    "Football Match Report": "Croatia qualified for the Nations League semi-finals next year as defender Dejan Lovren marked his return to the team with a rare goal in a comprehensive 3-1 victory over relegated Austria in Vienna on Sunday.\n\nLovren, playing his first international in almost a year, scored the third goal for the visitors, who topped League A Group 1 with 13 points from six matches, one point ahead of second-placed Denmark. Austria finished bottom.\n\nLuka Modric gave Croatia an early lead with his 23rd international goal as he took a touch to control Nikola Vlasic's pass and fired low into the net.\n\nThat joy was short-lived as Austria equalised three minutes later when Christoph Baumgartner glanced Marcel Sabitzer's cross into the net with a deft header.\n\nBut two goals in three minutes midway through the second period sealed the points for Croatia as Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer's cross.\n\nDespite the loss, it was a special night for home forward Marko Arnautovic, who won an Austrian record 104th international cap and moved past Andreas Herzog at the top of the country's list of most appearances.",

Fabian Balbuena sealed victory for the South Americans in the 85th minute when he headed home unmarked from a corner.\n\nREAD MORE UAE take first step on long path towards targets with friendly against Paraguay in Austria\n\nHowever, the UAE created a number of chances throughout the match, with youngster Harib Abdallah hitting the woodwork and all-time leading goalscorer Ali Mabkhout going close. Rodolfo Arruebarrena’s side round off the camp against Venezuela on Tuesday.\n\nFor the UAE, Austria marks the beginning of a long preparation period for three major tournaments in the first half of next year, starting with the Arabian Gulf Cup in Iraq in January and culminating with the Asian Cup next June.\n\nSpeaking after the Paraguay match, full-back Abdulaziz Haikal said: “The friendly was a very useful test. The players did a great match against a strong team with big stars, and only conceded in the final five minutes.\n\n“The friendly matches we play during the camp are aimed at preparing the team for the upcoming competitions. All players have great desire to get maximum benefit from the camp.\n\n“We are going to play another friendly against Venezuela, who are a strong team that have good and experienced players. The match will be an opportunity for the technical staff to correct the negatives of the last match, and to continue preparations to reach the highest level of readiness before starting the official competitions.”\n\nMeanwhile, Arruabarrena praised the players’ performance on Friday, with the Argentine stressing that he was more focused on his side’s display rather than the result.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Austrian government on Wednesday announced plans for a power price cap to curb the rise in energy costs tied to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nChancellor Karl Nehammer said the cap should ease costs for an average household of three by about 500 euros ($494) per year. The government will provide around 3-4 billion euros to finance the measure, which will come into effect in December and last through the end of June 2024.\n\n“No one in Austria should be unable to afford their basic electricity needs,\" the chancellor told reporters in Vienna.\n\n“This is about quick and unbureaucratic help, which is why no one needs to apply for it,” he added. “The electricity price cap is handled automatically for every household. It is another building block in the relief of people in a difficult time.”\n\nNehammer added that low-income households can apply for additional financial support.\n\nThe cost-relief plan comes at a time when Austria and other European countries are struggling to contain an energy crisis and rising prices as Russia has throttled back supplies of natural gas.\n\nEuropean officials have said it’s energy blackmail, aimed at pressuring and dividing the European Union as it supports Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe 27-nation EU should set a price cap on Russian natural gas and pass other measures to ease the energy crisis, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nIndividual governments across Europe have passed relief for households as high energy prices drive up utility bills and fuel inflation.\n\nAustria's government announced other financial aid earlier this year, including extra payments of child bonuses and financial aid for retirees on low pensions.",
    "Austria takes ‘historic step’ to scrap creeping tax rises": "Coalition partners have agreed that creeping tax increases on low-wage earners will be removed from the start of 2023\n\n‘Bracket creep’, or ‘cold progression’ as it is known in German, occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets in progressive tax systems as wages increase to stay ahead of rising prices.\n\nThe result is an increase in income taxes but no increase in disposable income if adjustments to income tax rates are not made fast enough, a problem in places like Austria, where taxation levels do not automatically follow inflationary pressures.\n\n“The abolition of the creeping tax increase is a historic step. With this, we ensure that a salary increase actually remains for all those who work hard every day to live on and is not eaten up by moving up to a higher tax bracket,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to calculations by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), the creeping tax increase is worth €1.85 billion.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, two-thirds of the revenue will flow back to taxpayers automatically in the future via income tax and deductions.

    "TCR Europe returns to Austria and Hungary in 2023 calendar": "TCR Europe has unveiled its 2023 calendar, which will exclusively support the International GT Open championship.\n\nSince the series’ creation in 2018 it has usually split its schedule between GT Open and World Touring Car Cup events, although last year primarily supported GT World Challenge Europe and this year guaranteed a German presence by racing with the DTM twice.\n\nFor 2023 the calendar will remain at seven rounds, and will have a similar look to the current schedule with races at Algarve starting the season on the final weekend of April.\n\nThe Spa-Francorchamps round will move from June to late May, then the Paul Ricard round shuffled from May to the height of summer in July. Between those two events is a return to the Hungaroring, which was last visited by TCR Europe in 2019.\n\nAnother returning circuit is the Red Bull Ring in Austria, also last raced on in 2019, which is set to be visited on September 8-10 although the date is yet to be confirmed until the event contract is signed.\n\nAs is now tradition, the season ends with trips to Monza (22-24 September) and Barcelona (October 20-22).\n\n“We are all looking forward to another great year in TCR Europe in 2023 and releasing the calendar now means our existing teams and those thinking of joining us can start to make firm plans,” said TCR Europe’s promoter Paulo Ferreira.\n\n“We have become known for offering a great calendar that visits some of Europe’s most iconic racing circuits.\n\n“There will also be some more news to come about the technology we plan to introduce for next year – we think of it as a new era in TCR competition – so I would advise teams and drivers considering a TCR Europe entry in 2023 to keep an eye open for more details.”\n\nProvisionally there will be no clashes with the World Touring Car Cup next year, meaning drivers and teams will be able to compete in both.\n\nThe lack of DTM support events means TCR Europe will be without a German round for the first time since 2020, having raced at the Norisring and the Nürburgring this year.\n\n2023 TCR Europe Calendar\n\n28-30 April – Algarve, Portugal\n\n26-28 May – Spa-Francorchamps\n\n16-18 June – Hungaroring\n\n21-23 July – Paul Ricard\n\n8-10 September – Red Bull Ring*\n\n22-24 September – Monza\n\n20-22 October – Barcelona\n\n*to be confirmed",
    "Time to accept that obesity is a disease – Austria is building a national system to treat it": "Obesity needs to be treated just like any other disease that threatens people’s lives. To fight obesity effectively, policy-makers, health professionals and other stakeholders need to create a health system that ensures that every person has access to high quality care for the management of overweight and obesity. Austria is currently working on a such a system that can bring obesity treatment to the next level.\n\nFighting obesity: treatment is just the beginning\n\nNina, a girl from a rural area in Austria, was diagnosed with obesity and a very heavy individual burden of comorbidities when she was 14 years old. After medication treatment and significant weight reduction, she was dismissed from hospital. But as she lived a 2.5-hour drive away from the clinic, she lost contact with her doctors 8 months after treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Nina came back, she had not only regained weight but also had type 2 diabetes.\n\n“Cases such as Nina’s show that treatment may aid, but it can never be sufficient if doctor-patient relations are not maintained, and if there is no national system that gives clear guidelines on how obesity should be treated,” said Dr Daniel Weghuber, Head of the pediatrics department at the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Medicine of Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are around 240 000 children and adolescents living with overweight and obesity in Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent report from WHO/Europe showed that, in the entire WHO European Region, around 60% of adults and 1 in 3 children are living with this condition. Halting the rise in obesity is going to require comprehensive policy approaches, both in the areas of obesity prevention, such as through creating healthy food and physical activity environments, and in the areas of obesity and overweight management.\n\nObesity treatment as part of general insurance\n\nAs President of the European Childhood Obesity Group, Dr Weghuber has been leading the work on a national concept on childhood obesity treatment for Austria, which is based on the idea that obesity is a serious chronic disease that is tightly connected with other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept was prepared by professionals from primary to tertiary health care and signed by all relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the social security sector, in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO has been urging Member States to take further steps in halting the so-called global obesity epidemic by 2025, as no country in the Region is on track to halt or even reduce the rise of obesity by this date.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Austria is ready for the next step. Leading health professionals and stakeholders launched a nation-wide initiative called Austrian Obesity Alliance. The Alliance proposes a renewed obesity management programme that acknowledges obesity as a disease and demands that the social security system includes obesity management in the universal health insurance system.\n\nMany people don’t see obesity as a problem\n\nThere are several regions in Austria that have already created the infrastructure for the planned national obesity treatment programme. These structures can be scaled up to other regions of the country. But to roll out the programme, political commitment based on the understanding that obesity is a serious public health challenge is also crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to change the perception of obesity that is prevalent today,” said Dr Michael Krebs, Specialist for Internal Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna. “There are more than 3 million adults and 240 000 children with overweight and obesity in Austria representing a wide range of demographics. Yet, more than 85% of obesity patients seeking treatment in our outpatient clinic are women. That means that most men living with obesity don’t see their condition as a disease – or don’t want to treat it for whatever reason.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many countries in the Region, obesity is still associated with social stigma, and it multiplies the life-threatening risks of this medical condition. Health professionals need help from decision-makers to get evidence-based messages and WHO recommendations through to a wider audience.\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease”\n\n“Countries need to adopt a comprehensive approach to obesity prevention and management,” said Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe, Acting Head of the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. “We learned a lot from listening to people living with obesity and their families, and we encourage all governments to take measures to also get inputs from these important stakeholders for all stages of the obesity policy cycle.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe (RC72), to be held in September 2022 in Israel, high-level stakeholders and decision-makers from all 53 Member States of the Region will discuss best practices that can stop the increase of obesity levels and tackle this urgent problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria is an active participant in many of the related WHO projects including the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) and the WHO Marketing Network. These projects are helping health professionals and stakeholders to create an effective country-tailored system to fight obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease. And since it’s a chronic disease, every person with obesity has to be diagnosed, and in each case a treatment needs to be defined. This is the future,” concluded Dr Weghuber.\n\n\n\n",
    "Austria in violation of EU labour market laws": "The European Commission has notified the Austrian government of its failure to signal the transposition of new EU labour market directives, kickstarting the bloc’s infringement procedure that could end at the European Court of Justice.\n\nOn Wednesday, several EU countries were found violating EU law. In the case of Austria, two new laws regulating the labour market were not properly transposed into domestic law, a requirement with directives.\n\nVienna failed to do so for the 2019 law on transparent and predictable working conditions, which is meant to bolster workers’ rights to information about their job. Workers in precarious, informal forms of employment stand to benefit from this.\n\nThe government also failed to ensure a 2019 law that was designed to further the work-life balance of parents and carers. The directive introduced paternity leave and a minimum of ten free days for fathers.\n\nAustria is far from alone in failing to meet the demands of EU law. In all, 24 EU countries have failed to notify full transposition of the latest batch of the ten new EU laws. Italy, Lithuania and Estonia were the only countries not to receive a letter on Thursday.\n\nVienna has been given two months to respond or address the issue before the Commission takes the next step, a “reasoned opinion.”\n\n(Nikolaus J.

    "Iran protests: Two supporters ejected from Austria friendly for protesting death of woman in police custody": "Protesters against the Iranian regime are led away by security personnel during Iran's friendly international with Uruguay in Austria. ALEX HALADA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nST POLTEN, Austria -- Two supporters protesting against the death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in police custody in Iran earlier this month after being charged for allegedly wearing a headscarf improperly, were ejected from Iran's friendly international against Uruguay by police in Austria after entering the supposedly-behind closed door fixture in St Polten.\n\nPolice approached the two men midway through the first half of the game in the NV Arena, 50 miles from Vienna, and asked them to hand over the placard which said Amini was 'murdered by the police of the Islamic Republic of Iran.'\n\nAfter failing to persuade the supporters to end their protest, police marched the men out of the stadium.\n\nThe death of Amini has sparked widespread protests in Iran which have seen women take to the streets without hijabs (headscarves) and cut their hair in a show of defiance.\n\nAs a result of the situation in Iran, the country's government insisted that the national team's friendly game against Uruguay be played behind closed doors to nullify the prospect of further protests.\n\nBut despite the game officially being listed as a 'behind closed doors' fixture, fans from both teams were allowed into the NV Arena, with the main stand populated by around 400 spectators.\n\nBefore the game, media were told that neither Iran coach Carlos Queiroz or any of the team's players would be available for interview after the fixture.",
    "Posting workers to Austria": "An overview of Corporate obligations when posting your workers to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services.\n\nIn Austria, the provisions of the Directive on the Posting of Workers (Directive 96/71/EC) and of the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU have been implemented into national legislation by means of the Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), published in Federal Law Gazette Part I № 44/2016. In addition, the provisions of the LSD-BG ensure compliance with Austrian wage and working conditions, prevent wage and social dumping by foreign companies.\n\n1. Formal requirements companies have to meet when posting workers to Austria\n\nUnder Section 19 of the LSD-BG, companies established in an EEA Member State must notify the Central Coordinating Agency (ZKO) of the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) of the posting of any worker in the context of a temporary provision of services in Austria.\n\nHence, foreign employers and agencies posting their employees to carry out work in Austria have to notify the ZKO in electronic form using the web form ZKO3. The notification shall be submitted prior to the start of the working activities in Austria at the latest.\n\nIn accordance with § 23 LSD-BG, when posting workers to Austria, the posting company shall designate a contact person to liase with the authorities. In particular, the contact person is either one of the posted employees, or a professional legal representative domiciled in Austria. Furthermore, the contact person shall keep copies of:\n\nThe notification of posting (ZKO3);\n\nSocial security document A1/E101 or equivalent documents;\n\nIn the case of third country citizens, an official work permit in the country of domicile, if required;\n\nPay documents and records of hours worked.\n\nIn the event of any subsequent changes of the original notification, companies shall submit a change report without delay. Circumstances requiring the transmission of a change report include any change of the actual place or places of work, of the posting period or the cancellation of the posting.\n\n2. Exception to the obligation of notification\n\nGenerally, certain cross-border work activities do not fall under Austrian regulations governing minimum remuneration, registration and notification. For instance, the exception to the obligation of notification applies if the posted worker performs the following work in Austria:\n\nBusiness meetings;\n\nParticipating in seminars, presentations, conventions and conferences; activities as part of international programmes of advanced training and research at universities;\n\nParticipation in trade fairs and similar events, etc.\n\nSince the amendment to the Austrian Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), other exemptions apply to postings of skilled workers within a company group for a maximum total of two months per calendar year and for the purpose of research and development, training, planning project activities, business consulting, controlling or collaborating with departments of the company group which are responsible for central management and planning for more than one country.\n\n3. Posting of third-countries workers employed by EEA companies to Austria\n\nIn case the posted employee(s) come from third countries, the ZKO automatically forwards the notification to the Public Employment Service (AMS). Pursuant to Section 18 para. 12 of the Employment of Foreigners Act (AuslBG), the AMS is competent to issue an EU Posting confirmation and to allow the posting of a non-EU worker. To do so, the AMS verifies that the third-country worker is:\n\nProperly employed in the posting country, and Employed in Austria in accordance with Austrian wage and working conditions during the posting period.\n\nIn order to allow the verification of the above requirements, the posting company must include in the notification details of the employment permit and of the residence permit which were issued in the posting country.\n\nThe regional office of the AMS shall, within two weeks, confirm to the posting company that the requisite conditions are met, and issues an EU posting confirmation or, if they are not met, ban such posting.\n\n4. Obligation to keep posting documents readily available\n\nForeign employers, posting his workers to Austria, must keep the following documents readily available at the place of work during the entire posting period or make them accessible electronically on site:\n\nA copy of the ZKO3 report and any reports regarding subsequent modifications, as well as\n\nDocuments regarding the employees’ registration for social security insurance (A1 Certificate or E 101), or equivalent documents, such as the application for the issuance of the A1 or E 101.\n\nIf an official permit is required to employ the posted workers in the country where the employer is established, this permit or a copy thereof must also be kept readily available.\n\nBesides, each company posting its staff to Austria shall keep all salary documents that are necessary to determine the wages due to the employees according to Austrian legislation readily available in German, during the entire period of the posting, meaning:\n\nRequired wage or salary documents in German;\n\nEmployment contract;\n\nPay slips and proof of wage payment or bank transfer statements;\n\nWage or salary records;\n\nRecords of hours worked and;\n\nDocuments relating to pay categorisation in order to verify the remuneration that is payable to the posted worker under Austrian law for the duration of the employment.\n\n5. Austrian working and salary conditions\n\nWhen posted to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services, workers must comply with Austrian regulations on working time and rest periods. Generally, the normal daily working time is 8 hours, while the weekly working time amounts to 40 hours, excluding overtime. In addition, the maximum of overtime allowed per week is 20 hours. Finally, the minimum rest period under Austrian law is of 11 consecutive hours after daily working time.\n\nFurthermore, employees posted to Austria shall receive at least the amount of remuneration that is due them in Austria pursuant to a statute, ordinance or collective agreement.\n\nIt is therefore particularly important, prior to posting workers, to be aware of the minimum wage levels stipulated in the applicable Austrian collective agreement.\n\n6. Further obligations: BUAK and Dienstleistungsanzeige\n\nIn the construction sector, foreign employers posting their workers to Austria need to observe a number of special regulations related to the Austrian Construction Workers’ Holiday and Severance Pay Fund (Bauarbeiter-Urlaubs- und Abfertigungskasse, BUAK).\n\nTherefore, the foreign employer needs to comply with a series of requirements, namely:\n\nReport the posting for the purpose of construction works in Austria;\n\nMeet the conditions for the employees’ annual leave entitlement by remitting to the BUAK the monthly wage supplements for the category of annual leave (‘annual leave supplements’ and ‘holiday pay fund procedure’);\n\nPay the employees at least the minimum wage in Austria as stipulated in the collective agreement;\n\nIn the event that construction workers are hired out to an Austrian user undertaking and the workers continue to be covered by social insurance in their home country, a contribution to the BUAK’s AÜG-Fonds-Service for the social and continuing training fund (SO-Beitrag), in addition to the annual leave supplement.\n\n6.1. The Dienstleistungsanzeige to carry on regulated trade in Austria\n\nAccording to Section 373a of the Gewerbeordnung 1994 (GewO 1994), if a foreign company wishes to carry on a regulated trade in Austria, they have to notify the competent authority before starting their operations. Such notification is the Dienstleistungsanzeige and must be renewed once a year if the company intends to provide services in Austria during the year in question.\n\nSection 94 of the GewO 1994 specifies which are the regulated business activities for which it is necessary to apply for a Dienstleistungsanzeige. They include, for instance, metal technology for metal and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe competent authorities for issuing the Dienstleistungsanzeige is the Federal Ministry of Labour and Economy (BMAW). To submit the application, the foreign company shall provide a series of documents, including:\n\nAttestation about the lawful establishment in the member or contracting state;\n\nAttestation regarding activities previously pursued exercise of the activity concerned;\n\nProfessional qualification of the responsible legal representative;\n\nFor certain trades, proof of absence of criminal records (e.g. security trade) or of the conclusion of liability insurance (e.g. real estate trustee).\n\n7.

    "Austria's OETI celebrates 55 yrs of testing, certifying, accreditation": "As an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\n\"As renowned flooring manufacturers founded the Austrian Carpet Institute on 25th of September 1967, no one could have imagined how successful the company would become. But even back then, one thing was clear to the experts: the need to establish a carpet research and testing centre in the form of an association. And its success proved them right. Today, over five decades later, OETI is a testing and certification services provider for OEKO-TEX certificates and labels, textiles, leather, due diligence along the textile and leather supply chain as well as for personal protective equipment (PPE), flooring technology, furnishings and indoor air quality,\" OETI said in a media release.\n\nAs an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\nInnovation as well as high quality standards were also important criteria behind the institute’s continuous market development and constant competitiveness right from the start, explained managing director Robert Löcker. “We work together with our customers to bring new ideas for product developments to life and award products, services, production processes and production facilities the 'Inspected Quality' label. We also test and certify indoor air quality in line with the Cleanair standard, which is based on stringent national and international guidelines.”\n\nIn 1992, OETI was a founding member of the ‘International OEKO-TEX Association for Research and Testing in the Field of Textile and Leather Ecology’ with independent certifications and product labels. Ever since, OEKO-TEX has enabled companies along the textile and leather supply chain and every consumer to make responsible decisions for safe, environmentally friendly and fairly manufactured products.\n\nAnother pioneering step occurred in 1994: OETI was one of the first Austrian institutes to be accredited under the new Accreditation Act in accordance with EN 45001, a major and important milestone for future collaborations and the domestic market.\n\nIn line with its focus on sustainability, OETI and its Swiss parent company, Testex AG, wanted to build the new OETI headquarters using low energy construction techniques and ensure its carbon-neutral operation. To achieve these goals, the highest possible thermal insulation and energy optimisation standards were applied, while the carbon-neutral power supply is generated by its in-house photovoltaics system as well as domestic renewable energy, the release added.\n\nThe new headquarters, which the company moved into in 2021, provides space for 75 employees over 2,500 square metres. The laboratory areas, the analytical/chemical laboratory and the physical/fire laboratory were also designed based on the latest methods and technologies. This makes OETI, alongside its Swiss parent company Testex, the second fully fledged laboratory site in the entire, global Testex Group.\n\nFrom 1967 through to the present, OETI has been constantly changing. An important cornerstone of this adaptability is the establishment of international subsidiaries and a consistent internationalisation strategy. This led to the foundation of subsidiaries in Egypt, the Czech Republic and Ukraine between 2007 and 2010. And further sales offices were regularly added from 2014: Turkey, Moldova, Italy, Iran, Morocco, Israel, North-Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n“We know that the market for our services will change dramatically in the coming decades due to technological and social factors. In order to successfully celebrate our 100th anniversary as well, OETI will be very flexible with those services that will continue to help both consumers and industry in the future, locally and regionally, wherever they are needed.” Specific plans include a renewed focus on internationalisation and market expansion to the Indian subcontinent, with the addition of two new sites in India and Bangladesh in 2022. “We also want to extensively expand our portfolio and comprehensive consulting service, as well as accelerate our growth through corporate acquisitions in the future,” Löcker, added.\n\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (RR)",

    "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions": "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions\n\nThe two face off in qualifying for the 2023 Women's World Cup, both having had successful summers at the Women's Euros\n\nWhen England last faced today's opponents Austria, the post-match atmosphere as players passed through to speak to the media, contrasted starkly with the result.\n\nIt was the opening game of a Euros campaign that would end with the Lionesses triumphing, winning their first ever major tournament in unforgettable fashion. But it started with a far from memorable 1-0 win against Austria, the occasion massive as 68,781 turned out at Old Trafford, but the performance stuttering as the unfavoured nation harried and pressured them like few others have done.\n\nThey almost spoiled the party, something they’ll look to do again this weekend to keep their unlikely hopes of finishing top of the World Cup qualifying group alive, while strengthening their ambitions for a seeded spot in the play-offs.\n\nUnderneath the headline of the summer as England brought football ‘home’, quarter-finalists Austria were one of the stories of the Euros. But they are not just a story for this year. The signs shown in July were as promising for the future as for that tournament. They’ll be a thorn in England’s side this weekend, and for any side moving forward.\n\nThat much was felt when Lionesses Lauren Hemp and Fran Kirby reflected on the game after these two last met. The mood was relief. They had got three points which would certainly, as what followed shows, get rid of the nerves that surrounded a much-hyped evening.\n\nWhen Austria midfielder Sarah Zadrazil stopped to talk, meanwhile, she was very pleased – or, in her words, “super happy”. Her team had lost the game, but there were plenty of positives in what was a “bonus game” against the favourites.\n\nWhat followed was a tournament not too many expected from Irene Fuhrmann’s side. They finished second in a group that saw Norway crash out in spectacular fashion, head coach Martin Sjogren leaving his role shortly after a group stage exit that included an 8-0 defeat to England, and posed Germany plenty of problems in the quarter-finals – hitting the woodwork three times before losing 2-0.\n\nAfter that game, Zadrazil was upbeat again, as was fellow midfielder Laura Feiersinger. Their team had just gone toe-to-toe with the eventual finalists, one of the world’s best.\n\n“We're always the underdog and no one really has us on the list,” Zadrazil told GOAL, after saying she believed Austria had “definitely” impressed a few in England. “We just love proving people wrong.\n\n“I think we showed, again, what being a team means and what you can achieve as a team. Maybe we don't have the best individual players out there, but I think we have a strong team and that's what matters and that's what's successful.”\n\nThe Bayern Munich star might be doing herself a disservice there, as she is one of the best midfielders in Europe. Austrian players might not grab the headlines, but added to Zadrazil’s quality, striker Nicole Billa is one of just two foreign players to be named Footballer of the Year in Germany – the other being Pernille Harder – while Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger was the stand-out goalkeeper in the Women’s Super League last season.\n\nHowever, team spirit and togetherness are certainly star characteristics of this national team.\n\n“We always have fun shortly before the games, which is, I think, very important because somehow you get waken up, you're there and you just enjoy everything,” Feiersinger explained.\n\n“From the moment we go outside, on the pitch, everything changes. That's so fascinating for me as well because sometimes I'm in the locker room and I'm like, 'Okay, we have a game in five minutes. We have the semi-finals or the quarter-finals and, it's insane in here'. But as soon as we step on the pitch, everything changes.”\n\nAll of that is headed up by Fuhrmann, one of the most impressive coaches at the Euros. To watch an Austria team is to watch 11 players who know exactly what the game plan is, what their role is and how to execute what is being asked of them.\n\n“I think tactically we are always well prepared against the opponents and that's one part, but she also lets us have our individual bits,” Zadrazil explained, giving a glowing review of a coach who only took charge last July. “She doesn't say, 'You have to play this way or this way'. We can be creative as well.\n\n“I think the best thing is that she keeps a good team spirit and that she keeps the team together and that everyone is happy and has a good feeling. I think that's what makes us so successful.”\n\n“We have young players, great young players,” Feiersinger added. “I think they need a few more years to develop and I think Irene is the perfect coach for them.”\n\nMany of those young stars got great exposure at the Euros – such as midfielder Marie-Therese Hobinger, winger Julia Hickelsberger-Fuller and recent Arsenal signing Laura Wienroither. Lisa Kolb and Maria Plattner, the two 21-year-olds who missed the Euros due to Covid and injury respectively, are right at the front of that exciting next generation, too.\n\n“It's very important,” Feiersinger replied, asked how crucial the summer’s experience would be going forward. “I think it's also so important for everyone that everyone starts believing that we are a great team, that we are great players and that everything is possible - especially for the future.\n\n“I think this tournament also showed that that we have quality and that we can be very proud of ourselves and that we won't stop.”\n\nEngland are unlikely to have forgotten how tough this team is to face – but a high-profile fixture like Saturday’s may serve as a reminder to many that Austria is a team to keep an eye on as yet another major tournament approaches over the horizon.",

    "French superstar expresses his approval of Saliba after Austria win": "Kylian Mbappe is the apple of France’s eye when it comes to football as the Paris Saint-Germain superstar is sure to go down as one of the country’s greatest ever.\n\nThe forward’s influence on the game has grown rapidly over the last few years and everything he does seems to be a significant story – such as the image rights debacle recently.\n\nGetting Mbappe’s approval is one way of making your mark in a team the 23-year-old is involved in and that is certainly what Arsenal’s William Saliba has done.\n\nThe Arsenal defender has impressed many with his performances at the start of this season and has played a key role in the Gunners’ early success.\n\nThe 21-year-old came off the bench early for France in their latest match against Austria, following an injury to Jules Kounde, and his cameo impressed the French golden boy, Mbappe.\n\nAfter earning his sixth cap, Saliba posted on Instagram via the Mirror: “Always proud to wear this jersey. Thanks to the supporters for this atmosphere.”\n\nAmid the plethora of comments from adoring Arsenal fans, Mbappe sent the defender a message that read: “Duroooooo”, which translates in English to ‘hard’.\n\nA rock at the back, the 20-year-old centre-half has found himself yet another fan in his famous France teammate as his impressive start to the campaign continues.",
    "Austrian officials find Listeria at company linked to outbreak": "Officials investigating a deadly outbreak in Austria have found Listeria at the company thought to be responsible.\n\nListeria isolates with the same genetic fingerprint as the outbreak strain were detected in three environmental samples from the firm in Lower Austria.\n\nKäserei Gloggnitz previously recalled all kajmak, drinking yogurt and cream cheese products because of potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Kajmak is a type of cheese.\n\nThe Listeria strain behind the incident does not match any of those in the AGES Listeria database, which contains more than 15,000 sequences of human, food and environmental isolates.\n\nCluster analyzes by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) found eight infections occurred since 2020 because of an identical Listeria strain. Three people died between 2020 and 2022.\n\nIllnesses occurred in Vienna. The patients are five women and three men aged between 29 and 82 years old.\n\nThe outbreak strain has also been detected in a food product from the suspected company. This food was served in a restaurant mentioned when the sick people were interviewed.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) had asked AGES to investigate the outbreak.\n\nAGES said local food authorities have taken “appropriate measures” to deal with the incident. These included temporarily stopping production at the site for steps including cleaning and disinfection ahead of a review before potential restart, according to local media.\n\nAbout Listeria infections\n\nFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure.\n\nAlso, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for the food poisoning symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.\n\nSymptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)",

    "Anger over 'waste' in Austria as even the dead are sent Є500 climate payout": "Thousands of dead people in Austria have been sent a government payout aimed at encouraging people to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe payouts are being financed from the proceeds of a new carbon tax that makes transport and heating more expensive if it is unfriendly towards the environment.\n\nThe tax -- which sees Austrians charged Є30 per tonne of CO2 created -- is aimed at incentivising people to make greener decisions.\n\nBut the financial aid -- Є500 per adult and Є250 for a child -- is being paid to everyone still on the tax register even if there are dead, the government acknowledged.\n\nThe bonus is inherited by the heirs of the deceased, some of whom have gone to the Austrian press surprised that Vienna has not tightened this apparent loophole.\n\nThis oddity is fueling a heated debate in Austria, a prosperous country in central Europe currently implementing ambitious tax reforms to fight against global warming.\n\nAn opposition party, the New Austria and Liberal Forum, called it \"a waste of taxpayers' money, which lands in the pockets of people not only with high incomes but also of the dead\".\n\n\"Every person who has lived in Austria for 183 days this year is entitled to the climate bonus,\" a spokeswoman for Austria's environment minister told Euronews. \"This entitlement does not expire if the person concerned dies in the period between the cut-off date and the payment.\n\n\"In this case, the climate bonus is – like every other income of this person - transferred directly to the inheritance.

However, energy and food prices have continued to soar despite anti-inflation government policies, Statistics Austria said.\n\nThe slight month-on-month decline was due to fuel prices, which fell by 10.4 percent compared to July. However, although statistics Austria said the August inflation rate would have stood at 9.9 percent without the decline in fuel prices, they remain the strongest driver of annual inflation.\n\n\"The trend of rising prices remained unbroken for household energy, food and restaurants,\" said Tobias Thomas, director general of Statistics Austria.\n\nThe Austrian government has introduced several packages of measures to combat inflation, including increasing social benefits for the unemployed and other vulnerable groups. ■"
