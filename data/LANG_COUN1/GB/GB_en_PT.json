    "Portugal's mysterious 'birthing stones'": "The wind whipped across my face as I stood on the edge of a vast plateau in remote northern Portugal. Lavender-blue haze stretched across the horizon, and I could just make out the outline of a steep waterfall as it cascaded down the mountain below. Delicate yellow flowers created swathes of colour in the otherwise murky landscape. Looking down on the mountains spread out before me like an undulating carpet, I felt as if I was standing at the edge of the world, and I could see why these were called the Montanhas Mágicas (Magic Mountains).\n\nI was in the Arouca Unesco Global Geopark, an open-air geological museum that has long been an attraction for the scientific community due to the sheer number of geological marvels it contains: 41 separate geosites in total. These include some of the world's biggest trilobite fossils – arthropods that lived more than 500 million years ago – as well as geological fault lines and otherworldly rock formations sculpted by water over millions of years.\n\nBut I had not come to see any of these – admittedly interesting – natural exhibits. I had come for something even more fascinating: one of the world's most baffling geological phenomena.\n\nPulling myself away from the mountain view, I continued towards my destination: the tiny village of Castanheira. Nestled into the side of the Freita Mountain (one of the Magic Mountains located within the geopark), the village is home to the Pedras Parideiras, or \"Birthing Stones\" in English – 300-million-year-old rocks that seem to \"give birth\" to smaller \"baby\" stones. They are unlike any other rock on the planet.",
    "Portugal’s growth in 2023 expected to take ‘much larger tumble’": "Council of Public Finances forecasts 1.2% “and even that could be optimistic”\n\nAfter 2022 in which Portugal ‘basked’ in the highest rate of growth in Europe, 2023 is almost certain to be the polar opposite.\n\nThe Council of Public Finances has this afternoon published its forecasts over what is coming by the end of the year, in 2023 and up to 2026.\n\nExplaining that it has had to revise the country’s economic perspectives in light of current times (of elevated uncertainty), the council stresses the exercise was motivated by the “dramatic deterioration in the costs of energy in Europe”.\n\nAs Observador explains, this is not the forecast of the government “as has been requested by the President of the Republic”. Indeed, it is in no way a vision tinged by politics.\n\nIt paints a scenario for 2023 that is “more pessimistic that that published in March (by the council) – and worse than previsions already given by institutions like the Banco of Portugal (headed by former Socialist finance minister Mário Centeno) and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development).\n\nFirst to the ‘good news’: estimates for growth this year have been revised upwards to 7.7%, compared to the 4.8% forecast in March. This is largely due to the “strong performance during the first semester of exportations of services (mainly tourism) and private consumption, benefitting from a backdrop of savings above historic averages” (due to people’s lack of spending during the pandemic).\n\n“But in 2023, the scenario changes”. The council’s forecast is indeed the lowest prevision for growth in the Portuguese economy that has ever been given by any institution, says Observador: 1.2%.\n\nThe slowing down will be “expressive” “due to the persistence of inflationary pressures, with negative consequences on private consumption, and a slowing down of external economic activity (because citizens everywhere are very much in the same boat, and will have less available income with which to take holidays, etc).\n\nAs experts have been telling news anchors, inflation will continue (albeit at a lower rate than the 7.7% forecast this year by the council), and thus loss of spending power will remain with families which are already facing the equivalent loss of one month’s pay packet in those who receive 14 monthly payments (the old system of holiday and Christmas subsidies).\n\nSays the council: “Lack of income in real terms resulting from inflation is one of the factors that leads to the very weak growth in private consumption that we see for 2023”.\n\nAnother powerful factor will be the increase in interest rates – hammering any kind of spending on credit ‘and the rest’.\n\nPutting the boot in further, the council stresses that the weak level of growth it has forecast could in fact “be considered rather optimistic (…) the hypothesis of a recession cannot be excluded in some of our principal commercial partners, which would have inevitable implications in Portugal”.\n\nThe very word ‘recession’ is being ‘fuzzed out’ as much as possible from news reports at the moment. But it is the current ‘elephant in the room’.\n\nRegarding inflation, the council’s forecast for 2023 is that it will ease back to around 5.3% (meaning prices will still be rising, but less steeply). This again is less enthusiastic, for example, than the central bank’s suggestions of 2.7%, and the OECD, which is going with 4%.\n\n“Uncertainty is the watchword in coming months, and the Council for Public Finances is aware of this”, says Observador. “In addition to the risks coming from the outside, the council has identified question marks within. In the execution of the PRR (Plan for Recovery and Resilience) for example: “the possibility of additional delays to those already announced cannot be ruled out – impact of which in real terms could be aggravated in the context of increases in investment prices”. And in terms of the (State) budget (for 2023, due to be debated in parliament next month) we cannot rule out the possibility of (the government) taking more measures to respond to the energy crisis, which would throw the forecasts to the ground”.\n\nnatasha.donn@portugalresident.com",
    "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal": "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal\n\nWidely considered to be the fourth club in a country dominated by ‘The Big Three’, SC Braga might just be on the cusp of breaking the hegemony in Portuguese football. Their excellent start to 2022-23 certainly has fans on the edge of their seats…\n\nSC Braga, under the tutelage of their new manager Artur Jorge, have started the season in spectacular form, both domestically and in European competition. Since drawing on the opening day of the Primeira Liga season at home to Sporting CP, Braga have gone on to win every single match – six in league, two in UEFA Europa League, scoring goals aplenty and attracting plaudits both in Portugal and across Europe for their breathtaking performances.\n\nPortugal’s Fourth Club\n\nBraga, particularly in the 21st century, have established themselves as Portugal’s fourth club. A club which strives to fight at the top of Portuguese football, battling to break through the glass ceiling to reach Os Tres Grandes or The Big Three, consisting of SL Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting CP. The last time they finished in the top three wasn’t too long ago, finishing third in 2019-20; a season where they took advantage of a Sporting CP that were seemingly in free-fall both off and on the pitch.\n\nBack in 2009-10, Braga recorded their best league campaign, finishing second under Domingos Paciência, picking up a fantastic 71 points and losing just three games all season. A year later, Braga managed to reach the UEFA Europa League final in Dublin, eventually losing to FC Porto 1-0 before Paciência was nabbed by Sporting CP in the summer. By and large though, Braga are usually found sitting just outside the top three, occupying fourth position. In fact, they’ve finished fourth in seven of the last 10 Portuguese top-flight seasons.\n\n2011 UEFA Europa League Final between Braga and Porto\n\nTheir electric start to 2022-23, however, has indicated that they may well be gunning to add another top-three finish to their record books. A key difference (and incentive) to note between the last time they went one further than the top three and finished second, is that due to Portugal’s coefficient ranking, Braga had to play UEFA Champions League qualifiers the following campaign in order to secure group stage football. This season however, a second-place finish would guarantee group stage football in Europe’s elite footballing competition, and third place would see them enter the qualifying rounds.\n\nNew Manager, New Ideas\n\nWhen Carlos Carvalhal, a manager who led Braga to a Taça de Portugal victory, consecutive fourth place finishes and to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals, left the club at the end of last season to “embrace a new project”, Braga didn’t look to replace him with a manager of similar profile and experience, but instead opted to hand the reigns to one of their own, in the form of Artur Jorge.\n\nJorge, an ex-Braga player, has spent the majority of his coaching career working at the club in one capacity or another, whether it be as working as manager of Braga B, with the club’s U23 side or working with the youth teams at the club’s academy, as well as experiencing a month in charge of the first team as caretaker manager in 2020.\n\nThis season, Jorge has moved Braga away from the 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 formation that they often utilised under Carvalhal and before that, Rúben Amorim. The Braga boss has instead opted for a more traditional 4-4-2, allowing Simon Banza and either Abel Ruiz or Vitinha to work off one another up top.\n\nInterestingly, Artur Jorge’s approach this season hasn’t been to try and emulate Benfica, Porto and Sporting, instead they’re playing their own brand of more direct football, and it’s working.\n\nBraga have had the joint most shots (19) and scored the most goals (5) from high turnovers in Portugal so far this season. They don’t press as high up the pitch as the big three, but they time their press to perfection and only seem to press the opponent in their defensive third when they think that they’ll get a shooting opportunity from doing so.\n\nField tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the field tilt numbers in the Primeira Liga this season, the stark difference between Braga and the big three becomes even clearer. Benfica are currently averaging 84.6%, Sporting CP 77.1% and FC Porto slightly less with 71.9%, Braga however are currently averaging only 57.5%, taking fewer touches in the opposition third and completing fewer passes in the opposition third, yet they lead the league for goals scored (23).\n\nAs the graphic above shows, Braga are averaging less passes per sequence than the big three. In fact, Braga’s 3.4 passes per open play sequence actually means they are currently closer to promoted Casa Pia and Rio Ave (3.1 and 3.0 pps respectively) in that regard than to Benfica and Sporting (4.4 and 4.3 pps).\n\nThis directness from Braga starts at the first whistle and is a key reason why they’ve often started games on the front foot. 26.% of Braga’s goals so far this season in the Primeira Liga have been scored inside the first 15 minutes. In the match against Famalicão, Braga effectively killed the game off after 18 minutes, scoring twice and then managing the game brilliantly, allowing Famalicão to have possession in safe areas and then intelligently choosing when to hunt the ball back without leaving themselves exposed.\n\nAs the numbers indicate, Braga’s efficiency so far this season has been a key reason for their success. In front of goal, they have been ruthless. In the space of just over two weeks, Braga beat Famalicão 3-0, Marítimo 5-0 and Arouca 6-0 – 14 goals from 28 shots on target, meaning half their shots on target were hitting the back of the net.\n\nSC Braga players have scored 23 goals (excluding own goals) from an expected goals total of just 15.1 – a league-high overperformance of 7.9.\n\nOf course, it helps considerably when your top players are creating chances and firing on all cylinders when in front of goal. In Braga’s case, Ricardo Horta and Simon Banza, as well as several others, have started the season in emphatic fashion for Artur Jorge’s side.\n\nBanza’s exploits last season at Famalicão (18 goals and seven assists) were enough for Braga to bring him to the Estádio Municipal and give the Frenchman a platform to perform at the top end of the table and so far, he hasn’t disappointed. In his first five games of the season, he scored five goals and provided one assist for Braga.\n\nAnother talented forward that Braga have at their disposal is the exciting 22-year-old striker Vitinha, who himself has three goals and one assist in just six starts. Vitinha is generally very involved in the game for a traditional striker, averaging a healthy 31.7 touches per game, putting in 1.6 tackles per game and making 1.1 clearances per game. It was Vitinha’s smart rebound against Bundesliga leaders Union Berlin which gave Braga all three points away from home in the UEFA Europa League, a goal that epitomised his striker’s instinct.\n\nWhilst Braga will be delighted at both Banza and the rest of the teams’ goalscoring exploits, they will undoubtedly be aware that their potency in front of goal will not last forever. Their xG overperformance of 7.9 is probably not sustainable in the long term, thus they will be expecting a bit of a crash in front of goal soon. For further comparison, the biggest overperformance of xG across the whole of last season in Portugal was 5.3 by Tondela, while Benfica followed with 3.7 goals more than their xG total.\n\nKeeping Hold of Ricardo Horta\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Braga’s superb start to the season without analysing their key man, the club’s all-time top scorer, the magnificent Ricardo Horta.\n\nThroughout the transfer window, Horta was the subject of a very publicised transfer saga linking him with a move to Lisbon giants SL Benfica, with The Eagles’ president Rui Costa admitting on several occasions that the club were very keen on signing the 28-year-old Portugal international. The interest in him was expected, Horta was hot off scoring 23 goals and providing 10 assists across all competitions, seeing him named in the Liga Portugal Team of the Season.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best players in the division, it seemed almost inevitable at times that Horta would depart, and Braga would have to pick up the pieces to begin a search for a solution to the gaping hole their most influential player exiting would leave behind.\n\nHowever, when the transfer window slammed shut, Horta was still a Braga player. The club and its passionate supporters breathed a collective sigh of relief.\n\nIf you thought for a moment that this very public courting of Horta would in any way affect his morale and his performances going forward for Braga, you would be sorely mistaken. He has started the season in simply electric form. Some players can either create chances or take chances, Horta does both consistently with equal efficiency. His 56 attacking sequence involvements puts him second in the league behind Enzo Fernandéz, but what is remarkable about Horta’s numbers is how evenly distributed they are, 16 involvements in the build-up to shot, 18 chances created, and 22 shots shows that Horta isn’t currently excelling in just one particular area, but instead he’s doing it across the board. In terms of solely chances created, no player has created more than Horta so far this season (20) and only two players have created more from open play than he has (16).\n\nHorta’s consistency and efficiency when creating and taking chances means he is currently the league leader for combined goals and assists with seven, consisting of four goals (second most in the league) and three assists (most in the league).\n\nHis importance to Braga becomes even more obvious when his numbers are compared to the rest of his Braga team-mates. He is their key man and if they are to remain on their upward trajectory and potentially fight for a top three position, keeping Horta fit and firing will undoubtedly be key.\n\nA Brilliant Start, but That’s All It Is\n\nArtur Jorge’s side displayed character and heart on the opening day against Sporting, coming back from behind three times to take a well-earned point. Another test came in the form of their Minho rivals Vitória SC. This was a big test for Braga, who at this point had won three successive matches without conceding a goal but wary that on derby day, form can go out of the proverbial window. The result? Braga won 1-0 courtesy of a Vítor Tormena winner in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time, which was nearly the final act of the match, with their rivals barely having time to kick-off. The best possible way to beat your fiercest rivals and maintain your winning streak.\n\nFast forward a few weeks to today and Braga remain unbeaten both domestically and in Europe, but they will not be getting carried away. A brilliant start is great, but it’s exactly that, a start. Their next match after the international break is a huge test of their credentials, a trip to the Estádio do Dragão to face defending champions FC Porto.\n\nSérgio Conceição’s men come into this one in poor form and lacking confidence, having won just twice in their last six matches in all competitions. On one hand, Braga will feel like it’s a great time to take on the Dragons, but on the other hand, this is a Porto side that will need no motivation, who know that defeat on the day will see them fall six points behind Braga.\n\nIf Braga are serious about usurping one of the big three, if only for this season, then it is in matches like this one that their credentials will really be examined. Lose and it’s not the end of the world, win and Braga fans will be in dreamland for yet another week.\n\nEnjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.",

We attract people and investment to Portugal which, in turn, creates jobs that benefit the Portuguese, with businesses that pay taxes\", declared the minister.\n\nBernardo Ivo Cruz also declared that both the Government and the municipalities are mobilised to solve the housing problem in Portugal, with \"a large program of investment in real estate and construction\".\n\nNew profile of foreign investors\n\nFor the Secretary of State, the profile of people who move to Portugal is also changing, contributing to the country's development.\n\n\"We want to attract good investment to Portugal, a structuring investment that creates jobs and the French people who are going to Portugal now belong to a new generation, they are younger French people, with children, who settle [in the country] to work, generate wealth and raise their families\", he explained.\n\nIn a study carried out with around 1,000 French people, around 20% responded that they could effectively live in Portugal if they had a job that allowed them to work remotely.\n\nAs for reasons, 'bon vivre', or quality of life, is what attracts the French the most, as does the cost of living, the climate, the price of houses and security.\n\nIn a climate of uncertainty with the general increase in prices and the war in Europe, these characteristics seem to become even more attractive to the French.\n\nInvestment by emigrants, especially the Portuguese community settled in France, also continues to be one of Portugal's priorities.\n\n\"It is always a good time for emigrants to invest in Portugal. I have had many conversations and many meetings with our community spread all over the world and there is a great desire on the part of everyone to invest. From large investments to small investments in villages from which people left and they are all very important\", concluded Bernardo Ivo Cruz.",

    "Why tides rise and fall and Thor’s drinking quest": "Having grown up on the coast of the south of Portugal, the beach, the sun, and the sea have always been a big part of my life and of the country’s culture and identity.\n\nPortugal boasts some of the best and most beautiful beaches in the world and its long coastline, which is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean, played a huge role in putting the country at the forefront of overseas exploration during the Age of Discovery.\n\nThis era of maritime exploration and colonisation were the beginnings of the globalisation that today allows millions of tourists to flock to Portugal’s golden beaches each year.\n\nThese beaches feature everything from immense stretches of sand as far as the eye can see, to little coves, cliffs and caves that sometimes are only accessible during low tides. But why do we have high and low tides throughout the day?\n\nWe now know that it is mainly the gravitational pull of the moon paired with the rotation of the Earth that causes tides to rise and fall around the world. However, tides throughout history have always been a mysterious phenomenon to ancient cultures. Even in semi-recent history, a 17th century German astronomer named Kepler believed that the Earth was a living breathing animal, that tides were due to its respirations, and us humans were like insects living on its back.\n\nDescartes was eventually the first philosopher who advanced the theory that tides were due to the influence of the Moon and Newton then worked out the reasoning why.\n\nEverything in the universe that has mass also has gravity, including us. The greater the mass of a planet or body, the stronger its gravitational pull. The gravitational force of the Moon pulls the oceans towards it, which causes them to bulge outwards. The side of the Earth facing the Moon experiences the Moon’s pull the strongest, and this causes the seas to rise, creating high tides.\n\nHowever, a bulge of water is also created on the opposite end of the Earth. This happens because gravity is measured from the centre of mass of an object and weakens with distance. Therefore, the side of the Earth facing away from the Moon feels a weaker pull towards the Moon than the Earth’s centre. So, the centre of the Earth experiences the Moon’s pull more than the oceans, which, in turn, also creates a bulge of water or a high tide.\n\nSince the Earth is constantly rotating, we experience two high tides and two low tides every lunar day (24 hours and 50 minutes). As the Earth rotates and our area moves closer to the Moon’s influence, water slowly rises up the shore and then slowly falls back again. As the Earth keeps rotating, we then experience another high tide when we are on the side of the Earth opposite the moon. Therefore, if you are worried about where to place your towel, it will take the sea six hours and 12.5 minutes to go from its lowest point to its highest point.\n\nLike stated before, everything in the universe that has mass has gravity. Accordingly, the Sun also exerts a gravitational force on the Earth even though the Moon’s pull is stronger as it is much closer to us. Yet, when all three align, the Sun’s tidal force works together with the Moon’s tidal force creating the highest high tide – called a Spring Tide.\n\nLikewise, the opposite happens when the Sun and the Moon are at a 90-degree-angle. When this happens, the tidal forces act against each other creating the lowest low tide – called Neap Tides. Both Spring Tides and Neap Tides occur twice a month.\n\nIt wasn’t just the German astronomer who came up with wild theories about the Earth. The first ships that were built in and sailed from Lagos in the Algarve kickstarted the Age of Discovery and carried the sailors and explorers into the fearful void.\n\nTales of sea monsters and the unknown were plentiful and although more than 80% of the ocean has still not been mapped, explored or even seen by humans, we now know today how tides work and when they occur. We can use them to our advantage whether we are sailing, fishing, surfing, or even just lazing on the beach with a cold beer waiting for the guy with the cooler full of doughnuts to pass by.\n\nWith that last note, I will leave you with one of my favourite ancient tales relating to the rise and fall of the oceans. In Norse Mythology, there is a tale where the god Thor is challenged to a drinking contest by the King of the Giants, Skrymir.\n\nThor enthusiastically accepts the challenge and is brought a huge horn filled to the brim with mead. The Giant King tells Thor that whoever can finish it in one drink is considered a great drinker, whoever finishes it in two is just about worthy, but no one has ever been so weak as to need to finish it in three.\n\nThor drank mightily but, as he felt his breath running out, the mead in the horn had barely lowered. The Giant King mocked Thor as he gave it a second attempt. He drank and drank until his breath failed him once more, and although the level had gone down, the better part of the horn still remained full. His third attempt was even more impressive than the last two, but, in the end, he found himself defeated.\n\nThe King of the Giants later on admits to Thor that the end of the horn was in fact connected to the ocean and Thor had nearly succeeded in drinking it all. He took such huge gulps that, as the legend goes, the tides are Thor’s valiant attempt to drink the ocean.\n\nBy Jay Costa Owen\n\n|| features@algarveresident.com\n\nJay works for a private charter airline, and is also a UX designer and aspiring author who enjoys learning about history and other cultures",
    "Americans Moving To Europe: Portugal Still Top Place For Expats Despite Restrictions": "Portugal, a favorite among expats getty\n\nHousing prices, political divisions, high cost of living, the rise of remote work, crime rates in some U.S. cities, a strong dollar now at parity with the euro for the first time in more than 20 years — these are among the reasons experts mention to explain the wave of Americans relocating to Europe, or planning to do so in the near future.\n\nSome have other, more personal reasons such as love for the European way of life, the food, wine, a job or following family members who have already moved to the old continent.\n\nIn a recent article entitled “Americans Who Can’t Afford Homes Are Moving to Europe Instead,” Bloomberg writes that the traditional trends of retirees and the wealthy as the prime American buyers of real estate in Europe have changed: “Relatively cheap housing — particularly in smaller cities and towns — and the rise of remote work have made the continent alluring to a wider range of people, including those who are younger and find themselves priced out of the housing market at home.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Why Are Vienna And Six Other European Cities The Best In The World To Live In?\n\nAmericans’ high demand for houses in Europe\n\nDigital nomad working from a beach terrace getty\n\nInternational real estate businesses release data every day showing a growing interest from American buyers, particularly concerning Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, among others, that offer special deals for golden visas, digital-nomad visas, green visas and lower-cost housing.\n\nIn the past few years, Portugal appears at the top of most of the lists of places recommended for expats and retired people to enjoy a good life and its golden visa program is one of the most popular in the world. The number of Americans living in Portugal rose 45% in 2021 from the previous year, according to government data.\n\nIn Spain, also a popular destination and hosting the largest American population in Europe, the number of U.S.-born residents rose 13% between 2019 and 2021 and demand continues to rise.\n\nSotheby’s International Realty has said that requests from Americans looking to move to Greece rose 40% in the April-to-June period this year compared to a year earlier.

With the new changes in effect since last January the required Golden Visa minimum investment increased to €500,000.\n\nThe same as in Spain where the investment is at €500,000.\n\nThe golden visa also permits freedom of movement throughout the 27 E.U. countries,\n\nSo far this year, Portugal has collected €397.7 million through its golden visa program, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

    "Brits to receive post-Brexit residency cards by end of year": "Minister predicts 36,000 Brits will have residency card by 2023\n\nPortugal’s Minister of Internal Administration said today that he expects the 36,000 British citizens living in Portugal to have the new post-Brexit residence card by the end of the year.\n\n“By December 31, we really hope to have responded to these 36,000 British citizens,” José Luís Carneiro said during a visit to the British citizens’ service desk at the Lisbon regional office of the immigration and borders service (SEF).\n\nWith two counters exclusively for Brits, the new post in Lisbon is the fifth to open in the country for the collection of biometric data for the issue of the new residence permit, under the agreement of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.\n\nThis phase of the process started in February in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira and from July in the municipalities of Cascais and Loulé, with two other posts scheduled to open in October in Porto and Quarteira.\n\n“We are fulfilling the commitments we have made, with a view to guaranteeing the rights, freedoms and guarantees of British citizens who seek our country as a country of residence, investment, and living,” the minister told journalists.\n\nFollowing the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, British citizens already living in Portugal when the transition period ended at the end of 2020 were able to apply for a new residence permit. By September, there were around 36,000 registered applications.\n\nMeanwhile, and until the definitive card is issued, British citizens have a provisional document issued when they register on the SEF’s Brexit Portal, in digital format with a QR code that serves as an official residence document.\n\nHowever, according to José Luís Carneiro, this document does not ensure the right to access Portugal’s national health service, the services of the tax authority and the ministry of labour, solidarity and social security, nor the right of movement within the Schengen area.\n\n“This service point aims to respond to that need,” he added.\n\nThe minister also announced the opening of 13 more service points for British citizens from next month, in coordination with the Agency for Administrative Modernisation (AMA) and the Institute of Registration and Notary Affairs (IRN).\n\nThe new posts will open in Lisbon, Faro, Marinha Grande, Pombal, Coimbra, Castelo Branco, Porto, Seixal, Santarém, Beja and Lagos.\n\nQuestioned as to whether they will be permanent posts, the interior minister began by stating that at the moment “a very specific response” is being created.\n\nHe also said this experience of extending the SEF response to the IRN, to the municipalities, as well as to the AMA Citizen Spaces, will “allow us to extend the posts to the entire country, from the municipalities, where immigrant citizens can go to deal with their essential documents”.\n\nAlso present at the visit, the British consul in Portugal, Simona Demuro, said that the opening of the post in Lisbon is a “very important” step that will allow many British citizens living in the country to obtain the new residence card.\n\nSource: Lusa",
    "Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal comments show Erik ten Hag has a Manchester United weapon to use": "Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free\n\nThey are the type of numbers that seem inconceivable at first glance. Then you remember we are talking about one of the greatest players in the history of the game.\n\nBy the time the World Cup comes around in two months, Cristiano Ronaldo will be on the cusp of 200 caps for his beloved Portugal — not to mention more than 100 goals. When it comes to representing his country, there is no question of his importance to the side, even though he is less than five months out from turning 38.\n\nWhile all is rosy on the international front, the superstar has been in the headlines for the wrong type of reasons. Namely, the summer-long saga involving his future at Manchester United.\n\nRead more: Neves gives Ronaldo verdict amid United speculation\n\nThe whole episode did not cover him in any glory and understandably a portion of United fans are keen for him to be shipped off in January if possible. Many wanted him gone as soon as it was made aware he wished to leave in the summer. Whatever the reasons behind it, it didn't happen and he's stayed put.\n\nThat is not to say he cannot play his part this season and, who knows, maybe even further beyond that.\n\nErik ten Hag has so far been content to use Ronaldo sporadically, with just one league start since he walked in the door (albeit there was the caveat of him missing pre-season due to a personal issue).\n\nBut given the fixture congestion that lies ahead, the Dutchman will surely be banking on being able to call upon Ronaldo on a more consistent basis as the season goes on. At 37, he does not have the luxury of being able to wait around months. He needs game time to build fitness for the World Cup, and if that means Europa League matches or Nations League assignments for his country then so be it.\n\nSome have questioned his commitment to the cause but you only have to look at his stance when it comes to Portugal duty. Ronaldo rarely, if ever, shirks call-ups and a measure of his desire to continue playing at the highest level was evident with his latest comments. He was asked whether the upcoming World Cup in Qatar was likely to be his swansong with his country and his answer was unequivocally clear.\n\n\"It has been a long road, but I would like to say that my road is not over yet. (You're going to have to) take a little more road from me,\" said Ronaldo.\n\n\"I hope to be part of the federation (team) for a few more years. I still feel motivated; my ambition is high. I'm in a team with young people. I want to be part of this World Cup and the European too; I'm going to assume that right away.\"\n\nHis longevity, in terms of consistently performing at the highest levels in the sport, may never be witnessed again.\n\nWhile he may not be the player United had first time around, or even the one we saw last year, you should never rule him out. The fire is clearly still burning deep within.\n\nREAD NEXT:",

    "Portugal on a budget – Lonely Planet": "Portugal once had a sterling reputation as one of Europe’s most affordable destinations. Although prices have been on the rise in recent years (thanks in part to the nation’s growing popularity), you can still travel inexpensively here.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nPortugal’s parks and nature reserves are all free to visit, as is the wide array of trails and greenways. Starting the day with a bica (espresso) and a creamy pastel de nata (custard tart) will only set you back a few euros. The country also has many free museums and inexpensive attractions, from medieval architecture to cutting-edge contemporary art. If you’re thrifty, you can get by on as little as 50 euros a day.\n\nHere are some other key ways to cut costs while traveling in Portugal.\n\nFigure out the cheapest way to reach Portugal\n\nPortugal has international airports in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. Be sure to check prices at each before booking, as you may find better deals arriving in one or the other. If you’re considering combining a trip to Portugal with Spain, you might find cheaper rates flying into Madrid or even Sevilla, which is a two-hour train ride away from Tavira in southern Portugal.\n\nTake public transportation from the airport\n\nWhether you arrive in Lisbon, Porto or Faro, you can start your trip right by foregoing a pricey taxi ride and taking a bus or the metro to your destination. Handy metro service runs to city centers from Lisbon (red line) or Porto (violet line E). Faro’s airport has a quality bus service operated by Vamus Algarve. The Aerobus runs into Faro and also to Albufeira, Portimão and Lagos.\n\nInstead of using a rental car, opt to take the train or bus © Andrei Bortnikau / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDitch the car and get around by train or bus\n\nThe high cost of rental cars coupled with soaring fuel prices can make for a pricey trip to Portugal. You can save money and lower your carbon footprint by traveling the country by train and bus. Portugal’s rail line connects major cities from Valença in the north down to Faro in the south, running through Porto, Coimbra and Lisbon. Portugal’s bus network helps fill in the gaps and connects smaller towns.\n\nTicket prices are reasonable. For instance, the second-class train fare from Lisbon to Lagos (a 4.5-hour journey) is around €25, which is not much more than the price you’d pay on tolls alone by taking the A2 to get there.\n\nVisit from October to April to save on lodging\n\nIn spring and autumn, you’ll generally find pleasant weather in Portugal, with blooming wildflowers in March and April and changing leaves in October in some parts of the country. You’ll also notice thinner crowds and lower rates when it comes to accommodation. Prices are typically around 25% off high season rates.\n\nYou can save even more by visiting from November to February. This is the cheapest time of the year to visit Portugal, and many hotels slash their rates by 50% or more. Just be sure to pack for the weather adequately. Bring a rain jacket, scarf and warm layers for Porto and other destinations in the north. In the south, you’ll still find plenty of sunshine in the Algarve, with mild temperatures for outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\n\nMake lunch your biggest meal\n\nMany restaurants in Portugal offer good-value lunch specials. Always ask if there's a menu do dia (fixed menu) or prato do dia (daily special). Even high-end restaurants typically have lower-priced lunch menus.\n\nIn the evening, you can forego conventional dining for a picnic in the park, at a viewpoint or overlooking the seaside. A loaf of fresh bread, cheese, olives and a bottle of wine makes the perfect accompaniment to watching the sunset.\n\nConsider staying in a hostel\n\nPortugal has many of Europe’s most stylish hostels, some of which are set in historic buildings and feature upscale amenities like roof terraces, art-filled lounges or swimming pools. Rates start at around €22 per night ­– big savings over a traditional hotel. Many hostels also offer budget-friendly activities, like free walking tours or pub crawls and free or low-cost rentals of bikes, surfboards and other gear. Some even host communal dinners, which are a great way to meet other people while saving money in the process.\n\nEven beach destinations like the Algarve have fabulous deals © wundervisuals / Getty Images\n\nPlan your itinerary around less expensive destinations\n\nDon’t rule out visiting Portugal’s most appealing cities. Places like Lisbon and Porto have a wide range of accommodations, and you can find excellent prices if you’re willing to stay outside the center (or in a more centrally located hostel). You can also find inexpensive activities (free museums, neighborhood exploring), and you won’t spend much on transportation.\n\nThe Algarve also has good deals if you know where to look. If you don’t want to stay in a hostel, you’ll find some of the best prices in Faro and Portimão. The Algarve is also among the best places for budget-friendly activities: scenic walks along headland trails above the beach and frolicking in the waves won’t cost you anything.\n\nDine in a tasca, adega and other local haunts\n\nNo matter where you roam, you can eat well in Portugal without breaking the bank if you know where to look. Among the key places to seek out is the tasca, an old-fashioned eatery (often with a loyal local following) that serves up excellent daily specials (which are not always listed on the menu) as well as classic staples like bacalhau (codfish) dished up many different ways. Slightly more convivial are adegas, usually decorated with wine casks and serving up hearty, inexpensive meals along with carafes of very affordable wine.\n\nPicnicking with ingredients from a local market is a must in Portugal – and also a cheaper alternative to a restaurant © T.W. van Urk / Shutterstock\n\nBecome a picnic expert\n\nSprinkled throughout Portugal, you’ll find mercados (markets), where you can browse for cheeses, charcuterie, baked goods and other fare. When no market is near, head to the nearest supermarket, where you can also score Portuguese produce at rock-bottom prices. With a bit of strategic planning, you can make a fun day out of your food shopping and sightseeing, stopping at a scenic spot for a picnic along the way.\n\nPlan your days around free and low-cost activities\n\nSome of the best things to do in Portugal won’t set you back much. A trip on a tram around Lisbon or Porto offers a great view of dynamic neighborhoods without the cost or hassle of taking a guided tour. Many churches are free to visit, as are parks and miradouros (viewpoints). Be sure to budget in downtime at cafes, where you can linger over inexpensive drinks while making plans for the day or evening ahead.\n\nIn the Algarve, you can design a day of beach hopping, followed by sunset viewing at one of the region's fabled overlooks (like the Cabo de São Vicente). You can also explore the islands of the eastern Algarve, reachable by inexpensive ferries from Faro, Olhão and Tavira.\n\nAt some restaurants in Portugal, a glass of wine can cost as much as a bottle of water © Alexander Spatari / Getty Images\n\nOrder the house wine\n\nPortugal has some excellent, affordable wines you can enjoy over dinner by ordering the house wine (vinho da casa). You can order by the glass or a carafe (jarro), ranging in size from 0.25 liters (around two glasses) to 0.75 liters. At many family-run eateries, a glass of house wine costs about the same as a bottle of water.\n\nTake a walk\n\nMountains and rugged coastlines make a memorable backdrop to one of Portugal’s greatest free outings: hitting the trail. You can plan your whole trip around a famous multi-day walk – like the Rota Vicentina that passes along sea cliffs and over deserted beaches on Portugal’s southwest coast. Or you can base near one of Portugal’s nature reserves and go on a day hike over craggy hillsides, beneath medieval ruins and through old stone villages – all features you’ll find in the Parque Nacional Peneda-Gerês in Portugal’s northeast.\n\nDaily costs\n\nHostel room: €22-35\n\nBasic room for two: €50-80\n\nSelf-catering apartment (including Airbnb): from €80\n\nLisbon metro ticket: €1.50\n\nMeia de leite (café latte): €2-3\n\nBifana (pork cutlet sandwich): €3-5\n\nDinner for two: from €30\n\nBeer at the bar: €2-4.50",
    "Tourism workers reaching end of their rope": "58% of tourism employees seek to quit sector in less than five years\n\nPortugal’s tourism sector is facing yet another challenge when it comes to its workforce.\n\nWhile the sector’s struggles to hire workers have been widely reported, a new study has found that most employees working in the tourism sector in Portugal are planning to leave the sector in less than five years.\n\nAccording to Expresso newspaper, the study by temporary work company Eurofirms has found that 58% of current tourism workers are looking to find work in another sector.\n\nThe study was carried out in May 2022 and is based on the answers of over 500 tourism workers, who also explained which issues are leading them to want to abandon the sector: 61% blame it on casual labour; 41.8% say they are unable to balance their professional life with their family life due to the hectic schedules; and 54% say they earn no more than €800 in monthly gross wage.\n\n“This portrayal of the sector helps explains the difficulties that it has faced when it comes to hiring and maintaining workers. Tourism is known for its difficult schedules, low wages and temporary employment,” Expresso points out.\n\nThe Algarve tourism sector’s shortage of workers remains one of the sector’s biggest challenges, Hélder Martins from the Algarve hoteliers association (AHETA) told the Resident last week.\n\n“We are already working on this; meetings are being held and efforts are being made to bring workers from other countries to Portugal,” said Martins.\n\n“But there are issues with this strategy which remain. These people need a place to live, and there is simply not enough affordable accommodation in the Algarve,” he said, adding that hotels and tourist establishments cannot afford to cover their rents.\n\nAnd while the summer of 2022 may go down as one of the best – if not the best – the Algarve’s tourism sector has ever seen, businesses are seeing their survival at stake with the rising costs of everything from food to energy.\n\nSome hotels are seeing their energy bills more than double – increases which the hotelier boss warns could force some businesses to “close down for good”.\n\nBy Michael Bruxo\n\nmichael.bruxo@portugalresident.com",
    "In and out of Spain and Portugal: a road trip up the Guadiana River": "Strapped into a harness, hands clamped to a metal bar, I flew – at terrifying speed along 720 metres of zipwire suspended over the Rio Guadiana – from Spain into Portugal.\n\nI’d taken a boat from Alcoutim (on the Algarve side of the river) to Sanlúcar de Guadiana (in Andalucía). From there I was driven up to a launch platform on a rocky summit with jaw-dropping views of both countries. Did I scream? As I hurtled towards Portugal, I tried to focus on those views: two dazzling white villages, the wide green river below, a castelo on one side, a castillo on the other. It was all over in less than a minute, but thanks to the international time difference I gained an hour.\n\nThe LimiteZero experience (the world’s only cross-border zipline) was just one of the high points of a meandering road trip along the Rio Guadiana – the long river that rises in the Spanish province of Albacete, slips over the Portuguese border near Elvas in Alentejo and heads south to the Bay of Cádiz, on the Algarve’s eastern edge.\n\nLimiteZero, a unique cross-border zipline, spans Spain and Portugal. Photograph: Luís Costa\n\nDriving a hired Fiat 500, my husband Dave and I stuck mostly to the Portuguese side of the river, taking six days to do what amounts to a three-and-a-half-hour drive. For much of the route, the river forms a natural boundary between Spain and Portugal; a trail of castles and fortresses glare at each other from opposite riverbanks. Too many castles for one trip, perhaps, but there are lots of other things to see: salt marshes, walled towns and ancient river ports, lakes, river beaches, heavenly night skies and the wild landscapes of Alentejo’s Guadiana Valley national park, where the river squeezes into craggy ravines and kestrels and golden eagles circle over the waterfall at Pulo do Lobo (or Wolf’s Leap).\n\nA detour took us to the eerie ruins of the Sao Domingos pyrite mines, and later we pressed on to Elvas – a little-known border town with world heritage status – just to see the remarkable seven-kilometre Amoreira Aqueduct, which took more than 100 years to build (from 1537).\n\nThe 16th-century Amoreira Aqueduct in Elvas, Portugal, is a Unesco world heritage site. Photograph: Mauricio Abreu/Alamy\n\nAt the start of our trip we rolled into Vila Real de Santo António, a pleasant border town on the Guadiana estuary with wide marina promenades and pine-forest walks that lead to the dunes of Praia Santo António – one of the fabulously sandy and often-uncrowded beaches of the eastern Algarve.\n\n\n\nThe Spanish can nip across on a ferry from nearby Ayamonte – to shop (for towels, I am told), eat fresh tuna, garlic prawns and codfish stew at seafood cafes or sit under orange trees on Praça Marquês de Pombal. The town’s market square is at the heart of a masterplan dreamed up by the Marquês de Pombal, who oversaw the reconstruction of Lisbon – and then Vila Real – after devastating earthquakes in the 18th century.\n\nThe walled, pedestrian streets and houses of Monsaraz are built of flinty metamorphic rock (wear sensible shoes)\n\nThe town’s later prosperity was built on tinned fish, an industry that more or less died in the 1960s, leaving it to look unloved. Redundant canning factories at the Spanish end of town still lie derelict, but the centre’s “Pombaline” architecture has been spruced up in recent years.\n\n\n\nOn the square, the Pousada de Vila Real de Santo António, open since July 2021, is a delightful base, a collection of restored 18th-century buildings: a former kindergarten, the headquarters of the local Communist party and part of the bank next door, with pools and roof-terrace views of the Guadiana estuary (doubles from €130).\n\nThe Spanish come by ferry to visit Praça Marquês de Pombal in the Algarve. Photograph: Lewis Oliver/Alamy\n\nNext stop was Castro Marim. Just a few minutes’ drive upriver, this ancient river port sits between the Guadiana International Bridge (a towering, cable-stayed number visible for miles) and a marshy nature reserve rich with birdlife (flamingos come and go). There’s a medieval castle with views across the marshes to Spain, but the town is best known for salt – a natural wetland resource which has been mined in the region for aeons. Artisan salt panner Jorge Raiado offers tours and tastings at his family’s Salmarim salinas (salt pans) – white with sun-dried crystals which are harvested without machinery or chemicals.\n\nOur phones made erratic switches between Spanish and Portuguese time as we followed the river on a back road to Alcoutim. The home of the LimiteZero zipline sits among banks of orange, olive and almond groves and gardens of figs and apricots on one of the loveliest stretches of the Guadiana. The Praia Fluvial do Pego Fundo river beach is an oasis of cool green water and soft white sand imported from the coast. There’s also a castle (first built by the Moors, reconstructed in the 14th century and again 100 years later) and an archaeological museum displaying Roman pottery and a collection of medieval stone board games. Sanlúcar, the town’s Spanish twin, is five minutes away by boat.\n\nIn Sanlúcar del Guadiana, Spain, with Portugal in the background. Photograph: Roger Lee/Alamy\n\nThe place is popular with walkers, who come here to start (or finish) the Via Algarviana trail, a 300km footpath that runs from Cape St Vincent to Alcoutim. The 165km Grande Rota do Guadiana (or GR15) from Vila Real to Mértola also passes through.\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of our brand new magazine, Saturday.

Photograph: Roger Lee/Alamy\n\nAs we drive north, the river swings away from the Spanish border into Alentejo countryside, meeting Mértola on the fringe of the national park. A labyrinth of cobbled streets, cats and crumbling buildings, the little town tumbles down to river wharfs and jetties from the rugged walls of yet another castle. Since pre-Roman times, it has served as a Gaudiana trading post, particularly important to the Moorish rulers, who shipped grains and minerals downriver to the Atlantic ports. Beneath the castle walls, the pretty whitewashed church of Nossa Senhora da Anunciação dates from the 12th century and was originally a mosque – one of the few relics of Portugal’s 500-year Islamic rule. For five-star views of Mertola from the opposite side of the river, budget hotel Quinta do Vau has doubles from €40 room-only.\n\nAnother hour’s drive took us north to Monsaraz, a beguiling town on a hump of schist that rises from the plains of Alentejo’s montada – a vast area of holm oaks and cork forests, vineyards, farms and megaliths. Its walled, pedestrian streets and whitewashed houses are built of flinty metamorphic rock (wear sensible shoes) and offer dreamy views of the largest artificial lake in Portugal, formed by the Alqueva Dam.\n\nThe castle and bell tower in Monsaraz in Alentejo. Photograph: Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images\n\nLater we turned our gaze to the night sky. The Alqueva region is the first in the world to be recognised as a Starlight Tourism Destination, thanks to clear skies, a sparse population and a collective drive to keep the lights low at night. Set in forest on the edge of the Alqueva lake, Montimerso Skyscape Country House has roomy suites and generous terraces with views of the montada and deck chairs for stargazing (from €200 B&B).\n\nWe were lucky to choose a moonless, cloudless evening for a late-night stargazing session at the “official” Dark Sky observatory, in a former primary school in tiny Cumeada.\n\nIn a courtyard we stood and stared into space while our guide picked out Pegasus, Taurus, Auriga and the Milky Way. Andromeda, a mere 2.5 million light years away, is, he told us, the farthest we humans can see with the naked eye. We could see it here.\n\nThen it’s down to earth, back the way we came. I’d like to do it all again – maybe on the Spanish side of the river – though I am in no hurry to repeat the zipline experience.\n\nThe trip was provided by Visit Algarve.

    "Portugal’s Next Great Beach Vacation Destination: Ericeira": "The new Aethos Ericeira hotel Francisco Nogueira\n\nTo be fair, Portugal’s Ericeira, about an hour northwest of Lisbon, isn’t exactly some brand new discovery. It’s been on the radar for a while now—at least for surfers. Its waves are more accessible than the gigantic ones up the coast at Nazaré, but reliably interesting for a range of skill levels, which is why it’s Europe’s only “surf reserve.” But while the town itself retains a lot of the charm of the fishing village that it once was, its services have tended toward hostels, surf schools and cafés serving açaí and quinoa bowls.\n\nThat changed this summer with the opening of two new five-star hotels in the general surroundings of the town—not walking distance but within easy reach if you come with a car. (Call them Ericeir-ish.) Surfers are still more than welcome of course, but they also offer quite a lot to people who don’t care about chasing waves. And, joining with the existing hotel You and the Sea, they’re set to change the appeal and perception of Ericeira.\n\nTo be sure, Ericeira is unlikely to become the new Comporta, at least not anytime soon. But now it’s turning into a place that promises its own brand of slow travel. It’s a destination for people who appreciate nature (not just beaches), stylish design, quality materials and good food, but without the glamour or the need to see and be seen.\n\nImmerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe first hotel to change the perception and position of Ericeira is Immerso (as in “immersion in nature”), which opened earlier, and which is built into a hillside to help it blend into its surroundings and to ensure that each of the 37 rooms has an excellent ocean view, especially at sunset. In fact, the television is to the side of the bed, making it a bit awkward to watch—the idea is to look straight ahead, out the window, instead.\n\nThe design, by Portuguese architect Tiago Silva Dias and designers Alexandra Almeida d’Eca (one of the founders of the hotel) and Bárbara Neto, is simple, with concrete floors, woven rugs in natural colors, organic shapes, artisan furnishings and textures from the land and sea. They worked a number of artists on items for the rooms, indoor lounge, long terrace and pool deck and fire pit.\n\nThe spa is more ambitious than it needs to be, with heat and wet areas, three treatment rooms and a menu of services based on the vegan, natural skincare brand Vinoble Cosmetics. The massage list ranges from Japanese shiatsu to hot stones to Ayurveda.\n\nEmme restaurant at Immerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe restaurant, Emme, also takes its cues from the hotel owners’ conscious, local and natural philosophy. Dogma aside, its quite good, with a brief but tasty menu, a lively relaxed dining room and snappy service. The consulting chef is Alexandre Silva, who holds a Michelin star at his Lisbon restaurant Loco and earned a reputation for his excellent cooking with fire at Lisbon’s Fogo and the Alentejo’s Craveiral FarmTable.\n\nExecuted here by resident chef Paulo Pedro (ex-Fortaleza do Guincho), the menu is strong on local fish and seafood—the trio of oysters is an excellent starter, and the simple main courses are tasty—with some vegetables from the organic kitchen garden and saline-tasting plants from the sea mixed in. The spread for the breakfast buffet is well above average. When it opens later this autumn, Emme on Fire will be an outdoor, communal dining experience based on food cooked over an open fire—what they’re calling a “medievally festive” experience.\n\nBy coincidence, Immerso was joined last week by Aethos Ericeira, an unrelated hotel that also happens to prioritize consciousness, nature, community, wellness and design. On top of a 130-foot-high cliff in a nature reserve, it has spectacular natural light and lovely views over the Atlantic. It’s part of the the Aethos group (after the Greek “ethos,” or characteristic spirit of a culture), a collection of members clubs and boutique hotels in Europe that was founded by a pair of international serial entrepreneurs who want to create a “global family of conscious explorers.”\n\nThe lounge at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAt the Ericeira hotel, which was designed by the Barcelona studio Astet and Portuguese architect Luís Pedra Silva, that means 50 suites and rooms that blend natural tones, materials and textures with the clean lines and soft simplicity of modernist design. The premium rooms have glorious views over the ocean, sometimes with private terraces.\n\nAt the restaurant, Onda (“wave”), chef Afonso Blazquez and his team focus on shareable, sustainable fish and seafood from the surrounding coast, with plenty of vegetables in the mix. The dinner menu includes dishes like asparagus with fresh green curry, bergamot gel and sourdough croutons, and squid “noodles” with pickled mushrooms and dashi. The oysters here are excellent as well.\n\nIn line with the Aethos philosophy, there’s a strong wellness component, including a spa that uses organic products from Sweden’s Under the Skin brand, a gym with expert trainers, yoga classes with world-class instructors, a meditation deck overlooking the Atlantic and a stone-trimmed saltwater pool. But this Ericeira—and surfing checks quite a few of those same wellness boxes. (I dare you to think about anything other than surfing when you’re doing it.)\n\nA guest room at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAnd Aethos being a five-star hotel, it has its own luxury take on the sport. It has a dedicated surf concierge, onsite storage facilities for boards and wetsuits, and onsite rentals. It also has a relationship with Joana Andrade, Portugal’s first female big wave surfer and champion several times over. She also started Portugal’s first female surf school in 1998, and continues to coach professionals as well as beginners.\n\nAethos guests of any skill level can book a private session with her and accomplish quite a lot in terms of skills and especially confidence in a short time. It’s a luxury version of surfing for sure, and also very much in line with the new direction of Ericeira.",
    "Portugal reaffirms ‘total’ commitment to NATO": "Portugal reaffirms ‘total’ commitment to NATO. Portugal is wholly committed to NATO and would always comply with the Alliance’s resolutions when necessary, President Marcelo Rebelo De Sousa said on Tuesday.\n\n“On behalf of the Portuguese people, I reaffirm Portugal’s total commitment as a member of NATO, as a founder of NATO, wherever and whenever it is needed,” said Rebelo de Sousa at the Air Force Air Command in Monsanto (Lisbon). The president delivered his speech in English as part of the commemorative ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of NATO’s Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre (JALLC).\n\nAt the ceremony – which was also attended by Defence Minister Helena Carreiras – the president said that Portugal maintains its commitments to help the “brave Ukrainian people” and “the Baltic countries, Romania, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea, in improving information, cyber-attack prevention actions, and geostrategic analysis”.\n\nThe president also stressed that it was precisely because of this commitment that Portugal was “one of the last – if not the last [country] – to leave Afghanistan”.\n\n“We remain ready and steadfast, with our soldiers, in the most difficult battlefields, on all continents, but especially in Europe,” he stressed.\n\nThe president indicated that “in recent decades, more than ever”, NATO has become “much more than an Alliance of States or an Alliance of peoples”.\n\n“NATO is a crucial guarantee of peace, security and respect for the Charter of Nations, [it is a guarantee] of freedom and human dignity,” he said.\n\nJust before unveiling a plaque to mark the 20th anniversary of the JALLC, Rebelo de Sousa stressed that it “portrays the lifetime of the JALLC, but also symbolises the last 20 years of peace and friendship between the countries of the Alliance”\n\nAddressing the Supreme Commander of NATO’s Allied Command Transformation, General Philippe Lavigne, who attended the ceremony, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa wished him a “welcome” to Portugal.\n\n“You are in a reliable, friendly and warm country, which shares the values that distinguish democracy from dictatorship, freedom from oppression, peace from war,” he added.\n\n(Lusa.pt)",

    "Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel undergoes complete refurbishment": "Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel has recently undergone a complete refurbishment inspired by the landscapes of the region\n\nVila Valverde Design & Country Hotel opened in 2004 in Praia da Luz, built on a fully renovated 19th-century manor house, on a five-hectare property with an enchanting view over the bay. The orchards, the spring, the small lake with carps and the spacious gardened areas reveal a building with only 15 rooms, but a whole range of services that make this place special, far from large tourist centres, but very close to the best that the Algarve has to offer.\n\nArchitect Mário Martins was responsible for transforming the farm into one of the six five-star rural hotels in Portugal, opting for a play of colours, straight lines for the furniture and the functionality of the spaces.\n\nThis year a new challenge was set, and Nini Andrade Silva was the interior designer chosen by the owner, Luís Tavares, to redecorate the entire hotel unit, with an investment of half a million euros. “She is a professional with a proven track record all over the world and she accepted this challenge. We usually renovate the property every two years, because we know it’s necessary to keep up with progress. But, we felt that this was the moment to make the atmosphere even more refined, intimate and exclusive,” he explains.\n\nThe beaches and mountains of the Algarve served as the motto for the transformation, where the once bright colours gave way to soft and neutral tones that can be seen in the finishes, furniture and decoration to bring the surrounding landscape into the hotel. This is a perfect symbiosis to provide an even calmer and more relaxing stay, which was replicated in all the common areas, the rooms and the exterior area of the main building. But there was more to the renovations than just the aesthetics.\n\nThe traditional buffet breakfast is now served à la carte, “so that guests have a more personalised offer that meets their morning cravings”. For dinner, chef João Branco is in charge of the restaurant menu. Featuring traditional Portuguese food “with a very modern twist”, the menu also caters to vegan and vegetarian preferences. Vila Verde also has a great wine cellar filled with Portuguese wines.\n\nAccording to Luís Tavares, the aim is “to give guests the opportunity to have everything available in one place”. In addition to the outdoor and indoor heated pools, another of the hotel’s secrets is the wellness centre, with a massage room, Turkish and Japanese baths, sauna and even a solarium.\n\nThere are dozens of treatments carried out by the hands of physiotherapists and masseurs, from relaxing massages, lymphatic drainage and foot reflexology to peelings, masks, thermotherapy and light therapy.\n\nGiven the hotel’s privileged location, surrounded by various golf courses, all guests can enjoy this sport and choose one of the six courses where they would like to improve their skills: Palmares (Odiáxere), Boavista Golf, (Lagos), Espiche Golf (Lagos), Santo António Golf (Vila do Bispo), Salgados Golf (Guia) and Álamos Golf (Portimão). The team can also organise tennis matches, bike rides, horse riding, sailing, diving or excursions to various parts of the country and even Spain.\n\nAnother aspect where this hotel stands out is its concern for sustainability. For several years now, Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel has been honoured with the Green Key for Sustainable Tourism, a certificate awarded by the European Union. “There’s no plastic anywhere, we have 350 solar panels that allow us to produce around 70% of all our electricity and we have a water mine. We have a vegetable garden where we grow all the vegetables we use at the hotel and several fruit trees (lemon, orange, peach and fig trees). We don’t use chlorine in our swimming pools and the surplus water is used for irrigation,” explains the owner.\n\nFocusing on well-being, attention to detail and personalised services, the hotel can accommodate up to 30 guests at the same time, and children under the age of 10 are not allowed.\n\nBy MARIA SIMIRIS",
    "Plate invites Portugal to support Indonesia become ITU Council member": "We know that Portugal is part of the European Union (EU), (so we have a meeting with Portugal since) we need allies from the members of EU (to support our candidacy).\n\nJakarta (ANTARA) - Communication and Informatics Minister Johnny G. Plate invited the Government of Portugal to support Indonesia to become a member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Council for the 2023-2026 period, representing the Asia-Pacific region.\"We know that Portugal is part of the European Union (EU), (so we have a meeting with Portugal since) we need allies from the members of EU (to support our candidacy),” the Indonesian minister remarked in a press release on Sunday during Plate's working visit to Portugal.Plate affirmed that his invitation was welcomed by the representative of the Government of Portugal, and there was a high potential for the country to support Indonesia at the ITU Council member election, especially considering the sound relations between both nations.\"Hopefully, they will support us. Considering his gestures and commitments, Minister Mario (Campolargo) highly supports our candidacy,” Plate said after meeting with Portuguese Secretary of State for Digitalization and Modernization of Administration Affairs Mario Campolargo to discuss cooperation potentials in the digital sector.Furthermore, he stated that by becoming the ITU Council member, Indonesia would be able to propose more fair use of telecommunication and information technology, such as the satellite orbit slots and communication device spectrum arrangements, for all countries, including for developed, developing, and least developed nations.Indonesia has pushed for three agendas in its candidacy: capacity building, women's empowerment, as well as connecting the unconnected.In addition to the candidacy as the ITU Council member, Indonesia strives to gather support for the candidacy of an Indonesian telecommunication expert, Meiditomo Sutyarjoko, as a member of the ITU Radio Regulation Board (RRB).Hence, since mid-2022, the Communication and Informatics Ministry had been actively garnering support for the success of the candidacies.Numerous bilateral meetings were conducted with various representatives from several countries, such as Germany, Japan, and Portugal, to bolster international support for Indonesia’s candidacy.The attempt is expected to garner many votes for Indonesia at the ITU Council member election that will be held in coincidence with the implementation of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 in Bucharest, Romania, from September 26 to October 14, 2022.",
    "Liverpool news: Diogo Jota on Portugal scoresheet as Reds record prediction comes to light": "A number of Liverpool players are away on international duty, with Jurgen Klopp's side preparing to kick-start their season when they return to Premier League action in October\n\nAfter a difficult start to the 2022-23 season, Liverpool's players have the distraction of international football before a busy October.\n\nThe Reds have won just two of their first six Premier League games to sit outside the top four, some way adrift of last season's champions Manchester City. Their final game before the break brought some relief, with Joel Matip delivering a late winner against Ajax in the Champions League, but there's still work to be done.\n\nInternational duty forms just part of the discussion with less than a week to go until the league meeting with Brighton. Here are the latest news lines from Merseyside.\n\nJota among the goals for Portugal\n\nLiverpool star Diogo Jota was on the scoresheet for Portugal as they crushed the Czech Republic in the UEFA Nations League. The 25-year-old scored his country's fourth goal, with Diogo Dalot hitting a brace and Dalot's Man Utd teammate Bruno Fernandes also on target.\n\nThe 4-0 victory in Prague puts Fernando Santos' team in a prime position to reach the Nations League finals. They host Spain in Braga on Tuesday with only a point needed to top their group, after La Roja were beaten at home by Switzerland.\n\nIt was Jota's first goal of the season, after a spell on the sidelines through injury. He has played just three times for Liverpool this term, with his first start coming against Ajax.\n\nRead more here.\n\nBellingham's price tag\n\nJude Bellingham could be available for less than the nine-figure price previously quoted, as long as any suitor pays Borussia Dortmund's asking price in one lump sum. England midfielder Bellingham has been linked with the Reds for some time, though a number of other Premier League clubs have shown an interest.\n\nWhere will Bellingham end up? Have your say in the comments section\n\nIt had earlier been reported that it could take as much as £150m to land the teenager, who joined Dortmund from Birmingham City in 2020. However, according to The Sun, a single £83m payment could be enough.\n\nWhile Liverpool remain in the mix, Manchester City reportedly consider themselves to be the front-runners. The Premier League holders, who currently sit second in the table, signed Bellingham's former Dortmund colleagues Erling Haaland and Manuel Akanji over the summer.\n\nRead more here.\n\nLawrenson's Liverpool prediction\n\nMark Lawrenson predicted a remarkable 159 games without defeat for Liverpool before leaving his post at the BBC. The pundit, who played for the Reds more than 300 times during his career, has been consistent in his faith in his former club.\n\nThe ex-Ireland international has left the BBC after a long association, including Match of the Day spots and written columns. Over that time, he was regularly tasked with predicting Premier League results, and the sight of a Liverpool loss was rare to see.\n\nHe last predicted a loss for Liverpool back in 2016, as they took on West Bromwich Albion early on in Jurgen Klopp's tenure.

    "PM announces 1,100 more officers to join PJ police by 2026": "António Costa says PJ police will have resources to “continue doing what it has always done”\n\nPortugal’s prime minister announced on Monday that 1,100 more permanent officers will be joining the Judicial Police force (PJ) until 2026, strengthening the force’s divisions of inspection and criminal investigation, specialist forensic police and special security.\n\nAntónio Costa made the announcement in the final part of his speech during a ceremony to welcome 97 new PJ inspectors in Lisbon.\n\n“We have to ensure continuity and predictability in the management of the PJ. On Tuesday, an ordinance will be published by the minister of justice and the minister of finance (Fernando Medina) defining the multiannual framework of admissions to the PJ until 2026,” Costa said.\n\nFollowing this step, according to the prime minister, “750 more staff will enter the criminal investigation and inspection career by 2026.”\n\n“In the career of forensic police specialists there will be 250 more staff and in the special security career there will be 100 more staff,” added António Costa, after hearing the general prosecutor of the Republic, Lucília Gago, and the interior minister, José Luís Carneiro, among other heads of security, defence and intelligence institutions.\n\nAs a result of this reinforcement, the prime-minister said that it was possible to conclude that the PJ “will continue to be equipped with the human resources it needs to continue doing what it has always done, with more or less resources, with greater dedication and with greater shared effort among all”.\n\nIn his speech, António Costa pointed out that, since 2019, until now, “there has been a reinforcement of 355 staff members in the criminal investigation career of the PJ alone”.\n\n“It is absolutely essential to continue investing in internal security and, specifically, in the PJ. This investment is in legislative tools, improvements in facilities, better resources for forensics, for the laboratory and in the investigation systems,” he said.\n\nHowever, immediately afterwards, the leader of the executive left a warning: “But none of this works without a central element that has to do with the human resources of the PJ”, he added.\n\nSource: Lusa",
    "Spain agrees not to cut water to Portugal": "Spain will maintain the flow of water from rivers to Portugal and respect the flows agreed bilaterally, according to the delegate of the Spanish Government in the region of Castile and Leon, Virgínia Barcones.\n\nBy TPN/Lusa, in News, Portugal, Europe · 22 Sep 2022, 18:03 · 3 Comments\n\n\"Spain is a serious state that abides by the international agreements it signs,\" Virgínia Barcones said, in response to questions from journalists in the Spanish city of León, quoted by the EFE news agency.\n\nVirgínia Barcones recalled that this matter is regulated by the Albufeira Convention, signed by Portugal and Spain 24 years ago, and that the country must fulfil the agreement.\n\nOn Monday, around 3,000 farmers from the provinces of León, Zamora and Salamanca demonstrated in the city centre of León to demand an end to the release of water to Portugal under the Albufeira agreement.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Portuguese Minister for the Environment and Climate Action said that the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) holds “permanent meetings” with Spanish counterparts on drought within the scope of existing conventions between the two countries.\n\nDifficult year\n\n“Portugal is having a very difficult year, Spain is having a very difficult year. We are aware that both countries are being affected by the drought issue. There have been permanent meetings between the APA and Spanish counterparts regarding the monitoring of responsibilities under the existing conventions. We will always defend our country for the best use and respect for conventions”, said Duarte Cordeiro, during a hearing in parliament.\n\nThe minister said that “the existing difficulties on either side will be evaluated”, recalling that in the summer there was always “a very complicated situation regarding the Tagus”.\n\n“We had the opportunity to draw Spain's attention to this, to reinforce the flows”, he added, noting that, from the point of view of the Albufeira Convention, there are daily, monthly and annual flows, and “short-term flows have been fulfilled”.",
    "Pregnant woman’s death causes outrage over crisis-hit Portugal health service": "The death of a pregnant woman who could not receive treatment in Lisbon’s main hospital because of a lack of capacity has been met with outrage in Portugal, where a months-long health crisis has shut emergency services across the country and put maternity care under extreme pressure.\n\nThe 34-year-old woman was admitted to Lisbon’s Santa Maria hospital on 23 August with respiratory problems and high blood pressure. Owing to a lack of space in the neonatal service, she was transferred to another hospital, but she died after a heart attack in the ambulance.\n\nHer baby, born at 30 weeks weighing 772g (1lb 11oz), survived.\n\nThe health minister, Marta Temido, in office since 2018 and throughout the Covid pandemic, resigned this week after the case came to light. She said in a short statement sent to the Guardian that she “no longer had conditions to stay in office”. The prime minister, António Costa, said the woman’s death was “the last straw” for Temido.\n\nMarta Temido said she ‘no longer had conditions to stay in office’. Photograph: Julien Warnand/EPA\n\nSanta Maria hospital said the patient had been stabilised, and it described transfers between regional hospitals as a “frequent procedure”. It told CNN that the woman’s death was “neither foreseeable nor expected in this situation”.\n\nAn investigation has been opened. The government’s general inspection of health activities (IGAS) is also examining the death of a baby on 9 June in Caldas da Rainha, north of Lisbon, after there were no obstetricians to assist the mother when she went into labour. On 22 August another pregnant woman had to be transferred twice between hospitals, travelling a total of 95 miles (150km) while in labour.\n\nNewspaper front pages have called Portugal’s formerly highly rated national health service (SNS) the “national disease service” and the health ministry the “ministry of pretend” after shutdowns left thousands without access to care in the virtually free public health system.\n\nThe crisis is a result of decades-long structural problems including low wages, outdated equipment and inefficient bureaucracy, said Dr Gustavo Tato Borges, the president of the National Association of Public Health Doctors.\n\nSalaries have not changed since 2009. A specialist physician has a monthly starting wage of €1,853 (£1,603) and a nurse €1,200. “There is no lack of doctors to fulfil the needs of the SNS, but rather a lack of doctors willing to subject themselves to working in the SNS,” Borges said. “The SNS does not have the capacity to attract doctors and ensure they stay for a long time.”\n\nWhile the number of doctors in Portugal has almost doubled in the last 20 years, almost half work in the private sector. It is estimated that a third of the population have health insurance, an almost twofold increase in the last 16 years, as waiting times have increased in the public health system.\n\nChild mortality is at its highest rate since 2018 and the third highest in the last decade. Portugal has an excess mortality rate of 23.9%, four times above the EU average.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Portugal’s health authority returns to ‘recommending’ use of masks in closed spaces": "Recommendation is not enforceable\n\nPortugal’s DGS national health authority has returned to recommending the wearing of masks in pharmacies, on public transport, at airports, sea terminals, underground and train networks, according to its guideline “Covid-19: Adequacy of public health measures“, now updated.\n\nThe change has been published on the health authority’s website which explains “the guideline has been updated according to “the current epidemiological situation and the best scientific evidence”.\n\nFor the time being at least, the government’s decree to end the compulsory use of masks in public passenger transport, taxis, TVDE (mobile ride hailing app taxis), aeroplanes and pharmacies remains in force. In other words, the DGS recommendation is not obligatory.\n\nSays Lusa, the recommendation refers to “any person over 10 years of age whenever they are in closed environments, in crowds, namely when using public passenger transport, including air transport, as well as when transporting passengers in taxis or TVDE”.\n\nThe use of masks is also recommended on platforms and covered access to public transport, including airports, maritime terminals and metro and train networks, pharmacies and “in confirmed cases of Covid-19, in all circumstances, whenever [people] are away from their isolation site until the 10th day after the date of onset of symptoms or positive test”.\n\nAgain ‘for now’ the recommendation excludes schools, which have only just ‘returned’ from a three month summer break.\n\nAccording to Lusa, “the DGS also advises the most vulnerable people, namely those with chronic diseases or states of immunosuppression at increased risk for severe Covid-19, to use a mask whenever they are in a “situation of increased risk of exposure”.\n\nAccording to the guideline, the mandatory use of mask is maintained in health service establishments, in residential or care facilities or home support services for vulnerable people, elderly or disabled people, as well as in National Care Network units. This obligation extends to contacts with confirmed cases of Covid-19 for 14 days after the last exposure date.\n\nThe DGS website has no information on the multiple studies that have concluded there are very few benefits to mask wearing. In fact, in a number of situations, they can make things worse.\n\nFor links to these studies, see below:\n\nhttps://www.cureus.com/articles/93826-correlation-between-mask-compliance-and-covid-19-outcomes-in-europe\n\nhttps://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817\n\nhttps://centerforneurologyandspine.com/do-masks-work-see-the-review-of-over-150-studies-below/\n\nThe bottom line is that mask-wearing does not bring obvious positive results – and – as has now been universally recognised – contributes to other problems, not least the inability for young children to learn/ develop vital communication skills.\n\nA working paper prepared for the Cato Institute has explained that masks can potentially accelerate disease spread. “For example, the auditory difficulties engendered by masks combined with their obfuscation of lip movements could cause wearers to talk more loudly (which yields greater numbers of droplets), lean to the side of plastic barriers while speaking, or approach more closely to hear or be heard, undermining the reductions in droplet movement that masks provide. This concern is particularly relevant for the aged or others who have impaired hearing and who may also be at higher risk of severe COVID19 infection.”\n\nnatasha.donn@portugalresident.com",

Friday’s stunning 2-0 defeat from Japan shows the injury-laden Americans have ways to go before thinking their floor is higher than other nations’ ceilings.\n\nThe lone MLS tilt this week is a big one.\n\n\n\nThe Seattle Sounders are next on the Western Conference’s cutting board in terms of playoff elimination, but it still feels odd to think they’re incapable of pulling a rabbit out of the hat and surging back up.

    "Portugal awaits assessment of two lithium mines before launching auction": "Demonstrators protest against lithium mines in downtown Lisbon, Portugal September 21, 2019. The placards read \"Lithium Not\". REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nLISBON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Portugal will not commit to setting a new date for a long-awaited auction of lithium mining licences as it awaits the conclusion of ongoing environmental impact studies at two sites, Energy Secretary Joao Galamba said on Wednesday.\n\nThe southern European nation, which has 60,000 tonnes of known lithium reserves, is central to Europe's bid to secure more of the battery value chain and cut reliance on imports.

    "CHEGA celebrates far-right victory in Italian elections": "CHEGA says “winds of change” will reach Portugal too\n\nPortugal’s right-wing nationalist party CHEGA has applauded the results of the Italian election, which has been won by a conservative alliance led by far-right party Brothers of Italy.\n\nIn a statement to the press, Portugal’s third political force congratulated the “Italian right-wing for the results obtained” and said that there will be a “true change of policies” after this election.\n\nThe party also said it hopes that a government will be “formed quickly” in order to provide the Italian people with a “strong and stable governing solution capable of facing the hard times that are ahead.”\n\nThe statement also alluded to the growing number of European countries moving to the right of the political spectrum.\n\n“After Sweden, it is now Italy that has given another clear sign that the European continent is undergoing a deep change,” the party said, adding that voters are “trusting more and more in parties that defend, without reservations, the sovereignty of peoples, their traditions and civilizational values.”\n\nCHEGA also said that “the winds of change will reach Portugal.”\n\nGiorgia Meloni, leader of Brothers of Italy, is set to become the first female Prime Minister of Italy .\n\nSpeaking to her supporters from a hotel in Rome, she said this is just a “starting point.”\n\n“From tomorrow, we have to demonstrate what we are worth. It’s time for responsibility — we won’t betray Italy… We will govern this nation on behalf of everyone,” Meloni said.\n\nAccording to state broadcaster Rai, the Meloni-led coalition, which features Matteo Salvini’s nationalist Northern League and former PM Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia — won just over 43% of the vote, “enough to give it a comfortable parliamentary majority.”\n\nThe coalition’s victory has also been celebrated by other right-wing forces across Europe.\n\nMarine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, said on Twitter: “The Italian people has decided to take its destiny in hand by electing a patriotic and sovereigntist government.\n\nLe peuple italien a décidé de reprendre son destin en main en élisant un gouvernement patriote et souverainiste.

    "Portugal Preparing 10 GW Offshore Wind Auction for 2023": "Portugal will offer 10 GW of capacity through the country’s first offshore wind auction expected to take place in 2023, according to Portugal’s Environment Minister Duarte Cordeiro.\n\nPortugal had originally planned to offer between 6 GW and 8 GW of offshore wind capacity in the first auction.\n\nRelated Article Posted: 3 months ago Portugal Postpones First Offshore Wind Auction, Doubles Capacity Target Posted: 3 months ago\n\nThe increase in the capacity target is part of the Portuguese government’s plan to speed up the country’s energy transition.\n\nThis is the second capacity increase for the country’s debut offshore wind auction. Portugal had initially planned to hold the first auction in 2022 and offer up to 4 GW of capacity in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n”We have already launched the working group to prepare the 10-gigawatt offshore Eolic tender so that we can increase our capacity to increase renewable energy for this type of industry,” Minister Cordeiro was quoted as saying by O Jornal Economico.\n\nBack in 2017, the Portuguese Government approved the Industrial Strategy for Ocean Renewable Energies (EI-ERO), with an aim of developing the country’s offshore wind potential, according to which the potential for offshore wind installation in Portugal is much more significant for floating turbines (40 GW), than for fixed ones (1.4 to 3.5 GW).\n\nAccording to estimations from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), the Ocean Renewable Energy Action Coalition (OREAC), and the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Portugal’s offshore wind technical potential is 131 GW: 117 GW for floating wind and 14 GW for bottom-fixed.\n\nPortugal already has a floating wind farm up and running, the 25 MW Windfloat Atlantic, which has been operational since July 2020. The project features three MHI Vestas 8.4 MW turbines mounted on Principle Power’s semi-submersible floating foundations.\n\nFollow offshoreWIND.biz on:",

Boyd, will visit Portugal from 19 to 27 September.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur’s visit at the invitation of the Government follows a challenging summer from a climate perspective, as heat waves and wildfires have seriously affected the country, and elsewhere around the world.\n\n“The aim of my visit is to learn about good practices and challenges in the implementation of human rights obligations relating to climate change and environmental protection,” Boyd said. “I am particularly interested in topics such as air quality, biodiversity, climate, food systems and water-related issues.”\n\nThe independent expert said Portugal had included the right to a healthy environment in its constitution in 1976, offering decades of experience in implementing and fulfilling this human right at the national level.\n\nBoyd noted the Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly had recently recognised the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.\n\nDuring his visit, he will meet Government officials, representatives of civil society, academics, youth and other stakeholders.\n\nBoyd will present his preliminary observations on the visit at a news conference on 27 September at 10:00 am local time at Mar da Palha Auditorium in the Oceanario de Lisboa, Esplanada Dom Carlos I s/nº, 1990-005 in Lisbon.

    "Over 250 new supermarkets opened in Portugal": "Portuguese food distribution ended 2021 with a new boost both in its sales room for consumer products (PGC) and in the number of stores, according to the latest report on the sector published by Alimarket.\n\nBy TPN, in News, Business, Portugal · 25 Sep 2022, 16:10 · 0 Comments\n\nAt the end of the year, the sector had added 257 new points of sale to the commercial fabric of the country, which recorded a growth of 3.8% in the commercial area.\n\nDespite being a highly concentrated market, in which the first four operators by sales bring together 67.6% and half of the stores, Portuguese distribution still presents growth opportunities for chains. Proof of this are the active expansion plans of many of the distributors, who seek to strengthen themselves in the areas in which they are already present, in addition to gaining access to new districts in which they do not yet operate.\n\nAldi growth\n\nThe Portuguese distribution continues to be led by MC Sonae, which at the end of the year was more than six points away from the local group Jerónimo Martins. Although both added more than 20,000 m2 to their commercial fabric, the growth of the German chain Aldi stands out, which led the openings by area and climbed one position in the general ranking, reaching seventh place.",
    "Thinking of Moving abroad? Here’s the Best Cities to Live in Portugal": "If you are considering moving to Portugal from the UK, there are some excellent cities you can call home. Portugal is a highly welcoming country and already boasts an impressive multicultural, diverse foreign population. Considering all the visa options, subclasses, and types the Portuguese government has introduced to attract professionals, it is no surprise that Portugal is regarded as a favourable expat destination.\n\nWith nearly 300 days of sunshine, a great climate, friendly people, and great work and educational opportunities, what’s not to like about Portugal? It has thousands of kilometres of coastline, pristine beaches, and great food. No wonder Portugal sees so many expats from the UK shifting here. UK residents moving to Portugal have several visa options and categories that they can avail of. Even residents in the UK on a fiancé visa are eligible to apply for a visa to Portugal. However, it is necessary to have all the documentation and paperwork ready before applying, or the wait times may get extended.\n\nLet us look at the best cities to live in Portugal.\n\nLisbon:\n\nLisbon is hands down the best place to live and work in Portugal. Considered the London of Portugal, Lisbon has its own unique identity that is a marvellous mix of Portugal’s cultural influence and history mixed with modernity and urban architecture. For those hoping to live and work in Lisbon, there are never-ending career and work opportunities with many large multinationals calling the city home.\n\nIt is also the hub for educational institutes and is known for its thriving student population. Lisbon always has a music festival, exhibition, museum tours, gastronomic experiences, sports matches mixed with movies, concerts, pubs, nightlife, entertainment options, and more.\n\nLisbon has excellent paying jobs. However, the standard of living in the capital is higher than in other cities in Portugal.\n\nFaro:\n\nFaro in the Algarve region of southern Portugal is known for its delicious seafood, sun, and the sea. Faro has a laid-back vibe that attracts many families with senior citizens or small children. Faro is not known for its massive work opportunities but is known as an excellent place for start-ups and small businesses (especially online businesses).\n\nThe real estate sector in Faro is booming and has survived relatively unscathed from the pandemic. The rental and ownership properties are much more affordable than those in larger cities like Lisbon and Porto. The public transport system is also well connected with a good health infrastructure for residents.\n\nFaro also has a large expat community, so most foreign residents feel at home.\n\nPorto:\n\nPorto is probably one of the most stunning cities in Portugal and tends to attract many expatriates. It is famous for its Porto wine, local foods, gastronomic experiences, and stunning architecture. Like Faro, Porto is also known for its incredible start-up culture and is home to many small and medium-sized businesses. This is one of the main reasons Porto sees several international entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and banking institutions in the city.\n\nPorto has some good schools and colleges, with a decently-sized student population. Considering the average age group of Porto’s population, there are a substantial number of entertainment and nightlife options. The housing costs are cheaper than in Lisbon, but not as cheap as in Faro.\n\nSome great places to live in Porto are the neighbourhoods of Ribeira, Foz do Douro, Boavista, Avenida do Aliados, and Campanha.\n\nEvora:\n\nEvora isn’t mentioned as often as Lisbon, Porto, and Faro, but it is an equally wonderful city to permanently move to. Evora has its own old-world charm mixed with modernity that appeals to many. This is primarily due to medieval architecture and Evora’s ancient history. The temperature remains nearly the same all year, and it can get slightly hot in summer. However, the rest of the year is average, leading to a comfortable life.\n\nEvora is perfect for people averse to large crowds and boisterous, noisy places. It is also a fabulous place to start a small business, raise children, or retire with loved ones. It has plenty of quaint cafes, restaurants, and eateries to sip coolers and drink wine on hot days.\n\nViseu:\n\nViseu in central Portugal is known for its fantastic quality of life. The city has a well-connected public transportation system, excellent infrastructure, great educational institutions, healthcare, and outstanding career and work opportunities.\n\nThe housing costs are not as expensive as in Lisbon. But Viseu is known for its equally well-paying job opportunities. There are very few cons to Viseu, with mostly all pros for students, educationists, professionals, families, and sports enthusiasts. Viseu is also renowned for its natural beauty, Renaissance-style architecture, and affordable lifestyle.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated",

    "Portugal’s absolute majority wades through political mud": "PM launches into damage limitation; manages to keep smiling, but…\n\nSomehow this week, politics in Portugal has scaled new heights. The ‘absolute majority’ government seems bogged down. It has reached the stage that the prime minister resorted to ‘an interview’ on primetime television on Monday to insist “there are no tricks in pensions”, when every single political commentator has already minutely explained how the tricks have been “so cleverly devised”.\n\nThe country, which has been repeatedly told there is nothing more important than a decision on a new airport and on a new health service statute, has now heard that all these things can wait…\n\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is in Angola – so that takes preference over any decisions on the country’s drowning health service – while the airport decision is so confused that Mr Costa has smiled broadly and said it will be left until next year.\n\nIf only he could remember the “urgency” he described back in 2018. Admittedly, the world has changed dramatically since then – but not when it comes to the PM’s executive reaching desperately needed decisions.\n\nEnvironment minister Duarte Cordeiro was scheduled to outline energy-saving measures last Thursday, only to announce that the announcement would “come shortly but not now”; Mr Costa pledged measures to help businesses through the energy crisis well over a week ago – and since then, nothing…\n\nIndustry, meantime, is crying out for solutions (some sectors having seen energy costs leap 10-fold). There are warnings that production will be affected; jobs lost. But what does the prime minister do? Go on television to say “there are no tricks in pensions”.\n\nOpposition PSD leader Luís Montenegro, meantime, is ‘out for blood’. A polar-opposite to his predecessor in terms of proactivity, the 49-year-old has launched into a tour of the country, borough by borough, to take place for one week of every month, and has started making daily declarations decrying government “disarray” (and social insensitivity) which are gaining media traction.\n\nOn the right, André Ventura, leader of the country’s reviled third political force CHEGA, is equally focused on showing the Socialist executive up for its “absolute failings”.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, as the dust settled on the prime minister’s platitudes given to TVI/CNN, the country’s ‘best read tabloid’ carried a headline explaining that public sector workers’ salaries will have lost 14% in terms of ‘purchasing power’ since the troika years (i.e., since PS Socialists have been returned to power).\n\nIn a week where the nation’s schools begin the new academic year after the best part of three months on holiday – with 60,000 pupils missing a full complement of teachers, it is little wonder that strikes are being threatened and ‘liability waivers’ requested by exhausted workers within the health service.\n\nThis leads neatly into the fundamental changes promised for the SNS health service, which has finally seen a replacement minister appointed (to take over from the one who resigned after the untimely death of a young pregnant woman). It has also seen the announcement of the name of a new ‘saviour’.\n\nCurrent (popular and laudably competent) director of Porto’s São João Hospital Fernando Araújo is to be the CEO of the newly-devised top tier of health service management (the SNS executive that cannot be officially formed until President Marcelo promulgates the diploma approving it on his return from Angola).\n\nIn interview on Monday, the prime minister stressed that “Lisbon has a lot to learn from Porto” in terms of hospital management, and the functioning of A&E departments.\n\nIt was a statement that suggested the enormous problems suffered within the country’s health service are somehow concentrated in Lisbon – when in truth they are everywhere, hence the reason that over 6,500 health professionals have requested liability waivers.\n\nSo, what have the first signs from Dr Araújo been? He maintains the health service needs a new strategy for the future; one that centres on disease preventions.\n\nBearing in mind it can take several months to be given a date for a specialist consultation in the health service – and even longer for people who need operations – it is chilling that it has required a new broom to reach this conclusion.\n\nBut back to the PM’s ‘damage limitation’ exercise. What else did he say? Here is a taster, provided by Expresso:\n\n“It’s probable that there will be” support for people with mortgages. “There are various measures possible, and the government is accompanying the situation and in dialogue with the banks. One of the possibilities that pleases the head of government is for agreements to be possible between the bank and its mortgage customers along the same lines as what happened during the pandemic.”\n\nAs for inflation, the chief of government says he is working on a forecast of closing the year with 7.4%. Questioned on whether public sector workers will have an increase of this order, he quickly responded: “They will certainly not be increased by 7.4%”.\n\nAnd on the topic of a windfall tax on big business – so that extraordinary profits could be ploughed into supporting the least fortunate in society, Mr Costa answered: “We haven’t excluded it, we haven’t decided.”\n\nSomething of a master in the use of unnecessary words, Mr Costa told his interviewers: “We are analysing the situation; if it justifies, there will be measures, if it does not justify, there will not be measures.”\n\nIn other words, the way forward is as clear as the thick sludge that flooded villages as a result of Storm Danielle’s downpours over Serra da Estrela this week. Authorities had warned of the folly of leaving burnt detritus in the hills following the summer fires (only recently extinguished). But their warnings went unheeded – and now thousands of euros has to be found to repair the damage.\n\nBy NATASHA DONN\n\nnatasha.donn@portugalresident.com",
    "Portugal’s president receives warm welcome in Gustine. ‘This will go down in history’": "Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was given an enthusiastic welcome to Gustine on Sunday, where he met with community members and local dignitaries as part of his trip to California.\n\nGustine Mayor Pat Nagy presented Rebelo de Sousa with a key to the city, saying the moment will be remembered for years to come.\n\n“This will go down in history, you can believe it,” Nagy told the audience gathered at Gustine Pentecostal Society Portuguese Hall. “You will forever be welcome here, and you will be in our hearts.”\n\nRebelo de Sousa told the Sun-Star he had planned on coming to Gustine in 2020, but that visit was postponed by the COVID pandemic.\n\nRebelo de Sousa explained while there are many stops on his trip, when talking about Gustine he said, “But this one is even more special. No other Portuguese president has been here. So many Portuguese have been working here. I had to come.”\n\nHe called the United States an ally and “a very old friend,” saying Portuguese Americans remain “resilient” and determined to succeed.\n\n“(The Valley) is a place where Portuguese have been for 150 years,” he told reporters gathered for the event. “It’s a lifetime. Several generations.”\n\nGustine has one of the highest concentrations of Americans with Portuguese heritage in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Many of those local folks trace their ancestry back to the Azores, as well as Portugal itself.\n\nThe city is steeped in Portuguese history and longtime traditions that continue to this day, like its annual festa, which began in the 1930s.\n\nWhen given the key to the city by Nagy, Rebelo de Sousa joked, “Now I feel like a citizen. I don’t know if you thought about it before offering it ... I feel good here, I may be back several times.”\n\nRebelo de Sousa presented a merit medal to local dairy farmer Joao Pires while addressing the group in Gustine. Pires, who is originally from Azores, was moved to tears as he accepted the medal.\n\nGustine Pentecost Society President Manuel Siqueiros said it meant so much to the people of Gustine for Rebelo de Sousa to take the time to visit.\n\n“Just the fact that he recognizes this Portuguese community and to come out here and celebrate this day and express his happiness with the people of Gustine, it’s amazing,” Siqueiros said. “You don’t get a foreign president visiting a lot of places let alone Gustine, California.”\n\nOther scheduled stops on Rebelo de Sousa’s California trip include throwing the first pitch at the San Francisco Giants-Colorado Rockies game Tuesday in celebration of Portuguese Heritage Night.\n\nHe was scheduled to appear at Stanford University on Monday for a panel discussion titled “Sustainable Solutions for Portugal and California.”\n\n“(Portugal has) 60% of our energy sources coming from renewable (energy),” Rebelo de Sousa said Sunday, saying that number is expected to increase to 80% by 2030.\n\nHe also mentioned Portugal’s efforts to embrace the digital revolution, particularly with many young entrepreneurs spearheading startups and technological innovations.\n\n“(That) is something that makes California and Portugal very much alike. It’s very good,” he said. “We are far away, but we are very close, facing these new challenges. “\n\nGustine Mayor Pat Nagy, center, is shown presenting Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa with a key to the city on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2022.
