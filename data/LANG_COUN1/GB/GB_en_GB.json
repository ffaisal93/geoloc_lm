    "Detection of circulating vaccine derived polio virus 2 (cVDPV2) in environmental samples– the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America": "\n\n\n\nSituation at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than two months later, these samples were classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2 on 8 August. As of 5 September, no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between 21 April to 26 August 2022 from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July, a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the first case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on 3 August and 11 August) containing more than five nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County – these viruses are now being classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel1.\n\nFigure-1 Detection of genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates in the United Kingdom and the United States of America from February to August 2022\n\nEpidemiology of Poliomyelitis\n\nPolio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).\n\nThe virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented by immunization.\n\nThe incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease often goes unrecognized.\n\nVaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).",
    "Cabinet approves the MoU signed on mutual recognition of academic qualifications between India and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland": "The Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 07.09.2022 chaired by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi granted ex post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on mutual recognition of academic qualifications signed on 25.04.2022.\n\nMutual Recognition of Qualifications between India and UK aims to promote academic collaboration and student mobility. The request from UK side to grant recognition to their One Year Masters Programme was considered, and during the meeting between the Education Ministers of the two countries held on 16 December 2020 in New Delhi, a decision was taken to set up a joint task force for this purpose. The first meeting was held on 04th February, 2021 and subsequently after detailed deliberations and negotiations both sides agreed on the draft MoU.\n\nThe MoU aims to facilitate the mutual recognition of educational qualifications, periods of study undertaken, documents related to academic degrees/qualifications and accreditation by educational institutions within the two countries. Professional degrees like Engineering, Medicine, Nursing and Para-Medical Education, Pharmacy, Law, and Architecture are out of the purview of this MoU. It will also facilitate establishment of Joint/Dual degree courses between Higher Education Institutions, one of our objectives under NEP 2020 for Intel-nationalization of Education.\n\nThis MoU will promote bilateral exchange of information about educational structure, programs and standards and increase mobility of students and professionals between the two countries. It will also encourage other areas of cooperation in education sector, development of study programs as mutually agreed upon by the Parties.\n\nThis MoU shall recognize equivalence in accordance with parity with regard to acceptability of qualifications as approved under national policy, law, rules and regulations of the two countries.",

We are particularly concerned about the persistent digital divides that further exacerbate social and economic inequalities around the world.\n\nNow more than ever we need a strong, impactful, and efficient Union providing core expertise in the domains of radio communications, telecommunications/ICTs standards, and bridging the digital divide, including with regard to gender, age and persons with specific needs. The Union should contribute to the digital transformation that puts humans at the centre, empowers individuals and provides meaningful connectivity.\n\nTo this end, we promote a human rights-based approach to the whole life cycle of telecommunication/ICT technologies – including design, development, deployment, use and disposal - as part of a human-centric vision of the digital transformation, including in international standard-setting processes.\n\nIn this light, we should work together to achieve a digital transformation based on openness, inclusion, equality, sustainability, resilience and security. We encourage the ITU, as a member of the UN family and working with other Standard Development Organisations to develop international telecommunications/ICTs standards that are consistent with existing international frameworks on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nWe welcome other UN efforts in this direction, in particular the Human Rights Council Resolution on new and emerging digital technologies and human rights (A/HRC/RES/47/23) that calls for consultations with standard development organizations on human rights and telecommunication/ICT.\n\nIt is equally important that the ITU, which builds upon the expertise of various stakeholders, including industry, SMEs, and academia, redoubles its efforts to make its procedures more transparent and accessible, including to organizations active on human rights aspects of telecommunications/ICTs. Forging consensus and making sure that all stakeholders are heard forms a critical part of the ITU´s work.\n\nThank you for your attention",

    "What the death of Queen Elizabeth II means for the United Kingdom": "The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport)\n\nOne of the main problems with the heavy handed establishment responses to the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign are the insistent the declarations of national greatness that so many feel cause to proclaim. Not only does this nationalist cringing conjure an anachronistic nostalgia for greatness at a time when more than one in five Brits live in poverty. Somehow, amidst all the commentary, there is very little reflection on what the death of Queen Elizabeth II might actually mean for the symbolic decline of that greatness, and which will be nowhere more clearly expressed in the end of two geopolitical arrangements: the Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nFirst, Elizabeth II’s death heralds the end of the Commonwealth – perhaps not immediately, but certainly before the century’s end, and possibly within the next decade. Initially formed in the year of Elizabeth’s birth as the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Commonwealth later dropped ‘British’ from its title and established a criteria of ‘free and equal’ status between its fifty six members in 1949.\n\nElizabeth took the throne just three years later, and the Commonwealth became a point of immense personal passion and pride. Her first public speech in 1940 had been addressed to ‘the children of the Commonwealth’, and she was in Kenya when she inherited the Crown. One of the few times she made her politics publicly known was when Thatcher refused to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa. Recognising the threat Thatcher’s position posed to the integrity of the Commonwealth, the Queen’s ‘dismay’ was uncharacteristically leaked to several papers, including The Times.\n\nIf the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise\n\nHistorically, the Commonwealth has been the institutional vehicle by which Britain managed the formal decolonisation of its Empire. In the past few days, many on the left have understandably pointed to the Queen as a symbol of British colonialism. But as the head of the Commonwealth, she might also be seen as the monarch who oversaw the careful management of the Empire’s gradual dismantling (this is not to say that colonialism does not continue in other forms).\n\nFrom this view, the Commonwealth can be seen as a halfway stage between Britain’s formal Empire and the arrival of full political decolonisation. In the Caribbean, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Saint Vincent, and the Grenadines have been on the verge of leaving the Commonwealth for some time, and several other territories host significant republican movements. The death of Queen Elizabeth II will only accelerate this historical flow.\n\nHastening the break up of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, it is likely that Elizabeth’s death will not only hasten the break-up of the Commonwealth, but also the fragmentation of the Union itself. Unlike the US, France, Germany, or pretty much any other modern democracy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no written constitution. Instead, when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland joined together in 1707, the constitution was embodied in the person of the monarch.\n\nThis is why you now hear politicians celebrating Elizabeth for standing as a constant above the ‘clashes of politics’ – she was the constitution, both figuratively and literally. With her death, the post-war iteration of that constitution – the only one most living Britons have known – has come apart.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that Charles III will be incapable of reinventing anything like the quiet soft power Elizabeth once held. A second independence referendum in Scotland seems just one general election away; a referendum on Irish reunification is only a little further down the line. If the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise.\n\nPerhaps this is the same process of decolonisation running its course – England and Scotland already had colonial possessions in 1707, and Great Britain was always an imperial state, so the break-up of the United Kingdom is arguably the decolonial endgame. But even if that is the case, this process is far more likely to fuel reactionary rather than progressive politics if no efforts are made to find stability through different constitutional means.\n\nAnyone with an understanding of the Queen’s political gravity may therefore feel concerned at the passing of her symbolic heft. For ‘Great Britain’, as an historical territory and imagined community, truly is adrift without it.\n\nA democratic non-monarchical settlement\n\nI say that not as a monarchist or nationalist, whose reach for hyperbolic epithets about British greatness betrays the deepening insecurity of our current settlement. Instead, I invoke it as a republican who recognises how desperately Britain needs a new settlement, one that is capable of tackling multiple, interlinked crises in health, energy, climate, education, social care, regional inequality, and political representation.\n\nWe need a new constitutional agreement for Britain that foregrounds democracy, devolves authority, empowers regions, redistributes wealth, and holds political and financial elites to account. We might call this something like a Green New Deal, but in Britain it must go much deeper than infrastructure plans. Practically, it could start with the removal of unelected leaders, including in the House of Lords, and move towards a vision of the isles as a collection of federalised states with shared constitutional values that are actually written down.\n\nThe specifics will need to be debated, of course. But whatever form they take, it is clear that we need an idea of Britain that has come to terms with the Empire that it was, and which is equally realistic about what it might yet become. Without recognition of this need in constitutional arrangements, we will continue to plunge forward, blind to the many challenges that are quickly becoming far too real to alleviate with the pseudo-warmth of nationalist platitudes.\n\nWe currently lack the imaginative and empathic leaders needed to bring such changes about. Until they emerge, Britain will continue to crumble, shedding parts of itself, and concealing its waning political power beneath the peeling sticking plaster of the culture wars. Meanwhile, more and more of British society will struggle and suffer, rocked by climate and energy crises, disinvested from meaningful imagined communities, and now deprived of even the symbolic salve that Queen Elizabeth II once provided.\n\nDominic Davies is Senior Lecturer in English at City, University of London.

    "Hull sends formal condolence to King Charles III during moving occasion": "City councillors in Hull have formally expressed their condolence on behalf of the people of Hull to the Royal family over the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAt an historic full meeting of the council in the Guildhall, they unanimously supported a motion of condolence moved by the Lord Mayor Councillor Christine Randall and seconded by council leader Councillor Mike Ross, before making several personal tributes. The motion mirrored a similar one agreed by the authority in 1952 following the death of King George VI.\n\nToday's motion read: \"The Lord Mayor of Kingston upon Hull and Admiral of the Humber, City Council and Citizens of Kingston upon Hull, desire to express to his His Majesty King Charles the Third their deep sense of the loss which His Majesty and the Members of the Royal Family have sustained in common with the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, whose constant devotion to duty secured for her the regard and affection of all citizens of the United Kingdom, and people across the world, and whose name and memory will ever be cherished by them.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The Queen's funeral - everything you need to know\n\nCouncillors and officials observed a two-minute silence before starting proceedings.

Our condolences go to King Charles and the Royal family.”\n\n(Image: Hull Live)\n\nHe also thanked all those involved in local recent events commemorating her passing, including Sunday’s Proclamation ceremony held on the City Hall balcony. He encouraged people to gather again in Queen Victoria Square next Monday to watch the Queen’s funeral which is being screened live on a big screen on the same balcony.\n\nCllr Ross said the council was also planning to invite people to submit ideas on a future permanent commemoration to the Queen in the city. More details on this are expected to be announced in the next few weeks.\n\nDeputy council leader Councillor Jackie Dadd was in tears as she delivered her tribute. Councillor Kalvin Neal, who served with the Army in Iraq, said: \"When I fought on the frontline conflict zone I can quite honestly, hand on heart, say I did fight for Queen and country.\n\n\"Yes, the people next to me were important and I was making sure they were OK as well, but I did fight for Queen and country and to understand what that means to me is still quite difficult.\"\n\nOpposition Labour group leader Councillor Daren Hale said: \"It is important to remember there is a family who have lost a loved one. Just because the Queen is a public figure, we must not forget that.\"\n\nFollowing the tributes, the Lord Mayor announced the official Loyal Address to the new King on behalf of the council and the people of Hull.\n\nIt reads: \"We, the Lord Mayor and Admiral of the Humber, City Council and Citizens of KIngston upon Hull are desirous of tendering our heart and sincere congratulations on Your Majesty's accession to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We desire to offer Your Majesty the assurance of our loyal attachment and allegiance to Your Majesty's person and throne to express the wish that the reign of Your Majesty will be marked by the furtherance of measures for promoting the welfare, happiness and prosperity of all citizens of this United Kingdom.

    "King Charles and the Jacobin Right": "Charles Windsor has gone through an extraordinarily rapid transformation. We all know that he became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its overseas territories and other Commonwealth realms, the second the Queen’s heart stopped beating on the afternoon of Thursday, 8 September 2022. In the minds of the UK’s Jacobin Right, he went through an even more dramatic metamorphosis at the same time: from the lunatic lefty “Clown Prince” who was in league with Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Soros and the other members of the shadowy elite syndicate that apparently run the world through the obscure auspices of the World Economic Forum — to His Majesty the King, the venerable Sovereign and beloved Liege Lord of the great country on God’s green earth.\n\nIt is one enormous throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology\n\nIt’s easy to mock the motley cast of characters that make up the crankish world of the Guido-GB News British right — and it’s very entertaining, too, so let’s do that for a paragraph. Many of them appear to be confused adolescent boys who accidentally wandered into a TV studio in the middle of a school trip and have mysteriously never been asked to leave since. Like a horrible right-wing mirror image of the deranged children that inhabit that barely-glorified hard-left intellectual creche “Novara Media”, they have been conducting an adolescent William Hague impersonation contest ever since — although to be fair to North Yorkshire’s favourite pint-downing former Tory leader, they have succeeded in making him look like a cross between Benjamin Disraeli and Edmund Burke.\n\nIt’s not just the kids though: there are plenty of hoary old-timers who have done a dramatic u-turn now that deranged eco-terrorist Prince Charles has become the Almighty’s glorious anointed. Nigel Farage interrupted a busy schedule of day-drinking, wistful self-googling and bashing away on the Daily Mail comment section to give his ever-so-slightly obsequious verdict on the King’s early performance. One can only surmise that a portrait of His Majesty has already replaced his beloved, and perhaps slightly soiled, framed photo of the Queen that he kept on his wall between the Pirelli calendars and his mint-condition collection of Rothmans cigarette cards.\n\nIn their various ways, what these characters sum up is the extent to which there is a section of the modern British right that is simply one enormous great throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology. Many of the younger ones take libertarian licence to an extreme of glorious self-parody. Should children be allowed to take crack cocaine? Or perhaps sell their kidneys at auction to a gang of international organ-harvesters in lieu of a school fundraising tombola? “Who are YOU to stop them, Nanny State Nazis?”, opine Darren Harwood and baby Guido.\n\nEnvironmental politics is a good example. It’s a complex area, and there are good reasons to be sceptical about many specific aspects of the green agenda of the government and activist groups. But it’s hard to shake off the impression that what lies behind the hysterical attacks on the then-Prince Charles’ work to highlight the risks of plummeting biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion and various other forms of environmental degradation is the same sort of emotion that lies behind the toddler who is told that they cannot have their fourth mini-milk: sheer disbelieving outrage than anybody should ever question their right to have whatever they want, whenever they want it and damn the consequences.\n\nIt’s a part of the Right Jacobin mentality that has become a distinctive phenomenon among many contemporary so-called conservatives. They share the abstract rationalising tendency of the French revolutionaries — and indeed most of the modern hard left — to see politics as a mere utilitarian machine designed to smash anything that gets in the way of the fulfilment of their immediate will and pleasure. The slow accretion of tradition as the collected wisdom of the species; the caution embodied in the idea of Chesterton’s fence; the grandeur of our long-standing national institutions: all such ideas are, in substance, so much lily-livered “bed-wetting” flim-flam so far as the San-Culottes of the Home Counties are concerned. They’d have the King in a tumbril tomorrow if they thought it would lead to zero per cent corporation tax and a lot of Albanians drowning in the English channel.\n\nSome faint glimmerings have been summoned up in their souls\n\nIronically, they reproduce in reverse so many of the assumptions of the hard left. In many cases — Tom Grimes being a good example — they are just Whiggish liberals who take the inevitable progressive course of history as a given, but disagree with the Corbynistas and nose-ringed Tankies as to what form it should take. They simply see the dynamism of the unleashed free market as a better way to the world of materialistic abundance and self-indulgence they crave than “Fully Automated Luxury Communism” or cyber-Stalinism or whatever tedious, nightmarish utopia the hard left are currently peddling. The difference is one of means, not ends: they are all equally lacking in any aesthetic or spiritual sensibility. This is really why they hated the postliberal politics of Charles, a man who values restraint, limits, boundaries, discipline; and understands that we cannot limitlessly abuse the Earth simply because we want endless wasteful profusion. It’s why they cannot truly appreciate the prescriptive wisdom of our customs and traditions.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that such Right Jacobins don’t exist in a vacuum. They are an understandable — if wrong-headed and unfortunate — overreaction to the condescension of a liberal-left technocratic mindset that is no better. When genuine debate, reasonable compromises and pragmatic accommodations are made impossible by the breakdown of meaningful democratic politics at the hands of both quasi-totalitarian progressivism and ultra-liberal hubris, one can hardly be surprised that morbid symptoms appear on the right. However intransigent the progressive Brahmins may be and however mad the social justice warriors are, it’s a mistake to respond with a sort of golf club Leninism.\n\nIn a spirit of generosity, let’s be encouraged by the fact that some faint glimmerings of the glories of tradition, duty and sacrifice have been summoned up in their souls by the death of our late Queen and the accession of Charles. It’s never too late to abandon one’s youthful revolutionary errors and embrace the politics of virtue, restraint and the transcendent. God hasn’t abandoned anyone to such errors irrevocably — even Nigel Farage.",
    "UK's former Labour leader snapped playing Thatcher-slaying Doom mod": "Audio player loading…\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour party and two-time candidate for Prime Minister, has been pictured enjoying a game of Thatcher's Techbase in Liverpool ( thanks, Indy100 ). Thatcher's Techbase is a Doom II mod where the late Margaret Thatcher returns to the tenth circle of hell, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the player sets out to make sure that this time 'CyberThatcher' stays dead.\n\nDoubtless the current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will be delighted to discover that Corbyn's been digitally blasting away at a dead Tory Prime Minister. There isn't even any ambiguity about it, one picture shows him staring at the screen with hands on the controls, and in the second it looks like he's… dabbing?\n\nHe liked the game 🙂 pic.twitter.com/fD9VuNVvYZSeptember 25, 2022 See more\n\nThe Thatcher's Techbase cabinet made its debut at The World Transformed festival, and was built by Thatcher's Techbase creator Jim Purvis to support the tenants' rights organisation Living Rent. Alongside the pictures of Corbyn, Purvis noted that \"he liked the game\" with a smile emoji.\n\nUK politics has been something of a clown show for the last decade and yet even so this is one of the wildest things to happen in some time. Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader from 2015-2020, during which time the party was in opposition, and was loved by elements of the left for exactly the same reason that the right hated him.\n\nCorbyn's a dyed-in-the-wool socialist leftie, the type of politician who attends picket lines (and radical festivals like this), and he has a knack for saying things that make more centrist voters baulk. A British Bernie Sanders with an allotment. Ultimately the Labour party under his leadership was an electoral failure, and this can be attributed partly to Corbyn's disastrous relationship with the media: he seems a nice enough guy but they monstered him, and he certainly gave them the material to do it with.\n\nJeremy Corbyn now sits as an independent MP, amidst an ongoing disagreement with the parliamentary Labour party, and so there's an element of this which is just him saying 'screw it, why not shoot Thatcher in a game'—it's not like he's worried about the next general election. It should also be said that this is, fundamentally, pretty funny: we're talking about an old socialist playing a Doom II mod starring CyberThatcher.\n\nNevertheless, if you're outside the UK, here's why this could well turn into a shitstorm. Margaret Thatcher is a figure reviled by elements of the UK, for reasons way too numerous to go into here, and conversely idolised by her own side as the Iron Lady of British politics. Jeremy Corbyn is meanwhile something of a boogeyman for right-leaning Brits, and a Captain Planet-esque idol for the socialist left.",
    "The Queen’s real name was a touching tribute to her family": "For over 70 years, the Queen ruled over the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth until her death last week.

The Queen Mother was not known as Queen Elizabeth II to avoid confusion with her daughter who ascended to the throne at 25 years old.\n\nAlexandra was the name of Elizabeth’s paternal great-grandmother and wife of King Edward VII, Alexandra of Denmark. The Queen’s grandmother on her father’s side was called Mary, although she was known affectionately as May.\n\nThe last name for the royal family is Windsor which was chosen in 1917 by George V after the castle of the same name. Previously the royals had been referred to by house, for example Queen Victoria's eldest son Edward VII belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThis tradition was changed by Edward VII because of growing anti-German sentiment in the UK during the First World War. The Queen reaffirmed the name Windsor for royals but also said her direct line would use Mountbatten-Windsor to reflect Prince Philip’s lineage.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor is used when The Queen's children need a surname, such as upon marriage.

We must unite in our grief and take strength that both our Country and the Commonwealth are better places today for her long reign and life of public service.\n\n“Her Majesty was truly the Queen of Britons—y Cymry—and of the British Nations, descended from the Welsh Princes.\n\n“Eight countries came together in 1949 to form the modern Commonwealth. Her Majesty became Head of the Commonwealth after being chosen for this role by Commonwealth Member Countries when she became Queen three years later, since when the Commonwealth has grown to become a free association not of eight countries, but of 56 independent and equal member countries. I thank Her Majesty for her service.”\n\nOn Thursday, I travelled to London with fellow Welsh Conservative Members of the Senedd, where I was privileged to attend Her Majesty’s Lying-in-State in Westminster Hall.\n\nOn Friday, The King made his first official visit to Wales since ascending the throne and was welcomed to the Senedd for the ‘Presentation of the Motion of Condolence to His Majesty King Charles III’.\n\nIt was a great honour to listen to his address in the Senedd Chamber and to later meet and speak with the Queen Consort.\n\nIn North Wales, I attended a Service of Thanksgiving for the life of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in St Asaph Cathedral and a Commemoration Service for Her Late Majesty in St Giles Church, Wrexham.\n\nIt was also an honour to unveil an equine-inspired sculpture paying tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II and marking her Platinum Jubilee at Saturday’s event at the John Summers Clock Tower site in Deeside.\n\nIt has been a significant, poignant, and reflective week for us all.

The Orb and Sceptre were also taken. The Lord Chamberlain broke his Wand of Office and placed its remnants on the coffin. King Charles III placed The Queen’s Company Camp Colour on the coffin, too, before it was committed to the Vault.\n\nThe Service of Committal followed a State Funeral at Westminster Abbey this morning. Her Late Majesty will be buried privately later this evening in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at Windsor.",
    "Queen’s deep love of Scotland led her to ‘purr’ with relief after No vote": "The Queen in Scotland\n\nThe Queen faced the prospect of becoming Elizabeth I of Scotland or even Elizabeth, Queen of Scots, had the Scottish people voted in favour of independence.\n\nBut Elizabeth II will go down in history as the Queen whose reign escaped the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nThere was much personal relief in royal quarters in September 2014 following the victory of the “No” campaign in the Scottish independence referendum.\n\nIn fact, so concerned was the Queen that the 307-year-old Union of which she was sovereign would be broken up that she reportedly “purred down the line” to then-prime minister David Cameron when he rang to tell her: “It is all right, it’s OK.”\n\nThe Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales enjoying the Braemar Royal Highland Gathering in Scotland (Danny Lawson/PA)\n\nWhile Mr Cameron was left embarrassed at his lack of discretion after being caught on camera discussing the Queen’s reaction, the “purr-gate” blunder simply confirmed what many already believed – that she was, in private, strongly against Scottish independence.\n\nAs head of state, the Queen was publicly neutral when it came to political matters.\n\nBut the words she uttered a few days before the vote after attending morning church at Crathie Kirk had already appeared to urge voters to be cautious about severing the ties.\n\n“Well, I hope people will think very carefully about the future,” she told a well-wisher in the crowd.\n\nIn 2019, Mr Cameron confirmed he had indeed sought the Queen’s support after being panicked by a poll predicting a Yes victory, and he suggested to palace officials that the Queen could “raise an eyebrow” over the matter.\n\nThe Queen regularly attended Crathie Kirk church in Crathie, Aberdeenshire, when staying at Balmoral (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\nIn the wake of the referendum, the Queen issued a message of reconciliation, calling on people to unite in their “enduring love of Scotland” and expressing her belief they would come together to “work constructively for the future”.\n\n“Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots, like others throughout the United Kingdom, are able to express strongly held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country,” she said.\n\nWhen she was 27, the Queen had been crowned in a deeply religious service in Westminster Abbey during which she took a solemn oath to “govern the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.\n\nHer coronation promise was not one she took lightly and it was rich with significance for the young monarch.\n\nEven her coronation gown demonstrated the importance of the Union. It was not without thought that the intricate embroidery centred on the four emblems of the United Kingdom – the rose, the shamrock, the leek and the thistle.\n\nDuring the Queen’s Silver Jubilee year of 1977 there were growing calls for power to be devolved to Scotland and Wales.\n\nAndrew, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen and Edward in the grounds of Balmoral (PA)\n\nThe Queen made her views clear in a speech to both Houses of Parliament when she said she understood the aspirations of Scotland and Wales, adding: “But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom, of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n“Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.”\n\nIt was fitting that the Queen was in Scotland at her own Aberdeenshire home, Balmoral Castle, when she learned of the historic referendum outcome.\n\nEach year, she retreated to the Scottish estate during the summer months – even managing to do so during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 when restrictions eased a little.\n\nShe was apparently never happier than when she was at Balmoral, where the family spent their time riding, fishing or walking.\n\nMr Cameron once said there was not much “chillaxing” – chilling out and relaxing – at Balmoral, with the royals spending their time on outdoor pursuits.\n\nThe Queen wishes to share this private photograph taken with The Duke of Edinburgh at the top of the Coyles of Muick, Scotland in 2003. ?Photograph by The Countess of Wessex. pic.twitter.com/CE030Ux0UB — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) April 16, 2021\n\nAfter the Duke of Edinburgh’s death in 2021, Buckingham Palace released a poignant photo of the Queen and Philip – chosen personally by the Queen from her private family albums.\n\nIt showed the Queen and the duke, both smiling and enjoying downtime away from public duties, as they enjoyed the stunning scenery of the Scottish Highlands in 2003.\n\nThe Queen sat on a picnic blanket on the grass next to Philip, who was lying down at the Coyles of Muick, a beauty spot near the town of Ballater in Aberdeenshire.\n\nBalmoral Castle was the Queen’s private home and was handed down to her after being bought for Queen Victoria by Prince Albert in 1852.\n\nThe Queen at Balmoral Castle accompanied by her dog trainer and gamekeeper Bill Meldrum (PA)\n\nShe appointed a prime minister at Balmoral for the first time in 2022, inviting Liz Truss to form a government after the Tory leader travelled to see her from London, instead of making the increasingly frail monarch journey back down south.\n\nThe Queen had a lifelong love of Scotland.\n\nHer own Scottish heritage was an important part of her life.\n\nHer mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, hailed from an ancient aristocratic Scottish family.\n\nElizabeth II was also descended from Mary, Queen of Scots, James I who was James VI of Scotland, and Robert the Bruce, who secured Scotland’s independence from England.",

Trading insults and soundbites is no subsititute for calm and rational argument over policy.\n\nI am not holding my breath.\n\nRICHARD POAD\n\nCookham\n\nNonsense stems from Theresa May idea\n\nOn September 10 Prime Minister Liz Truss signed the Proclamation of King Charles III, declaring that ‘the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ had ‘solely and rightfully come to him’ and that he had ‘become our only lawful and rightful Liege Lord’, ‘of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories, King’.\n\nSo there should no longer have been any doubt in her mind that Northern Ireland is still an integral part of the United Kingdom; it has not been quietly hived off to become one of the ‘other Realms and Territories’, possibly a kind of buffer zone between the UK and the EU, and maybe even a ‘condominium’, with sovereignty shared between the UK and the EU or the Irish Republic.\n\nYet in the following week a government lawyer continued to argue in the Belfast High Court that, for all purposes connected with the movement of goods, Northern Ireland must be treated as part of the EU, and Great Britain must be treated as a foreign country, and in his words ‘What it means fundamentally is that the United Kingdom cannot be treated as a unitary state’.\n\nAll this nonsense stems from Theresa May’s original crazy idea that the best way to control the small volume of goods carried across the open land border into the Irish Republic was not by the obvious answer of export controls on those goods but by EU checks and controls on all the goods brought into the UK, and moreover on all the goods produced in the UK.\n\nDr D R COOPER\n\nBelmont Park Avenue\n\nMaidenhead",
    "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy": "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy\n\nThe Queen’s death came at a volatile period in British politics, with a recent scandal-induced change of prime minister and skyrocketing energy, food, and gasoline expenses, according to Kevin McGlone, a history professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, in an interview.\n\n“A 2021 poll conducted in England, Scotland, and Wales found that Queen Elizabeth had 70 percent approval, but only 50 percent approved of her son and heir Charles, now King Charles III. It remains to be seen how her death and Charles’ succession to the throne affect public attitudes of the monarchy,” he added.\n\nWith the death and burial of the Queen now over, King Charles is expected to settle in for his real role.\n\nWhat to know about the King and why he is called the ‘green monarch’\n\nCharles Philip Arthur George Windsor, the first son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip, was born on November 14, 1948. As the first modern heir to the British throne, Charles was educated outside of the palace rather than receiving private tutoring, and he later graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts.\n\nWhen the queen died on September 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, ascended to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles III is the oldest person to become a British monarch, at the age of 73.\n\nBritain’s next King is a dedicated environmentalist with a long history of pushing for improved conservation, organic farming, and climate change mitigation, which is likely to appeal to more environmentally aware younger Britons.\n\nHow wealthy is he?\n\nAccording to Forbes.com, an American business magazine, Charles now supervises $42 billion in assets and inherited $500 million from Queen Elizabeth, including her castles, jewels, art collection, and a horse farm—all of which are tax-free.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles established a number of initiatives to conserve the environment and promote organic farming. Charles controlled the largest organic food brand in the United Kingdom, as well as a nature retreat and crafts centre in Transylvania, both of which run as bed & breakfasts, through his Charitable Foundation (which William now inherited).\n\nThe sour love story\n\nLady Diana Spencer, later known as Princess Diana, was Charles’ first wife.\n\nThey were married for 15 years, from 1981 through 1996.\n\nDiana was 20 years old and Charles was 32 years old when they married.\n\nTheir wedding was described as a fairy tale, but their marriage was not. The royal couple divorced in 1996 after splitting in 1992.\n\nCharles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he met almost a decade before in 1970, as the public eventually discovered.\n\nEventually, Charles married Camilla in Windsor in 2005, 8 years after the death of Princess Diana in Paris.\n\nRead also: King Charles officially proclaimed as Britain’s new monarch\n\nHis experience in the corridors of power\n\nPrince Charles is no stranger to political machinations globally.\n\nHe has been to Washington at least 20 times and met every President of the United States since Jimmy Carter.\n\nDuring a three-day visit to the United States in 2015, Charles met with then President Barack Obama for the second time. Obama said in the Oval Office that the American people were “very fond of the royal family,” and that they “like them much better than their own politicians.”\n\n“I don’t believe that,” the king said.\n\nAlso, when former President Donald Trump’s visited the United Kingdom in 2019, Charles was supposed to meet with the American leader for around 15 minutes, but they ended up talking for longer.\n\nAfter their encounter, Trump described him as “a very good person” who was “very into climate change.”\n\n“What touched me was his concern for future generations,” Trump stated. “He wants to ensure that future generations have a decent climate rather than a calamity, and I agree.”\n\nSimilarly, he engaged President Biden at the COP26 climate meeting in Scotland in November 2021 who commended him for his environmental leadership, saying, “We need you badly… and I’m not just saying that.”\n\nThe king’s speech and the water it holds\n\nKing Charles III gave his first speech to the nation as the British monarch on September 9, 2022 following the passing of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn his speech, he paid tribute to his mother, saying: “Throughout her life, Her Majesty The Queen -my beloved Mother – was an inspiration and example to me and to all my family, and we owe her the most heartfelt debt any family can owe to their mother; for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example.”\n\n“Queen Elizabeth’s was a life well lived; a promise with destiny kept and she is mourned most deeply in her passing. That promise of lifelong service I renew to you all today,” King Charles continued.\n\n“The role and the duties of monarchy also remain,” King Charles said, highlighting his responsibility towards the Church of England and his own deep-rooted faith.\n\n“As the queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I, too, now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation,” he said.\n\n“And wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the Realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavor to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life,” he added.\n\nAccording to royal.uk, some of the roles of the monarchy that remains in practice include: to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters and by convention, to not vote or stand for election; however, they do have important ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the government of the UK.\n\nWhich countries recognise Charles as king?\n\nLike his mother, Charles is the king of the UK as well as 14 other nations, including Canada and others in the Asia-Pacific and Caribbean referred to as the Commonwealth realms.\n\nThey are distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations, a loose association of 54 former British Empire members, the majority of which are now sovereign.\n\nThe Commonwealth realms collectively have about 150 million residents, with the UK, Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand having the highest populations.",

    "Britain pessimistic on Scotland's future in Union despite royal moment of unity": "Fewer than one in three Britons believes that Scotland will still be part of the United Kingdom by 2050, The National can reveal.\n\nEven the patriotic fervour of the mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II did not convince Britain that its destiny is to stay together, polling data shows.\n\nA state-of-the-nation survey by Deltapoll for The National also reveals a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Brexit more than two years after the UK left the EU, a move that changed the dynamics of the Scottish independence debate.\n\nA narrow majority of Britons saw Brexit as a bad thing, and 46 per cent said it had gone worse than they expected, compared to only 19 per cent who were pleasantly surprised.\n\nAsked about Scotland, only 31 per cent said it would still be part of the union by mid-century, while 48 per cent said it would not.\n\nOpinion was more closely divided on Northern Ireland, with 46 per cent expecting it to stay in the UK and 32 per cent predicting it will leave, as nationalists gain strength on both sides of the Irish border.\n\nOnly Wales, where nationalists are a smaller presence on the political landscape, is seen as highly likely to stay put, with 61 per cent believing it will and 19 per cent saying it will not.\n\nOther findings in the wide-ranging exclusive poll:\n\n.\n\nThe poll was conducted during the first four days of mourning for the late queen, who typically spent her summers in Scotland and died at Balmoral Castle, a Highland country retreat that belonged to her personally.\n\nIn a procession highly charged with British tradition and symbolism, her coffin was taken from Balmoral to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, then lay at rest in St Giles’s Cathedral before her final journey to London.\n\nBut people polled during those days of remembrance for the queen had little confidence that the union would long survive her, despite the brief outbreak of national pride.\n\n“As far as attitudes to independence are concerned, it probably won’t make a huge amount of difference,” Mark Diffley, a researcher and analyst on Scottish public opinion, told The National.\n\n“The proposition for independence does not include Scotland becoming a republic. It includes retention of the monarchy. So you can vote for independence and be a monarchist.”\n\nThe queen came to the throne in 1952 when Britain still had vestiges of the imperial might that once cemented Scotland’s place in the union, but her 70-year reign saw a growing clamour for self-government north of the border.\n\nHer deep attachment to Scotland pushed her about as close as she ever came to expressing a political view, most notably in the last days of the referendum campaign in 2014 that ended with a No vote to independence.\n\nProcession of Queen Elizabeth II's coffin in Edinburgh - in pictures\n\nExpand Autoplay Members of the royal family arrive to attend a vigil at St Giles' Cathedral, in Edinburgh, on Monday for Queen Elizabeth II. AFP\n\nThe queen’s guarded comment that people should “think very carefully about the future” was interpreted as a subtle nod to the No campaign, without making any explicit endorsement that would have compromised her neutrality.\n\nDavid Cameron, the prime minister at the time, later had to apologise after letting slip that the queen had \"purred down the line\" when he briefed her on the result.\n\nA similar coded comment came in 1977, during a time of debate over Scottish devolution, when the queen told parliament: “I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”\n\nScottish nationalists have sought to make a virtue of the monarchy’s popularity, saying the 419-year-old union of the crowns would continue in an independent Scotland and highlighting the queen’s links to the country.\n\n“Indeed, while she was everyone’s queen, for many in Scotland she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots,” said Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons, during parliamentary tributes.\n\nBut there have long been doubts, from Scotland to the Caribbean to Australia, over whether the queen’s heirs would be able to match her popularity in countries considering loosening ties with Britain.\n\nKing Charles III visited the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh during the mourning period for the late queen. AFP\n\nMr Diffley said it was too early to assess King Charles III’s popularity in Scotland, but said the monarchy was a little less popular than in the UK at large and that younger people in particular were less enthused.\n\nBut although a good chunk of Yes voters would support a Scottish republic, it is generally a low priority and “there’s not really any votes in this,” he said.\n\n“Even pro-independence supporters and the first minister herself would say that there will be challenges in terms of currency, trade, borders and membership of the EU. The last thing you want to do is to throw in, ‘also, by the way, we’ll get rid of the monarchy’.”\n\nThe SNP wants to call a second Scottish independence referendum in 2023 but the UK government says the question has been settled for a generation, arguing that it alone has the power to sanction such a vote.\n\nWhen The National visited the historic Scottish border town of Coldstream last year, there was much despair at the thought of an international border running along the River Tweed.\n\n\"If we had voted yes in 2014, Scotland would be bankrupt right now,\" said Ian Fraser, 49, from Lanarkshire, a Scottish expat who lives in Dubai.\n\n\"Our annual deficit is too wide and there are never any answers on the main topics, like the five year budget forecast, the currency, how we would get back into the EU and the borders. It's quite scary, truth be told.”\n\nBut the SNP’s argument is that Brexit has effectively invalidated the 2014 referendum because Scotland voted that year, by a 55-45 margin, to remain in an EU-member Britain that no longer exists.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they got dragged out of the EU by the English. I think they have every right to have another referendum based on the new reality,\" said fellow expat Michael Bowles, 51.\n\nScottish nationalists, seen here at a rally in Edinburgh, hope to hold a second referendum in 2023. AFP\n\nNationalists may be bolstered by the finding that Brexit is not proving popular. While 52 per cent of Britons said leaving the EU was a bad thing, more than six years after the referendum, only 39 per cent saw it as a good thing.\n\n\"Obviously not being part of the EU is helping our cause,\" said Wendy Miller, 59, an independence supporter from Aberdeenshire. \"We need to secure our referendum,\" she said.\n\nMs Miller, who lives in Dubai, said she was a big supporter of the idea of an independent Scotland. “We need to secure our referendum,” she said. “Obviously not being part of the EU is helping our cause.”\n\nThe poll confirmed a strong generational divide on Brexit. While 70 per cent of millennials had a negative view of Brexit, 55 per cent of those in the baby boomer generation saw it as a good thing.\n\nIn addition, there was a lukewarm response to the bilateral trade deals touted by Brexit supporters as one of the main advantages of Britain’s economic autonomy.\n\nOnly 34 per cent said post-Brexit trade deals had been a good thing, while 43 per cent thought they were a bad thing.\n\n“Intuitively, those who see that Brexit has overall been a good thing for the UK also harbour positive views to whether Brexit has gone better than expected and the trade deals the UK government has signed post-Brexit,” Deltapoll’s polling report said.\n\n“They are also more supportive of focusing on building relationships with countries outside the EU and either maintaining or having a weaker relationship with the EU.”\n\nDeltapoll interviewed 2,096 adults in Britain between September 9 and 12.",
    "Camilla to be known as Queen Consort as Charles becomes King": "King Charles III has ascended to the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, aged 96. You can read an obituary to the Queen, who reigned for 70 years, here. You can also follow all the latest updates on this breaking news story here.\n\nHer death means a number of significant changes in Royal titles. Aside from the most obvious transition of Prince Charles becoming King Charles there is also a new title for his wife who until now has been known as the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nCamilla is, as the wife of the King, the Queen. Her style is now Her Majesty rather than Her Royal Highness. She is a Queen Consort, as was the Queen Mother, rather than a Queen Regnant who rules in her own right, such as Elizabeth II. Ahead of Charles and Camilla’s wedding in 2005 royal aides said Camilla did not want to be Queen and “intended”, when the time came, to be known as Princess Consort instead – a title which has never been used before in British history.\n\nBut just a few weeks before their nuptials the government confirmed that legislation would be needed for Camilla not to become Queen automatically on Charles’s accession, no matter what she wished to style herself. Elizabeth II ended years of controversy in February 2022 when she publicly endorsed her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort in her Platinum Jubilee message to the nation.\n\nCharles, who was the Prince of Wales, is now King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is also King of other Commonwealth realms. His style is His Majesty rather than His Royal Highness. Read his tribute to his mother here.\n\nCharles is also Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The monarch has been known by the title Defender of the Faith ever since it was bestowed on Henry VIII as “Fidei Defensor” by the Pope in 1521 for his early support for Roman Catholicism.\n\nWhen Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church in 1534 he was named Supreme Head of the Church of England. This was repealed by Mary I but reinstated during the reign of Elizabeth I who was proclaimed Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nIn 1994 Charles, a passionate advocate of religious tolerance, caused controversy when he told of his desire to become “Defender of Faith” rather than “Defender of the Faith” when king. But he later indicated in 2015 that he would still be sworn in as Defender of the (Anglican) Faith when he became king. “It always seems to me that while at the same time being Defender of the Faith you can also be protector of faiths,” Charles said.\n\nAccording to the Privy Council website the new monarch will proclaim an oath at the Accession Council which will begin: “I, (his name as King) by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of my other Realms and Territories King, Defender of the Faith....”\n\nKing Charles III is also now the Duke of Lancaster. Revenue from the Duchy of Lancaster – the hereditary landed estate – forms a vital component of the sovereign’s income. Elizabeth II was also the Duke of Lancaster. This is only a custom for sovereigns, rather than a legal title. When Henry V, who held the title before he acceded to the throne in 1413, became king, the dukedom merged with the crown and has not been officially recreated.\n\nREAD MORE:",

    "Everything to Know About the Union Jack, United Kingdom's National Flag": "The Union Jack, also known as the Union Flag, is the national flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories, and is rooted in a 400-year history.\n\nIt is largely associated with ideals of pride and patriotism, which is why the flag has been proudly scattered and sported among the tens of thousands of spectators who have lined the streets to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's long life and reign following her death.\n\nWhile the Royal Standard flag was draped over Her Majesty's coffin during the funeral and several processions, it differs from the Union Jack in that it represents the Sovereign and the United Kingdom.\n\nBoth flags were notably used to signify the Queen's presence in Buckingham Palace. The Royal Standard would only fly when she was there, while the Union Jack would fly when she was not.\n\nIn the wake of the Queen's death, the Union Jack is to be flown at half-mast. (The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast — \"even after the death of a monarch, as there is always a Sovereign on the throne.\")\n\nFrom the Union Jack's origin to the meaning behind its multiple crosses, here's everything to know about the United Kingdom's national flag.\n\nWhich countries does the Union Jack flag represent?\n\nHollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe Union Jack flag is the national flag of the United Kingdom. It represents the four countries that are united under one Sovereign, including England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland — though since 1921, only northern Ireland has remained a part of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn addition, commonwealth countries have incorporated the Union Jack within their flags to signify the history of British settlement, including Australia, New Zealand, and Tuvalu.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. state of Hawaii, several Australian states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia), and three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario) feature Union Jack on their flags.\n\nWhy is the United Kingdom's national flag called Union Jack?\n\nEd Ram/Getty\n\nThere is much debate about the exact origin of the Union Jack flag's name. In the 16th century, it was initially called the British flag and in 1625, the word \"Union\" was introduced.\n\nWhen the flag was first created in 1606, it was ordered primarily to fly at sea, situated atop the main masthead of all English and Scottish ships, warships and merchant ships. Before the 1600s, the term \"jack\" was used to describe a small flag flown at the bow of a ship.\n\nSome believe the \"Union Jack\" title dates back to Queen Anne's reign from 1702 to 1714, per the royal family's official website. Others believe it derives from the \"jack-et\" of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who formed the first union in 1603.\n\nAnother alternative is that the name is rooted in a proclamation by Charles II, \"that the Union Flag should be flown only by ships of the Royal Navy as a jack,\" the royal family website also notes.\n\nWhat do the colors and crosses on the Union Jack flag represent?\n\nZac Goodwin - WPA Pool/Getty\n\nThe Union Jack consists of three heraldic crosses combined: Saint George's Cross of England, Saint Andrew's Cross of Scotland and Saint Patrick's Cross of Ireland. The layout of the flag has evolved since the first Union Flag — which is what it was initially known as — was created in 1606.\n\nThe first Union Flag only consisted of England's red cross of Saint George on a white background combined with Scotland's white diagonal cross on a blue background. But since it is not considered permissible to have red on a blue background, according to heraldry, the red cross had to be bordered with white.\n\nIt wasn't until Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom in 1801 that Saint Patrick's Cross was added to the flag, represented by the diagonal red cross on a white background.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nWhen is the Union Jack flag flown?\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty\n\nInitially, the Union Flag was recognized as a Royal Flag. When its present design was deemed official in 1801, it was ordered to be flown solely on all the King's forts and castles.\n\nPrior to the Queen's death, the Union Jack was flown above Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Sandringham when she was not in residence. Following her death, it is flown at half-mast.\n\n\"The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast, as the Sovereign never dies (the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor),\" the royal family's official website states.\n\nGovernment buildings must fly the Union Jack flag on Royal Family birthdays, Commonwealth Day, Coronation Day, The Queen's official birthday, Remembrance Day and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament.\n\nIn more recent years, U.K. government buildings have been encouraged to fly the flag all year round. In the wake of the Queen's death, the Union Jack flag — in addition to all official flags — should be lowered to half-masted until 8 a.m. on the day after the Queen's state funeral.",

    "Will Prince William be Prince of Wales? How royal titles have changed after the death of the Queen": "Queen Elizabeth II’s death at the age of 96 means that the UK has a new monarch for the first time in more than 70 years.\n\nThe accession of King Charles III means that the order of succession shifts, with Prince William now the heir to the throne.\n\nAs a knock-on effect, the royal titles of many senior royals have changed – here’s everything you need to know, and if William automatically replaces Charles as Prince of Wales.\n\nHow have royal titles changed after the Queen’s death?\n\nCharles – King\n\nCharles, who was the Prince of Wales, is now King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nHe is also King of other Commonwealth realms.\n\nHis style is His Majesty rather than His Royal Highness.\n\nCharles is also Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England\n\nThe monarch has been known by the title Defender of the Faith ever since it was bestowed on Henry VIII as “Fidei Defensor” by the Pope in 1521 for his early support for Roman Catholicism.\n\nWhen Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church in 1534 he was named Supreme Head of the Church of England. This was repealed by Mary I but reinstated during the reign of Elizabeth I, who was proclaimed Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nIn 1994, Charles, a passionate advocate of religious tolerance, caused controversy when he told of his desire to become “Defender of Faith” rather than “Defender of the Faith” when king.\n\nBut he later indicated in 2015 that he would still be sworn in as Defender of the (Anglican) Faith when he became king.\n\n“It always seems to me that while at the same time being Defender of the Faith you can also be protector of faiths,” Charles said.\n\nAccording to the Privy Council website, the new monarch will proclaim an oath at the Accession Council which will begin: “I, (his name as King) by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of my other Realms and Territories King, Defender of the Faith….”\n\nAs well as taking the throne, Charles becomes the Duke of Lancaster (Photo: AP)\n\nCharles is now the Duke of Lancaster\n\nRevenue from the Duchy of Lancaster – the hereditary landed estate – forms a vital component of the sovereign’s income. Elizabeth II was also the Duke of Lancaster.\n\nThis is only a custom for sovereigns, rather than a legal title. When Henry V, who held the title before he acceded to the throne in 1413, became king, the dukedom merged with the crown and has not been officially recreated.\n\nCamilla – Queen Consort\n\nCamilla is, as the wife of the King, the Queen.\n\nHer style is now Her Majesty rather than Her Royal Highness.\n\nShe is a Queen Consort, as was the Queen Mother, rather than a Queen Regnant who rules in her own right, such as Elizabeth II.\n\nAhead of Charles and Camilla’s wedding in 2005, royal aides said Camilla did not want to be Queen and “intended”, when the time came, to be known as Princess Consort instead – a title which has never been used before in British history.\n\nBut just a few weeks before their nuptials, the government confirmed that legislation would be needed for Camilla not to become Queen automatically on Charles’s accession, no matter what she wished to style herself.\n\nElizabeth II ended years of controversy in February 2022 when she publicly endorsed her daughter in law to be known as Queen Consort in her Platinum Jubilee message to the nation.\n\nWilliam – The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge, as heir to the throne, is now the Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nAs Charles’s eldest son, he has inherited the title the Duke of Cornwall.\n\nWilliam’s great-great-grandfather, George V, combined the Cornwall title with his existing dukedom in 1901.\n\nHe became the Duke of Cornwall and York, when his father became Edward VII – but only remained so for nine months after which he was created, and was known as, the Prince of Wales, on the orders of the king.\n\nAs the 25th Duke of Cornwall, William is entitled to the multimillion-pound annual net surplus from the Duchy of Cornwall landed estate. The income will cover the cost of both his public and private life.\n\nWilliam is not yet the Prince of Wales\n\nWilliam will, at some stage, be given the title the Prince of Wales – which is traditionally used for the male heir to the throne.\n\nBut this not automatic and William needs to be created so by his father. The same stands for the Earl of Chester.\n\nWilliam’s Scottish titles\n\nWilliam has also inherited the Scottish titles the Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.\n\nDuke of Rothesay – This title of the Scottish peerage was first conferred by Robert III, King of Scots, on his son David in 1398. An act of the Scottish Parliament in 1469 confirmed its restriction to the heir apparent to the throne of Scotland.\n\nWilliam and his (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSince the 1603 Union of the Crowns, the title has descended alongside the Dukedom of Cornwall.\n\nEarl of Carrick and Baron of Renfrew – Other titles of the Scottish peerage inherited by the heir to the throne under the 1469 Act.\n\nLord of The Isles – This ancient title, held by those who ruled the Western Isles as vassals of the King of Scotland, was annexed to the Crown by James V of Scotland in 1540, to be passed to his heirs.\n\nPrince and Great Steward of Scotland – The hereditary office of Great (or High) Steward dates from the 12th century. The 1469 Act confirmed that the title should go to “the first-born prince of the King of Scots for ever”.\n\nKate – The Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge is now the Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nUntil the Queen’s death, Camilla was the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nWhen William becomes the Prince of Wales as expected, Kate will become the Princess of Wales – last used by William’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, when she was married to Charles.\n\nCamilla was also technically the Princess of Wales but never used the title because of its association with Diana.\n\nKate will also hold the title the Countess of Chester, if William becomes the Earl of Chester.\n\nShe is also now the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland – also previously Camilla’s title.\n\nGeorge, Charlotte & Louis\n\nWilliam and Kate’s children have become Prince George of Cornwall and Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cornwall and Cambridge, and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nThey will eventually become “of Wales” when William is the Prince of Wales.\n\nArchie\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor is now technically a prince due to rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n\nWhen Archie was born he was too far down the line of succession for such a title according to George V’s restrictions, but now, as the son of a son of a sovereign, he can be an HRH and a prince.\n\nArchie was allowed to become Earl of Dumbarton – one of the duke’s subsidiary titles – when he was born, or could have been known as Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, but Buckingham Palace said his parents had decided he should be plain Master Archie instead.\n\nIn the Sussexes’ bombshell Oprah interview, Meghan, however, claimed Archie was not made a prince because of his race – even though George V’s rules meant he was not entitled to be one.\n\nIn 2021, it was suggested Charles – in a bid to limit the number of key royals – intended, when he became king, to prevent Archie becoming a prince.\n\nTo do so, he will have to issue a Letters Patent amending Archie’s right to be a prince.\n\nUntil that potentially happens, Archie remains a prince, whether his parents choose to use the title or not.\n\nIf it does not happen, Archie continues to technically be HRH Prince Archie of Sussex.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s titles will not change. The couple have stopped using their HRH styles, but they still retain them.\n\nLilibet\n\nArchie’s younger sister Lilibet “Lili” Mountbatten-Windsor is now technically a princess.\n\nIf she uses the title, she will be HRH Princess Lili of Sussex.\n\nLike Archie, Charles would have to issue a Letters Patent to remove this.\n\nAdditional reporting from Press Association"
