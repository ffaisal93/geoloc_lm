    "China becomes ‘hothouse’ of intrigue ahead of crucial Communist party congress": "Purges of senior officials and unfounded rumours of military coups in Beijing have fed into feverish speculation ahead of a key meeting of China’s ruling party next month, when president Xi Jinping is expected to be granted an unprecedented third term.\n\nThe jailing of a clique of senior security officials for corruption, followed by days of strange and quickly dispelled rumours of Xi being under house arrest, have fuelled what one analyst called a “hothouse” environment mired in secrecy and suspicion.\n\nLast week, a Chinese court jailed the former vice-minister of public security Sun Lijun, the former justice minister Fu Zhenghua, and former police chiefs of Shanghai, Chongqing and Shanxi on corruption charges. Fu and the police chiefs had been accused of being part of a political clique surrounding Sun, and being disloyal to Xi.\n\nThe round-up was one of the biggest Chinese political purges in years, and came just weeks before the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) most important political meeting – the twice a decade party congress – where the political elite are reshuffled around the various positions of power in the one-party state.\n\nXi is expected to be reappointed as leader of the party and military commission at the meeting, after he abolished the two-term limit in 2018 and waged a years-long anti-corruption campaign that also targeted many political opponents.\n\nOn Sunday state media announced the list of CCP central committee delegates, numbering almost 2,300, had been finalised. Xi’s inclusion on the list further refuted social media rumours that had been swirling since Saturday of a military coup. The unfounded claims – accompanied by unsourced videos of military vehicles and based mostly on mass flight cancellations – were debunked, but not before it began trending on Twitter.\n\nThere was no specific mention of the coup rumours on China’s social media, but a Weibo hashtag related to “airports across the country cancel flights” was viewed by more than 200,000 people over the weekend.\n\nSome made fun of the rumours, noting the lack of any evidence of a political takeover on the ground in Beijing.\n\nDrew Thompson, a scholar with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said a coup in China wasn’t entirely implausible, and Xi had reportedly shown concern about the prospect in the past, but the weekend’s rumours looked more like “wishful thinking”. They appeared to originate in accounts associated with the Falun Gong movement, which Thompson said was “essentially not credible”.\n\n“The rumour that Xi Jinping has been arrested has legs because it is such a sensitive political moment in China, and the recent trials (and convictions) of long-serving senior officials creates a hothouse atmosphere,” he said on Twitter.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping Photograph: Sergei Bobylev/AP\n\nThompson, who is also a former US state department official, told the Guardian the Falun Gong media often exaggerated or highlighted their opposition to Xi and the CCP in their reporting. “In this case those themes they have highlighted and reported on for a long time suddenly broke into the mainstream.”\n\nOther analysts like Sinocism author, Bill Bishop, said he thought the rumours were “BS” but the “inherent opacity” of the CCP mechanisms easily fuelled their spread.\n\nThe party congress is a secretive process of power distribution, with the most senior positions not announced until the final day. Government control of the domestic narrative and crushing of dissent has intensified in recent weeks as the meeting approaches.\n\nXi has been absent from the public eye since he returned to China from the SCO Summit in Uzbekistan last weekend. Observers said he is likely to be quarantining.\n\n“I think the fact this rumour spread so far, and was considered plausible enough to analyse is really a reflection of an underlying shortcoming of Chinese governance,” said Thompson.\n\n“It really is a story about the opaqueness and the uncertainty around high-level Chinese succession. If you look back through history, to 1949, succession between top leaders has been fraught. Hu Jintao was the first successful transition of power where no one was imprisoned or died … Xi Jinping has created an entirely new paradigm where no successor has been identified, which raises questions about what would succession look like if it was unplanned or uncontrolled?”\n\nChina’s government has not responded to the rumours, but public security authorities were among those posting under the hashtag “the truth about large-scale cancellation of flights across the country”, disputing the significance of the cancellations which they said was normal for the pandemic.\n\nThe party congress begins on 16 October. The event, in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, is closed to the public but is the most important date on the CCP’s five-year political cycle. There is speculation that Xi could further consolidate power with the promotion of stronger allies to senior positions, and that the party will resurrect the “people’s leader” title, not used since Mao Zedong.",
    "China’s business schools embrace the state agenda": "At Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, in Beijing, first-year domestic MBA students began a new mandatory course this month: Socialism Theory and Practice with Chinese Characteristics in the Xi Jinping New Era, featuring the paramount leader’s ruling ideology.\n\n“You may see this as a constraint as some non-business elements are added to the curriculum,” says Liu Qiao, dean of Guanghua. “But, from another perspective, the course addresses many of the same environmental, social, and governance topics western business schools are teaching.”\n\n“We emphasise the Communist party’s leadership because it cares about these issues,” adds Liu.\n\nThe overhaul is likely to have far-reaching implications for how China nurtures its next generation of business leaders, as Beijing develops what it describes as a cleaner, more equitable and innovative economy in the wake of political tensions abroad and real estate turmoil at home.\n\nMany students say they welcome the course. Lu Yining, a former financial services professional in Shanghai, says he enrolled at Guanghua this year in order to study the motivation behind China’s public policy that increasingly holds the key to business success in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nLu Yining, a student at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, is keen to ‘understand’ motivations for state policies\n\n“It makes little sense to confront the authority,” argues Lu, referring to the backlash against Beijing’s crackdown on the “disorderly expansion of capital”. He says: “I want to understand how these policies originated.”\n\nGuanghua is among numerous Chinese business schools that are adjusting their curriculum to champion Xi’s policy mantras, ranging from common prosperity to private sector regulation.\n\n“The government hopes business education could serve the country’s strategic needs,” says Guanghua’s dean Liu. “That is going to create a profound impact on everything from launching new programmes and updating the curriculum, to recruiting students and placing them in the newly prioritised sectors.”\n\nWhile traditional subjects, such as marketing and corporate finance, still form the basis of the curriculum, Chinese business schools have made a big push to design courses and case studies focused on China’s political economy as it grows increasingly apart from the west.\n\nLu Xiongwen, dean of Fudan University School of Management, says the first thing his students should study is “politics — and especially comparative politics”, so they can better navigate geopolitical tensions that weigh on business.\n\n“We need to understand how the US turned from being very friendly with, and supportive of, China to seeing us as a major enemy,” says Lu, who encourages students to take a course on relations between the world’s top two economies.\n\n“It is not enough to study how to price and package a product in an attractive manner,” he adds. “Huawei’s mobile phone business, which outperformed Apple for a few years, fell sharply after losing access to [US] chips. How could you understand Huawei without knowing politics?”\n\nWe are not aiming to make every student think in the same way\n\nChina’s state-dominated financial services industry is another area that requires a localised curriculum, say students.\n\nJames Wang, an MBA student at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, says he benefited “hugely” from the financial regulation course that discussed how local government financing vehicles became a formidable force in China’s bond market.\n\n“The best place to study LGFV bonds is China because they do not exist in other parts of the world,” says Wang.\n\nThough public discussion of political and business topics is subject to heavy censorship in China, the country’s business schools provide more opportunity for debate.\n\nBai Chong-En, dean of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, says his students are able to have a “thorough” discussion, sometimes with opposing views, of business topics ranging from common prosperity to climate change.\n\n“We are not aiming to make every student think in the same way,” says Bai. “We are hoping they could have a good understanding of the issues . . . so, they are able to do well by doing good.”\n\nGuanghua’s Liu shares that view: “I won’t be a smart professor by saying you are necessarily wrong for not supporting strong regulation.”\n\nStudents also say they are free to speak their mind. Wang recalls heated discussions in class at SAIF on whether Beijing should block Ant Group’s blockbuster public listing after its founder Jack Ma made a provocative speech two years ago. The Ant listing was shelved in November 2020.\n\n“There is nothing we can’t talk about,” says Wang. He points to how some of his classmates complained about the regulatory requirement that newly listed firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen must make more detailed disclosure of their ownership structure, following the revelation that investors with ties to senior officials had taken stakes in Ant.\n\nBut the business education reform goes beyond the curriculum. It also affects whom to admit. Multiple business schools say they prefer applicants with a background in technology or manufacturing over those with real estate or finance experience who, until a few years ago, were popular candidates.\n\nThis shift is not only a product of China’s property meltdown, but also an answer to Beijing’s call for the country’s leading business schools to focus on training technology leaders amid growing US-China rivalry and geopolitical tension.\n\n“We have a duty to serve national interest that stresses technology innovation and prioritises the real economy over the virtual one,” says Xue Jian, deputy dean of Tsinghua SEM.\n\nOn the school’s top-ranked executive MBA programme, almost two-thirds of first-year students have worked in tech — a jump from almost 50 per cent a year ago. In contrast, the number of property and finance professionals, who once accounted for half of the student body, has shrunk “dramatically”, says Xue.\n\nBut this growing embrace of the state’s agenda by China’s top business schools raises the question of how they plan to expand their global influence. The issue is complicated by Beijing’s stringent zero-Covid policy, which has curbed international travel to and from China even as most countries have reopened borders.\n\nAt Guanghua, international students will also sit a mandatory course, called “Lecture series on contemporary China”, which aims to introduce, if not promote, the country’s political and economic policies.\n\n“The pandemic has had a big impact on us,” explains Bai of Tsinghua SEM, adding that some students had been unable to fulfil overseas exchange programmes and international students had struggled to obtain visas to enter China.\n\nDespite these challenges, Guanghua’s Liu says he expects foreign citizens to account for a fifth of students by 2027, provided the zero-Covid policy is no longer in place. The ratio now stands at 10 per cent.\n\nAt Fudan SoM, Lu is less ambitious about recruiting more international students than he is about promoting the use of English in business education, where China still lags behind the west “in many areas”.\n\n“I interview faculty candidates in English,” says Lu, who does not have an overseas degree. “You can’t teach at Fudan SoM if your English is worse than mine.”",
    "EU Chamber in China Releases Position Paper for 2022": "European businesses are concerned about China’s business environment but remain optimistic about the country’s long-term prospects, according to the EU Chamber’s annual position paper for 2022/2023. Among others, the Chamber urges that China should make more pragmatic efforts to rebuild investor confidence and continue its reform and opening up. It also calls both parties to proactively engage with each other and steer away from excessive self-efficiency.\n\nOn September 21, 2022, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EU Chamber) released its annual European Business in China Position Paper for 2022/2023 (position paper).\n\nThe position paper raises a number of concerns about doing business in China, ranging from criticism of the “dynamic zero-COVID policy” to an opaque policy development process. Despite these concerns, European businesses note that China’s unparalleled consumer base and manufacturing capacity make the country a core part of their business plans going forward.\n\nOverall, the position paper presents 967 recommendations based on consultations with members of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. Here, we look at the position paper’s main points and their implications for EU-China trade and investment.\n\nThe risk of two separate systems\n\nThe position paper is critical of policies that risk creating “two separate systems”. This refers to the need for many companies to create distinct policies and procedures when dealing with China compared to the rest of the world, such as developing separate supply chains to navigate the COVID policy.\n\nThe paper argues that China’s COVID policy is inflexible and inconsistently implemented and that they threaten economic growth. In a survey conducted by the Chamber in April 2022, 75 percent of respondents said that the COVID policy had a negative impact on overall operations. Respondents reported that the uncertainty the policy creates is its most significant challenge.\n\nThe paper suggests a way forward for the government to reopen its borders. It argues that the Chinese government should focus on fully vaccinating the population and providing boosters, and predicts that China will not fully open its borders until at least the second half of 2023.\n\nBeyond logistical challenges, the paper argues that some of China’s policies that promote self-reliance and “buy China” are pushing the country towards isolation. This refers to policies such as “Made in China 2025” and “dual circulation”, which many foreign investors and governments worry will reduce opportunities for foreign businesses. Further, China and the US are increasingly instituting trade restrictions that limit the export or import of some products and components made in the respective countries.\n\nIn addition to the economic impacts of such policies, the paper says that China’s increasing isolation is leading to less understanding of the country. It states, “Europe misses the deep level of engagement in hand with China in areas such as arts and culture, sport and tourism”.\n\nWith COVID policies in place, it is difficult for European executives to visit China and attract European talent. The Chamber estimates that the total number of Europeans living in China has halved since the start of the pandemic.\n\nBecause of issues such as these, the paper argues that China is “unable to showcase its potential to foreign investors”. As such, the opportunities presented by the Chinese market – such as its consumer base and manufacturing capabilities – are less visible to European businesses than they otherwise would be.\n\nInadequate policy predictability\n\nThe paper says that the Chinese government’s policymaking has become less predictable and more ad hoc. It notes that many areas of the economy are better regulated than ever, but that some strategic industries are only fully open to state-owned enterprises.\n\nFurther, the paper observes that, in recent years, policies are increasingly implemented in a blanket manner with limited transparency and prior consultation. The paper cites regulatory crackdowns on the tech and tutoring sectors as well as inconsistent energy reduction policies as among the policy developments that have caught large segments of the business community off guard.\n\nAccording to the paper, the growing politicization of business is a factor contributing to a less transparent and predictable environment. The paper recommends that the Chinese government provide conditions to allow companies to conduct trusted third-party audits in order to ensure compliance with global legislation.\n\nMore broadly, the paper states that providing a transparent and predictable environment as well as reaffirming a commitment to reform and opening up would reassure European businesses.\n\nBusinesses aren’t leaving – but they are diversifying\n\nThe paper suggests that European businesses are not leaving China, but that they are diverting some investments to other markets to mitigate risks, whether they relate to policy shifts or trade disputes. However, it warns that potential new entrants to the Chinese market may not take the plunge due to market obstacles.\n\nThe paper notes that between 2006 and 2015, EU FDI into China was relatively evenly distributed between the top 10 investors and the rest. However, over the last four years, the top 10 investors have contributed over 70 percent of total FDI.\n\nThis suggests that European FDI is increasingly concentrated among larger businesses, while small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are investing comparatively less. In light of this trend, the paper says there is an “increasing discrepancy between market potential and the actual market share of European companies.” In other words, European SMEs are not capturing all of the potential of the Chinese market because of access barriers.\n\nDue to China’s unpredictable policymaking environment, the paper states “while those already established in China are not looking to leave, they are increasingly weighing up the possibility of shifting planned or future investments to other markets that are perceived to provide greater reliability and predictability.”\n\nThis sentiment represents the popular “China+1” strategy, where businesses supplement their China operations with investments in other Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Such a strategy allows businesses to mitigate the risks of being overly dependent on one country while capturing opportunities presented by fast-growing emerging markets. The paper says that some companies are looking into “China+1+2+3” strategies to further diversify their risk exposure.\n\nIncreased trade and investment encouraged\n\nWhile the paper includes a variety of critiques of Chinese government policy, it recommends that the EU continue to proactively engage with China and reject calls for disengagement. Rather than pull back, the paper says that the EU should remain deeply integrated with the global economy and steer away from excessive self-sufficiency. This position acknowledges the size and importance of the EU-China economic relationship.\n\nThe EU is the third largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) into China, following Hong Kong and Singapore, though the latter two often act as intermediaries for investment from other countries. In 2021, EU-based entities invested US$5.1 billion in China, about 3.5 percent of the total, slightly down from 3.8 percent in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the EU exported EUR 223 billion (US$215.25 billion) worth of goods to China and imported EUR 472 billion (US$455.61 billion). Through the first seven months of 2022, China’s exports to the EU grew by close to 20 percent, while EU exports to China declined by 7.5 percent.\n\nFor European companies, the paper recommends maintaining strong communications between headquarters and China operations to stay informed and to continue to integrate foreign staff into China operations and Chinese staff into global operations. It further emphasizes the need for European companies to conduct supply chain and global systems analysis, while recommending that businesses monitor political risks on an ongoing basis.",
    "China’s Mistakes Can Be America’s Gain": "Xi Jinping should be enjoying his final days in charge of China. For decades now, the Chinese Communist Party has regularly replaced its senior leadership—a system crucial to the nation’s success—and after 10 years in power, Xi would be due to step aside and allow a new team to guide the country’s future. But when the country’s top cadres meet in Beijing on October 16 for the 20th Party Congress, Xi is widely expected to break precedent and extend his rule for at least another five years.\n\nAlthough this departure from custom has been mooted for years, the news might send a renewed chill down the spine of some in Washington, D.C. Xi has transformed China from the U.S.’s potential partner to its chief strategic adversary. The Chinese leader appears determined to capitalize on his country’s recently acquired wealth to challenge America’s economic primacy, technological advantage, and military dominance, and even its assumptions about the global order that forms the foundation of American power. Five more years of Xi almost certainly means five more years of superpower competition, even confrontation.\n\nThat is the conventional wisdom. But maybe Washington should be grateful Xi is sticking around. China’s leader definitely intends to roll back American global influence, but he may not be doing a good job of preparing his own country to attain that goal. The actual results of his policies suggest that he is weakening, not strengthening, China as a competitor to the United States. The longer Xi remains at China’s helm, the less competitive the country may become.\n\nLost amid the hype about China’s ascent is just how poorly the country has performed under Xi’s stewardship in nearly every aspect of policy. The economy has slowed dramatically. The leadership has given up on meeting its once-sacrosanct growth target. Xi’s aggressive foreign policy has alienated most of the world’s major powers and terrified China’s neighbors in Asia. Many of Xi’s high-profile government initiatives are marred by waste and mismanagement. China’s rise, which Xi has called inevitable, is less, not more, certain because of his rule.\n\nThat alternative narrative has serious implications for American foreign and domestic policy. In response to Xi’s belligerence, policy makers in Washington feel compelled to contest China on every front: diplomatic, economic, technological, military, and ideological. That was the thinking behind the recently signed CHIPS bill, which is designed to ensure America’s continued mastery of the semiconductor industry against China’s high-tech ambitions. The same strategy guided President Joe Biden’s 2021 Build Back Better World, an infrastructure-building program intended to compete with China’s Belt and Road Initiative and vie for influence in the developing world. These policies were based on the premise that China’s capabilities are keeping pace with Xi’s ambitions. The evidence now suggests that Xi’s aims are outstripping the country’s capacity to sustain them.\n\nRead: No more ‘strategic ambiguity’ on Taiwan\n\nThe timing of Xi’s overreach is fortunate for Washington. Amid the partisan rancor and social disorder that has preoccupied the United States in the past five years, American global power has probably been more vulnerable than at any time since World War II. Xi could have taken advantage of that disarray to expand Chinese influence at America’s expense. Instead, his actions have had the effect not only of keeping the U.S. in the game but also, in certain respects, of enhancing its global standing. The worldwide American network of alliances, which had come under severe strain, is arguably stronger now than it has been in years—in part due to Xi’s policies.\n\nXi’s China remains a threat as the only country with both the intent and the resources to undermine the U.S.-led global order. Yet the failings of Xi’s agenda show that the widely held assumption that China’s rise is as unstoppable as American decline is simplistic. Xi wants to be written into the history books as the man who overturned Pax Americana. Instead, he could end up being the one who preserves it.\n\nWhen Xi Jinping claimed power in 2012, most China experts anticipated that he would follow the immensely successful path laid by the “paramount leader” Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s—based on liberalizing economic reforms, integration with the global economy, and a partnership with the United States. Xi had previously served as an official in some of China’s most economically vibrant regions, so he had long experience with Deng’s central principle of “reform and opening up.” Shortly before Xi became the country’s new leader, he had had extensive interactions with then Vice President Joe Biden, which left the impression that Xi valued China’s fruitful relationship with Washington.\n\nAs his rule has unfolded, however, those early assumptions have proved to be wrong. Highly ideological, fiercely nationalist, and obsessed with political control, Xi has deviated sharply from his predecessors’ policies. In so doing, he has altered China’s course in profound and unpredictable ways.\n\nMost dramatically of all, Xi has entirely revised China’s foreign policy. He apparently believes that China’s moment to assume the status of the world’s most powerful country has arrived. Rather than treating Washington as a partner, Xi considers the U.S. to be China’s most dangerous adversary. Instead of immersing China in the American-led global order, Xi is promoting his own vision of a Sinocentric alternative, one that is friendlier to authoritarian regimes. Notably, the Chinese leader has forged a new friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Xi seems to believe can be an ally in his quest to roll back American power.\n\nYet the more openly hostile China has become to the current international system, the stronger U.S. alliances have grown. Xi’s agenda has persuaded the world’s democracies to tighten their ties to the United States and to one another in order to counter the threat he presents.\n\nInitially, European leaders were uncomfortable with Washington’s tougher line on China, insisting on their “strategic autonomy.” This divergence sowed some dissension within the Atlantic alliance. However, Xi’s support for Putin amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has gone a long way toward healing that rift. At a virtual summit in April, ostensibly meant to bolster cooperation between China and Europe, the leaders of the European Union criticized Xi’s pro-Russia stance, warning him against aiding Putin’s war effort.\n\nThen, in June, the leaders of Washington’s four main partners in the Pacific—Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand—participated in a NATO summit for the first time to discuss the Chinese threat. This was a sign that a more coordinated or fully united alliance that brought together the democratic powers in Europe and Asia might be possible. In addition, India—usually wary of entangling itself in superpower competition—has become more active in the Quad (a security partnership that also includes Australia, Japan, and the U.S.). This suggests that India sees the group as a potential bulwark against Beijing, which has alarmed Indian leaders by pressing territorial claims along the two countries’ disputed border.\n\nRead: Zero COVID has outlived its usefulness. Here’s why China is still enforcing it.\n\nXi seems not to care about these effects of his actions. In mid-September, on his first international diplomatic trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Xi chose to meet Putin, thumbing his nose at the United States and its European allies. He has also pressed ahead with his undiplomatic diplomacy, which has at times descended into threats and demands delivered by his appointees. In a July meeting with his Australian counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi blamed the two countries’ strained relations on Canberra’s “irresponsible words and deeds.” He went on to say that they could be improved—if Australia avoided “being controlled by any third party”—that is, the U.S.—according to an official Chinese summary of the conversation.\n\nShortly after that, China’s foreign ministry directly threatened the U.S. that it would “pay the price” for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which Beijing perceived as a violation of its sovereignty. (The government in Beijing considers Taiwan part of China.) A few days later, a senior Chinese official warned the Israeli ambassador to Beijing not to allow the U.S. to influence Israel’s approach to China, with a tactless claim that the Jews and the Chinese share a common grievance as victims of the West.\n\nAs a consequence of all this, China’s image has deteriorated sharply around the world, according to a recent survey of 19 countries, mostly major democracies, by the Pew Research Center. Xi himself fares poorly, too, with respondents in many countries expressing little or no confidence that the Chinese leader will “do the right thing” in international affairs.\n\nChina is perceived somewhat more favorably in parts of the developing world, and Beijing’s foreign policy has become increasingly focused on winning support in what’s called the “Global South.” But even there, Xi blunders. China, for instance, failed to corral the small nations of the South Pacific into a security and economic pact, in part because of Beijing’s arrogance. Henry Puna, the secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum, a regional policy organization, said in a July briefing that local leaders had rejected the initiative because Chinese officials had presented them with fully drafted documents for the pact without consultation. “If anybody knows what we want and what we need and what our priorities are, it’s not other people—it’s us,” he said.\n\nXi isn’t doing much better at home, particularly with China’s economy. Growth has slowed significantly on his watch. In 2012, at the start of his tenure, the economy grew 7.8 percent, but this year the International Monetary Fund forecasts a meager 3.3 percent expansion. A reduction in the rate of growth was probably inevitable as the economy developed, but Xi’s policies have likely made matters worse.\n\nThe key to China’s decades-long economic boom was the withdrawal of state intervention in the economy and its opening to overseas trade and investment, which allowed private enterprise to thrive. To some extent, Xi has reversed that—enough to undercut some of the most vibrant sectors of the economy and divert capital and talent into wasteful endeavors, such as a slate of state-led industrial programs.\n\nThe most obvious sign of that shift is the extensive new regulatory burden imposed on private companies. Some of it is well intentioned—ensuring that food-delivery workers get better treatment, for instance—but all of it has been introduced haphazardly and has curtailed the expansion of some of the country’s most important companies. The once-flourishing private-education industry, which offered after-school classes for college-hungry kids, has suffered layoffs and heavy financial losses after an edict forbidding these businesses from making money out of teaching core-curriculum subjects to most students. One prominent technology firm, the ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, has suffered so much harassment from a cybersecurity investigation and restrictions on its operations that its share price has plunged by more than 80 percent since its initial public offering a year ago.\n\nRead: When Biden went to China\n\nInstead of propelling fresh economic growth, the tech sector as a whole has been downsizing and laying off employees. That has made jobs harder to find for recent college graduates: In July, youth unemployment reached an all-time high of nearly 20 percent (though it improved slightly in August).\n\nXi’s motivations appear part ideological, part purely political. He seems to fear that Big Business, and especially the tech sector, could amass sufficient influence and wealth to pose a challenge to Communist rule. Party officials have said plainly that they want greater control over the management of private enterprises, and Xi himself has spoken of the “need to prevent the disorderly expansion and unchecked growth of capital.” Xi prefers instead state-led endeavors that he can more easily superintend. The government has provided lavish investments, subsidies, and tax breaks to support industries that Xi’s bureaucrats favor in sectors they want China to dominate, including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough these industrial programs are in too early a phase to pass final judgment on, and there are a few signs of progress, the results so far are generally not encouraging. One observer, Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted in a recent essay that in spite of huge government support, “there is almost no sector where China is the dominant technology leader.”\n\nOne of the most high profile of these state-driven missions—to develop a semiconductor industry advanced enough to make the country self-reliant—has been plagued by corruption. To date, it has made only glacial progress in catching up to industry leaders in the U.S., and has not come close to reducing the Chinese economy’s dependence on foreign-made chips.\n\nXi’s apparent distrust of free-market reforms has also exacerbated the economy’s most dangerous weakness: its broken growth model. Chinese policy makers and economists worldwide have long warned that China’s growth is too dependent on investment, which is often debt driven and excessive—squandering resources on unnecessary apartments, factories, and infrastructure. Xi continued the practice of pumping credit into the economy whenever it slowed below the party’s preferred target, and he’s suffering for it today. Debt has risen steeply during Xi’s tenure, from less than double national output in 2012 to almost triple today.\n\nThe consequences are emerging in the bloated but vital property sector. A government attempt to rein in highly indebted developers led to a crisis last year at one of the industry’s giants, Evergrande, and the sector’s troubles have deepened. With developers defaulting, property sales falling, real-estate prices sinking, and new construction slumping, the instability of the sector represents a risk to the nation’s banks, which are deep in property-related lending, as well as to the wealth of the country’s middle class. In a remarkable indication of diminished public confidence, families across the country recently engaged in a “mortgage strike”—suspending payments on unfinished apartments out of concern that cash-strapped builders will never complete them.\n\nXi is adding to these woes with his strict pandemic controls. Undoubtedly, the biggest achievement of Xi’s tenure was limiting COVID-19’s hold in China and averting the scale of public-health crisis that so many other countries have suffered. But Xi’s mandate that COVID cases must be kept at or near zero has become an intolerable burden on the nation. Recurring closures of major cities and industrial zones have stifled travel, output, and commerce. Hardest hit have been the smallest businesses, those neighborhood restaurants, salons, and corner shops that provide crucial urban employment.\n\nAmid the strain of quarantines and joblessness, domestic discontent has reached an unusually high level. The government faced widespread resistance in imposing its two-month COVID shutdown of Shanghai earlier this year. Residents confined to their homes banged pots and pans and screamed out of their windows to protest the harsh restrictions. In Beijing, where residents must still present a recent negative COVID test in order to ride the subway or eat in a restaurant, testing stations have become targets for vandalism, in some cases defaced with graffiti reading “Give me liberty or give me death.”\n\nThe sources of public dissatisfaction are not limited to the lockdowns. In July, hundreds of protesters from all over the country massed in the central city of Zhengzhou after their bank deposits were frozen thanks to a local financial scandal.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: A Russian defeat in Ukraine could save Taiwan\n\nThe angry mood seems to have overwhelmed efforts to censor criticism on Chinese social media. “People are not happy!” proclaimed one recent post on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “Your government positions are secure but people at the bottom are having a hard time surviving.”\n\nThe evidence of rising discontent with Xi’s government is anecdotal, of course. In an environment without free speech and a free press, what the Chinese public really thinks about Xi Jinping is impossible to gauge. But the willingness of ordinary citizens to risk reprisals for their displays of defiance—in Zhengzhou unidentified thugs assaulted protesters with the apparent complicity of local authorities—is a measure of how frustrated people are with the current state of China.\n\nNone of these diplomatic, economic, or social problems appear likely to derail Xi’s quest for a third term. They may, however, make his rule unpredictable. The more China’s fortunes fade, the more of a threat Xi may become—not unlike his friend Putin. Xi has shifted toward nationalism to legitimize his hold on power. Hence Beijing’s heightened rhetoric on issues such as Taiwan, and the relentless anti-American propaganda from its foreign ministry and state media. Xi needs enemies abroad to deflect public disaffection with his failures at home.\n\nFor Washington, Xi’s continued rule presents both dangers and opportunities. The correct strategy will be to ensure that tensions do not escalate into conflict, while capitalizing on Xi’s missteps to bolster American power. This approach involves a delicate balance, one fraught with the possibility of war. But if Washington manages the situation well, the U.S. could reap the benefits of Xi’s rule and make China bear the costs.",
    "China’s Economy ‘Dismal,’ Will See No Growth, New Report": "In this handout photo released by Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry, Chinese President Xi Jinping attends ... [+] the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (Uzbekistan Presidential Press Service via AP) Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry\n\nCommunist China under premier Xi Jinping is wilting fast.\n\nThe economy, already under pressure so far this year, looks set to get even worse, according to a recent report from London-based consulting firm Capital Economics.\n\nCapital kicks off with the following blistering assessment of the situation:\n\n“The financial world’s focus on a generational surge in inflation in advanced economies is stealing attention from a generational slowdown in China that is arguably of much greater importance for the long-term global outlook.”\n\nIn other words, ignore China’s economic worsening quagmire at your peril.\n\nAlready we know that China’s steel production is falling, down 5.7% in the year through August, according to the World Steel Association. That country has long been the world’s largest producer of steel so the decline is meaningful on a global scale.\n\nWorse still, only two of the top global producers performed worse over the same period: Russia and Turkey. Both are economic basket cases.\n\nThe hits keep on coming. Exports from Korea to China fell during the first three weeks on September, the Capital report says. At the same time, Korean exports to the U.S. grew.\n\n“This may be a sign that global demand for the consumer goods that China produces – and to which Korea provides inputs earlier in the production chain – is softening,” the Capital report states. My emphasis.\n\nPut simply, retail customers globally are pulling back and thats already hurting China.\n\nMonthly data for August show declining retail sales inside China as well and Capital expects further declines in September.\n\nWhen the experts put all this together the outlook is bleak.\n\n“We recently lowered our forecast for this year’s officially-reported GDP growth rate to 3% from 4% – the government’s 5.5% target set in March has been quietly abandoned – but in reality don’t expect the Chinese economy to grow at all.”\n\nPut another way, China’s growth under Xi likely dropped to zero from regular double-digit gains.\n\nIt’s not the sort of achievement most leaders want.",
    "China says US sending ‘dangerous signals’ on Taiwan": "China has accused the United States of sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on Taiwan after the US secretary of state told his Chinese counterpart on Friday that the maintenance of peace and stability over Taiwan was vitally important.\n\nTaiwan was the focus of the 90-minute, “direct and honest” talks between the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, on the margins of the UN general assembly in New York, a US official told reporters.\n\n“For our part, the secretary made crystal clear that – in accordance with our long-standing one-China policy, which again has not changed – the maintenance of peace and stability across the Strait is absolutely, vitally important,” the senior US administration official said.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry, in a statement on the meeting, said the US was sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on Taiwan, and the more rampant Taiwan’s independence activity, the less likely there would be a peaceful settlement.\n\n“The Taiwan issue is an internal Chinese matter, and the United States has no right to interfere in what method will be used to resolve it,” the ministry cited Wang as saying.\n\nTensions over Taiwan have soared after a visit there in August by the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi - which was followed by large-scale Chinese military drills – as well as a pledge by the US president, Joe Biden, to defend the self-governed island.\n\nBiden’s statement was his most explicit to date about committing US troops to the defend the island. It was also the latest instance of his appearing to go beyond a longstanding US policy of “strategic ambiguity”, which does not make it clear whether the US would respond militarily to an attack on Taiwan.\n\nThe White House has insisted its Taiwan policy has not changed, but China said Biden’s remarks sent the wrong signal to those seeking an independent Taiwan.\n\nIn a phone call with Biden in July, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, warned about Taiwan, saying “those who play with fire will perish by it”.\n\nThe state department had said earlier that Blinken’s meeting with Wang was part of a US effort to “maintain open lines of communication and manage competition responsibly”, and the senior official said Blinken had reiterated US openness to “cooperating with China on matters of global concern”.\n\nBlinken also “highlighted the implications” if China were to provide material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or engage in wholesale sanctions evasion, the official added.\n\nUS officials have in the past said they had seen no evidence of China providing such support.\n\nBlinken “underscored that the United States and China and the international community have an obligation to work to counter the effects of that invasion and also to deter Russia from taking further provocative actions”, the official said.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as one of its provinces. Beijing has long vowed to bring Taiwan under its control and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.\n\nTaiwan’s government strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s 23 million people can decide its future.\n\nTaiwan’s foreign ministry, responding to the meeting between Blinken and Wang, said China’s “recent provocative actions” had made the Taiwan Strait a focus of discussion, and China was trying to “confuse the international audience with arguments and criticisms that contradict reality.”\n\nBlinken’s meeting with Wang was preceded by one between the foreign ministers of the Quad grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US, which issued a statement, referring to the Indo-Pacific, saying that “we strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo or increase tensions in the region”.\n\nSince Pelosi’s visit “China has taken a number of provocative steps that have by design acted to change the status quo”, the US official said.\n\nThe US vice-president, Kamala Harris, will discuss Taiwan security during bilateral meetings with the leaders of US allies Japan and South Korea when she visits them next week, another US official said.\n\nDaniel Russel, the top US diplomat for Asia under president Barack Obama, said the fact Blinken and Wang had met was important after the turbulence brought by Pelosi’s visit, and hopefully some progress would have been made towards arranging a meeting between Xi and Biden on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in November, which would be their first in-person as leaders.\n\n“Wang and Blinken’s decision to meet in New York does not guarantee the November summit will go smoothly or that it will even occur,” said Russel, now with the Asia Society. “But had they been unable to meet, it would have meant the prospects for a summit in November were poor.”",
    "When asked about China, Australians tend to think of its government, not its people": "Official relations between Australia and China have been strained in recent years. The two countries have been involved in a trade dispute since 2020, when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and China responded by imposing new tariffs. The worsening relationship has also been evident in public opinion surveys: Australia saw the sharpest increase in negative views of China of any country surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2020, and those negative views remain widespread in Australia today.\n\nTo better understand how Australians think about China, the Center asked Australians in a 2021 survey to describe – in their own words – the first thing that comes to mind when they think of China. Researchers then analyzed the 1,127 responses with a focus on the first five topics that Australians mentioned.\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to get a better sense of Australians’ attitudes about China at a time of tension between the two countries. The analysis examines responses from Australians who were asked to describe, in their own words, the first things that come to mind when they think about China. To do this, we surveyed 1,127 Australians from March 15 to 29, 2021, and coded their responses. We coded the first five mentions in each open-ended response using a researcher-developed codebook. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAustralian adults most frequently mentioned the political system when thinking about China (29%). Some specifically critiqued the government. For example, one Australian man said, “Chinese leadership is a threat to the rest of the world.”\n\nOther Australians listed government actions, such as one woman who referenced “punishment for those who speak out about the government.” Some comments about the government were more neutral, such as “Different forms of government need to be respected.”\n\nA public focus on China’s government – rather than its people – is consistent with other recent Pew Research Center findings about China, including in the United States. The Center has also found a similar pattern in survey respondents’ views of countries other than China: Americans, for example, are more likely to have a negative view of Israel’s government than its people.\n\nIn Australia, the share of respondents who brought up China’s political system in their open-ended responses included 15% who described how political power was distributed across or exercised in the country. Many simply used labels such as “undemocratic,” “authoritarian” and “oppressive.” One Australian man called it a “totalitarian one-party state.” An Australian woman described a “strongly focused government that will seek conformity from citizens.” Another 9% of respondents specifically pointed to communism or the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which is set to convene its National Party Congress in October, when President Xi Jinping is expected to assume a third term.\n\nA country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you. Australian woman\n\nIn other responses to the Center’s survey, nearly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%) mentioned some perceived threat that China poses to the world, their region, Australia or China’s own people. Most responses in this category focused on China’s general quest to be the most powerful country (7%) or its perceived poor international conduct (7%), including mentions of manipulation and bullying on the world stage. One Australian woman said she thought of China as “a country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you.”\n\nThreats were more commonly top of mind for Australians ages 60 and older, as well as those who support Australia’s governing party – which, at the time of the survey, was the Liberal-National coalition, led by former Prime Minister Scott Morrison. (The current prime minister is Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party.)\n\nFor some Australians, China poses an economic or military threat (referenced by 4% each). Perceived economic threats included “working their way into different countries by lending,” using “trade sanctions to try and force their way or take revenge,” or simply “economic manipulation.” Mentions of China’s military included phrases such as “military strength,” “a military threat” or “military expansion.”\n\nFor roughly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%), human rights abuses were one of the first things to come to mind when thinking of China, and 11% specifically mentioned lack of freedoms in the form of government repression and censorship. One man described the country as “a powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition.” Words like “conformity” and “thought control” also came up, as well as mentions of restricted freedom of expression for Chinese citizens.\n\nA powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition. Australian man\n\nThe share of Australians who mentioned human rights included 4% who mentioned the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghur people, an ethnic minority group in the Xinjiang region of northwest China. Some explicitly used the word “genocide,” and others referenced “concentration” or “re-education” camps. One Australian woman said, “I have grave concerns about the Uyghurs and the way they are being rounded up and put into the so-called re-education centers. It seems as if there is another holocaust happening with these people.”\n\nRoughly a fifth of Australian adults who offered an answer (18%) brought up the economy when thinking about China, including 4% who described the current state or growth of its economy. An Australian man referred to China as an “economic powerhouse that managed to bring a billion people out of poverty in a few decades with cheap labor.” Others focused on China’s manufacturing prowess (3%), including an Australian woman who called China “the world’s factory.” An equal share of Australians (3%) mentioned trade, including China’s tariffs on some Australian goods. Fewer mentioned topics such as cheap or poorly manufactured products, or China’s status as an economic powerhouse.\n\nAbout one-in-ten Australians who provided an answer (8%) mentioned the size of China’s population in their responses. For example, one woman said, “Big population,” and another referenced “population overflow.”\n\nA similar share of Australian respondents (7%) offered generally positive evaluations of China. Some of these respondents identified things associated with China, such as one woman who wrote, “pandas, the wall of China, dumplings.” Others mentioned China’s culture and history, including another woman who mentioned China’s “rich artistic, economic, trading and scientific history.” Positive responses were more common among Australians ages 18 to 29 than those 60 and older. When it comes to overall favorability of China, younger Australians also have more favorable views of China than older ones.\n\nAustralia called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020, and a small share of Australians who volunteered an answer mentioned COVID-19 in their answers (6%). This included references to the origins of the coronavirus with mentions of “wet markets” and “Wuhan,” as well as references to China’s response to COVID-19. Others said they held China responsible for the pandemic due to insufficient containment efforts or alleged that the Chinese government engaged in a cover-up to conceal the country’s role in the spread of the virus. One woman said, “The first thing that comes to mind is selfish! If they had come forward when they were first aware of the risks of the virus and shut their borders to contain it, the world would not be suffering the way it is now.”\n\nThe people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry. Australian woman\n\nAnother 6% of Australians who offered their views about China brought up the Chinese people. One woman said, “The people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry.” Another woman said, “[I] have worked with some lovely Chinese people but have concerns about the attitude of the country’s ruling party towards other countries and their policies.”\n\nSome specifically referenced Chinese nationals abroad – especially those living in Australia – and a perception that they failed to assimilate to local culture. Others spoke to the long-standing history of people of Chinese origins living in Australia, such as one woman who said, “[There are] many Chinese living in Australia and have been for a long time and are part of our history. White Australia has often been racist towards Chinese.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government received largely negative evaluations in Australians’ responses, only 1% of responses expressed negative views of the Chinese people (compared with the 4% of responses that described the people of China in a positive light). Negative responses included words such as “selfish” and “unsympathetic.” In contrast, positive sentiments mentioned traits such as “hard-working,” “ingenious” and “family oriented.”\n\nA small share of Australian respondents (3%) brought up China’s environmental impact. One woman said she’s “been to China on business & for personal reasons. I’ve been north, south, east and a reasonable way west. I’ve never seen the horizon, because of the ever-present pollution.”\n\nAnother 3% of respondents spoke about China as a general or political world power. These included an Australian woman who called China a “world power with serious potential.”\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nTopic China Global Image",

    "Russia’s allies China and India call for negotiations to end Ukraine war": "China and India have called for a negotiated end to the Ukraine war, stopping short of robust support for traditional ally Russia.\n\nAfter a week of pressure at the United Nations general assembly, Russia’s foreign minister took the general assembly rostrum to deliver a fiery rebuke to western nations for what he termed a “grotesque” campaign against Russians.\n\nBut no major nation has rallied behind Russia, including China, which just days before the February invasion of Ukraine had vowed an “unbreakable” bond with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nChina’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on Russia and Ukraine to “keep the crisis from spilling over” and from affecting developing countries.\n\nAny annexed territory will have Russia's ‘full protection’, says Sergei Lavrov – video\n\n“China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to facilitate talks for peace,” Wang said on Saturday.\n\n“The fundamental solution is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.”\n\nDuring his visit to the United Nations, Wang met Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in their first talks since the war began.\n\nEarlier this month Putin acknowledged Chinese “concerns” about Ukraine during a meeting with his counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nUS officials have been heartened by what they see as China’s lack of concrete backing for the war and said that Beijing has declined requests to send military equipment, forcing Russia to rely on North Korea and Iran as its own supplies dwindle.\n\nChina’s reaction to Russia is being closely watched for clues on its approach to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nWang held firm that China would take “forceful steps” against any interference, insisting that efforts to prevent “reunification” with Taiwan would be “crushed by the wheels of history”.\n\nIndia, unlike China, has a warm relationship with the United States but it has historical ties with Russia, its traditional defence supplier.\n\n“As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\n“Our answer, each time, is straight and honest – India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there,” he said.\n\n“We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out.”\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at a news conference declined to answer whether there has been any pressure from China.

    "China is using civilian ships to enhance navy capability and reach": "Aerial view of fishing boats setting sail to South China Sea for fishing on August 16, 2022 in Yangjiang, Guangdong Province of China. Liu Xiaoming | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nA Chinese scientific ship bristling with surveillance equipment docked in a Sri Lankan port. Hundreds of fishing boats anchored for months at a time among disputed islands in the South China Sea. And ocean-going ferries, built to be capable of carrying heavy vehicles and large loads of people. All are ostensibly civilian ships, but experts and uneasy regional governments say they are part of a Chinese civil-military fusion strategy, little concealed by Beijing, that enhances its maritime capabilities. China's navy is already the world's largest by ship count, and has been rapidly building new warships as part of a wider military expansion. It launched its first domestically designed and built aircraft carrier in June, and at least five new destroyers are on the way soon. The buildup comes as Beijing attempts to exert broader influence in the region. It is increasing its military activities around the self-governing island of Taiwan, seeking new security agreements with Pacific islands and building artificial islands in disputed waters to fortify its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which the U.S. and its allies have challenged. The civilian vessels do more than just augment the raw numbers of ships, performing tasks that would be difficult for the military to carry out.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the South China Sea's Spratly Islands, for example, China pays commercial trawlers more than they can make by fishing simply to drop anchor for a minimum of 280 days a year to support Beijing's claim to the disputed archipelago, said Gregory Poling, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. \"China is able to use nominally civilian vessels that are clearly state directed, state paid to eat away the sovereignty of its neighbors, but then plausibly deny that the state is responsible,\" he said. China has been using civilian fishing trawlers for military purposes for decades, but has significantly increased the numbers recently with the creation of a \"Spratly Backbone Fleet\" out of a government subsidy program begun under President Xi Jinping, which helps cover building new vessels, among other things. Those ships \"largely appeared almost overnight\" after China constructed port infrastructure a few years ago on the artificial islands it built in the Spratlys that could be used for resupply, Poling said. Now there are about 300 to 400 vessels deployed there at any given time, he said. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and others also have claims to the Spratly Islands, which sit in a productive fishing area and important shipping lane, and are thought to hold untapped reserves of natural gas and oil. But the Chinese ships deter other trawlers from fishing in the area, and have been slowly displacing them from the grounds, with little that governments can do, said Jay Batongbacal, who heads the University of the Philippines' Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea. \"Because they are ostensibly civilian fishing vessels, navies' ships are unable to deal with them lest China accuse the Philippines of provoking an incident and using force against civilians,\" he said. \"They take advantage of perceived `grey zones' below the threshold for triggering a self-defense response.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nIn one highly publicized incident, a steel Chinese trawler in 2019 rammed and sank a wooden-hulled Filipino boat at anchor northeast of the Spratly Islands, abandoning its crew to be rescued later by a Vietnamese fishing boat. Despite a diplomatic protest from the Philippines, China denied the incident was intentional, calling it an \"accidental collision.\" In addition to about 800 to 1,000 commercial fishing boats in the Spratly fleet, China has approximately 200 other vessels as part of a professional maritime militia, according to a November study co-authored by Poling based on an analysis of official Chinese reports, satellite imagery and other sources. The professional militia is better equipped, with trained crews and under direct state control, and is used for more aggressive operations such as harassing foreign oil and gas operations, Poling said. In the event of a conflict, China's use of civilian vessels would complicate the rules of engagement, he said. \"You don't want to treat every Chinese fishing boat as if it were an armed combatant, but, in fact, some of them may well be armed combatants,\" Poling said. China has also been deploying civilian research vessels for military-related tasks in areas where its navy would be unable to operate without provoking a response, said Ridzwan Rahmat, a Singapore-based analyst with the defense intelligence company Janes. \"If you deploy grey hull vessels, your adversary may also deploy a grey hull vessel as a reciprocal measure, so that makes it more dangerous for everyone,\" he said, referring to the typical color of military ships. \"So to avoid this, China has been deploying white hull vessels — to reinforce its presence without escalating things.\" There are also many Western export controls prohibiting sensitive technology from being sent to China for military use, which China is able to bypass by building such civilian ships, even though \"in everything but name they're military,\" Rahmat said. The autonomously piloted Zhu Hai Yun is believed to be one such ship, capable of launching airborne, surface and underwater drones \"to carry out marine scientific research,\" according to the Chinese state-run Global Times. The ship, which completed its first autonomous sea trial in June, could also create military maps of the South China Sea floor, including important submarine lanes around Taiwan, Rahmat said. \"China has been increasing its submarine deterrent patrols, and in order to ensure it can do this it needs to map the underwater terrain,\" he said. China's methods drew the ire of regional rival India last month when it sought to dock the Yuan Wang 5 in Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port, not far from India's southeast coast, for refueling at a time that New Delhi was preparing to test a new missile. The vessel is officially a scientific research ship equipped with sensors that can be used to track satellites, but the same equipment can be used to gather data on a missile launch.\n\nwatch now\n\nSri Lanka, in the midst of an economic crisis and heavily reliant on aid from India, initially declined to allow the ship to dock over India's concerns. But China operates the Hambantota Port, having been granted a 99-year lease on the facility — built with Chinese money — after Sri Lanka defaulted on loans in 2017. After high-level consultations with Beijing, Sri Lankan authorities backtracked and allowed the Yuan Wang 5 to dock from Aug. 16 to Aug. 22. On Aug. 23, India successfully tested its new surface-to-air missile designed to defend a ship from close-range aerial threats. \"I suspect the launch was delayed until the Chinese spy ship was gone,\" Rahmat said. China hasn't tried to disguise its military use of civilian ocean-going ferries, which have had to meet defense standards since 2016 allowing them to accommodate military vehicles like tanks, said Mike Dahm, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer who has written on the topic for the U.S. Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute. Slickly produced state television videos showing trainloads of military vehicles and troops boarding the vessels and heading to sea, stating openly they are testing \"how to use civilian transportation resources to execute military tasks.\" The latest such exercise wrapped up earlier this month. This could be meant to intimidate Taiwan, which China claims as its own and has not ruled out attempting to take by force, and also dovetails with the Chinese government's message that the public is contributing to national security, Dahm said.\n\nwatch now",
    "Managing the risks of US-China war: Implementing a strategy of integrated deterrence": "Executive Summary\n\nOngoing disagreement between China and Taiwan about the desirability of unification and intensified competition between the United States and China are pressurizing the three-way relationship. If the United States is to maintain a constructive role in preventing the outbreak of a cross-Strait war, it will need to implement a strategy to deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan that is consistent with U.S. interests and capabilities, and that provides clarity around the existentially important matter of preventing nuclear escalation, in the event a conflict does occur. The inclusion in the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy of the concept of “integrated deterrence” is a sensible approach to doing so. It can be enhanced by: reaffirmation of the U.S. One-China policy; investment in conventional capabilities suited to the geography of the Western Pacific and resilient to China’s military concept of systems warfare; clear signaling about the economic and political consequences of aggression against Taiwan; and decreasing U.S. domestic vulnerabilities to Chinese embargoes and cyber attacks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nChina’s economic and military rise is changing geopolitics globally. No region is either immune to or insulated from the push-and-pull between China’s growing role in international politics and U.S. wariness about it. Nowhere, however, are these dynamics emerging as quickly or as dangerously as they are in East Asia itself, and in particular in the already delicate politics of the relationships among China, Taiwan, and the United States. The combination of China’s desire to expand its influence, the U.S. desire to maintain its own, and Taiwan’s history, international aspirations, and role in the global economy makes the island’s status an especially contentious and combustible issue.\n\nOngoing disagreement between China and Taiwan about the desirability of unification and intensified competition between the United States and China are pressurizing the three-way relationship. If the United States is to maintain a constructive role in preventing the outbreak of a cross-Strait war, it will need to implement a strategy to deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan that is consistent with U.S. interests and capabilities, and that provides clarity around the existentially important matter of preventing nuclear escalation, in the event a conflict does occur. Some prevalent thinking in the United States today errs in believing either that U.S. conventional military supremacy in and around Taiwan can be realistically restored to what it once was, or that threats of nuclear escalation could be wisely employed by Washington in the event of a serious crisis.1 The United States also remains too slow to improve its own resilience against possible Chinese economic, cyber, and/or military attack.",

House prices in China have fallen in each of the 12 months since Evergrande’s now prophetic warning, with Xi Jinping’s government now preparing to throw billions of dollars at a property market that experts say increasingly resembles a giant Ponzi scheme.\n\nPrices for new homes in 70 Chinese cities fell by a worse-than-expected 1.3% year on year in August, according to official figures, reflecting a turbulent 12 months in which China’s housing sector has gone from an unstoppable driver of growth and prosperity to being the chief threat to the world’s powerhouse economy.\n\nNearly a third of all property loans are now classed as bad debts – 29.1%, up from 24.3% at the end of last year, according to research by Citigroup this week – with once safe state-owned property developers driving the increase.\n\nThe crisis at Evergrande, then China’s second biggest property developer, has spread through the industry to the point where the government’s pledge this week of 200bn yuan (£26bn) to kickstart investment was judged by analysts to be well short of what was needed.\n\nThe rating agency S&P said at least 800bn yuan would be needed – or even 10 times that much in the worst-case scenario – to rescue a property market in which priceshave fallen, sales have slid, developers have gone bust and buyers have staged an unprecedented and widening mortgage boycott in protest at having paid largely upfront for homes that have not been finished.\n\nThe market is experiencing a total collapse in confidence, analysts say, and only government intervention can save the day.\n\nAn unfinished development by China Evergrande Group under demolition order in Danzhou, Hainan province. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters\n\nAbout 2m off-plan homes remain unfinished across China, according to a rough estimate by S&P. That figure will grow if sales continue to fall and developers continue to run out of money to complete projects.\n\n“China’s property downturn has turned into a crisis of confidence that only the government can fix,” S&P said. “If falling sales tip more developers into distressed territory, things will get worse. The distressed firms will halt construction on more pre-sold homes, hitting buyers’ confidence further. Our rough estimate is that about 2m unfinished homes presold by Chinese developers are now in limbo. This has shattered confidence in this market.”\n\nFor years, preselling homes – mainly apartments in large blocks and newly styled urban villages – kept the developers flush with cash and, along with borrowing on an epic scale, meant they could buy more land and keep building. In 2021, about 90% of homes were sold off plan in China.\n\nBut Xi’s decision two years ago to crack down on “reckless” lending starved developers of their funding and, when the music stopped, it emerged they could not finish homes they had already taken money for because they had spent it on buying the next parcel of land or project.\n\nPeople walk by a map in Beijing showing Evergrande development projects in China. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP\n\nIn short, it resembles a Ponzi scheme where money taken from new investors is used to pay off existing clients in an ever-decreasing spiral to collapse. It is even how the sober pages of the Economist sees it.\n\nGeorge Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at the University of Oxford, said the Chinese market was not quite a classic Ponzi scheme in the style of Bernie Madoff’s notorious scam that was exposed after the global financial crisis, but it was very similar.\n\n“Developers raise huge amounts money from customers to basically fund the purchase of the next construction projects. This continues on and on before it has got to the size it has,” Magnus said. “It’s not strictly a Ponzi in the asset management sense, the Madoff style, but they’re essentially using clients’ money to fund the next project, so yes, it’s the standard definition of what that means.”\n\nThe property market accounts for anywhere between 20% and 30% of China’s gross domestic product. This is a huge proportion compared with other large economies, and is thanks partly to the country’s investment-led economic model that has prioritised construction. As a result it has bred a hitherto blind faith in the property values, which have risen more or less uniformly for the past two decades or more.\n\nBut with repeated lockdowns also depressing the market, the longstanding belief that prices can only ever go up is starting to wane. This could lead to Chinese households moving 127tn yuan out of property in the next nine years and into other investments such as equities, bonds and wealth management products, according to the brokerage and investment group CLSA, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\n“People are losing confidence in the presale model,” said Magnus. “It’s a reboot of the Chinese mortgage market … the hallowed asset of property. The fabled rising middle class of China are not in great shape along with lockdowns as well.”\n\nChina’s president, Xi Jinping, stands with delegates during the closing ceremony of the 19th party congress in Beijing. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP\n\nThe situation presents a major challenge for the Xi government, especially with the all-important party congress coming up in October when the president will seek to become ruler for as long as he wants.\n\nBut although his government is pushing for the restructuring of failing developers such as Evergrande and hoping to spread the debt burden across state-owned enterprises, banks and local governments, the pain is likely to fall on ordinary Chinese – just as it does on ordinary investors when a Ponzi scheme eventually collapses.\n\nAnne Stevenson Yang, a co-founder of the US-based J Capital Research and a China expert, said the regime in Beijing was more interested in protecting the state-owned enterprises, institutions and billionaire owners of companies than homeowners – and that would inform its response to the crisis.\n\n“There’s what they can do and there’s what they will do,” she said. “What they can do is to transfer money to households such as by gifting apartments, allowing people to live in places where mortgages are unpaid, and boosting pensions so people have confidence and spend again.\n\n“But that’s not of course what is going to happen. The Chinese political system is not built around individuals, it’s built around companies, they are the constituents. The political system operates through them.\n\n“The property market was not designed to be a Ponzi scheme – a Ponzi scheme needs to be designed. But it is an investment bubble. And the bubble has ended.”",

    "China in the Age of Surveillance": "China’s security apparatus may not be able to see into the minds of the people, but it can make their lives a misery in the attempt.\n\nHe could feel the State’s bright eyes gazing into his face.\n\n~Vasily Grossman, Life and Fate\n\nOn April 3rd, 2011, the Chinese artist and outspoken dissident Ai Weiwei was apprehended by a large crowd of police at an airport in Beijing. Nothing at all was heard from him for the next three months. I still remember my own fear at the time: I knew details, unfortunately, of the various and barbaric tortures previously inflicted on dissenters like Gao Zhisheng. But when the artist re-emerged in June, he said that he had not been physically abused. Instead, he had been kept in a tiny room under 24-hour bright lights, always accompanied by two silent policemen. They would stand and watch Ai as he slept and showered and used the toilet. Every 12 hours, the shift would end and two new policemen would take up their positions. This peculiar form of psychological torture continued for 81 long days.\n\nThe purpose, we must assume, was to instil in the artist’s mind a sense of being permanently watched. For the rest of his life, whenever he began planning an art piece or dissident activity, he will be unable to shake the feeling that the eyes of the authorities are boring into his skull. The experiment’s success was questionable: after his release, Ai rigged up four surveillance cameras outside his Beijing home in apparent mockery. He also created the installation “S.A.C.R.E.D.” (“Supper, Accusers, Cleansing, Ritual, Entropy, Doubt”) consisting of realist models of Ai and his captors positioned in a variety of scenes inside six shoulder-height replicas of his detention cell. Ai Weiwei left the country for good in 2015, but seven years on, his surveillance-themed works are more appropriate than ever. Ai’s experience in detention was really a harbinger for the Chinese people; a microcosm of the nation’s future. Today, Xi Jinping is creating the most heavily-surveilled state in history.\n\nThere are now an estimated 540 million CCTV cameras in China. Cameras watch citizens as they shop and dine. Cameras stare at residents as they leave home in the morning and return at night. In the office, cameras spy on workers inside toilet cubicles. And if you, the Chinese citizen, are particularly unfortunate, you may arrive home one day and find that a camera has been installed within your property. Supposedly a quarantine measure, it crouches there on the cabinet wall like a hostile creature that has somehow found its way in—watching as you eat, watching as you watch TV; a silent, unwanted houseguest. Cameras also lurk in the homes of the mentally ill. The state considers them too volatile to live unmonitored, but no apparent thought has been given to the special torment produced by an ever-present eye during periods of psychological distress.\n\nA Chinese company in Xiamen installed surveillance cameras inside toilet cubicles to monitor its staff. A viral image on Weibo showed photos it took as evidence and staff caught smoking were fired as punishment. pic.twitter.com/RD9xtSuGYj — Rachel Cheung (@rachel_cheung1) September 14, 2022\n\nChina is home to eight of the world’s 10 most surveilled cities (the luckless occupants of Chongqing live at number one). And the surveillance camera of 2022 is a very different animal to the one we remember from our childhoods. It has evolved a whole new set of features: facial recognition, gait recognition, body scanning, geo tracking. Police in Zhongshan city are now using cameras that can record audio within a 300-foot radius. Their plan is to analyse the audio using voice recognition software and then combine the results with that same camera’s facial recognition data, quickly identifying targets.\n\nThe nation’s schoolchildren are monitored throughout the day. Party media reports that cameras record students’ facial expressions and log “whether they look happy, upset, angry, fearful, or disgusted.” Some will learn, of course, to mask their feelings permanently. But others won’t be able to preserve that private space. They will internalise the watching eye of the authorities, like a grotesque Freudian superego, and their thoughts will never really be their own. Schools down in the southern regions of Guizhou and Guangxi have taken an extra step toward dystopia. Should any of their students manage to slip away from the cameras’ gaze, an alarm will be triggered—uniforms now come with microchips in the shoulders.\n\nThe eyes of the Party hang above and all around as you walk through the city, but they also peer out from your jacket, your jeans, your purse. Smartphones have become all but indispensable in China. Most people use Alipay and WeChat for everything from flight tickets to family shopping, from their morning coffee to their monthly bills, and the CCP is making full use of this opportunity to harvest data and monitor online behaviour. COVID-19 has proved a blessing for Beijing: health-code apps help the authorities to stalk a person’s movements. In Xinjiang, where the surveillance state has ruled longest, Uyghurs long ago resorted to burying their phones in the back garden and freezing the data cards inside dumplings.\n\nThat smartphone in your pocket is like a bright flashing beacon to the Party’s ubiquitous phone tracking devices, which lurk within cameras, or nearby, resembling WiFi routers. The trackers hunt for specific red flags such as Uyghur-to-Mandarin dictionary apps, which would identify the phone owner as a member of the oppressed Uyghur ethnic group. But they also scour your mobile for personal details like social media usernames, regardless of your ethnicity. Some of the trackers are called “WiFi sniffers,” hiding on public WiFi networks to spy on phone activity. Others are called “IMSI-catchers.” They masquerade as mobile towers, luring your phone into making a connection. Once connected, your personal material can be raided, your conversations tapped, etc.\n\nThe CCP has always suffered from a lack of legitimacy (the Party seized power, rather than winning an election), and as a consequence, it relies on implicit social contracts. For the past three or four decades, the contract has involved large numbers of people getting rich at a pace for which history provided no precedent. But those days are over. China’s economy is now facing insurmountable difficulties, and so the contract has been rewritten. Instead of riches, the Party promises safety—the tightest and toughest security in the world.\n\nOfficials trumpet the successes of AI-powered surveillance, most of which we might charitably describe as modest. A decline in unlicensed street vending; less garbage on the streets; more responsible parking of electric bikes. Very occasionally there will be a genuine success—cameras will locate a missing child. Such cases are heavily publicised, along with reports of a rise in detention numbers, dubiously equated with a rise in general safety. All these successes distract from the main issue: invasive surveillance is fast becoming a feature of life for Chinese citizens. In Wuhan, parents take their children to data collection points for iris scans. In Xinjiang, travellers applying for passports are required to provide voice samples. In Zhengzhou, residents queue outside apartment blocks, waiting to have their faces scanned in order to enter their own homes. Everywhere, the masses surrender their biometric markers. And up above, drones disguised as doves hover in the smog, watching.\n\nThe Party is pumping tens of billions of dollars into the creation of what it calls “safe cities.” They will be safe because authorities will enjoy “100 percent coverage,” pooling the information from swarms of smart cameras and phone trackers with 63 different types of police data and a further 115 varieties of data from other government departments—medical history, family relations, religious affiliations, flight records, hotel records, and so on. The systems will hoard data from QR code readers; point-of-sale machines; air-quality monitors.\n\nChina’s police have also been taking every opportunity to collect male Y-chromosome DNA. Their reasoning is as follows: the Y-chromosome picks up relatively few mutations from one generation to the next, so the profile of one man is effectively the profile of multiple males along the same paternal line. Extensive Y-chromosome DNA records should help the authorities to capture a broad snapshot of any male suspect’s family history and geographic ancestry. And so the chilling instructions to police in Gansu province: “Do not miss a single family in each village. Do not miss a single man in each family.” In the view of the Party, as expressed by a former Minister of Public Security, all this big data will make it possible to literally “pinpoint a person’s identity.”\n\nSoon, AI-powered platforms will manage cities, controlling everything from urban planning to electricity consumption to firefighting. Of course, these “safe cities” will just ensure that few people are safe from the authorities and the unsleeping bright eyes of the State. Hangzhou provides a snapshot of the future. China’s tech giants practically run the city, but they are required to share their data with the government so it can be combed for “threats to national security.” In the eyes of a fanatical, paranoid, illegitimate regime, almost any behaviour could fall into this vast elastic category.\n\nAnd other dangers await today’s Chinese citizen. Oddly juxtaposed with all that efficiency, we find the cack-handed sloppiness and corruption that has always followed the CCP. Those vast vaults of data are typically stored on unprotected servers. For a price, details will sometimes be handed over to fraudsters or suspicious spouses. Earlier this year, hackers were able to snatch the personal details of almost a billion Chinese citizens from a Shanghai police database—perhaps history’s biggest personal data heist. The dashboard for accessing the information had been set up on a public web address and left open without a password.\n\nA surveillance state run by incompetents is still immensely dangerous. And Xi’s techno-totalitarian reach stretches far beyond China’s “safe cities” and the country’s borders. The so-called Digital Silk Road unspools across the map in all directions. AI-enhanced cameras are sold to Malaysia in the south and Mongolia in the north. They are shipped out across the Indian Ocean to Sri Lanka. Further west, they are reaching African shores: Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe. On the far side of the world, with the help of Chinese loans, they are now arriving in Ecuador and Bolivia. Safe cities are even coming to Europe, where Serbia’s combination of AI-cameras with joint patrols by Serbian and Chinese police has been specifically designed to make Chinese tourists feel secure; to feel they are still in China, to feel the eyes have never stopped watching them. In fact, the same surveillance tech aids police forces on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. This is not just good business; the Communist Party controls the networks and their data.\n\nAt exhibitions in Shenzhen and Beijing, companies like Huawei, Hikvision, SenseTime, and YITU display the latest surveillance technology, hoping to woo buyers both domestic and international. CEOs rhapsodise to their audiences about the dystopian state they are helping to build (and the West has also helped with this project, lest we forget: China’s safe city industry has plenty of commercial and supply-chain links to US companies). “Over the next twenty to thirty years human society will enter a smart era with omnipresent sensing, all-connectivity, and pan-intelligence,” Huawei executive director Wang Tao enthused at the China Public Security Expo in 2019.\n\nThe next frontier will be micro-expression and emotion-recognition tech. Financial services conglomerate Ping An has begun assessing loan applications with futuristic lie detectors. Ping An boasts that 54 tiny, involuntary facial movements can now be identified in the fractions of a second before the brain assumes full control, allowing for a detailed analysis of whether or not the applicant is being truthful. Meanwhile cameras probe faces at customs, searching for hints of stress or nervousness. The direction is clear: Beijing is attempting to transform into reality that old dystopian trope of thoughtcrime. By sifting through the mountains of data collected on each citizen, policing software can begin to determine patterns of behaviour and intervene in crimes that the perpetrator has yet to plan.\n\nBut the truth is that none of the flashy tech does what the Party thinks it does. There is no such thing as a reliable mind-reading machine. The convoluted motivations and inner world of a human being could never be reduced to eye movements and facial twitches and stress signals, all recorded and categorised by blind, unknowing artificial intelligence. (The only thing that can read a human mind is another human mind: instinctively, in the moment, with little or no understanding of the process.) We are witnessing an attempt to define people in purely rational terms—a variation on the same myopic mistake that Communist Parties have consistently made, all over the world, for a hundred years. They have always failed, and now this Party will fail once again, because human beings are not machines.\n\nWith such failure comes collateral damage. If mannerisms are signs of guilt, then the detentions will never end. The CCP’s paranoid police force already arrests citizens for such depravity as “frequent entry into a residential compound with different companions.” And most arrests already lead to a prison sentence, for the simple reason that torture is typically used to wrench confessions from detainees. Now the new technology is arriving—a technology for which success is measured in the numbers of suspects identified and detained. China’s prisons have always heaved with innocent people; they will need to build many more.\n\nIn the name of order, the Party is delivering chaos. But for all the blundering, Xi’s surveillance state still threatens a closer approximation of true totalitarianism—which means a fuller denial of human liberty—than any previous regime has managed. Neither Stalin nor Mao could look directly into the daily movements, words, and transactions of their subjects like Xi can. Those leaders had agitprop, re-education camps, the Red Guards, the Gulag; Xi has artificial intelligence and big data. There is no competition. China’s Intruder-in-Chief may not be able to literally see into the minds of the people, but he can make their lives a misery in the attempt.\n\nThe surveillance state watches everyone. There is, however, a blacklist consisting of those who require particular attention, and it’s a long one. It extends from fugitives and suspected terrorists all the way through to migrant workers, the mentally ill, and foreigners. (There is also a redlist: government officials, secret police, intelligence agents—the people whose behaviour must never be flagged, no matter how unorthodox.) But the state is most interested in the country’s dissenting voices.\n\nChina has rarely been without its dissidents: those men and women who rise above the herd and stubbornly refuse to be quiet and accept their fate. The Ai Weiweis; the Chen Guangchengs; the Zhang Zhans. They imbibe the same childhood propaganda as everyone else, but to the eternal bafflement of the authorities, they don’t turn out the same as everyone else. Zhang Yuqiao has lived for as long as the Party has ruled, and he is one such exception. For decades, Zhang has been petitioning the government—first seeking redress for the torture of his parents during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and later protesting police harassment of his family.\n\nUp until very recently, when making his trips from Shandong to Beijing to raise his complaints, he needed only to stay off the main roads in order to avoid police interception. Now his task has become more complicated. Before heading to Beijing, Zhang turns off his phone, buys multiple train tickets to the wrong destinations, and hires private drivers to get him round the numerous police checkpoints that spring up today like malign growths all over China’s highways. He would have no chance of making it through one of those checkpoints, not with the new technology in place.\n\nBut this is another crack in the façade of the surveillance state: simple, stubborn human ingenuity, as displayed by Zhang Yuqiao. There will always be some who manage to work around the restrictions. And even in dystopian Xinjiang, pockets of privacy can be found. Personal cars, thickly crowded marketplaces, remote stretches of desert—there are places beyond the eyes and ears of the Party; places where information can be shared and plans made. Xi Jinping wants omniscience, but he won’t find it.",
    "Trafficking Data: China’s Pursuit of Digital Sovereignty": "Advertisement\n\nThe Diplomat author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with Dr. Aynne Kokas – associate professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia; C.K. Yen Chair at the Miller Center for Public Affairs, and author of the forthcoming book “Trafficking Data: How China is Winning the Battle for Digital Sovereignty ” (Oxford, November 2022) – is the 337th in “The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series.”\n\nExplain China’s politics of data governance and pursuit of cyber sovereignty.\n\nThe Chinese government asserts cyber sovereignty, or control over all of China’s digital resources, including servers, user data, technical infrastructure, and tech firms operating in China, both within the country and globally. China’s 2017 Cybersecurity Law requires firms that offer critical information infrastructure in China (broadly defined) to store their data on Chinese government-run servers, allowing the Chinese government access to resources like Apple’s China-based iCloud data. Extending that oversight outside of China, the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law gives the Chinese government control over what it deems as crimes against China’s national security committed outside of Hong Kong, including issues related to data protection. Finally, China’s 2021 Data Security Law empowers the Chinese government to conduct national security audits over firms operating in China that gather user data. These laws are just the tip of the iceberg of China’s efforts to extend data oversight beyond its borders.\n\nAnalyze how China networks sovereignty in the United States.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe Chinese government extends sovereignty in the United States by using networked platforms to assert control over Chinese firms that operate in the United States and U.S. firms that operate in China. Firms and users willingly participate in this trade in goods and services for convenience, profitability, or entertainment.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nTake TikTok, for example: While the firm has made significant efforts to create a firewall between its U.S. and Chinese businesses, its parent company ByteDance remains subject to Chinese government data security audits. As a firm with a dominant presence in the Chinese market through its Chinese social media platform Douyin, ByteDance doesn’t have the luxury of exiting the Chinese market. Yet because the Chinese government has designated TikTok’s algorithm as a national security asset, ByteDance also does not have the option of spinning off its TikTok business. TikTok is the most well-known example, but similar dynamics exist for firms across a wide range of sectors. In my book, I profile everything from farm tools to baby monitors.\n\nWhat is most important to note about how China networks sovereignty is how China’s efforts to extend its cyber sovereignty in the United States build on how the U.S. tech landscape already exploits user data.\n\nIf Chinese social media platforms function as critical infrastructure, as you posit, how are they used as surveillance tools?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media platforms exemplify the exploitative model of U.S. data governance and how that can amplify China’s global digital oversight. Many users are aware that their actions face surveillance on social media. And indeed, surveillance or censorship of users posting politically sensitive content about Hong Kong or Xinjiang has drawn media attention to Chinese platforms like WeChat and TikTok.\n\nHowever, the form of surveillance that more often gets overlooked is what such platforms can do with all the data they collect, surveilling not just individual users but how entire social networks and communities function. Such insights are invaluable for generating and spreading disinformation on those same platforms. They can serve as the backbone of future products that appeal to users more successfully because of their attractive algorithm.\n\nDescribe China’s methods and magnitude of surveilling biodata.\n\nBiodata surveillance is rapidly evolving because of the rapid shifts in China’s COVID-19 policy. The Chinese government has taken the lead globally in developing networked tools to monitor citizens and their movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such monitoring occurs through codes issued to individuals called jiankangma, or health codes, that shape how citizens can move based on their known exposures and health symptoms.\n\nOutside China, Chinese tech firms like Xiaomi gather user biodata through consumer products that monitor everything from heart rate to activity level. Chinese labs also are certified to process tests from the U.S. due to the open system of laboratory standardization in the United States. Most people in the United States don’t realize that HIPAA does not protect their health data internationally. Thus, biodata from the U.S. can supply the Chinese National GeneBank DataBase.\n\nAssess U.S. policy and commercial efforts to counter China’s digital sovereignty.\n\nThe U.S. is in a dilemma. Exploitative data ecosystems that monetize the everyday lives of users with only the most minimal illusions of consent built Silicon Valley. Scholar Shoshana Zuboff refers to this as “surveillance capitalism.” U.S. tech firms have long been an engine of U.S. national power, strengthening the U.S. economy, attracting the best tech talent from around the world, and extending U.S. influence globally. The Chinese government’s efforts to gather user data in the United States build on these exploitative practices. Yet, with China’s efforts to expand cyber sovereignty, the features of this system become bugs.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

Efforts to regulate Big Tech in the Federal Trade Commission have proven difficult. Disagreements within and between political parties have delayed efforts to protect user data security through bills like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. Presidential Executive Orders from both the Biden and Trump administrations faced significant pushback from U.S. firms.

    "The End of Senior Politics in China": "Xi Jinping is the first leader since 1978 not to be constrained by powerful elders in the CCP.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, center, with former presidents Jiang Zemin, right, and Hu Jintao, left, attend the celebration to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China in Beijing, October 1, 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany China watchers consider institutionalization as the key to China’s political stability at the elite level since the 1980s. Andrew Nathan identified the institutionalization of power transitions as one of the main reasons behind China’s authoritarian resiliency. However, as Joseph Fewsmith has noted, what China scholars defined as political institutions in China are nothing more than norms. Since the Deng Xiaoping era, these norms have been constructed and guarded by senior figures in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), who are the main stabilizing force within the Party.\n\nThese seniors (元老) are retired national leaders who remain politically influential through their networks and proteges. They have historically played a significant role in Chinese politics by mediating elite conflicts, forging factional consensus, and setting the direction of policy. They played a vital role in personnel affairs by promoting followers, designating successors, and even deposing the top leader.\n\nThe first generation of seniors emerged during the 1980s. They were Mao’s comrades who were purged during the Cultural Revolution and later revived by Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang. Among them, the eight most powerful figures – known as the Eight Immortals – enjoyed unrivaled political influence. These seniors played an essential role in shaping economic policies during the 1980s.\n\nTwo seniors in particular, the conservative Chen Yun and reformer Deng Xiaoping, led the struggle over China’s future between a planned economy with a market as a supplement and a socialist market economy. Hu Yaobang, the CCP secretary during this period, complained about being sandwiched between the two elderly strongmen, while also facing complaints from Li Xiannian, arguably the third most powerful senior in China, that Hu only followed Chen and Deng while ignoring Li.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nDuring the turbulent five years between 1987 and 1992, senior politics reached a new dimension: Seniors, especially Deng Xiaoping, played the role of kingmaker and king-breaker. They deposed two party secretaries due to what they perceived as “political mistakes” before bringing Jiang Zemin, the party secretary of Shanghai, to Beijing.\n\nEnjoying this article?

He believed that rather than suppressing the movement, the party leadership should address student concerns and pursue democratic reform. However, Deng and other conservative seniors considered Hu “not forceful enough” to counter this bourgeois liberalism. After several meetings in Deng’s house, seniors forced Hu to resign.\n\nAfter Hu’s fall from grace, Deng and the seniors had to pick his successor. Two candidates stood out for the next CCP general secretary: The liberal-minded Premier Zhao Ziyang and Deng Liqun (no relation to Deng Xiaoping), a stubborn conservative and one of the CCP’s best political theorists. Deng Xiaoping worried that Deng Liqun might jeopardize the economic reform process. After receiving a criticism letter, Deng Xiaoping decided to strip Deng Liqun from all his positions, a move that received consent from conservative seniors such as Bo Yibo and Chen Yun. The fall of Deng Liqun paved the way for Zhao Ziyang’s ascension.\n\nIn the end, however, Zhao shared a similar fate to his predecessor. During the Tiananmen protests in 1989, Zhao supported a conciliatory approach toward protestors and vehemently opposed military suppression, which contradicted Deng’s strong-fisted approach. When Zhao admitted to the public that Deng still made all major decisions, Deng viewed it as a personal betrayal, effectively throwing him under the bus. Ultimately, Deng and other senior leaders deposed Zhao for “splitting the party” and placed him under house arrest for the rest of his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the downfall of Zhao, the seniors picked Shanghai Party Secretary Jiang Zemin as the next leader, because of his deft handling of student protests in Shanghai. Jiang was an acceptable figure for both conservatives and reformers.\n\nDeng’s final demonstration of his political influence was his Southern Tour in 1992. Following the Tiananmen protest and the bloody crackdown, many conservatives within the CCP believed that economic reform had brought political chaos. Therefore, the national priority shifted from economic reform to political struggle. In his speech on the 70th Anniversary of the CCP in 1991, Jiang declared that “class struggle will exist in China for a long time.” He emphasized the importance of ideological campaigns, especially the struggle against “peaceful evolution” and “bourgeois liberalization.” Following the speech, many observers claimed that Jiang might assault, even destroy, China’s infant market economy. Thus, Deng believed that he must take action to stop Jiang and conservatives from reversing the “reform and opening up” process.\n\nDuring the winter of 1992, Deng toured the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and gave a speech in which he threatened Jiang, saying that “whoever refused to reform will step down.” According to Li Rui, who was closely connected to the power center, Deng was so worried about the trajectory of reform that he had even decided to depose Jiang. However, other senior leaders like Chen Yun, Li Xiannan, and Bo Yibo stopped him. Bo reportedly told Deng ,“You took down Hua Guofeng, Hu Yaobang, and Zhao Ziyang; you can’t have it your way more than three times (事不过三).” Deng agreed, but Jiang got the message. A year later, Jiang announced that reform and opening “must not change in a long time.”\n\nDeng’s final political legacy was to designate a young Hu Jintao as Jiang’s successor, which started the tradition of a retired top leader appointing the successor of the current leader.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Jiang Zemin quietly consolidated his power as influential senior members passed away. He wrestled away his primary political opponents, Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan, by manipulating the retirement age. By 2002, he demonstrated his power by expanding the Politburo Standing Committee and filling it with his proteges, notably his long-term confidant Zeng Qinghong. The expansion made sure that Jiang maintained his political influence after his retirement. Jiang capitalized on his influence to nurture a relatively open political environment and a wave of political reform during the mid-2000s. The rise of Xi Jinping as Hu Jintao’s successor was also Jiang’s decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Hu was considered a weak leader who ruled under Jiang’s shadow. He could not consolidate power effectively like Jiang, had trouble controlling the Jiang-supporting People’s Liberation Army, and did not even receive the title of “leadership core.” Hu’s weakness was further demonstrated when he failed to promote his protege and the head of the Organization Department, Li Yuanchao, into the Politburo Standing Committee in 2012.\n\nXi’s consolidation of power was the result of consensus among senior leaders. Many seniors believed Hu’s “first-among-equals” leadership style had hindered policy implementation because power was too fragmented. They thought China needed a more “presidential” top leader with centralized power to push through difficult reforms. They also concluded from the Bo Xilai case that weak leadership led to unchecked corruption and elite power struggle. Therefore, as Fewsmith argued, seniors supported Xi’s power consolidation and the anti-corruption campaign. Both Cheng Li and Fewsmith have pointed out that Xi must have gotten approval from Jiang Zemin and other seniors in Jiang’s faction to purge Jiang’s protégé, Zhou Yongkang.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nHowever, the seniors certainly did not expect Xi’s power consolidation to go this far, with Xi taking down all political rivals regardless of their factional background.\n\nToday, China is in a new era. For the first time since 1978, China has no senior who can constrain Xi. Jiang Zemin is 96 years old and rumored to have severe health problems; his absence from the CCP’s 100th-anniversary celebration confirmed these rumors. Hu Jintao was never a powerful figure, and his influence further dwindled after Xi purged many members of the Communist Youth League faction, Hu’s traditional power base. Other seniors, such as Zeng Qinghong and Wen Jiabao, have kept a low profile to avoid the anti-corruption campaign. Xi’s constitutional amendment in 2018, paving the way for his incoming third term as CCP general secretary and China’s president, demonstrate that no senior figure can constrain Xi’s attempt to obstruct party norms.\n\nWhat does the lack of seniors mean for Chinese politics?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case of senior politics in Meiji Japan serves as a useful comparison. Japanese seniors (genro) were heroes of the Meiji Restoration. Their influence in politics started in 1892 when the genro group picked a new prime minister following the sudden departure of Prime Minister Matsukata Masayoshi. The genro shared a similar political role with seniors in China. First, they maintained the power to select prime ministers to ensure stability during the power transition. Second, they sat above narrow bureaucratic and party interests to guide domestic and foreign policies based on national objectives. Third, they adjusted the difference between political parties, bureaucracy, and the military to maintain centralized control.\n\nThe genro group faded out of Japanese politics in the 1920s due to their age. As a result, Japanese politics fell into deep chaos. Fanatic military officers seized power following genro’s departure through coups and pursued aggressive foreign policies, which the genro group abhorred. The military government’s unchecked power led Japan to World War II and its eventual defeat.\n\nThe parallel is not exact, of course. The PLA certainly is not in a position to seize power; in fact, Xi has strengthened the CCP’s command over the gun. However, seniors provided an additional check on the top leader. They also forestalled any political deviation from reform and opening in the past 40 years. Furthermore, they stabilized the decision-making process by guarding political norms. Without seniors, Xi might run into the mistake of pursuing extreme policies with unchecked power. The nationalistic foreign policies and the zero-COVID policy only confirm this danger.",
    "China on Taiwan: ‘External interference’ won’t be tolerated": "China vehemently defends its claim on Taiwan, which separated from the mainland after a 1949 civil war and now functions with its own government. A recent visit by the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, markedly ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe language, while pointed, reflected China’s usual vehemence about the island; it’s claim rarely goes unmentioned in major international speeches. Taiwan is a core issue of China policy, and Wang’s appearance — instead of his boss, Chinese leader Xi Jinping — was a signal that the speech was not necessarily a major one.\n\n“The PRC government is the sole government representing all of China,” Wang said, referring to China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China. “The one-China principle has become a basic norm in international relations.”\n\nChina exercises regular pressure worldwide on any entity — country, corporation, mapmaker — that even implies Taiwan might be a separate country. Its muscle has isolated the island’s government, though a few U.N. members continue to have diplomatic relations with Taipei rather than Beijing.\n\nOn Saturday at the U.N. meeting, just a few speakers before Wang, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, spoke forcefully about allowing Taiwan to raise its profile in international organizations, including the World Health Organization.\n\n“How can we stand askance, in relative silence and contented inaction, in disregard of Taiwan’s legitimate right to exist in accord with the wishes and will of the Taiwanese people?” he asked.\n\nWang’s appearance at the 2022 in-person edition of the U.N. General Assembly comes after two years of remote, pandemic-era speeches by China’s top leader. Xi did not attend this year’s general assembly, which Russian President Vladimir Putin also skipped. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday.",
    "How Chinese celebrities are amplifying official policy on Taiwan, pushing ‘One China’ messages to millions of fans online": "The Chinese government has a new ally when it comes to pushing its official line on Taiwan: celebrities.\n\nTension over the status of the island, which is claimed by Beijing as part of its “One China” principle, have been exacerbated by a series of recent incidents, including a high-profile visit to the island by U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and comments by President Joe Biden suggesting the U.S. would be prepared to defend Taiwan “militarily.”\n\nIt has led to an angry response from officials in Beijing, who have accused the U.S. of violating its long-standing commitment to abide by its One China policy. But it has also seen a renewed propaganda push aimed at getting the message of unification to the Chinese and Taiwanese public.\n\nAs experts in Chinese cultural politics, we have noted how the highly contentious series of events not only reshaped the regional dynamics around Taiwan but also permeated into popular culture in China – with celebrities being utilized to circulate One China messaging to fans and social media followers.\n\nIt forms part of a wider trend that we have researched and forms the basis of a forthcoming article published in China Quarterly on Chinese celebrities’ political signaling. By our analysis, 85% of the top 218 celebrities in China reposted official government messages on their social media account at least once over a six-month period we observed in the second half of 2021.\n\nThe power of Weibo\n\nThis phenomena has continued into 2022 and was seen during and after the Pelosi visit. On Aug. 2, the day that the House speaker landed in Taiwan, the state media outlet China Central Television, or CCTV, sent out a post on Weibo, a Chinese-owned Twitter-like social media platform, with the message “there is only one China in the World.”\n\nWithin hours, Chinese celebrities started to repost this message to their extensive networks of followers. Those doing so included Xie Na, a 41-year-old popular TV host and actress with 128 million followers on Weibo, and Jackson Yee, a 22-year-old singer, dancer and actor ranked the No.1 celebrity in Forbes’ 2021 Chinese Celebrity List. Likewise, Taiwan celebrities such as Chen Qiaoen and Wu Qilong also retweeted this message, though about a day later.\n\nTaiwan celebrities who reposted the message were lauded by Chinese media and fans for taking a clear political stance. An article in the Chinese tabloid Global Times quoted an online fan’s praise for Taiwan celebrities who reposted the One China message: “Well done! Daring to show support at this moment must be sincere.”\n\nOne celebrity news outlet went as far to post an article that listed more than 20 Taiwan celebrities who reposted “One China” and praised them for “fulfilling the responsibility to voice political support.”\n\nThe article also listed 11 Taiwan celebrities who did not retweet the One China message, suggesting that fans will judge them accordingly.\n\nIndeed, celebrities who did not repost the message were called out for their silence, with fans demanding that they show support for the government. Hebe Tien, a well-known Taiwan singer with 13 million followers on Weibo, was among those targeted by angry Chinese fans and media for not reposting the One China message.\n\nPosts get political\n\nChinese celebrities haven’t always been so politically active on social media when it comes to issues like Taiwan.\n\nActors, singers and TV personalities use Weibo, which came into existence in 2009 and has close to 600 million active monthly users, to share snippets about their personal lives, promote work, endorse commercial products and connect with fans. But until the mid-2010s, they rarely engaged in politics.\n\nBut since the start of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s second term in 2017, more and more celebrities have used their accounts to repost official state messages.\n\nThis is especially true on important political anniversaries, such as the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Republic of China. For instance, on July 1, 2021, Yang Mi, an actress with 112 million followers on Weibo, reposted CCTV’s quotation from Xi marking the centennial of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party: “When a people have ideals, their country will have strength, and their nation will have a bright future.”\n\nThese celebrity reposts often receive hundreds of thousands of user engagements, including reposts, comments and likes.\n\nThis effectively promotes official messages to an exponentially larger social media network. CCTV’s Weibo account, which sent out the One China message to coincide with Pelosi’s visit, has 130 million followers. Xie Na, a leading pro-Beijing celebrity, alone has 128 million followers – and she is one of many who reposted the message.\n\nAs we argue in our forthcoming article “Chinese Celebrities’ Political Signaling on Weibo,” Chinese celebrities started to repost official messages when it became important for their career prospects to do so.\n\nAs the entertainment industry rapidly grew in the 2000s, the Chinese government began to develop explicit policies to regulate and control celebrities, their cultural products, media platforms, fan groups and professional associations.\n\nCalling out ‘tainted artists’\n\nIn 2014, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television issued a notice to require all broadcasting platforms to block “tainted artists” – celebrities who engage in illegal behavior or actions deemed by the government to be problematic, such as drug use, prostitution, tax evasion, extramarital affairs and political incorrectness. This last category includes supporting Hong Kong or Taiwan independence.\n\nSince then, the phrase “tainted artists” has entered public discourse and is used by people online to criticize celebrities.\n\nUnder tightening political control, Chinese celebrities have fostered what scholars Jian Xu and Ling Yang have described as “a neoliberal subjectivity with Chinese characteristics.” In other words, Chinese celebrities see pleasing the state as an effective way to reach a market.\n\nCelebrities endorsed by the state are offered rare opportunities to perform on state television, star in state-sponsored films and TV dramas, serve ambassadorial roles for government agencies and attend important national conferences.\n\nAs such, celebrities have strong incentives to satisfy state demands in pursuit of career, fame and wealth. It is important to acknowledge also that some celebrities may sincerely support the government and want to promote its policies.\n\nEither way, the majority of celebrities on Weibo are echoing government positions such as the One China message. Our analysis found that just 15% of the top 218 celebrities – a list we compiled by reviewing both the Forbes China Celebrities Annual List from 2004 to 2020 and the size of online following – failed to repost any official government message in the six months we analyzed from June to November 2021.\n\nAmong those who reposted, the frequency of reposts varied from just one to 33 times during the six months.\n\nOur analysis found that younger celebrities with more followers tend to repost official messages more. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that young people tend to be more politically critical and rebellious. It also chimes with a recent study of Chinese public opinion that found that the Xi generation – those who came of age in the past decade – are more oriented toward authoritarianism than preceding generations.\n\nLegitimizing state positions\n\nThe reposting of official state messages by celebrities could have far-reaching ramifications.\n\nWhen politically sensitive events occur, Chinese citizens often go to celebrities’ Weibo accounts to discern their stance. On the issue of Taiwan, the heightened nationalist sentiments seemingly prompted users to monitor celebrities and expect them to express support for the Chinese government.\n\nMoreover, the reposting of official messages by celebrities serves to transform popular culture into a key instrument by which the Chinese government can legitimize its position on sensitive issues.",

    "China hopes new Italian govt will stay pragmatic in handling strategic ties": "Leader of Italian far-right party \"Fratelli d'Italia\" (Brothers of Italy), Giorgia Meloni acknowledges the audience after she delivered an address at her party's campaign headquarters overnight on September 26, 2022 in Rome, after the country voted in a legislative election.Photo: AFP\n\nThe leader of Italian political party Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni looks set to become the country's first woman prime minister at the head of its most right-wing government since World War II, according to many mainstream Western media outlets, after she led a conservative alliance to triumph at Sunday's election. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said China hopes the new Italian government can continue to insist on a positive and pragmatic policy toward China.Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a daily routine press conference on Monday that China and Italy are comprehensive strategic partners, and the stable development of bilateral ties serves the common interests of both sides.Chinese analysts said the victory of ring-wing forces in Italy, a major economy of the EU, shows that the political atmosphere in Europe is becoming polarized, with populist political forces from both the far-left and far-right rising in different countries, which is a signal that the political struggles between the left and right will greatly affect the efficiency, reliability, credibility and continuity of governments across Europe, and it will be hard for the EU to conduct effective reform amid the serious challenges of an energy crisis and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Western mainstream media outlets, such as CNN, have expressed their concerns over Meloni and her far-right government, by comparing her with Benito Mussolini, Italy's fascist leader during World War II. BBC quoted an Italian expert as saying that \"we will see more restrictions on civil rights and policies on LGBT and immigrants\" in Italy.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has warned Italy of consequences should it veer away from democratic principles, issuing a barely veiled threat ahead of Sunday's election, Reuters reported. Pope Francis also urged Italians to help migrants on Sunday, when the election result was expected to bring the anti-immigration far-right coalition into power, the Guardian reported.It's certain that Europe's integration process and unity within the EU will be challenged, said analysts, noting that after a series of incidents including the Arab Spring, Greece's debt crisis, the immigration crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU's political system seems unable to effectively coordinate its members to jointly handle major challenges, and the policies issued by decision-makers are far from meeting the actual needs of grass-roots people in Europe.This is a key reason why the populist or far-right political forces who dare to point out these problems are becoming increasingly popular, but experts also said pointing out the problems doesn't necessarily mean solving them.Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said on Monday, \"Many are worried that the right-wing alliance may not be capable of solving many problems in Italy such as its debt crisis, which may lead to economic problems for the entire euro zone, not to mention the fact that before the election, the European Commission chief publicly expressed that she did not welcome the most right-wing government in Italy since World War II.\"\"The political polarization is the real problem that the EU should really worry about, because it means no one has the majority and policies proposed by one side can be blocked and stopped by the other. As a result, no practical policy can be fully and stably implemented by the government,\" Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday.Wang Shuo said the EU is unlikely to solve this problem through simple reforms, because it's a structural problem of the Western political system, so the struggle between left and right will continue, and will also show a similar trend in the future, even in major EU powers like France and Germany.\"The new right-wing government in Italy will attach more importance to the national interests of Italy and autonomous policy-making without influence from the EU, so this means the EU will see more obstacles when pushing integration in the fields of financial policy and diplomacy,\" Zhong Zhun, an expert on European studies at Chongqing University, told the Global Times on Sunday.But the Meloni government won't be too irrational, and as a major economy in the EU that has also benefited from the EU system, will not take extreme actions like \"Brexit\", and Italy will keep its stance on the Russia-Ukraine crisis the same as the EU's, even though the EU has openly expressed its concerns and warnings to Meloni and her right-wing coalition, said analysts.Relations between China and Italy have developed stably in recent years, with Italy taking the lead in Western countries to join the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2019, and the two countries have also cooperated in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.However, Meloni has made some tough remarks toward China on not only BRI cooperation, but also the sensitive Taiwan question, telling Taiwan media on Friday that she will strengthen ties and \"if there is a center-right government, Taiwan will be an essential concern for Italy.\"Spokesperson Wang Wenbin of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair, and no interference from external forces will be allowed. The one-China principle is a consensus broadly shared by the international community and a basic norm of international relations, and it's the political foundation and precondition for all countries, including Italy, to establish and develop diplomatic ties with China.China urged the relevant politicians in Italy to clearly understand the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question, to abide by the one-China principle, and not to send wrong signals to \"Taiwan independence\" secessionist forces, Wang Wenbin said.Zhong said, \"Being tough toward China and hyping the Taiwan question is sort of a trend in Western political circles, as this can attract some attention, and this is why Meloni made such remarks during the election campaign. But after she formally becomes prime minister, she will be influenced by the reality of international relations and professional diplomats.\"Meloni will also be unable to do anything too outrageous on China-Italy ties, even though she could make some outrageous remarks to draw attention, Zhong noted.Wang Shuo echoed this view, saying the power transition won't bring about a fundamental change to China-Italy relations, as both sides are very pragmatic and cooperation is driven by real benefits, and politicians in Europe, not only in Italy but also in other small European countries, will continue to make noise on the Taiwan question, but will not dare to fundamentally challenge the one-China principle.",

Her family has bought three gas-powered cars in the last decade, but she recently grew concerned about gas prices and decided to go electric “to save money.” A few months earlier, her son had also bought an E.V. It was a $10,000 hatchback from Leapmotor, another Chinese manufacturer.\n\nThis year, a quarter of all new cars purchased in China will be an all-electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid. There are, by some estimates, more than 300 Chinese companies making E.V.s, ranging from discount offerings below $5,000 to high-end models that rival Tesla and German automakers. There are roughly four million charging units in the country, double the number from a year ago, with more coming.\n\nWhile other E.V. markets are still heavily dependent on subsidies and financial incentives, China has entered a new phase: Consumers are weighing the merits of electric vehicles against gas-powered cars based on features and price without much consideration of state support. By comparison, the United States is far behind. This year, the country passed a key threshold of E.V.s accounting for 5 percent of new car sales. China passed that level in 2018.",

    "Are China and India changing their stance on Putin's war in Ukraine?": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nEarlier this month, Vladimir Putin met one-on-one with Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi as the three world leaders attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. For the first time, Putin publicly admitted that China had “questions and concerns” about the continuing war in Ukraine. Likewise, Modi reminded Putin that the present era is “not one of war.”\n\nThese developments are noteworthy. Until now, China has openly supported Russia, while India has avoided public criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the summit, Modi reaffirmed the historic importance of India-Russia relations. And China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement calling the China-Russia relationship “stable as mountains.” Both countries continue to buy Russian exports in large quantities. They even joined military exercises in Russia this month.\n\nWhy have China and India been so reluctant to rein Moscow in? While their dependence on Russia for defense and energy resources are significant factors, my research suggests that status also plays a role in their policies. India and China share Russia’s resentment about their second-tier status in a U.S.-led international order. That makes both countries likely to continue to be tolerant about Moscow’s ambitions.\n\nNot defending the international order is risky\n\nIt may seem that security and economic factors are driving Beijing and New Delhi’s policies. But Moscow’s war in Ukraine has disrupted the economies of both China and India. The conflict has affected food and energy supplies worldwide, raising the price of oil and other commodities for India and China. Bankrolling a warring country with mounting economic problems is risky — Russia’s collapse, for instance, would also hurt partner countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia’s invasion also jeopardizes the international order, by disrupting the settled rules and norms that govern relations between countries. Moscow’s actions have challenged foundational international principles such as sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination. Russia has also announced its intention to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and World Health Organization, institutions that are core to the international order. In that light, it’s surprising that China and India would support Putin’s efforts to undermine the very order that has enabled their rise.\n\nRising powers won’t support an exclusionary order\n\nHistory shows, however, that rising powers like China and India do not simply value economic and security goals. They also value being recognized as eminent countries with an elevated status in international politics. In my recent book, I show that this status comes from being recognized as equals of the great powers that manage the international order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen core institutions of the international order recognize a rising country’s equality — typically by including these new aspirants in global leadership positions — they’re likely to uphold the order, even at great cost to themselves. When the order instead excludes these countries, they will demand greater representation in the governance of global issues and will be less willing to cooperate. If these demands are denied or indefinitely deferred, they may get frustrated and challenge the order.\n\nThe United States itself was once in this position, in the 19th century. Initially, it cooperated with a mostly inclusive international order. As a club of European great powers took over after 1815, the U.S. sought — unsuccessfully — to transform international law as a way of joining the club. Feeling unfairly excluded, the U.S. eventually challenged the order. In 1856, when Britain and France introduced new rules abolishing the use of private vessels in maritime warfare, the U.S. vehemently opposed the effort and refused to cooperate. At the time, private vessels provided the only source of equality the U.S. had with the naval powers of Europe.\n\nChina and India see the current order as exclusionary\n\nChina and India today are looking for opportunities for leadership in a global order dominated by the U.S. and its allies. New Delhi, for example, seeks a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. India’s foreign minister declared in 2020 that India deserved “due recognition” for its contributions to global order, and called for “reformed multilateralism.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing, already a permanent Security Council member, seeks greater representation in international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, whose top leadership positions have been exclusively occupied by American, European and Japanese nationals, respectively. Indeed, scholars have found that since 1971, the year China joined the United Nations, senior management positions within the U.N. system have been held largely by nationals of the U.S., France, U.K., Japan and Canada, with China, India and Russia trailing far behind.\n\nFrustrated that these institutions have been slow to change in this regard, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2014. When the U.S. pressured other countries to boycott the institution, China’s vice minister of commerce compared the international order to a basketball game in which “the U.S. wants to set the duration of the game, the size of the court, the height of the basket and everything else to suit itself.”\n\nChina, India and Russia prefer a ‘multipolar’ order\n\nSo long as the international order continues to exclude China and India from the great power club, these nations have little incentive to defend rules and institutions that they did not create and over which they feel little ownership. Since the end of the Cold War, China and India have joined Russia in consistently declaring their preference for a “multipolar world order,” which would give them a greater say in global affairs.\n\nAt the same time, there are limits to how far China and India will go. The recent Shanghai Cooperation summit shows that Russia may be pushing its friends too far, and they are beginning to push back. The need to protect their own longer-term interests and to successfully transform — but not wreck — the international order may now be leading both countries to restrain Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory shows that rising powers do not wait indefinitely for their place in the sun. Without some accommodation of their status aspirations, China and India are likely to remain skeptical of Western efforts to defend the international order against Russian excesses.\n\nRohan Mukherjee is an assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

    "China’s former justice minister faces life in prison amid purge of security officials": "Former Chinese justice minister Fu Zhenghua, who had headed several high-profile investigations into corruption, has been jailed for life for accepting bribes, state media says, as a purge of officials intensified ahead of a key Communist party congress.\n\nFu, 67, was handed a suspended death sentence that will be commuted to life imprisonment after two years, with no possibility of parole, according to state media on Thursday.\n\nFu was deputy head of the ministry of public security before becoming justice minister in 2018, and had led many high-profile investigations and crackdowns including an investigation about a decade ago into Zhou Yongkang, a former security tsar and the most powerful official in modern China to be convicted of bribery.\n\nIn July, Fu admitted accepting bribes exceeding 117m yuan ($16.50m).\n\nAhead of Fu’s court trial in the north-eastern city of Changchun, China’s anti-graft watchdog determined earlier this year that Fu had also been part of a “political gang” of Sun Lijun – one of the most prominent officials from the security apparatus to be targeted since Zhou’s conviction in 2015.\n\nSun, who was vice-minister of public security when investigations against him began in 2020, admitted on state television in January that he had colluded with some top law enforcement officials with the aim of personal enrichment.\n\nSun was also accused of not embracing President Xi Jinping’s authority. On Thursday, he was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for taking bribes, stock market manipulation, and illegal arms possession, according to state media.\n\nThe influence of Sun was so pervasive within the party that it had been described by authorities as “poisonous” and Sun himself was like a “cancer” that needed to be eliminated, the watchdog said.\n\nOn Wednesday, three former police chiefs of Shanghai, Chongqing and Shanxi province were sentenced to years in jail – including one for life – for corruption.\n\nLike Fu, they had also been accused of being part of Sun’s clique and for being disloyal to Xi.\n\nThe purges came three weeks ahead of a once-in-five-years congress of the ruling Communist party where Xi is widely expected to secure a precedent-breaking third term as China’s leader.",
    "Xi Jinping's core status reaffirmed as China's ruling party prepares for meet": "China’s Communist Party reaffirmed President Xi Jinping as its core, as it published the list of delegates invited to attend next month’s landmark twice-a-decade leadership summit.\n\nThe ruling party has selected 2,296 delegates from around the nation to attend the 20th Party Congress, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. The announcement of the list brings Xi another step closer to clinching a precedent-defying third term in power at the pivotal event, which begins Oct. 16 in Beijing.\n\nIn a Monday editorial, the People’s Daily newspaper urged delegates to closely align behind “comrade Xi Jinping as the core” of the party. “It is firmly believed that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and through the concerted efforts of all the delegates, the 20th CPC National Congress will be a congress of unity, victory and endeavor,” the newspaper wrote.\n\nRead more: Is Xi Jinping missing? Rumours of military coup in China explained\n\nThe Chinese leader hasn’t been seen in public since making his first foreign trip in more than two years earlier this month, breaking his self-imposed Covid isolation to rejoin the world stage at a summit in Central Asia. His subsequent absence is consistent with China’s Covid Zero requirements for international arrivals to undergo seven days of hotel quarantine, followed by three days of home isolation.\n\nThe absence fueled speculation over the weekend about whether Xi’s leadership had been challenged, which analysts at Eurasia Group Ltd. said “appear to have originated from social media actors who are common purveyors of misinformation and disinformation.” An announcement about the congress delegates would be extremely unlikely in such a scenario, they said.\n\n“We expect more rumors about Xi’s position ahead of the congress, but they are likely to be unfounded, unless they lead quickly to visible changes in personnel, propaganda, or policy making that challenge Xi’s leadership or agenda,” analyst Neil Thomas and colleagues wrote in a note.\n\nThe delegates must now be approved by a committee for congress, Xinhua said. The list, which includes Xi and all existing members of the top-decision making Politburo, also features scientists, lawyers, health workers, sports stars and cultural figures, Xinhua said. About 620 of the 2,296 people were women, while some 260 came from the nation’s ethnic minorities.\n\nXi is heading into China’s most important political event facing mounting challenges at home and abroad. Domestically, economic growth forecasts are being slashed as his Covid Zero policy weighs on growth. Woes in the property market have led to a 12-month decline in property prices and protests among aggrieved home owners.\n\nOn the international stage, China is facing pressure from the US and its allies over its human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, as well as Beijing’s growing military pressure on the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which the party considers a breakaway province. Meanwhile, Xi’s declaration of a “no limits” friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin weeks before Moscow invaded Ukraine has put China’s war stance under scrutiny.",
    "Macau casino shares soar ahead of return of China tours": "Shares in casino operators jump 13 percent after leader says China will resume e-visa scheme and permit group tours,\n\nShares in Macau casino operators soared up to 13 percent on Monday after the city’s leader said China would resume an e-visa scheme for mainland travellers and permit group tours, which could boost the footfall in the world’s biggest gambling hub.\n\nThe Chinese special administrative region, which is the only place in the country where it is legal for citizens to gamble in casinos, will aim to open to mainland tour groups in November for the first time in almost three years, the city’s chief executive Ho lat Seng said on Saturday.\n\nMacau, a former Portuguese colony, has implemented stringent COVID-19 pandemic restrictions with tight border controls since 2020, hitting its casino industry badly.\n\nThe announcement came earlier than expected, analysts said, who had anticipated such measures to be introduced only early next year. Mainland gamblers account for approximately 90 percent of its total casino revenue.\n\n“Although it’s tough to quantify the immediate benefit, we believe the resumption of e-visas and group tours should alleviate friction for a Macau trip, as well as signal to many that it’s OK to visit,” said DS Kim, an analyst at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.\n\n“Finally we feel we can talk about a return to normalcy.”\n\nSands China rose more than 13 percent, Wynn Macau climbed 7 percent, and Galaxy Entertainment advanced 10 percent, while shares of SJM and MGM China jumped 8 percent each.\n\nWhile the border between Macau and the mainland has been open for two years, traffic remained sluggish due to the lack of e-visas, which were readily used by Chinese gamblers prior to the pandemic to make instant bookings.\n\nCurrently, Chinese tourists to Macau need to book a visa appointment followed by a week-long approval process. The individual visa scheme accounted for about 50 percent of Chinese visitors to Macau in 2019 while tour groups accounted for approximately 25 percent of visitation.\n\nIn the first phase, the resumption of tour groups will come from five regions – Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian – which represented almost 60 percent of mainland visits to Macau in 2019.",
    "China’s ‘hidden epidemics’: the preventable diseases that could reshape a nation": "China faces a health emergency from “hidden epidemics’’ of diseases such as cancer, heart trouble and diabetes that could have far-reaching social, economic and demographic consequences for the world’s most populous nation, experts have warned.\n\nAlthough China imposed the world’s strictest lockdowns to protect its people from Covid-19, the deadly impact from non-communicable diseases is much less well understood and threatens to kill tens of millions of Chinese in the coming decades without tougher public health policies.\n\nChina has been transformed in recent decades by an economic miracle that has seen rapid industrialisation and the transfer of hundreds of millions of people from the countryside to towns and cities.\n\nThis enormous change has lifted multitudes out of poverty and given them a better standard of living than they enjoyed in rural areas. But along with higher wages and urban living have come “western” diseases such as cancer linked to very high rates of smoking, and diabetes and heart disease thanks to a richer diet, lack of exercise and high blood pressure.\n\nWang Feng, professor of sociology at University of California, Irvine, says the pace of change seen in China during the 1980s and 1990s is unlike anything seen anywhere else in history, and that the social and health problems stored up for decades are coming home to roost.\n\nA view of the Beijing skyline. Photograph: VCG/Getty Images\n\n“These are hidden epidemics and they are enduring epidemics,” he says. “You have an explosion in a new diet and nutritional intake in a short time period. Combined with unforeseen, unprecedented ageing, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges China faces – not just for individual families but it poses a political challenge to leadership.\n\n“This issue could really explode out of control,” he says. “This is not something that is going to go away.”\n\nSmoking ‘disaster areas’\n\nMore than a third of the world’s 1.1 billion smokers live in China, where around half the male population is addicted to tobacco. Smoking-related disease – which includes lung cancer, respiratory and heart disease – will kill a staggering one in three young Chinese men by 2050 according to current projections.\n\nThis is a grim statistic in a country that is already facing a demographic crisis due to a plummeting birthrate and a rapidly ageing population. The UN forecasts the population could fall from its current level of about 1.4 billion to about 1 billion by 2100. Chinese officials said in July that the population is already beginning to shrink as birthrates fall to their lowest for decades. But some predictions are far more drastic, with separate research in the US and China suggesting the population will almost halve by the end of the century to about 730 million. Populations in the UK and the United States, by contrast, are forecast to remain constant or grow slightly in the same timeframe.\n\nBernard Stewart, an internationally renowned expert on cancer causation and professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, says the evidence is categorical and China needs to take action to prevent what he calls an unfolding “disaster”.\n\nWorkers box e-cigarettes on the production line at First Union, one of China’s leading manufacturers of vaping products. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\n“There is no sense in which you can qualify the disaster facing China in regard to deaths from smoking,” he says. “There is a vast difference in rates between provinces, but the highly industrialised cities are disaster areas.”\n\nThe biggest cause of death in China is strokes, followed by heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease and then lung cancer, according to the global burden of disease study produced by the US Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Smoking is a contributing factor in many of those cases.\n\nCardiovascular disease is a major killer in China, especially in the heavily industrialised and urbanised north. People in that region are more likely to suffer from hypertension, obesity and a poor diet low on fruit and vegetables but high on red meat, a Lancet study has found.\n\nChina has more people with diabetes than any other country – more than 110 million – in what the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as an “explosive” problem. This number will climb to 150 million by the middle of the century.\n\nDiabetes and complications from diabetes already contribute to almost a million deaths in China each year, according to the WHO. More than 40% of these fatalities are classed as premature – occurring before the age of 70 – which is another cause for alarm.\n\nChina ranks 78th in an index of countries best at avoiding premature deaths. Photograph: Imperial College\n\nChina is the second-biggest economy in the world and has become home to hundreds of billionaires in the last few decades.\n\nBut its health outcomes are still those of a much poorer nation. People in China have a 14.1% chance of premature death from a non-communicable disease which places the country 76th in the health world rankings. South Korea is top on 4.7%, while the UK is 27th on 9% and the US is 44th on 11.8%. The outcomes are worse for Chinese men, with a 19.8% chance of dying prematurely.\n\nThe ruling Communist party’s attempts to deal with the health crisis include the Healthy China 2030 campaign launched in 2019 to reduce premature deaths, control risk factors, and boost healthcare capacity. There are now more smoking bans in public places such as high-speed trains, shops and restaurants. Even last year’s crackdown on children’s screen time can be seen as part of the effort to reduce incipient obesity and improve health outcomes.\n\nHowever, there remain obstacles such as the government’s dependency on cigarette tax, which provides about 10% of the tax base via the state-controlled tobacco monopolies.\n\n‘Western-style’ problems\n\nA man walks on a street smoking a cigarette during a sandstorm in the financial district in Beijing. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe health crisis can in many ways be traced back to China’s stratospheric economic growth since the late 1970s, when people started being able to consume a more western-style diet and acquire western-style habits.\n\nIn 1978, most Chinese people were on a subsistence-level diet. By 1988 they were consuming 60% more pork and 150% more vegetable oil, Wang says, which helped improve nutrition enormously. However, at the same time, alcohol consumption increased 3.5 times, and the number of packets of cigarettes being smoked doubled.\n\nWang says: “This was almost 30 years ago. But it is coming back as a problem for people in later life now. People were consuming liquor, sugar, and tobacco faster than food … There was no awareness of new malnutrition, people being overweight, and about how fast this has happened.”\n\nThe high cost of caring for a sick and ageing population is also a serious obstacle to Beijing’s hopes to revive a flagging economy. One reason is that a greater share of the expense falls on individual households than might be expected in the Communist-controlled nation – around a third of health spending per head. The need to save for healthcare is a huge drain on the budgets of families – often with just one child to do the saving and caring. This is in turn exacerbates the demographic problem because China’s current child-rearing generation of 18- to 40-year-olds have less money and inclination to start their own families.\n\nThese mounting problems are recognised by the Communist party leadership and are among the reasons the government has stuck so rigidly to its zero-Covid strategy while the rest of the world has returned to normal life. Beijing knows that the population – especially elderly people living in rural areas – do not have access to good healthcare, and with underlying health problems such as heart disease and breathing trouble already so common, would be at high risk from the spread of Covid. It is estimated, according to one source, that zero-Covid has saved a million Chinese lives.\n\n‘A health problem means an economic problem’\n\nPeople seek treatment in the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nAbout 95% of people in China have some form of health insurance, but that does not mean that healthcare is affordable. Attempts to reform the public health system have seen the number of private hospitals explode and the total now exceeds public facilities. Provision of care varies greatly from province to province and especially from urban to rural areas, but it is still seen as very inefficient and out-of-pocket expenses for people with insurance are still very high.\n\n“Chronic conditions are a major contributor to health burden, inequalities in health outcomes, and economic burden in China,” a group of academics wrote in the Lancet in 2021.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Barbara McPake, a health economist at the University of Melbourne, says households face dire consequences from the growing problem of China’s hidden epidemics.\n\n“The health system is seeing big out-of-pocket expenses for people with non-communicable diseases,” she says. “A health problem means you have an economic problem. 95% of people have health insurance but there’s a high cost for medicine and care. The insurance doesn’t go far, so in some cases it’s insurance that’s not worth having.”",
    "China ‘on track’ for 6th-gen fighter, US Air Force needs to get there first: ACC chief": "WASHINGTON — With China “on track” to develop a sixth-generation fighter, the US Air Force needs to ensure it fields its own next-generation fighter first, the head of Air Combat Command said recently.\n\n“I cannot tell you today what’s going on in China except they’re planning for their 20th National Party Congress [in October]. But I can tell you what’s not happening. They’re not having a debate over the relevance of six-gen air dominance. And I can also tell you they’re on track,” ACC commander Gen. Mark Kelly said during a roundtable with reporters at the Air and Space Force Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference last week.\n\nThe US Air Force needs to “make sure we get to six-gen air dominance at least a month prior to our competitors,” Kelly said.\n\nWhile most nations — including the United States — have divulged little information about their sixth generation fighter programs, China has been even more secretive about its efforts.\n\nDuring a 2019 interview, Wang Haifeng, chief designer for the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, stated that China was conducting pre-research on a next-generation fighter, with an eye to having a new capability ready to “protect the sea and sky” by 2035.\n\nWhile Wang said little about China’s design, he pointed to several elements that he believed would characterize future US fighter capability, such as being able to team with drones, the use of artificial intelligence, improvements in stealth and omnidirectional sensors. Designs could also feature “less certain” disruptive technologies, such as drone swarms, lasers and adaptive engines, he said.\n\nCurrently, the US Air Force is on track to become the first six-gen fighter user, provided it can begin fielding its Next Generation Air Dominance family of systems on time — “by the end of the decade,” according to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. The service first flew a manned NGAD prototype in 2020, and Kendall has said the service could pick a manufacturer for the program in the near future.\n\nHowever, the program is very complex — with a family of systems that includes a manned fighter, new weapons and likely several varieties of drones — and will be hugely expensive, with the manned NGAD fighter costing “hundreds of millions” per unit, according to Kendall. All of that could drive potential schedule delays, closing the gap between the US and Chinese timelines.\n\nDuring the roundtable, Kelly said that China’s conception of a sixth-generation fighter seem to mirror the United States’ own.\n\n“By and large is they see it greatly the way we see it in terms of an exponential reduction in signature and exponential acceleration in processing power and sensing, and the ability to iterate in terms of open mission systems, to be able to essentially reprogram at the speed of relevance,” Kelly said. “The differences, I think, are a nuance.”\n\nFor instance, China tends to slowly iterate from one fighter variant into another, such as how China morphed Russia’s Su-27 and Su-30 into its domestically produced J-16, Kelly said. By contrast, American aircraft design is characterized by large jumps in capability.\n\n“We as a nation, we tend to let go of the trapeze and kind of make a leap for the next rung. Our Chinese frenemies, they tend to iterate,” he said. “That makes a little bit easier for them to grab the rung when they go off-pitch.”\n\nAlthough Kelly raised alarms that China could outpace the US when it comes to sixth-generation capabilities, Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach had a much more muted reaction when asked about China’s current fighter capabilities on Sept. 19.\n\nChina’s fifth-generation J-20 is “nothing that I would worry too much about,” Wilsbach told reporters. “It’s their most modern aircraft. We’ve had a limited opportunity to assess it. Seems okay. It seems okay. It’s not anything to lose a lot of sleep over, but they seem to be a building a lot of them.”",

Nationalism and resentment towards the West among certain segments of the population has made frank dialogue, as well as disagreement over sensitive issues, impossible within the country’s borders.

    "TRA launches review of ceramic tiles from China": "The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) has today (Thursday 22 September) launched a transition review into anti-dumping measures on ceramic tiles from China.\n\nThese measures are among those inherited from the EU system and have been in place for 11 years. The TRA is reviewing them to establish whether they are still suitable for the UK’s needs.\n\nThe products in scope of this anti-dumping transition review include glazed and unglazed ceramic flags and paving, hearth or wall tiles, as well as glazed and unglazed ceramic mosaic cubes – all commodity codes in scope are listed in the case’s public file.\n\nThe UK imported over £382 million worth of these tiles in 2021, with 1.5% of these imports coming from China. Chinese imports of tiles to the UK currently face duty rates ranging from 14% to 70%.\n\nThe period of investigation for this transition review will be 1 July 2021 until 30 June 2022 and the injury period will be 1 July 2018 until 30 June 2022.\n\nBusinesses that may be affected by this review (such as importers or exporters of the products or UK producers of similar products) can contribute to the review process by registering their interest in the case on the TRA’s online case platform by 7 October 2022. All new developments in the case will be posted on the TRA’s public file.\n\nView further information on the TRA’s current investigations, including transition reviews like this one.\n\nNotes to editors:",
    "Britain’s Golden Era With China Is Well and Truly Dead": "Truss, formerly Britain’s foreign secretary , spent the campaign trail painting herself as a disruptor prepared to break the mold on groupthink, especially in foreign policy. Her China stance is no exception. It has been formed over a number of years and across a selection of senior positions. But even though Truss is a China hawk, she believes Beijing is principally a geoeconomic rather than geopolitical threat. In her view, strengthening the economic heft and leverage of the G-7 and NATO should be the primary means of deterring Chinese aggression.\n\nLong gone are the days of exploring how Britain can develop stronger economic ties with China. Under former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a self-proclaimed Sinophile , the British government briefly saw China as a potential key partner that could replace the European Union and provide significant foreign investment in the post-Brexit era. But as Beijing cracked down on Hong Kong, causing a rupture with London, those hopes faded—and under Truss, they have been replaced with an explicit skepticism of Beijing. Truss has even explicitly declared that China represents a threat to the United Kingdom.\n\nLiz Truss’s tenure as Britain’s prime minister will usher in a transformative period for the country’s foreign policy. While Truss will likely continue many of her predecessor’s domestic policies, her administration’s foreign policy will represent a marked departure from the past: most notably, a final break with the idea of a so-called golden era with China.\n\nLiz Truss’s tenure as Britain’s prime minister will usher in a transformative period for the country’s foreign policy.

But even though Truss is a China hawk, she believes Beijing is principally a geoeconomic rather than geopolitical threat. In her view, strengthening the economic heft and leverage of the G-7 and NATO should be the primary means of deterring Chinese aggression.\n\nTruss will have to navigate a challenging domestic environment with spiraling inflation and a potentially devastating energy crisis, which may come into direct conflict with her China policy pledges. Yet it’s clear from her time as foreign secretary that she will be consistently tough on China—at least rhetorically—as she plans to counter Beijing’s superpower status.\n\nTruss has picked a combination of long-standing allies and some of the Conservative Party’s loudest China critics for key posts. She’s tapped historian John Bew as her foreign affairs advisor and James Cleverly as her foreign secretary—both of whom generally share her worldview. She’s also picked Tom Tugendhat, founder of the influential Conservative Party’s China Research Group caucus, as her minister of state and Nusrat Ghani, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, as business minister. Both Tugendhat and Ghani are China hawks and were among the five British members of Parliament sanctioned by China in 2021; the China-focused groups they represent have been arguably the most influential in the U.K.’s break from golden era policies. While Ghani and Tugendhat do not align with Truss on all China matters—and tend to promote more aggressive anti-China policies—their move into her government severely limits their ability to publicly disagree with any policy of hers.\n\nTruss has been an ardent critic of China’s role in multilateral institutions.\n\nWith her team in place, a key part of Truss’s vision is to build a new world order with new and old partners—but without China. Over the past three years, Truss has been an ardent critic of China’s role in multilateral institutions. As international trade secretary, she criticized the World Trade Organization for being “too soft on China’s unfair trading practices for too long” and argued “democracies [need to work] together to make sure the global trading system is supporting democratic free enterprise.” She views Beijing’s growth and aggression as a direct challenge to liberal democracy and the post-World War II international order.\n\nTo this end, when she became foreign secretary, Truss set out her “network of liberty” strategy. This can best be summarized as the U.K. working with “like-minded partners” around the world to tackle the rise of authoritarianism and “malign influence,” with China squarely on the receiving end. It is, in essence, a tilt to a new British strategy—one that sees geopolitics as an economic problem.\n\nFundamentally, Truss views access to the global economy as being dependent on “playing by the rules.” She has spoken about “aggressors” using free trade “as a tool of foreign policy—using patronage, investment, and debt as a means to exert control and coerce,” and remains bullish on the prospects of using the G-7 to economically rein in China. Truss has also talked of using the G-7 and other partners to form an “economic NATO.” In her first major foreign-policy speech as prime minister, she said if “the economy of a partner is being targeted by an aggressive regime, we should act to support them.”\n\nBritain’s relationship with Taiwan, meanwhile, will likely deepen. More than any other cabinet member under Johnson, Truss spoke about the need to defend Taiwan as a fellow democracy. Taiwan’s future, Truss believes, is a totem of the legitimacy of liberal democracy. Truss strongly condemned heightened Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island in August. Although Truss has backtracked on some of her comments on arming Taiwan under media scrutiny, her convictions will continue to influence her team’s strategy on the region.\n\nIt’s unlikely that the U.K.’s official policy of neither recognizing nor maintaining official diplomatic ties with Taiwan will change. The harder questions—for instance, if Britain would commit to sending troops or directly arming Taiwan in the event of a conflict—are likely to remain unanswered, at least in the initial months of her premiership. Yet Truss’s administration could take less flashy actions, such as supporting the island’s calls to take part in the World Health Organization or ramping up efforts to share technologies that help fight climate change. Domestically, the administration will likely push for Taiwan to provide an alternative space for critical language learning amid broader calls to ban Confucius Institutes, China’s state-run global language program. Already, parliamentarians are in talks to carry out a proposal to have Taiwan send Mandarin teachers to Britain.\n\nThe U.K.’s growing support for Taiwan follows as a natural extension to the country’s deep-rooted connection to Hong Kong’s democracy movement and its protesters, many of whom live in exile in London. Even before Truss took office, the city had become a symbol of London’s unhappiness with Beijing’s actions. Now, Truss may use Hong Kong to rally support for Britain’s defense of Taiwan.\n\nU.K. regulation of sensitive Chinese technology will harden further under Truss.\n\nOutside of diplomatic relationships, U.K. regulation of sensitive Chinese technology will also harden further under Truss. During the Johnson administration, the country saw a significant and protracted swing away from welcoming Chinese investment in sensitive sectors, such as artificial intelligence and energy—a trend that was driven by the Conservative backbench in Parliament and accelerated under Truss’s time as foreign secretary. A ban on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from the U.K.’s 5G network, which was announced in July 2020, set a mood in Parliament of deep skepticism toward Chinese technology. In January, the landmark National Security and Investment Act came into force, giving the government wide-ranging powers to intervene in foreign companies buying U.K. assets in 17 sensitive sectors; so far, most government interventions have been aimed at companies linked to China.\n\nOne of the first cases Truss will have to address is that of Newport Wafer Fab, a semiconductor factory in Wales acquired by a China-linked company. This deal is currently on pause since it is being evaluated by the government for national security risks; Jacob Rees-Mogg, the new business secretary, will have to decide whether to block it. But Newport Wafer Fab is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to critical technology decisions the administration will face in its early days. Upcoming supply chain legislation will have a direct impact on video camera providers Hikvision and Dahua, both allegedly involved in crimes in Xinjiang—and only add to the long-standing headache caused by Huawei’s deep involvement in Britain’s own surveillance systems.\n\nTruss will likely push hard to minimize the presence of Chinese companies operating in critical sectors and keep firms in key industries in the hands of British owners. She already pledged to “crack down” on Chinese social media app TikTok and its competitors during her campaign, arguing that the U.K. should “be limiting the amount of technology exports we do to authoritarian regimes.” Any punitive action will find strong support from politicians concerned about the flow of data from the U.K. to China.\n\nStill, Truss will face challenges in implementing these policies. She may struggle to balance her commitment to upholding liberal democracy with the country’s economic reality: Hawkish China policies, such as economic decoupling, will hurt efforts to address more pressing domestic issues, such as curbing inflation, which may exceed 20 percent by the beginning of next year. Truss has already had to work to mitigate the effects of rising energy costs from the war in Ukraine by promising to freeze energy bills at an average of around $2,815 (2,500 pounds) per year. Reducing economic ties to China will only exacerbate cost-of-living issues for the average British consumer.\n\nBeyond domestic pressures to curb inflation, Truss also faces significant internal—and increasingly public—disagreement within the Conservative Party on how much engagement with China is desirable. In shaping her government, Truss has only managed to nullify two previous challengers of her China policy by bringing Tugendhat and Ghani—members of two of the most influential backbench groups—into her inner circle. The Tory backbench is increasingly a hotbed of China-skeptic parliamentarians, each with a varying vision for how they want the U.K. to engage with Beijing.\n\nThe backbench will ultimately push Truss to move into more direct confrontation with China. The question is how quickly and how far. Will they push her to impose Xinjiang-targeted economic sanctions? Heighten military cooperation with Taiwan? Cut off diplomatic communication in a more permanent way? In the first geopolitical blip of Truss’s premiership, a handful of Conservative politicians sanctioned by Beijing complained about Chinese officials being invited to Queen Elizabeth II’s lying-in-state. Postponing future internal conflict will require Truss to confidently communicate her China vision in a way that speaks to the most confrontational—and influential—voices on the backbenches.\n\nOne marker of Truss’s ability to manage backbench dissent will be the extent to which she is able to convince the incoming chair of Britain’s Foreign Affairs Committee—the most influential foreign-affairs position in Parliament—that her government is fulfilling its foreign-policy vision. Six parliamentarians are asking other politicians to back their campaign for the role. Three—Iain Duncan Smith (a close ally of Truss), Liam Fox, and Henry Smith—are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, Alicia Kearns is the co-director of the China Research Group, Richard Graham chairs a cross-Parliament group that focuses on China, and John Baron previously served in Duncan Smith’s frontbench team. All have been critical of China, but each has a distinctive vision for how to manage the U.K.-China relationship. Their priorities vary from wanting to focus on human rights-led engagement on Xinjiang and Hong Kong to industrial policy reforms to helping defend Taiwan.\n\nAs Truss will soon learn, declaring China a threat and pledging change is one thing; implementing a strategic vision during times of intense economic stress and brewing backbench rebellion is another. And while managing complex relationships among Conservative colleagues with conflicting views will require a masterful political hand, managing an increasingly tenuous relationship with a global superpower will demand much more.",

    "Turtle concern: Australian businessman denies threatening to sell Conflict Islands to China": "The owner of 21 tropical islands off the coast of Papua New Guinea says he never threatened to sell them to China and his main aim is to save the turtles that nest there.\n\nIan Gowrie-Smith, an Australian businessman and investor, bought the Conflict Islands, which lie less than 1,000km from the Australian coast, almost two decades ago.\n\nThe largely uninhabited atolls are a nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill and green turtles, whose breeding season begins within weeks. Some then migrate to the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nGowrie-Smith had been talking about selling the islands or developing partnerships to support the conservation work for several years, and hoped the Australian government could work with PNG, or by supporting a charity, to protect the breeding grounds.\n\nThe “atoll custodian” told Guardian Australia he contacted the office of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in June to discuss the future of the land, but grew frustrated waiting for a response.\n\n“Here’s an opportunity to protect not only the area but the Great Barrier Reef’s conservation – that in itself should have been enough of a reason for someone to reply and say this is a pretty important site,” he said.\n\nIn August that frustration led him to appear on A Current Affair, which focused on the “danger” if the islands should “fall into Chinese hands”.\n\nBut Gowrie-Smith said any suggestion he was threatening to sell the islands to China was entirely wrong.\n\n“I don’t have any intention of selling these islands to the CCP,” Gowrie-Smith said.\n\n“The point that’s been lost is that whomever I might sell it to may in turn decide to sell at some future point in time to a foreign nation that may or may not be friendly.”\n\nThe islands could theoretically be strategically important for China as there is a deep seaport and an airstrip.\n\nThe foreign affairs department told Guardian Australia the government was now “engaging directly” with Gowrie-Smith about the islands.\n\nThanks to erosion, climate change and shifting sands, the turtles have struggled to find somewhere to lay their eggs safe from human and animal predators, or from the seas themselves.\n\nThe Conflict Islands Conservation Initiative has employed rangers to protect and re-home eggs. They scoop the eggs out of danger and carry them in ziplock bags to a safer beach where they are reburied until they hatch. The project, which Gowrie-Smith said cost about $1m a year, has been supported by not-for-profits and by the cruise ships that have brought visitors to the islands.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
