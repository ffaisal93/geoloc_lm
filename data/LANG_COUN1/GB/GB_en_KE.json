    "Kenya's 'Marathon King' Inspires Runners After Beating World Record": "Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge is spurring young athletes to follow in his footsteps after breaking his own world record Sunday in Berlin.\n\nCheers erupted from the crowd Sunday at Nairobi's Karura Forest as they watched Kipchoge race on TV. The watch party followed an amateur marathon organized by the Friends of Karura Forest to celebrate their 25th anniversary.\n\nKaranja Njoroge, a past chairman of the conservation group who serves on its board, called Kipchoge's win \"absolutely magnificent.\"\n\n\"Everybody went wild,\" Njoroge said of the crowd at the watch party. \"Seeing the guy was way ahead. Everybody felt so elated by the efforts of our king of athletics, Eliud Kipchoge.\"\n\nKipchoge's new record, 30 seconds faster than his previous world record set in Berlin in 2018, is now two hours, one minute and nine seconds. Njoroge called it an inspiration.\n\n\"I think it encourages people. Gives people hope. And even those who would never compete begin to believe, because this guy is 37 years old and he's breaking world records,\" Njoroge said.\n\nBarnabas Korir, an executive member of Athletics Kenya, the governing body for track and field sports, agreed.\n\n\"He's inspired the youth, but not only the youth but particularly all the athletes from Kenya,\" Korir said. \"You know Kipchoge is one of the few athletes who is completely determined. He's also very focused.\"\n\nKorir, who is also chairman of youth development at Athletics Kenya, said camps have been set up nationwide to encourage sports.\n\n\"We got the support from the government to do that and in the last 3 years, Eliud Kipchoge talk to the athletes when they were in the camps,\" Korir said. \"So, this is an opportunity for us now to give our athletes a symbol that they can do well if they remain focused, if they work hard.\"\n\nKipchoge has won 15 out of his 17 career marathons, including two Olympic gold medals.\n\nDaniel Schearf contributed to this report.\n\n",
    "What interactive maps and 3D digital models reveal about Mau Mau detention camps in Kenya": "In a new documentary released last month in the UK, Kenyan and British historians describe how Britain secretly used torture against prisoners in Mau Mau detention camps during the anti-colonial uprising movement in the 1950s. One of the Kenyans featured is historian and digital heritage scholar Chao Tayiana, the founder of the African Digital Heritage Project (ADHP), an organization focusing on the use of technology in preserving and sharing African heritage.\n\n“It really flipped the script as to who is uncivilized,” Tayiana says in the film, which reveals details from a secret archive known as the “Hanslope Disclosure” that remained hidden from public view for over 50 years. The archive contained damning evidence on Britain’s use of torture including murder, rape, and forced castrations against Mau Mau prisoners. Surviving veterans of this period are also featured in the film, and describe the appalling conditions they endured in detention.\n\n\n\n“Oral history is treated as second rate compared to written knowledge, and so it hasn’t mattered in many years that veterans and people who lived through this period have been saying that this happened,” Tayiana tells Quartz. “It was only until the disclosure of the archives proving that there was torture that people really started listening.”\n\n\n\nHistory of the Mau Mau uprising\n\nThe Mau Mau was an armed rebellion launched by the Kikuyu people demanding the return of stolen land from white British settlers as well as money for independence. The British declared a State of Emergency in 1952 to counter the uprising, with the executive order to put in detention camps anyone who opposed colonial rule. Unofficial figures estimate that tens of thousands of Kenyans were executed, tortured, or maimed during the crackdown, which lasted until 1960.\n\nHistorians estimate that more than 100 camps were set up during this period, yet remarkably little is known about their history in both Kenyan and British public spaces today.\n\nThe Mau Mau were eventually defeated, but the uprising is regarded as one of the most significant steps towards Kenyan independence in 1963.\n\nDigitizing Britain’s detention camps\n\nSince 2019, Tayiana has been working in collaboration with volunteers and colleagues in Kenya and the UK to document, digitally reconstruct, and curate an exhibition that sheds light on the Mau Mau detention camps that were built by the British in the early 1950s.\n\n“Visual language and imagery is very powerful in informing our understanding of the past but also helping us get a sense of where things are located in time and physically,” says Tayiana. “So [the ADHP] asks how this data can be communicated in multiple ways, through multiple mediums to audiences across the board.”\n\nThe ADHP works with museums, archives, and communities to document African histories through innovative technology that centers human experiences and oral histories. The project has so far created a number of open source digital assets including 3D digital models and interactive maps that show the detention camps were spread out all over the country, and included exile camps, detention camps, work camps and women and juvenile camps.\n\nThese digital reconstructions rely on extensive research and sources including oral and written testimonials, existing plans and 3D scans, as well as some physical remains from the campsites. The goal is to create a better representation of shared history and to make these assets more accessible to more people, regardless of their literacy levels or knowledge of English.\n\n“The biggest knowledge gap regarding that period is really around the human experience,” says Tayiana. “We are aware of the camps, we’re aware they existed, but we don’t really know much about what took place. The human experience is very abstracted from the nationalist story of how the Mau Mau fought and they got independence.”\n\nA ‘lifecycle’ between digital and physical work\n\nDespite the opportunities in using technology to reproduce cultural value and meaning, Tayiana says the ADHP faces limitations with resources and infrastructure to carry out its digitization efforts. Digital reach is also a factor, she says, as many target audiences in Kenya still do not have easy access to digital technologies.\n\n“We ended up reaching a very specific demographic, which is 18 to 34 year olds who are on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook,” she said. “One of the things we think of is how can this primary audience then reach another secondary audience, so maybe their grandparents or their parents. We try to create a lifecycle between digital work and physical work, because I don’t believe they should be separate.”\n\nTayiana acknowledges that digital reconstructions will never be completely accurate, and she says remaining open to feedback and input is crucial. Next year, the team will begin incorporating more assets and cultural context to the map, beyond the epicenter of the violence in central Kenya. They are also currently working on a physical exhibition in Kenya about the approximately 800 concentrated villages that were set aside for around 1 million women and children during the Mau Mau uprising.\n\nThese villages were managed by British officials and ‘home guards’—armed non-Mau Mau Africans that were falsely branded ‘loyalists’ by colonial rulers. Tayiana says women and children were subject to cruel treatment including forced curfews, and they were not allowed to grow their own food or manage their own land resources.\n\n“The exhibition really centers on what that did to the societal fabric of these villages … and how the officials treated women.”\n\nTayiana says the exhibition will include the physical remains of a trench that was dug around the village, as well as the archives and oral histories collected from survivors.\n\nDocumenting history before it’s too late\n\nTayiana’s work with the ADHP is mirrored by her other initiatives that center human experience and value oral histories. In 2018, she founded the Museum of British Colonialism—a digital platform which facilitates global conversations on Britain’s colonial legacies. She is also the founder of the Open Restitution Africa project which gathers data on current restitution processes across the African continent.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency in much of her work to document these histories before it is too late. This is particularly true for the Mau Mau detention camps, as there are fewer veterans alive today to tell their stories.\n\n“This history is not being taught to the extent to which it should be taught in Kenya,” she said. “There are still a lot of wounds and silences here in the country regarding this period. But what’s interesting about this history, I think, is that there are so many factors that are working against it. And so the very fact that it did make its way to light…is something we really need to pay attention to.”",
    "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S.": "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S. Presented by\n\nQuick Fix\n\n— Kenya, the only African country engaged in bilateral trade talks with the United States, is worried about losing U.S. duty-free access for its apparel and other goods because the negotiations do not cover tariffs.\n\n— House lawmakers will introduce legislation today to suspend tariffs on base powder, an essential ingredient in infant formula, through Dec. 31 in a move supporters hope will spur domestic formula production and further alleviate the national shortage.\n\n— USTR on Friday outlined a short list of negotiating objectives for the trade pillar of the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework agreement, just two weeks after all 14 participants agreed on joint goals.\n\nIt’s Monday, Sept. 26.

You’ll also receive daily policy news and other intelligence you need to act on the day’s biggest stories.\n\n\n\nDriving The Day\n\nKENYAN MANUFACTURERS WANT PERMANENT DUTY-FREE ACCESS: The Biden administration has been clear that none of its trade negotiations cover tariffs. That includes talks with the U.K., the EU and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership talks with Kenya.\n\nIn Kenya’s case, the country already has duty-free access to the United States for most of its goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But the Biden administration has not said yet whether it supports renewal of that legislation, which expires in 2025.\n\nSo, in comments filed with the USTR, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers requested that duty-free access be continued, either as part of a bilateral trade agreement or through renewal of the nearly quarter century old AGOA program.\n\n“With unemployment and under employment challenges in Kenya at a record high, the contribution of AGOA to creating job opportunities cannot be underestimated,” the group said.\n\nThe Corporate Council on Africa, a U.S. business group, also urged continuation of Kenya’s duty-free access, noting the West African country is “the largest AGOA exporter of apparel to the U.S., totaling $449 million in 2021 and accounting for some 50,000 direct jobs.”\n\nBut it’s “important that we have an agreement with Kenya that establishes a broader economic partnership that goes beyond AGOA’s unilateral preferences and addresses more than just tariffs and goods market access,” the CCA added.\n\nAdditional areas should include digital trade and financial services, as well as provisions that promote deeper foreign investment and protect investors from unfair treatment, the group said.\n\nTrade activists at Public Citizen approached the market access question from the other side, arguing that it’s hard to see how a bilateral agreement with the United States would be better for Kenya than a simple renewal of the AGOA program since “history has shown that countries signing trade agreements with the United States have to make major anti-development concessions.”\n\nThe group urged USTR not to negotiate a traditional free trade agreement with Kenya because that would have “catastrophic policy and political repercussions.”\n\nFIRST IN MORNING TRADE: The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act is being proposed by members of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, including Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Earl Blumenauer(D-Ore.), Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).\n\nIn July, those same lawmakers rallied broad bipartisan support for the Formula Act, a bill that temporarily lifted tariffs on imports of finished formula. U.S. formula companies lobbied heavily for base powder to be included in that earlier bill, but the provision was excluded amid concerns expressed by dairy producers.\n\nWhile shelves are better stocked today than over the summer, formula remains difficult for many families to come by. “The legislation I’m introducing today will build on that progress by helping increase domestic formula production,” DelBene said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that this bill can move with the same speed and bipartisan support that the previous legislation had.”\n\nG20 TRADE MINISTERS CLASH OVER RUSSIA: A meeting between trade ministers from the world’s leading economies in Bali, Indonesia, ended without a joint statement Friday after representatives disagreed over whether to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIndonesia was expected instead to issue “a chair’s statement” outlining the six priorities that lower level officials agreed on earlier in the week. Those include WTO reforms, a multilateral approach to industrialization, digital trade and the pandemic response, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe G-20 host issued a press release Friday that did not mention the minister’s failure to agree on a joint statement or include a link to a chair’s statement. G-20 finance ministers also failed to agree on a joint statement when they met in July.\n\nIndonesian softball: The European Union, which released its own readout of the gathering, said most countries agreed the conflict was the primary challenge for international trade and “condemned this gross violation of international law.”\n\nThe U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain objected to the statement produced by Indonesian Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan since it didn’t include explicit condemnation of Russia, according to international media reports.\n\n\"Of the 27 paragraphs of the joint statement, 26 were agreed, one was not. The paragraph that was not agreed upon was about geopolitical issues. There was no consensus,\" Hasan was quoted as saying.\n\nAgriculture is next: G-20 agriculture ministers will be in Bali later this week to discuss global food security, efforts to boost sustainability and related concerns.\n\nTai heads to Japan: Tai will be in Tokyo Tuesday to attend former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. The U.S. delegation is led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who also will visit South Korea on the trip.\n\n\n\nMENENDEZ HOLDS UP MCKALIP AG NOMINATION: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) has placed a hold on the nomination of Doug McKalip to be USTR’s chief agricultural negotiator until he receives assurances the agency will establish procedures for greater congressional oversight and transparency of U.S. trade policy, a spokesperson for the senator confirmed after Inside U.S. Trade reported the action last week.\n\n“As [Menendez] awaits commitments and specific actions to this end, he opposes confirmation of this nominee as a way to send the clearest signal that he firmly believes Americans deserve honest and transparent trade policy that prioritizes the economic interests of the country and cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nLong time coming: Menendez was one of six senators in May to sign a letter to Ambassador Katherine Tai that claimed the agency was not upholding its own transparency standards, and failed to properly consult Congress in dealings with the World Trade Organization involving intellectual property and Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFarm groups impatient: Last week, a coalition of 105 agriculture and food associations and companies sent a letter to Senate leaders urging a swift floor vote on McKalip’s nomination. The Senate Finance Committee voted 27-0 in favor of advancing the long-time government employee’s nomination two weeks ago, with Menendez abstaining.\n\nA BRIEF GLIMPSE OF U.S. IPEF GOALS: A USTR spokesperson called the short outline of the agency’s negotiating objectives \"a vision document that is guiding our conversations with IPEF partners and stakeholders.\" It runs just slightly more than two pages, although USTR said it could be updated at a later date.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration committed to following certain “Guidelines for Consultation and Engagement” developed by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nThose guidelines say “at least 30 days before initiating negotiations for a trade agreement, USTR will publish a detailed and comprehensive summary of the specific objectives with respect to the negotiations and a description of how the agreement, if successfully concluded, will further those objectives and benefit the United States.”\n\nThe guidelines also say USTR will hold a public hearing on the negotiating objectives. However, a USTR spokesperson said those transparency commitments that Tai reaffirmed do not apply to IPEF since it is an “executive” agreement not subject to congressional approval.\n\n\n\nCANADIAN DAIRY WAITING GAME: It’s been about 120 days since USTR initiated a second dairy dispute with Canada after its first effort failed to force Ottawa to open its market as much as U.S. industry believes it should be under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBy now, USTR is within its rights to request another dispute settlement panel to hear its complaint since no deal to resolve the disagreement has been announced. However, a USTR spokesperson on Friday provided little information on that. “We’re engaged with Canada on next steps, in close coordination with stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBecky Rasdall, vice president for trade policy and international affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association, said it has “been in communication with USTR about the substance of the second round of consultations and are working to support their efforts.”\n\nWhat’s next: Although timing is still uncertain, “we support proceeding with the second dispute when USTR is ready,” Rasdall said.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR SOME TRADE TALK? Unfortunately, we couldn’t get Hank Williams Jr. to kick off the WTO’s Public Forum this week, but I’ll try my best to pump you up about the annual gabfest. I mean, if four days of multi-room discussions on every conceivable trade topic is your idea of heaven, then Geneva is where you want to be this week.\n\nJust imagine being trapped in a building and every door you open is a different Washington International Trade Association event. It’ll be something like that.

    "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias": "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias\n\nAs he moves on from Africa to take up his next posting in Mexico, NPR's Eyder Peralta has one last love letter to a favorite part of Nairobi, Kenya: roadside plant nurseries.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFor the past six years, NPR international correspondent Eyder Peralta has taken us all around the African continent. He's now moving on to report for NPR from Mexico. But before leaving his post in Nairobi, Kenya, Eyder wrote a love letter to one of his favorite parts of the city - the roadside plant nurseries.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CARS HONKING)\n\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Nairobi tends to be a chaotic city.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN)\n\nPERALTA: It's a sprawling metropolis, so the streets are a jumble - people, buses, police, goats, cows. On the side of the road, you can buy anything from a samosa to furniture to a puppy. But my favorite thing is that on the side of almost every street, you find a nursery. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of Kenyans commandeer little strips of land, and they grow everything from roses to azaleas to delicate gardenias.\n\nGEORGE JENGA: I'm George Jenga. When you translate Jenga, it comes George builder.\n\nPERALTA: Nearly 20 years ago, unable to get a job, George went into the forests of the outskirts of Nairobi and started collecting seeds. Since then, he's turned this bit of roadside into paradise. He walks me through his garden, a smile on his face. He has learned as much as he can about all of his plants.\n\nJENGA: Like, this one is called Podocarpus falcatus. This one is good for timber.\n\nPERALTA: He picks a hard, round seed.\n\nJENGA: This pod, it germinate within one year and eight months.\n\nPERALTA: Most of the plant sellers in Nairobi sell flowers. They grow quick, and it is what people want, but not George. What George loves are indigenous trees. So he waits years for a pod to turn into a seedling to turn into a tree.\n\nJENGA: Our generation is not for the trees. They are going after quick money. And quick money, you cannot get it while you are in a garden.\n\nPERALTA: George moves fast past his flowers. They're just not his thing. But about trees, he can talk for days.\n\nJENGA: This is Vitex keniensis. In English, it is called Meru oak. This one, it is called Calodendrum capense. The seed has a lot of oil.\n\nPERALTA: For wrinkles, he says. He keeps calling out names and uses. But as we move away from the road, his nursery becomes an oasis. We start hearing birds. He dodges bamboo, skips over rocks, and suddenly, we hit a stream. This is the source of life for his plants.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)\n\nPERALTA: This is the most charming part of Nairobi, that in the middle of all the chaos, there is always beauty. It's a place where you discover that the aphids making your roses brown also attract hummingbirds, so you let them be.\n\nI can see why you like this.\n\nJENGA: You know, a wise scholar said when you treat the nature the well, the nature will reward you. I’ve been rewarded\n\nPERALTA: He's in good health. His kids have gone to school off these plants. And it's not lost on him that as Nairobi becomes a mega city and climate change ravages the Earth, at least hundreds of thousands of trees have passed through his hands. Sometimes, he says, he sees some of his seedlings around town.\n\nJENGA: I walk there. I see a tree. I laugh myself. This has come from my hand.\n\nPERALTA: (Laughter) So that's a good feeling.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I feel...\n\nPERALTA: Yeah.\n\nJENGA: Yes.\n\nPERALTA: Yeah. You're fulfilled.\n\nJENGA: Yes.

    "How Kenya Became the World’s Geothermal Powerhouse": "Geophysicist Nicholas Mariita remembers when Kenya’s geothermal sector wasn’t the high-tech powerhouse it is today. In the early 1980s, he regularly joined teams of scientists on expeditions into the country’s Great Rift Valley to survey for potential sites where the Earth could be tapped for a prime subterranean energy source. They weren’t looking for oil or coal — they were looking for heat, the key resource in geothermal power.\n\nThe Great Rift Valley was still wild then, so dodging snakes and buffalo was part of the job. “One in a while, we’d be chased by a buffalo and have to climb into a tree, and if it was a clever one, it’d flick urine at you with its tail,” Mariita recalls. “Those were the kind of funny things we went through.”\n\nTheir risk has yielded results. In 2020 and 2021, some 48 percent of all electricity generated in Kenya came from geothermal — the highest share of any country. And as the world seeks to increase both the quantity and cleanliness of its electricity, it’s a cheap, bountiful and low-carbon option Kenya plans to increasingly rely on.\n\nRising megawatts\n\nThe idea of geothermal generation in the Olkaria Area — located 44 miles northwest of Nairobi in the Great Rift Valley — was first considered in the 1950s. A consortium of power companies, led by the East African Power and Lighting Company, drilled two test wells. But efforts to make power from them were stymied by technical problems. By the turn of the decade, the wells — and the dream of geothermal power — had largely been abandoned.\n\n“In those days, almost 90 percent of our electricity came from hydropower,” says Mariita, now the director of the Geothermal Training and Research Institute of the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, however, leaving geothermal resources untapped became untenable. A fickle hydroelectric grid and the global oil crisis left the country, then in its second decade of independence, starved for power. “To avoid power rationing,” says Mariita, “the government had to change its strategy.”\n\nWith assistance from the United Nations, the public-owned Kenya Power took charge of the effort in 1977.\n\nThe first geothermal plant in Africa came online in June 1981. Upon its inauguration, the Olkaria I plant comprised just one turbine with a generating capacity of 15 megawatts (roughly 2.7 percent of nationwide capacity at the time), but expansion followed. In 1982, Kenya’s parliament passed the Geothermal Resources Act, which established a formal legal framework for geothermal investment, siting and licensing. That same year, a second turbine, also 15 MW, was added to Olkaria I.\n\nIn 1997, Kenya Power Company became the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (known as KenGen), and investment ramped up significantly. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Kenya installed some 93 megawatts of generating capacity. In the first two decades of this century some 531 megawatts of capacity came online. With the July 2022 opening of Olkaria V and a sixth turbine added at Olkaria I came some 258 MW of new capacity — bringing the country’s total to some 882 MW.\n\nLooking forward, some 300 MW of capacity are expected to come online upon the completion of new projects both at Olkaria and beyond. By 2030, in line with the country’s green development goals, Kenya hopes to have 1,600 MW — almost double today’s total — up and running.\n\nThat energy is needed to achieve Kenya Vision 2030. The government plans rapid industrialization so the country can rise to middle-income status by the end of this decade.\n\nOf all renewables, geothermal energy is especially useful for industrialization, a goal shared by countries across Africa. For one, unlike sources such as wind and solar, it provides a reliable stream of power critical to energy-intensive industrial processes. Moreover, geothermal need not be converted to electricity at all: Direct applications — where geothermal steam itself is used — abound.\n\nAround the world, geothermal wells are used to heat buildings, can food and process textiles. In Kenya, the Naivasha-based Oserian Development Company has used geothermal steam to heat its flower-farm greenhouses, which are among the largest on Earth.\n\nHeat seeking\n\nGeothermal energy is not a green panacea, of course. For one, the construction of new wells, like any infrastructure, can encroach upon natural ecosystems and displace communities. The Olkaria plants, for instance, have forced hundreds of semi-nomadic Maasai families indigenous to the Great Rift Valley to relocate, though KenGen has made efforts to both employ Maasai people and mitigate the effects of displacement.\n\nMoreover, the geothermal potential of any given area is determined by immutable geologic characteristics.\n\nFor the last 20 million years or so, the Somali minor tectonic plate has been crawling southeast, shearing Africa’s westernmost edge from the rest of the continent, which sits on the northwest-bound African plate. Diverging plates form gaps in the Earth’s solid outermost layer, the lithosphere. From within those gaps seeps the layer beneath, the asthenosphere. Those bits of asthenosphere fill the void left by the parting plates, and a few millimeters — and million years — at a time, become a new crust.\n\nBut the patch job is not perfect. Just as tectonic collisions form mountains, divergence creates swaths of crust just a bit thinner and more porous than average. Those who live on that thin crust live closer to what’s underneath: heat.\n\nNot every country falls on a tectonic rift. However, massive amounts of geothermal potential remain untapped in the world.\n\nThis May, a group of Egyptian geologists — led by Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geologist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo — created a first of its kind analysis of high geothermal potential regions in Africa, using data on faults, heat levels and magnetic forces. They found 14 areas of interest, from Algeria to Namibia to Malawi, South Africa, Liberia and beyond. “Africa has very high potential,” says Zaher.\n\nGeothermal’s impact is not just measured in megawatts in Kenya today. When Nicholas Mariita began his career, its then-nascent geothermal sector relied on outside expertise. “In those days, we used consultants from the United States, Japan and New Zealand,” says Mariita.\n\nIn the 40 years since, Kenya has built not only world-leading physical geothermal infrastructure, but the human capital to support it. Through geothermal energy, Kenya has found an unshakeable source of power — in all its meanings.\n\n“Now, Kenyans actually do the exploration work, the impact assessment, the project planning, the design of the plants and so on,” says Mariita. “You go to one of our projects, and you see Kenyans are in charge.”",
    "Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has hiked rates by 850 bps in the past year but that has not helped stop a slide in its currency which has been one of the worst performing emerging market currency, having lost over half its value this year.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.",
    "Kenya dispatches its troops to end the Rwanda-Congo conflict once and for all": "Kenya’s president William Ruto has said that he will be sending troops to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to fight against the M23 Rebel group which operates in the eastern region of DRC and is being sent as well as backed by Rwanda. Dr Ruto said that as DRC is a part of the East African Community, it is the duty of every nation in the region to step in to put an end to the violence and terror perpetrated by the M23 rebels. He emphasised that just as the UN has a presence in DRC for mediation and military action, Kenya too will take an active role in ending the carnage. He added that there was no choice left and leaders cannot avoid these challenges as peace and stability are necessary because what is happening in DRC are Kenya’s problems too. Dr. Ruto called DRC an economic partner, recognizing the fact that a civil war stricken DRC, will have its ramifications on Kenya as well.\n\nFor years M23 has been operating in Eastern DRC. The M23 is a terrorist group which is infamous for its cruel and barbaric practices against civilians. This group has a long history of subjecting vulnerable poor people to unimaginable levels of torture and violence. M23’s involvement in dozens of war crimes, kidnappings, disappearances, massacres, assassinations, mass rapes etc make it one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in Africa.\n\nM23 is funded by Rwanda; it has the full backing of its government. Rwanda is actively involved in war crimes in eastern DRC, time and again the international community called on Rwanda to put an end to its activities in eastern DRC but nothing has happened. M23’s reason for being in eastern DRC is its mineral resources. DRC is rich in gold and cobalt which Rwanda is trying to get its hands on and M23 has managed to gain control over the resources in some areas. In fact, M23 has created a smuggling ring with local gangs dealing in gold and selling it to international companies and businessmen. The funds generated from sales are used in purchasing arms and weapons.\n\nRwanda voted in favour of Ukraine at the UN Security Council to appease its western masters. Despite committing acts of terror and promoting violence, the US and the EU are supporting it as they to eye the resources in eastern DRC. On the contrary, Democratic Republic of the Congo has good relations with Russia.\n\nRead More: Willliam Ruto’s ‘Kenya First’ initiative beats the living daylights out of UK\n\nRuto made a tough call\n\nIn these circumstances, the decision taken by Kenya’s president William Ruto is drastic. As leader of one of the important nations in the East African Community, he realises the significance of an African unity needed for economic development and growth. It won’t be wrong to imply, that in a political terrain such as that of the African continent, that problems of one country take no time to become the problems of another. Kenya in its far sightedness has realized this and is now taking steps to help DRC, which also is one of its major economic partners when it comes to earning revenue from the Mombasa port. In fact, DRC is the third largest market of the Mombasa port and Dr Ruto stressed that 50% of imports of DRC go through it.\n\nSeveral in western mainstream media have criticised him for taking a call to help DRC, they argue that Kenya has no business being in DRC and is interfering in its internal matters by deploying the Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF). However, such accusations are overshadowed by the commercial relationship between the two countries.\n\nKenya is taking a leadership role in the East Africa region. Ruto’s initiative is motivated by a longing for peace which is desired by most regimes and citizens in Africa. With the West now acknowledging the importance of Africa even more than before, the Kenyan leader understands that a peaceful environment is indispensable for a thriving economy, a successful democracy and rapid trade activity. And that peace can only be attained when tough calls are made. The decision to put Kenyan military in east DRC will not only help in preventing the suffering and violence that civilians are regularly subjected to at the hands of M23, but also in creating a conducive environment for an economy to thrive.\n\nUnfortunately, Ruto will not only have to deal with Rwanda but also the West which has supported it. It will try its best to put hurdles in the progress of this mission which Kenya has taken up unto itself. In the name of sanctions, withholding of any economic ties, diplomatic isolation to allegations of human rights violations, war crimes and genocide, the US and the EU will try to smear Kenya in its effort to bring peace.",

There was a lot of work to do, but the group was fantastic – everyone got stuck into the work that needed doing.“From painting classrooms to teaching the students, it was fantastic to see everyone getting involved and the pupils enjoying spending time with us – they always teach us a lot in return.“They’ve been making amazing progress with their studies – something we take for granted, but without The Walk Centre many of these children wouldn’t be able to get an education or even a decent meal. It makes such a difference to their lives, and it gives them an opportunity to do more than just survive.“We’re extremely privileged to be a part of The Walk Centre and a part of those young people’s lives.”",
    "Kenya's Ruto warns of 'starvation in Horn of Africa' due to climate change": "William Ruto, Kenya's new president, granted an interview to FRANCE 24's Marc Perelman on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Ruto warned that the worst drought in 40 years risks causing starvation in the Horn of Africa, adding that \"3.1 million people are facing severe drought\" in Kenya alone. \"This is no longer a country-by-country challenge. This is becoming a multilateral challenge,\" he insisted, calling on multilateral institutions and lenders for support. Ruto blamed climate change for the drought but stressed that the situation had been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and the resulting fall in grain exports to Africa.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAsked about the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, Ruto said he was \"very concerned\", saying \"whatever happens in Ethiopia gets to Kenya\". However, he expressed confidence that under an African Union framework, \"we should be able to bring the sides to the [negotiating] table at the earliest possible opportunity.\"\n\nRuto also addressed his relationship with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, whom he appointed as an envoy to Ethiopia and DR Congo. Ruto said he was \"a good friend\" of Kenyatta and that the latter \"brings value to the processes in Ethiopia and in DRC\".\n\nFinally, asked about the conflict in neighbouring Somalia, where Kenyan troops have been deployed for 15 years, he said: \"Those troops will come back home as soon as we're done with the assignment that we have in Somalia.\" While admitting that Kenyans want the troops to come home \"yesterday\", he expressed hope that the new Somali president would be \"more committed to fighting Al Shabaab\".\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",
    "‘Restoring the river’: why Kenyans are returning to precolonial spirituality": "Wairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture earlier this year. Within months, the 26-year-old had gained more than 60,000 followers and received at least 1m views of her videos, where she talks about her ethnic group’s traditional practices and beliefs on topics such as mental health and sex.\n\nMukuru, a Kikuyu language teacher, is one of a small but growing number of Kenyans from the country’s largest ethnic group, the Agīkūyū, who are trying to revive precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. The belief systems were suppressed and marginalised during British colonial rule in the 19th century, and as Christianity became more entrenched.\n\nWairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture this year. Photograph: TikTok\n\n“Westernisation was entangled with Christianity,” says King’ori wa Kanyi, a member of the Agīkūyū Council of Elders. “A good African convert had to take a European name, dress like a European and visit the clinic instead of the herbalist.”\n\nAbout 85% of Kenyans identify as Christians and the religion has become an entrenched part of the country’s political and cultural fabric, marking naming, birth, marriage and political ceremonies.\n\n“There’s a new kind of Pentecostalism that has consumed much of how we understand ourselves,” says Kamau Wairuri, a socio-political researcher at the Edinburgh University. “Since people are not familiar with other alternatives, those looking to practise a different kind of spirituality might not know where to begin.”\n\nAdherents of Kikuyu spirituality say it is inseparable from their culture and is treated as a way of life. During colonial rule, the community fought to retain their spiritual systems but the practices were labelled as “savage” pagan religions and ultimately pushed to the margins.\n\n“Colonialism destroyed indigenous African religions, labelling them primitive and not good for the modern age,” said Jacob Olupona, a professor of African religious traditions at Harvard divinity school. “With time, Africans stopped seeing something good in their own traditions. Those belief systems became so marginalised that some have become like secret societies.”\n\nToday, less than 2% of Kenyans practise traditional beliefs. But experts say accurate estimates are elusive because many practise indigenous belief systems alongside mainstream religions such as Christianity and Islam.\n\nAlthough the numbers are fairly low across Africa, and many of those who do practise traditional religions are seen as outliers, some Kikuyu elders say that there has been a slow but gradual shift in attitudes within the community.\n\n“Many people are now rejecting European imposed religious and cultural identities,” says Kanyi, adding that among the Agīkūyū, there is a term for the efforts to revive indigenous beliefs, which translates as “restoring the river to its original course”.\n\nKikuyu girls in 1936-37 at a Church of Scotland mission school in Kenya, where they were dressed in European clothes and taught domestic skills. Photograph: Universal Images/Alamy\n\nExperts say interest has grown as a rising number of the African diaspora returned to the continent over the past decade, in search of their ancestral traditions. “It has emboldened those who are practising it at home,” says Olupona.\n\nObservers say renewed reckonings over the legacies of colonialism may also prompt greater interest in precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. Nevertheless, those looking to reclaim their heritage face challenges. Most African spiritual belief systems are an oral tradition and are not recorded in writing.\n\n“There’s a lot that has been washed away,” says Mukuru, who has been exploring the Kikuyu cultural and spiritual history for several years.\n\nIf we lose these religions ... we would have lost an entire civilisation Jacob Olupona\n\nSome accounts on the Agīkūyū way of life were written by the Kikuyu historian Godfrey Muriuki and Louis Leakey, a Kenyan-British archaeologist who lived among the community for most of his life. Mukuru says a lot of the history can also be found in the community’s language, sayings, songs and stories by Kikuyu writers such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.\n\nTraditional religions are also fiercely guarded by community elders and practitioners, say experts, adding that their oral form has allowed religions to evolve and incorporate beliefs from other religions.\n\nBut the efforts to revive traditional beliefs have not been welcomed in all quarters. Some members of the community, especially those over 50, strongly oppose the revival, says Mukuru’s teacher and spiritual guide, Kariithi wa Njenga. Many have embraced Christianity.\n\nKikuyu men and women dancing in traditional dress in Kenya’s former Central province, the Kikuyu heartland. Photograph: Images of Africa Photobank/Alamy\n\nThose who try to re-engage with the traditions, like Mukuru, also face some pressure to adopt it wholesale. She does not agree with some old Kikuyu traditions, such as female genital mutilation, for example. But she says the traditions entail a wide range of beliefs, including many that are progressive.\n\nUnder Kikuyu cultural practice, women had control over agricultural production, the community’s main source of livelihood. Mukuru says she was surprised to discover that the culture was also matrilineal and sexually liberal. “Sensual dances were used as a way to gauge sexual synergy with the opposite sex,” she says.\n\nEnvironmental protection was also an important part of the culture. “Treating animals and plants with respect is a mark of spiritual maturity among the Agīkūyū,” says Kanyi, adding that the community attached spiritual significance to mountains and trees, and observed a mainly plant-based diet.\n\nSuch spiritual practices are only held sacred by the community’s few practitioners. Experts say they have become custodians of an important history and culture. “If we lose these religions, it would be a big loss for the world,” says Olupona. “We would have lost an entire civilisation.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Kenya quashes order on compulsory use of SGR for cargo transport": "By ANTHONY KITIMO More by this Author\n\nTraders can now clear their cargo at the Port of Mombasa and choose the mode of transport to Nairobi and the hinterlands after Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reverted custom services to the coastal city in line with a presidential decree.\n\nKPA has issued a notice to quash a 2018 notification banning the nomination of cargo to Mombasa and compulsory use of the standard gauge railway (SGR) for ferrying cargo.\n\n“This is, therefore, to notify all shipping lines that importers’ documentation of place of clearance and mode of transport for their goods shall be at their choice,” acting KPA Managing Director John Mwangemi said in the notice on Monday.\n\n“Shipping lines are hereby advised to facilitate importers’ nomination of place of clearance, including port clearance, Kenya Revenue Authority’s licensed container freight stations (CFSs) and KPA’s inland container depots (ICDs). This notice supersedes the notice of 6th June 2018 on similar subject,” KPA said.\n\nShippers’ take\n\nThe Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) chief executive Gilbert Lagat said the notice has ended confusion on the implementation of the presidential directive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is very clear. We are happy with the directive. The place and choice of mode and place of clearance rest with the shipper. This is what we had been pushing for to allow cargo clearance and delivery to compete on efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness,” said Mr Lagat.\n\nHe added, “rail, road, port, CFSs and ICDs will compete on level ground. We expect the cost to respond to market dynamics as it is a win-win for all.”\n\nPresident William Ruto issued a directive a fortnight ago ordering that all cargo clearance be reverted to Mombasa port.\n\nCargo transporters had been protesting the directive by former President Uhuru Kenyatta to ferry their goods to Nairobi or Naivasha via the SGR for onward clearance, saying it had raised the cost of doing business, with the costs passed on to consumers.\n\nKenya Transport Association chairman Newton Wang’oo said SGR should compete with roads on an equal opportunity basis, which will ultimately lower the cost of transport and improve services.\n\n“This is a positive move. We have been fighting against forced railage. Let us looks out for the implementation of the directive on the ground,” said Mr Wang’oo.",

    "‘People should be who they are’: Kenyans embrace genderless fashion": "A growing number of Kenyan labels are embracing genderless fashion, as a younger, more vocal generation calls for greater inclusivity and creativity in clothing designs.\n\nIn July, fashion brand Vivo and Bold Network Africa released a vibrant gender-inclusive collection called Zoya X Bold. It is one of a new crop of collaborations showcasing androgynous fashion. Nairobi designer Jamie Bryan Kimani, who launched his brand Sevaria in 2018, exclusively creates genderfluid clothing.\n\nLGBTQ+ activist Chris “Makena Njeri” Muriithi, CEO of Bold Network Africa, which describes itself as a queer storytelling platform, says that fashion needs to be more inclusive. “For the longest time, I had to go to the men’s section to even buy a shirt,” says Muriithi, who is non-binary.\n\nColourful fashion from Bold Network Africa and Vivo. Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\nDressing across genders is common practice in Kenyan comedy, but those who do so outside that sphere face severe backlash.\n\n“I was bullied on social media for how I used to dress just because it did not conform with what society has shown people to be the norm,” says Muriithi.\n\nGuys should be able to rock hot pink and not be questioned about what their sexual preferences are Ashton Laurence\n\nThe Zoya x Bold collection features striking fabrics, colours and prints designed to work with all body types.\n\n“The clothing that’s available on the market assumes a very binary world,” says Wandia Gichuru, CEO of Vivo. Many businesses are hesitant to take a stand on sexual and gender inclusivity for fear of losing custom, she says. But times are changing, she adds, and businesses have room to take more risk.\n\nZoya targets a younger, daring and less apologetic demographic, which Gichuru believes leans more towards inclusivity and self-expression than previous generations. “The younger generation is more values-driven than my generation was,” she says, pointing to the growing interest in locally made and environmentally sustainable products. “Being exclusive or outrightly prejudiced might hurt you in the long run.”\n\nAshton Laurence, 23, who modelled the new line, says traditional binaries stifle creativity. “Growing up, I was very bored seeing how men would dress for red carpets on TV. It would be the same thing – black tux, white shirt – and yet women would have so many different [clothing] expressions.”\n\nChris Muriithi: ‘For the longest time, I had to go to the men’s section to even buy a shirt.’ Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\nKenya’s queer community has been increasingly visible over the past few years, after a number of prominent Kenyans came out publicly. Celebrities such as Willis Chimano of Afropop band Sauti Sol, challenge traditional gender dressing with crop tops, low V-necks, bare backs and bodysuits. Popular lifestyle YouTuber Jayson Wamae also embraces fashion fluidity, dressing in anything from sheer tops and silk jumpsuits to neck scarves.\n\nMuriithi says: “People need to be able to be who they are without having to be afraid.”\n\nBut LGBTQ+ people face systemic discrimination and violence in Kenya, and gender non-conforming people face heightened threats. In April, a 25-year-old non-binary lesbian was murdered in a suspected hate crime. The following month, a 50-year-old intersex person was raped and killed. Figures by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission suggest that these are not isolated incidents.\n\nLaurence faces harassment daily but does not shy away from growing out his hair, wearing eyeliner and mesh vests. It is an ode to his younger self, who he describes as a feminine boy.\n\n“I didn’t see a lot of people like me growing up in Nairobi, so I want to be that person for others,” says Laurence.\n\n“Guys should be able to rock hot pink and not be questioned about what their sexual preferences are,” says Laurence. The Zoya X Bold collection experiments with fabrics often associated with women, such as silk, in its designs. “That kind of visibility in fashion is changing the game,” he says.\n\nAshton Laurence: ‘I didn’t see a lot of people like me growing up in Nairobi.’ Photograph: Shop Zetu Production Team\n\n“There is still very little visibility for those people that do not conform to the dominant gender,” says Letoya Johnstone, a transgender fashion icon, who has worked in the industry for nearly a decade. When she started, designers wouldn’t cast her as a model.\n\n“People would ask why I couldn’t just dress like a man,” says Johnstone, who quit a job after a designer tried to force her to do so.\n\nIf there were more genderless fashion lines, Johnstone says the start to her career might have been easier. “I wouldn’t have had to make so much enmity, as I was kicking doors down.”\n\nBut fashion movements can ring a bit hollow for transgender women like Johnstone, who are often targeted and face a high risk of violence regardless of what they wear.\n\n“Genderless fashion is not always put in the context of other people who are not cisgender,” says Johnstone, who has been attacked for the way she dresses. “It is easier for a woman to dress like a man, but would be much harder for a transgender woman,” she says. “The police don’t know about gender fluidity in fashion.”\n\nGlobally, such lines have been criticised for failing to accommodate trans people in their fit and function.\n\nKenya’s new president William Ruto recently termed LGBTQ+ issues a non-issue, giving a nod to similar sentiments by his predecessor, president Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\n“We are making some progress but still have some way to go,” says Johnstone.\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks",

    "Kenya and South Africa are making a push for U.S. tourism dollars: Travel Weekly": "Kenya and South Africa have both launched tourism marketing campaigns that are targeted specifically to the American traveler as the U.S. market remains a vital one for Africa's sub-Saharan destinations.\n\nCape Town and the Western Cape launched a dedicated \"U.S. Neverending Tourists\" marketing campaign. Looking to attract travelers from the U.S. using the voices of U.S. expats who came to the cape and never left -- a group fondly known as \"neverending tourists\" -- the campaign features three Americans immersing themselves in the nature, culture and food and wine experiences on offer in the Western Cape. The series simply calls on viewers to come visit the destination to \"Get in a Good Space.\"\n\nThe digital strategy includes a media partnership with Expedia. The campaign will target source cities with direct flights, including New York, Atlanta and Washington.\n\nMireille Wenger, the provincial minister of finance and economic opportunities, explained how the campaign will further boost tourism numbers from the U.S.\n\n\"With the campaign set to drive increased awareness of the destination, we believe that we can expect a ramp-up in not only our visitor numbers but also in trade and investment,\" Wenger said \"We look forward to reaping the positive knock-on effect that this will have on our economy as we look to boost job creation in the Western Cape.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) launched the first phase of its global digital marketing campaign in North America to highlight Kenya's variety of wildlife, cultural and adventure activities.\n\nThe \"Real Deal Kenya\" campaign, launched in partnership with media-buying travel marketing experts Dahl-Mac Group and data insights company Sojern, delivers a variety of video content and display banners to audiences actively seeking new ideas for travel.\n\nAccording to CEO Betty Radier, the KTB campaign is in line with the board's strategy of enhancing the country's reputation as one of Africa's top tourism destinations.

    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent. The U.S. trade office said the two countries are developing a road map of engagement in agriculture, digital trade, customs procedure and other areas.",
    "Uhuru Kenyatta: How will Kenya's outgoing president be remembered?": "\"The handshake created a sense of inclusivity because if there was anything that was going to divide this country and throw it to the dogs, [it] was the whole idea of some people feeling excluded - the idea that government sort of belonged to a section of people or communities,\" says Egare Kabaji, a professor of literary communication at the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST).",
    "Uhuru Kenyatta failed to turn Kenya into as big an international player as he could – here’s why": "One of the notable achievements of Uhuru Kenyatta’s nine-year tenure as president was that he invigorated Kenya’s foreign policy.\n\nA year after his 2013 inauguration, his government launched a document that outlined Kenya’s diplomatic engagements and foreign relations. It was the country’s first written foreign policy since independence.\n\nIts themes can be distilled into four objectives and practices: regional and continental cooperation; promoting Kenya’s economic interests; revival of pan-Africanism; and an aggressive approach to foreign policy, including a plethora of high-level visits.\n\nIt was indeed a dynamic performance.\n\nNevertheless, in my view, based on the country’s mixed outcomes and foreign policy losses, it’s evident that the Kenyatta government’s foreign policy was not focused, consistent or effectively coordinated. Consequently, it failed to create a regional balance of power favourable to Kenya’s interests.\n\nAnd while the country became more visible globally and actively engaged in international matters, the returns from this visibility have been dismal – save for an increased debt burden.\n\nRegional and continental cooperation\n\nIn the 2014 Kenya Foreign Policy document, Kenyatta affirmed that Kenya would seek to promote sub-regional and regional integration.\n\nIn his inauguration speech in 2013, he said his government would strengthen regional ties through the free movement of people, goods and investment. He underscored the importance of deepening relations with the East African Community and Africa as a whole to:\n\ndeliver on the promise of independence and liberation from our colonial past.\n\nHowever, critics faulted Kenyatta for using a pan-African approach to overcome the initial global isolation and non-receptiveness Kenya faced from traditional allies like Britain and the US. This chilly reception from the UK and US followed Kenyatta’s election as president despite his facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) case.\n\nAs a result, the president’s policy on global politics retracted to operating through the continental body, the African Union.\n\nKenya became an active contributor to the union’s programmes. In 2014, the country gave US$1.1 million to support the African World Heritage Fund.\n\nIn 2015, Kenyatta was elected the chairperson of the African Peer Review Mechanism. This is a voluntary assessment and monitoring system that evaluates and advises African Union member states on their progress in achieving good governance.\n\nMoreover, Kenya was among the countries that contributed troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia.\n\nDespite all this activity, Kenyatta failed to effectively exert influence and drive regional integration to Kenya’s advantage.\n\nPan-Africanism\n\nA notable element in Kenya’s foreign policy under Kenyatta was the renaissance of pan-Africanism. In his first address to the African Union Summit in 2013, he said:\n\nPan-Africanism has sparked a Kenyan renaissance.\n\nThe president said he had received tutelage on pan-Africanism from his father, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya’s first president.\n\nArguably, this pan-African reinvigoration into Kenya’s foreign policy was motivated by the existential threats of global sanctions that the regime faced. Yet, Kenyatta’s election against the backdrop of the cases at The Hague turned Kenya into an icon of resistance following what was perceived as the unfair targeting of Africa by the ICC.\n\nDuring Kenyatta’s inauguration, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni praised Kenyans for rejecting western neo-colonialism. This was in reference to calls by diplomats that Kenyans should not elect people with cases to answer at the ICC.\n\nThe African Union convened an extraordinary summit that declared support for Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, who was also facing charges at The Hague.\n\nEconomic interests\n\nKenyatta’s foreign policy of economic prosperity was pursued and achieved via a triple approach.\n\nFirst was through encouraging trade ties with traditional allies like the UK, US and some countries in western Europe. Second was through a diversification of economic relations to include new markets in the form of a “look east” policy.\n\nThird was through emphasising intra-African trade. Kenya signed trade agreements with states not considered traditional allies, such as Nigeria and Ghana. Additionally, the country quickly signed the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement in March 2018.\n\nBut questions have arisen on whether Kenya has the financial capacity to meet present and future economic obligations.\n\nAssertive foreign policy\n\nKenya hosted a wide range of high-level international meetings. Subjects ranged from climate change to trade. Kenyatta also received high-level delegations reminiscent of former president Daniel Moi’s era. His guests included the pope and leaders of India, Israel, US, UK, China and Japan.\n\nFrom Africa, Kenyatta hosted leaders from Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Rwanda, among many others.\n\nBy July 2022, a month to the election that would end his term in office, Kenyatta had made 158 official foreign trips. In contrast, his predecessor Mwai Kibaki made just 33 foreign trips over 10 years of leadership.\n\nThe country’s foreign policy during Kenyatta’s second term, which began in 2017, is what I would describe as aggressive or assertive. The country took advantage of any international opportunity that arose to make its mark.\n\nIn February 2022, Kenya addressed a UN Security Council meeting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its envoy to the UN, Martin Kimani, came out strongly in defence of Ukraine. He stated that the Charter of the United Nations was fading due to “the relentless assault of the powerful”. Kimani compared Ukraine’s plight to Africa’s colonial legacy.\n\nKenya’s aggressive foreign policy direction earned Kenya a seat at the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.\n\nBut this aggressive foreign policy also portrayed Kenya as a nation that “wants everything”. This earned it some opposition regionally. For instance, states like Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti and Tanzania didn’t vote for Kenya in its bid to chair the African Union Commission.\n\nKenyatta should have streamlined his priorities and made his foreign objectives sharper so as not to appear to be a “Jack of all trades” in foreign affairs. Many foreign interests were projected with little coordination; few were accomplished.\n\nIn some cases, the country’s goodwill was squandered in the pursuit of self-interest.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe post-Kenyatta government needs to fast-track the realisation of East African Community objectives. It needs to support South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s active participation in regional integration. The new Ruto regime should also maintain a non-disruptive relationship with Rwanda and Tanzania.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, Kenya needs to diplomatically endeavour to reduce Ethiopia’s growing influence in the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\n\nUnder Kenyatta, Kenya’s foreign policy practice within the African Union was more “lone ranger”. The Ruto regime will need to forge closer ties with regional powers like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa to make it easier for Kenya to push through its agenda at the African Union.\n\nIt will also need to renegotiate its foreign debts and re-examine Kenya-China agreements to re-organise debt repayments.",
    "Preventing election violence in Kenya": "Average read time: 4 minutes Preventing election violence in Kenya On International Peace Day 2022 Benard Agona, peacebuilder and Executive Director of AfriNov in Kenya shares how they worked for peace before, during, and after the August 2022 elections.\n\nCivil society efforts to prevent election-related violence are working. Photo: AfriNov\n\nSince 1992, Kenyan general elections have been accompanied by mass violence causing tribal animosity and many other social injustices. The worst being the 2007/08 post-election violence that saw more than 1000 people killed and thousands displaced.\n\nSince 2012, AfriNov have been part of civil society efforts to prevent violence before, during, and after elections. This sits alongside our long term work for peace and justice.\n\nWhat follows is a brief account of our contribution to ensuring peaceful elections in August 2022.\n\nCivic education for free and fair elections\n\nCivic education is one of the most used strategies by civil society organizations to inform citizens. Citizen education is entrenched in the constitution of Kenya 2010. From 2012, AfriNov has organised impartial civic engagement forums to offer fair and balanced information to help minimise potential election violence. Our programme helps communities make informed decisions on who to vote for and to reflect on what good governance looks like.\n\nWith goal of seeing a peaceful, free and fair general election in August 2022, AfriNov started intensive civic education engagement from early 2021 by reaching out to key and influential people. This included opinion leaders, youth leaders, women leaders, the clergy, teachers, and more.\n\nOur goal was to ensure that citizens make informed decisions at the general election and to counter potential manipulation by politicians to engage in violence. We equipped local leaders with knowledge about the importance of citizen participation before, during and after the elections. These key local leaders then shared this news with grassroots citizens.\n\nWe also organised mass civic education. Our community resource people (a network of volunteers already trained by us in nonviolence and peacebuilding) engaged people through church/faith-based gatherings and other public gatherings. We also partnered with local radio and TV stations and participated in radio/TV talk shows, encouraging citizens to stand up and exercise their civic right of decision making, whilst also responding to their questions of concern.\n\nIn Nairobi, our youth groups (already trained by us in nonviolence) used their artistic talents to paint, draw and write messages that communicated the importance of participating in decision making and remaining peaceful over the election period. They did this on walls and any available public surface.\n\nWe also used social media to convey peace messages. WhatsApp groups allowed us to coordinate and update peace actors across our country on any incidences that could trigger violence. Through Facebook we shared success stories of action groups were taking to reduce tension as well as examples of empowering citizens for informed decisions.\n\nCommunity dialogues and peace campaigns\n\nDuring every election year in Kenya, some people leave their neighbourhoods for fear of threats of being evicted because of political affiliations. AfriNov organised and moderated community inter-ethnic dialogues bringing together community members and leaders for open conversations aimed at bridging any gaps that could result in violence. This was done in areas we identified as potential violence hot spots.\n\nAfriNov also continued to support community groups engaging in nonviolent campaigns against election malpractice and other form of injustices that could lead to election violence or cause tension in the country. With Turning the Tide nonviolence skills and knowledge, groups were able to organise street peace walks, write and present petitions to relevant authorities, engage with local leadership and police to register their concerns, and offer suggestions on how to handle issues nonviolently for a peaceful election.\n\nThe famous 'boda boda' groups (motor bike transporters), having been trained in the Turning the Tide approaches, made a pledge to never be used by politicians to cause violence. In previous elections, politicians had bribed boda boda riders to disrupt the political rallies of their opponents which resulted in violence. This year, boda boda riders conducted several street peace rallies and rides encouraging people to remain peaceful.\n\nTrained election observers\n\nTo ensure a credible election, AfriNov applied for accreditation to deploy election observers in selected polling stations. We recruited and prepared 69 people to participate in observing the general election held on 9 August 2022. This increased the confidence of citizens that the election was free and fair and also identified any gaps and challenges. It was good to see that most polling stations conducted peaceful elections, free of any election malpractices.\n\nCalm and active nonviolence\n\nWhat stands out in this year's general election is the level of calmness witnessed before, during, and after the elections. When the presidential election was disputed and taken to the Supreme Court people remained peaceful, even in areas believed to be hot spots. When the Supreme Court made a ruling, peace loving Kenyans held their breath. Though the aggrieved party was not happy with the ruling they accepted the verdict and requested their supporters to remain calm.\n\nAt the grassroots Kenyans were seen busy getting on with their work, a clear indication that the peace campaigns done by the many peace actors were successful. And beyond the election, our work with communities to address ongoing injustice and violence using active nonviolence continues.\n\nRead more about AfriNov's work",
    "Is Kenya ready to reintroduce the Shamba System?": "A view of Mt Elgon Forest. [Caroline Chebet, Standard]\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua's proposal to revert to the Shamba system has sparked debate on whether Kenya is ready for the re-introduction of the system that was banned twice by different regimes.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, in Baringo County, Gachagua hinted that the government has plans to allow peasant farmers to carry out farming in forests to boost food production in the country.\n\n\"There was Shamba System where locals could plant maize until the trees grow. This government is yours, we have made an order for Wananchi to be given an opportunity to cultivate in the forest to have more food,\" Gachagua said.\n\nHow the Shamba system worked\n\nThe agroforestry approach started way back in 1910 under tolonial rule to promote sustained and optimum production of food crops while assisting forest conservation. Under the system, agricultural crops are grown together with the forest trees.\n\nDuring the Moi administration, the system was aligned and locals would cooperate with officials from the Kenya Forest Service in matters allocation of land (mostly not more than an acre for each family).\n\nAfter allocation, the had grown after around three years, the beneficiaries would hand back the land to the Kenya Forest officials.\n\nBack then, the main aim was to afforest land where exotic trees had been cut for timber and as well as boost the food supply chain across the country.\n\nAmong the crops that were grown included; maize, beans, groundnuts, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. At the same time, those allocated the land would be allowed to harvest firewood, forest fruits and even keep beehives.\n\nWhy it was successful\n\nFrom the onset, the Shamba System was successful because at its introduction stage, the government through the Kenya Forest docket had designated personnel who worked hand in hand with farmers on a weekly basis.\n\nWith this in place, the farmer could be guided on what to plant and what not to during what season plus kinds of trees to plant and when to harvest.\n\nThe officers were also in charge of plot acquisition hence ensuring that only those with good intentions were vetted and allocated.\n\nHowever, it was later banned under the late Mwai Kibaki;s era, after it emerged that most farmers refused to move out of their allocated plots after the three-year period given elapsed and had cut down the trees.\n\nAnother major reason that led to the Kibaki-led government to abolish the Shamba System was logging, where rogue millers would collaborate with some Kenya Forest Service officials to cut trees for personal benefits.",

Backstory: In July, Kenya’s Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) got a court order to freeze 56 bank accounts which seven companies had used to launder Ksh 7 billion (~ $59.2 million). Of the seven companies, Flutterwave had about Ksh 6.7 billion frozen in 52 accounts from several banks including Guarantee Trust Bank, EcoBank, and Equity Bank. Later in August, the ARA received another order to freeze more accounts belonging to the fintech. The court froze funds worth Ksh 400.6 million ($3.3 million) across three banks including UBA, Access Bank, and Safaricom M-Pesa. And now? Well, about 2,468 investors say their money is part of the money frozen by the ARA in its pursuit of Flutterwave. Spokesperson Morris Ebitimi Joseph explained to Business Daily that they invested in a company called 86 Football Technology—also known as 86FB, 86Z, or 86W. The investors made deposits for an investment scheme that promised better returns which did not come to fruition. Investigations by the investors led them to believe that they had been swindled to the tune of Ksh 1.44 billion ($11 million) by a dubious person via transactions on Flutterwave. Now, they want Kenyan courts to separate Ksh 1.44 billion out of the frozen Ksh 6.7 billion released to them. “I believe that the issuance of an order compelling Guarantee Trust Bank, Equity Bank and Ecobank to deposit the sums excluded in the bank accounts of our advocates, justice shall be served to the 2,468 interested parties who were swindled of their hard-earned money through the scheme,” Ebitimi said. Zoom out: While the Central Bank of Kenya has accused Flutterwave of operating without a license, the fintech has maintained that it submitted an application for licensing back in 2019, citing the country’s notoriously long licensing process. Meanwhile, the ARA’s freeze order is valid only for 90 days as it gears up for its case against Flutterwave which is set to appear in court in November.\n\n\n\nSEND BY FLUTTERWAVE Don’t just send money, send money fast.

Last week, the DStv parent company announced its acquisition of Namola, an on-demand emergency response app. So, more choices for MultiChoice? Yup. MultiChoice South Africa CEO, Nyiko Shiburi, said “Namola is part of our strategy to expand our ecosystem beyond entertainment and to offer a suite of consumer services that meet the needs of our customers.” Namola describes itself as South Africa’s leading response solution “that allows all citizens get help fast”. On the app, users can get access to the public emergency services in South Africa including the police, fire service, ambulance and other community services. Its premium plan, Namola Plus, even allows users opt-in to receive help in emergency situations where they can’t reach or answer their phones. Namola’s individual plan costs R29 (2$) per month, the couples plan is R59 ($3.30), and the family package is R99 ($5.6) monthly. With MultiChoice’s acquisition, Namola will now be available to all DStv users—at extra cost, of course. From October 26, South African users can add the service to their bill. Big picture: MultiChoice has big plans for its future. Other than its recent acquisition of Namola, it also recently launched an internet service called DStv Internet, and it’s planning to launch its own smart TV called DStv Glass. MultiChoice Group CEO, Calvo Mawela, also announced last week that the company is looking to foray into fintech, although we might not be seeing that for a while.\n\n\n\nBAMBOO EXPANDS INTO GHANA Bamboo, one of Nigeria’s leading online brokerage firms, has expanded into Ghana, making it the first trans-national West African brokerage app. Through a partnership with 10th Capital Investments, a licensed Ghanaian firm, the more-than-50,000 users on Bamboo Ghana’s waitlist will now be able to buy and invest in stocks from US companies like Apple Inc and Tesla. When Bamboo raised a $15 million Series A round in January, its CEO announced that Ghana’s market was the company’s next frontier. Nine months and another $17.4 million raise later, the Ghana plans have become a reality. In a statement shared with TechCabal, Bamboo said it recently received a No Objection Letter from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate in the country, enabling it to launch successfully. “We believe strongly that all Africans should earn a return on their investments and build intergenerational wealth. That’s why we created Bamboo: we wanted to create an easy and secure way for everyday Africans to invest in the US stock market, and eventually, in all types of asset classes,” said Richmond Bassey, Bamboo CEO and co-founder. Since its 2019 launch, Bamboo and other retail investment apps providing access to foreign securities like Chaka, Trove and Rise have had to deal with harsh regulatory conditions in their home country, Nigeria. In April last year, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labelled this category of companies as illegal and warned operators in the capital market to desist from operating with them. This was followed by Nigeria’s central bank describing Bamboo as unlicensed and freezing its bank accounts for a while. Despite the struggles, Bamboo has maintained its resolve to work “very closely with regulators in Nigeria” to ensure mutual satisfaction from both parties. Now in Ghana, Bamboo has committed to working with the country’s SEC on an ongoing basis to develop a standard regulatory framework for the retail investment industry Bamboo is pioneering. Through Bamboo’s US digital investing partner, DriveWealth LLC, the Nigeria-born company assures users that all accounts can claim insurance of up to $500,000 via the US Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). With regulations and insurance in place, Bamboo is ready to make retail investment a norm in Ghana. Albert Asiamah, 10th Capital Investments COO, was effusive about the performance of Bamboo’s product in Nigeria, describing the investment as ideal and beneficial. “We’re thrilled to work with [the Bamboo team] to bring Ghanaians the opportunity to invest in the US and eventually the local stock market. Their impeccable track record in Nigeria, stellar product and educational tools make them an ideal collaborator,” he said. “Together with Bamboo, we’ve been able to provide investors across Africa with affordable access to the US markets. Today, we’re thrilled to extend that same access to the people of Ghana,” said John Shammas, head of technical sales at DriveWealth. “As we continue our international expansion, we look forward to empowering more customers with the tools they need to improve their financial well-being and engage with the markets,” he added.\n\n\n\nSELL MORE WITH PAYSTACK Increase your online sales with a Paystack Storefront – a free, beautiful seller page that helps you bring creative ideas to life. 👉🏾 Learn more at paystack.com/storefront.

In Africa, its importance is extra critical as activities ranging from financial services to social commerce depend on its availability. Yet, internet speeds across many African countries are far below the global average. At 68.9 megabits per second (mbps), South Africa leads the continent in terms of internet speed, though it fell short of the 77.7mbps global average according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. The effects are dire as it restricts young Africans from harnessing more opportunities in the global digital economy where reliable and fast internet remain key. While 3G and 4G internet services are largely available across the continent, they pale in comparison to the speed 5G internet brings. Currently, about 13 nations are testing 5G networks, with over 40 nations yet to lay down a foundation for the creation of 5G spectrums. The impact of the 5G internet is already obvious on the continent. According to Sylwia Kechiche, principal industry analyst, enterprise at Ookla, MTNSouth Africa performed better than its competitors on the continent as a result of the 5G technology. “We can clearly see the impact that 5G has on overall performance as South African operators came first thanks to having 5G networks in place. MTN South Africa was well ahead of the rest of operators, despite facing challenges with load shedding, with a median download speed of 65.95 mbps If we take 5G out of the equation, Safaricom Kenya was the fastest operator among the analyzed operators,” he said. While analysts predict that 5G will add $2.2 trillion to Africa’s economy by 2034, the transition doesn’t seem so smooth. Existing challenges include spectrum regulation clarity, commercial viability, deployment deadlines, and low citizen purchasing power of 5G enabled smartphones and expensive internet. To accelerate adoption of 5G technologies in Africa, African countries must develop clear and comprehensive frameworks for infrastructure deployment, use, regulation, and management. Spectrum pooling should be implemented to optimise the benefits of available spectrum and increase available bandwidths for mobile operators. Furthermore, spectrum trading should be pursued to enable cost-effective and efficient spectrum use to optimise the transfer of spectrum rights to users who require the 5G network spectrum the most, thereby lowering auction spectrum prices.

    "‘A brutal legacy’: Queen’s death met with anger as well as grief in Kenya": "In 1952, the then Princess Elizabeth was on a royal tour with Prince Philip at Treetops lodge in Kenya. Unknown to them at the time, she would receive news of her father’s death during that visit, and the forest lodge would long be remembered as the place where Britain’s longest-serving monarch “went to sleep a princess and awoke a queen”.\n\nJust two years after her visit, the Mau Mau, Kenyan freedom fighters opposed to British colonial rule, burned the lodge down. It was rebuilt in 1957, and older residents who live along the long and winding path to the lodge remembered her second visit to the area in 1983 fondly, saying it had placed their neighbourhood on the map. But Treetops was not open for the end of the Queen’s life. It closed its doors last year after a dive in tourism during the pandemic forced it out of business.\n\nThe lodge, in Aberdare forest, has a lofty presence but dusty stairwells and webbed windows suggest solitude and abandonment. Most people who interacted directly with the Queen are now dead, said a hunter who worked there. The treehouse is adorned with pictures and stories of her visits but few stories about her were passed on. Vague recollections mirror the faded relevance of the monarchy in Kenya.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth and Prince Philip (centre) are greeted at the Treetops lodge in February 1952. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images\n\nAfter the announcement of the Queen’s death on Thursday, however, reactions in Kenya were swift. The country’s leaders paid tribute with messages expressing “great sorrow and a deep sense of loss”, hailing a “towering icon of selfless service to humanity” and lauding her “admirable” leadership of the Commonwealth. Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, ordered four days of mourning as news of the Queen’s death made the front-pages of major local papers and dominated conversations online.\n\nBut many on the streets in Nairobi were indifferent or unaware of the news. Some younger Kenyans spoke of it in detached tones. To a number of them, she was a distant figure, better known through fictional portrayals of her on popular TV series such as The Crown.\n\nA wave of criticism also flooded online spaces. During her reign, British soldiers committed widespread atrocities against Kenyans at the height of Mau Mau uprising between 1952 and 1960. Roughly 1.5 million people were forced into concentration camps where they were subjected to torture, rape and other violations. Reports later showed the British had made concerted efforts to destroy and conceal official records of their brutal crackdowns.\n\nObservers say the erasure of history had consequences that have stretched on to the present. “I don’t remember learning about the ills of the colonial empire,’’ said Dr Njoki Wamai, an assistant professor in politics and international relations at the United States International University-Africa. “Many of us have had to educate ourselves in public spaces, and because of the legacy of colonial education in Kenya, the Queen has been venerated and treated as an iconic figure.”\n\nHundreds of arrested Kenyans wait to be questioned in a Mau Mau camp, in March 1953. Photograph: Interncontinentale/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEven so, harrowing tales of British colonial rule have been passed on through generations. “When you sit with your grandparents and they tell you their stories, the pain is almost tangible. You can feel it,” said Nyambura Maina. “I refuse to centre the pain others are feeling over the pain our people went through.”\n\nKikonde Mwamburi, 33, said: “Death should not be used to sanitise her brutal legacy. I’m glad this obtuse culture is being questioned by younger generations.”\n\nRather than pay tribute to the Queen, a number of Kenyans chose to honour the independence movement. The words “Mau Mau” and “Dedan Kimathi”, the leader of the uprising, trended through the early hours of the morning.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She believes the British legacy of violence is downplayed for economic reasons.\n\nKenya has strong economic and trade ties with the UK and is a part of the Commonwealth, membership of which bolsters countries’ lobbying capacity and provides business and education opportunities.\n\nBut the association’s geopolitical relevance has been challenged in recent years and King Charles III will be pressed to strengthen ties with Commonwealth countries and solidify Britain’s soft power. Earlier this year, the royal family’s efforts to do so were subverted in Jamaica, after leaders and the public called for slavery reparations and an apology for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe Queen maintained strong relations with leaders of Commonwealth countries over her 70-year reign, including many of Kenya’s presidents. Experts say King Charles may face an exacting task in sustaining those ties amid criticism of the British empire in former colonies across the globe, and that he can expected to face growing calls to address colonial injustices.",
    "Why US tech billionaire took up job as ambassador to Kenya": "By Mike Owuor More by this Author\n\nBy Elvis Ondieki More by this Author\n\nWhen United States President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Margaret “Meg” Whitman as the Ambassador to Kenya last December, one question must have lingered in many minds across the world: why would a Silicon Valley billionaire with a storied career as a corporate executive and board member of some of the world’s top multinationals take up this role?\n\nIt was an inevitable introductory question as the Sunday Nation team settled down for an exclusive interview with Ms Whitman—the first since her arrival last month—at the American embassy in Nairobi.\n\nPerhaps undergirded by decades of experience as a corporate leader and awareness of her new role as a diplomat, 66-year-old Ms Whitman calmly tackles even the most uncomfortable of questions and has a vivid recollection of events, people and places. She speaks with authority and dresses the part.\n\nHer real-time net worth on Forbes is indicated as $3.1 billion (Sh373 billion), ranking her among the richest women in the United States.\n\nForbes data indicate that in 2021, the year she was nominated to be the ambassador to Kenya, her peak net worth was $5.8 billion. This usually fluctuates depending on various factors, including stock markets.\n\nBack to the question: What convinced the billionaire, most known for steering multinational e-Commerce giant eBay to astronomical growth and for leading Hewlett-Packard among other high-profile corporate positions, to take up a US government job in Nairobi?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfluential global role\n\n“So, I was called by the President of the United States (President Joe Biden) and he asked whether I would be willing to be an ambassador. And the next sentence was, ‘We want you to go to Kenya.’ And I said, ‘Okay, tell me why. Tell me more’,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman says that in her conversation with President Biden, he explained the influential global role Africa would play in the next decades, especially given its burgeoning population.\n\n“And he said, ‘Kenya is one of the most important countries in Africa, and so I’d really like you to take up a post there. The other thing that I think would be a good fit for you and the United States is that Kenya is the East Africa leader in technology; with Safaricom, M-Pesa (a mobile money service) and the start-up community’,” says Ms Whitman, who has been inducted to the US Business Hall of Fame.\n\nIn picking her, the president believed that having an American ambassador with such vast experience, especially in technology—given Kenya’s prominent role on the continent—would be important.\n\nShe told the President: “Okay, I’m game.”\n\nBut being a daughter, wife, mother and grandmother, it was not a decision she would make on her own. So, what did those closest to her think about this? Throughout the interview, the significance of her family, especially in some of the most important decisions in her personal and professional career, stands out.\n\nHer two sons—Griff Harsh and Will Harsh —encouraged her to take up the ambassadorial job because “life is about experiences and we think it would be a great experience.” It did not matter that she had never been a diplomat before and her husband, Dr Griffith R Harsh, a renowned neurosurgeon in the United States, decided to come with her to Nairobi.\n\n“As it turns out, American medical licences are good in just three countries outside the US. Kenya is one of them. And so, he is now trying to decide what he will do as he gets settled in Kenya,” she tells Sunday Nation about a man whose unwavering support alongside that of her mother is acknowledged throughout Ms Whitman’s book, The Power of Many.\n\nShe goes on: “It turns out that households don’t run themselves. And so, just getting the household set up, learning how to use M-Pesa, understanding how we get around and where to go, I have had no time. So, that has fallen to him.”\n\nBesides, Ms Whitman had to resign from the board of General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Teach for America among others, to satisfy the requirements for her appointment. Ambassadorial duties, she says, require the relinquishing of all such positions.\n\nRead: Joe Biden nominates ex-HP boss as US ambassador to Kenya\n\nEven though she had been to Kenya before in 2018 during a two-week visit that also included travelling to Tanzania as a member of the board of trustees of The Nature Conservancy, a US-headquartered global environmental organisation, this time it was different.\n\nMs Whitman’s nomination was considered by the US Senate and confirmed on July 14 this year. She came to Kenya on August 1 to take over from Kyle McCarter. It was not until August 5 that President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose term ended this month, received her credentials. Significantly, it was just four days to one of Kenya’s most closely contested elections.\n\nTake on general election\n\nWith that, she was thrust headlong into the General Election. She admits that she had been researching a lot about Kenyan politics, but a lot was new. Ms Whitman’s conclusion is that the election was “remarkable”.\n\n“Democracy has prevailed here,” she says. “The outcome was ultimately contested, but in an appropriate, non-violent way—right to the Supreme Court that adjudicated and the candidates accepted the results. And I think it was a shining moment for Kenya.”\n\nShe goes on: “Kenyans should be very proud of the process that took place here. It was, I think, a model even for East Africa and all of Africa and, frankly, a model for the world.”\n\nShe was an observer on Election Day and her experience at Nairobi Primary School is stuck in her mind. She marvelled at the calmness and organisation of the voting—though she thought the ballot papers were “very long and many ”.\n\nMs Whitman says that the US had no preferred candidate in the election: “The US was very clear that this was a Kenyan election by Kenyans for Kenyans. We are here only to be supportive if we can be in terms of transparency and as election observers. But we did not have a preferred candidate.”\n\nNonetheless, there appear to have been shuttle diplomacy by Western envoys during the post-election period. On August 18, for example, Ms Whitman was in a team that included Delaware Senator Chris Coons, which separately met with Mr Kenyatta, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s William Ruto (then President-elect) and Mr Raila Odinga of Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party.\n\nWhat was this all about? She says Mr Coons was the reason the meetings happened.\n\n“As you probably know, Senator Coons has a long history with Africa and a long history in Kenya. He did his first year of college at the University of Nairobi. And he speaks quite fluent Swahili.\n\n“So, he knew all three (Mr Kenyatta, Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga) and he actually arranged these meetings. They (the neetings) were really about checking in with his friends and talking about where we were in the election and encouraging what was already underway—which was a peaceful resolution to the challenge at the Supreme Court,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nBut did the US and other global powers fear Mr Kenyatta would cling to power and frustrate a peaceful transition? The envoy says she never had such doubts, given her interactions with him.\n\n“I would say we were quite confident,” she says. “When I met with President Kenyatta as I presented my credentials, I said, ‘I have every confidence that this election will go as you all hope it will: violence-free, a peaceful transfer of power.’ And that’s exactly what happened. And I, in the US embassy, had confidence that this would go smoothly. And it did.”\n\nVisa backlog\n\nMs Whitman’s management style celebrates competence and teamwork. Early in her tenure, she has had to confront some long-standing challenges at the embassy that she says she is confident she will resolve.\n\nThe backlog in handling visa applications of Kenyans has resulted in long waiting times, and has been top on her agenda after complaints from those who had been forced to reschedule or cancel their travel plans.\n\nAs part of the efforts to streamline operations, the American embassy recently waived interview requirements for some categories of visa renewal applications. She says she recently spent a few hours working with the teams processing the visas and, after some training, helped to take applicants’ fingerprints.\n\n“I’m not trained to do the interviews (like the consular officials) but anyone can do finger-printing,” she says, laughing.\n\nThe embassy now has a new “very experienced” consul-general, she says, and the ambassador hopes that the appointment, plus the recent repeal of a requirement for visa interviews for some categories, will eventually help clear the backlog and improve the US visa application experience.\n\nIf she still sticks to her worldview when she wrote her 2010 book, The Power of Many, she will be slow on parties and showy treats for embassy staff. While emerging tech companies indulged in parties, she writes, eBay was focused on spending only on the necessities and paying its staff well.\n\n“Beyond vetoing fluff and excess, I was determined to make sure eBay remained a lean, efficient company in other ways, too,” she wrote.\n\nSo what drove her as a pioneer woman corporate executive often breaking the proverbial glass ceiling?\n\nBecause of her career choices, Ms Whitman has at times worked in set-ups where she was the only woman in the room, but she is grateful for the mentorship from her mother and her early workplace influences for building in her the spirit to fight on.\n\n“From the earliest day, my mother told my brother, my sister and me: ‘You can do anything you want.’ And I amazingly believed her. There was no reason to believe her, but she was very persuasive and confident. And she said, ‘Don’t let people tell you you can’t do it. You figure it out,’” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds; “I landed the US ambassador job. I’m not a career diplomat. I’ve never done this before. So, at first, you’re thinking, ‘Hmm, how am I going to do this?’ And then you figure it out. And so, my advice to men and women is: Give yourself a little latitude to figure it out.”\n\nAmerica has previously sent some colourful and controversial envoys to Nairobi, so what should Kenya expect during her term? She says democracy and transparency remain important and she will also focus on economic development—particularly small and medium enterprises.\n\n“How to take this digital environment and make it work for small- to medium businesses is a real passion of mine,” she says, saluting President Ruto for also focusing on enterprise in his manifesto.\n\n“What Kenyans have to build on are things like the penetration of M-Pesa. I’m not sure that Kenyans realise how impressive this is. In Silicon Valley, we all knew about M-Pesa and were amazed at the penetration and how it had lifted people out of poverty and now everyone in Kenya is banked,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nHer assessment of Kenya’s technology scene is that it is at its infancy but has tremendous potential.\n\n“I think it’s very vibrant, but maybe at the beginning of the cycle,” she says. “What you need to create an even more vibrant tech scene is some large companies: Safaricom, now Google is here, Microsoft,among others. What they are doing is bringing in young tech workers and training them.”\n\nSuch an environment with many skilled people helps create start-ups.\n\n“Then you need an investment community: venture capital. And venture capital is alive and well in Kenya. In fact, if you adjust for the size of GDP of the country, Kenya has the biggest venture capital sector on the continent of Africa,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman emphasises the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) for long-term gains.\n\n“You need some very good universities who are training computer scientists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers in Stem. I would encourage the leading universities here to think about investing in training more Stem students,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman, who is often listed as one of the most influential women in the world, particularly points out that “unless girls major in Stem and go through high school with a good maths and science background, you’re not going to have the women to take the jobs in technology.”\n\nFood security\n\nDuring her tenure in Kenya, she says she will also focus on food security. Ms Whitman is perturbed by the humanitarian crisis caused by the drought in north-eastern Kenya and the Horn of Africa that is “perhaps the largest in the world right now”.\n\nShe says she will also put emphasis on conservation.\n\n“What Kenya has done around community conservancies is extraordinary. You know, the national parks, I think, comprise around two to three per cent of Kenyan lands. If you add all the community conservancies, it could go up to 12 per cent of Kenya—and I am being conservative. And, obviously, tourism is a big source of foreign exchange and a big part of the economy,” she says.\n\nSpeaking of the economy, it is widely acknowledged that Kenya-US trade relations are lopsided in favour of the superpower. The trade window facilitated by Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) has been among the key areas to bridge that gap. It first opened in 2000 and extended in 2015, but stares at an uncertain future when it expires in 2025.\n\n“Kenya has benefitted, I think quite dramatically, under Agoa. They are one of the biggest beneficiaries of Agoa, particularly in apparel exports. We have seen apparel exports from Kenya to the US go up dramatically in the context of Agoa,” she says, hoping that there will be conversations about maintaining this momentum.\n\nInvestment Partnership\n\nThere is also the USA-Kenya Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that started during the tenure of former President Donald Trump. Ms Whitman says the FTA has been binned by the Biden administration in favour of the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) launched in July.\n\nWhile Mr Trump wanted to negotiate a bilateral trade deal, the STIP was described as “the new roadmap” to support African regional economic integration.\n\n“When new administrations come in, sometimes policies change. And so, what we now have in place is the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership that was negotiated by our United States trade representative and (Trade Cabinet Secretary) Betty Maina in the Kenyan government. And this is an important first step to ultimately perhaps even more cooperation,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds: “One of the things that I’d very much like to see is exports from Kenya to the US improve significantly. It’s important for Kenya because of the foreign exchange reserves and the opportunity for American companies to import to Kenya.”\n\nDuring Mr Kenyatta’s administration from 2013, and his predecessor Mwai Kibaki since 2003, there has been a rise in Chinese investments and trade with the Asian giant. Chinese firms, mostly state-backed, have been involved in various mega projects, including construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway. Is the US worried about China’s growing influence?\n\n“Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken was very clear when he was here in October 2021 that we didn’t want to say to Kenyans ‘you can’t do business with China’ but give Kenyans an opportunity to do more business with Americans. And so, we definitely are interested in making sure there is a level playing field for American companies and making sure that American companies understand the opportunity in Kenya,’” she says.\n\nMs Whitman notes: “I was the CEO of a Fortune 50 company. And I think many big American companies don’t understand the opportunity in Kenya. When you sit in America, you are thinking about Asia, Europe, Latin America – because they are so close to us – but the opportunity in Africa and in Kenya is great.”\n\nThe American embassy has also been under fire for its travel advisories over the years. Under Ms Whitman, two that warned American citizens against travelling to Kisumu on key dates around the presidential election—the announcement of the results and the Supreme Court verdict—have stirred debate.\n\n“Our first job as the embassy and [for me] as the US ambassador is to make sure that Americans and embassy personnel are safe. And this is true not only for Kenya but for every country in the world: safety of Americans and embassy personnel is number one. We had no information that you didn’t have, but our second biggest installation outside of Nairobi is Kisumu,” she says, adding that the precaution could have been informed by “some violence in previous elections”.\n\nSays Ms Whitman: “I have no real latitude about whether to issue those warnings or not. They are really required by the United States government in these kinds of circumstances. Fortunately, Kisumu was perfect. There was no violence there, and so we were happy about that.”\n\nUS Supreme Court\n\nShe explains that even though she did not have a lot of latitude on the decision to issue those warnings, “as we go forward, we’ll try to think about these as carefully as we can.”\n\nWe held the interview three months after the US Supreme Court overturned the Roe v Wade judgment, effectively removing many liberties for women on abortion. Will that affect the US government’s funding of reproductive health rights in Kenya? Ms Whitman says a categorical “no”.\n\n“President Biden has been very clear that in the US, he will continue to support women’s rights to choose,” says Ms Whitman. “The State Department and the mission in Nairobi will not change policies on that.”\n\nPresidential ambition?\n\nHaving been previously listed by some publications as one of the people most likely to be America’s first woman president, she is categorical during our interview that she would not consider getting into the race for the White House.\n\n“I ran for governor of California (in 2010). As you know, I lost [to Jerry Brown]. And I sort of did my turn at elective politics. So, you will not see me run again,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman has visited a few places outside Nairobi, most recently Kisumu, but hopes to travel more. And true to her love for the outdoors, she has already been to Ngong Hills and Mt Longonot for a hike. She has also visited the Amboseli National Park and the Maasai Mara.\n\n“But that’s just the beginning of my travel. I want to get out to places beyond Nairobi. Nairobi is very important, but I want to make sure I get out to towns and villages across Kenya.”\n\nWe had to wind up our interview exactly when our scheduled hour with her ran out. She was rushing to address a gathering of women in technology hosted by the embassy.\n\nDorcas Odumbe contributed to this article with additional interview questions\n\n[email protected]",
    "Kenyan herders turn to aloe farming as drought bites": "Corrugated roads, sharp bends, rocks and scorching sun reflecting off the ground define a road trip to Sabor village in Baringo county of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley.\n\nFor a long time, keeping livestock has been the main economic activity here, but the enterprise faces myriad challenges, including acute scarcity of pasture and water. The dire situation in the region encourages cattle raiding which, in turn, has led to the proliferation of guns and other illegal weapons.\n\nIn times of drought, livestock farmers incur losses as they are forced to sell their animals cheaply. Butchers from Nairobi and other cities across the country flock to the villages to buy livestock at very low prices, with a mature cow sometimes selling for as little as US$50.\n\n“This is a failed enterprise – selling an animal at a throwaway price is really discouraging,” says 57-year-old Jackson Cheboi, a former livestock farmer in Sabor.\n\nPastoralists in the region have always been at risk from drought. But recent years have been particularly punishing, with failed rainy seasons killing thousands of livestock, along with their owners’ livelihoods, and bringing the threat of starvation to the region.\n\nAccording to government-owned news outlet Kenya News Agency, between January and April this year about 3,766 livestock died due to drought – 1,338 in Tiaty constituency and 1,245 in Baringo South – while 44,300 households suffered the pangs of climate change-induced famine.\n\nTurning to aloe vera for relief\n\nTo mitigate the losses, Baringo farmers like Cheboi have decided to diversify to farming aloe vera and selling various products from the perennial plant. Aloe vera thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions and is well known for its medicinal properties. It has been found to be a viable way to alleviate the climate woes that have hit pastoralists in the Loruk, Kimalel, Sabor and Koriema areas.\n\nAloe vera farming in Baringo is not an entirely new enterprise. In 2004, the European Union donated about US$150,000 towards a project to promote aloe growing, harvesting and processing. The venture was successful on a number of fronts, but collapsed in 2008, reportedly due to poor management and poor pricing mechanisms, which disincentivised farmers from pursuing the crop.\n\nNow, Cheboi and some other farmers – through their community-based organisation KOKISA (Koriema Kimalel Sabor Farmers’ Cooperative Society) – are working more with the crop. They have been manufacturing several products from it, including soap, shampoo and herbal medicine for treating various ailments.\n\nMy animals perished in the drought and some were stolen, I now fully depend on the aloe vera plant for my daily needs Jackson Cheboi, a former livestock farmer\n\nApart from the products, the farmers also sell aloe vera sap to foreign traders, mainly those from China, who go to villages that are accessible to buy the solidified sap and export it to their country. “This is what keeps me going. I have no other income. My animals perished in the drought and some were stolen,” Cheboi tells China Dialogue in Sabor village. “I now fully depend on the aloe vera plant for my daily needs.”\n\nAlfred Chepkwony, another farmer from Baringo North, says the plant is the only solution for dealing with the numerous climate change-related challenges facing the people of Baringo.\n\nAn aloe garden in the grounds of the aloe-processing facility, Koriema (Image: Shadrack Omuka)\n\nHe says farming it is slowly transforming pastoralists’ in the region. “Our lives have been uplifted compared with those who still rely on livestock alone,” he says. “The crop also discourages animal raiding and lessens climate-related losses, because people keep only a few livestock that they can manage easily, as they farm aloe vera for their daily income.”\n\nJoseph Ng’etich, project manager in charge of the Baringo Aloe-Bio-Enterprise Development Project, confirms that aloe farming has improved many lives in Baringo. “Aloe vera is a valuable plant and that is why we’re encouraging locals to grow it and stop depending on livestock. There is a big market in China where they can sell their products and earn good profits,” said Ng’etich.\n\nThough beauty products and medicine manufactured from the sap attract high demand locally, most farmers prefer selling their sap to Chinese traders at US$1.5 per kilogram.\n\nAccording to Evans Taracha, chief of research at National Museums Kenya, Baringo can produce up to 7 tons of aloe sap per acre, worth more than US$15,000 per month – an amount that cannot easily be matched by livestock farming in this arid and semi-arid region.\n\nIn Turkana County, too\n\nIt is not only Baringo farmers who have resorted to aloe vera farming to alleviate losses triggered by climate change. In neighbouring Turkana county, locals have also formed farmers’ groups with the aim of engaging fully in aloe farming and production of various products.\n\nThrough their community group, Nalapatui Community-Based Natural Resource Management Committee, which comprises 35 members – mostly women and younger people – the locals have abandoned livestock keeping to become aloe vera farmers.\n\nRecommended\n\nWith assistance from Kenya Forestry Research Institute, group members have established aloe nurseries to end their reliance on wild-growing aloe and begin cultivating the plant, thereby ensuring regular supplies of sap. At the moment, they are manufacturing soap and beauty products which they sell locally at Kakuma Refugee Camp and in Lokichogio town.\n\n\n\nAs is the case in the villages of Baringo, the enterprise has transformed the living standards of the locals of Nalapatui village in Turkana West, which is also located in a region where crime such as cattle raiding is common.\n\n“Money that I get from aloe products has enabled me to start other businesses. I own a retail shop inside the village where I also sell various products,” says Ekuro Ekutan, a farmer in Nalapatui.\n\nNot an easy venture\n\nCultivating aloe vera requires relatively low levels of chemical inputs and next to no weeding. The locals say once planted, the plant kills the weeds by itself and cannot be eaten by animals, mostly because its leaves have a thorny structure on both sides, complete with a thorny tip. Information published by the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute does, however, suggest using nitrogen-phosphate-potassium fertilisers at a rate of around 20 kg per acre, as well as occasional insecticide to combat mealybugs which feed on the plant’s sap.\n\nThe exercise of squeezing sap from the plant and processing it into the final product is not easy, demanding a lot of labour.\n\nA newly erected Zonken sign post at the gate of the Koriema aloe-processing facility (Shadrack Omuka)\n\nA farmer in Kimalel, Pamela Chepcheng, says sap must be boiled to a level that facilitates solidification. “Once the liquid is thick, it is removed from the boiling pot and poured into another container to cool. After about 30 minutes, the thick sap turns solid,” she says. “The solid materials are then broken into small pieces and packed in gunny bags, ready for the market.”\n\nChepcheng says the process is quite burdensome and that sometimes one is forced to hire many workers to do the job, “which turns out to be expensive compared to the profits we earn after the whole process.”\n\nAccording to Ng’etich, in a day a farmer working alone can squeeze up to five litres of the green liquid from the plant. Those farmers who live in remote areas, from where it is difficult to reach the market themselves, will tend to sell the sap to traders at about US$0.30 per litre, earning up to US$45 in a month.\n\n“The Chinese traders buy the sap at US$1.5 per litre [from markets] but the farmers think the price should be hiked to around US$4 to make the business more lucrative,” he says.\n\nThough the profits are not encouraging, Chepcheng is not disappointed. She tells China Dialogue that aloe farming has empowered her to build a house for her family and send the children to school. She is also able to feed them, unlike before when they depended on relief food.\n\n“After selling the sap and getting the money, I am able to do many things,” she says. “I pay school fees for my six children: three in primary school, two in high school and one at a local university.”\n\nCommercialising the crop\n\nTwo years ago, the county government of Baringo signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a Chinese company, Zonken Biotech Company Limited, to promote aloe vera farming and marketing in the region.\n\nAccording to the MOU document, Zonken is tasked with promoting the farming as well as undertaking marketing activities and purchasing sap from local farmers, while the Baringo county government must allocate land for setting up a facility to help process aloe.\n\nBaringo governor, Stanley Kiptis, says the chief aim of signing the MOU was to commercialise aloe farming in the county so as to improve farmers’ living standards.\n\n“We need our people to change their mentality, from relying on livestock, to aloe vera farming, a venture that is more profitable than just keeping animals. We, as the government, would like to see our famers living a decent life,” Kiptis tells China Dialogue.\n\n“We have more than 7,000 square kilometres of land that has been left fallow for many decades. If we can plant aloe vera on this land, we will change our lives forever; relying on livestock is now an outdated way of doing business,” he says.\n\nZonken has already started renovating a stalled facility in Koriema in Baringo South to process the aloe sap, a departure from the current practice whereby farmers process the sap manually.\n\nA representative of the company, William Chin, says the company is also expected to employ many women and younger people, below 35 years old, as soon as it begins its operations. He says Zonken will offer good incentives to farmers “to further boost their morale which has been low for a long time due to low prices.”",

    "Will U.S.-China Competition Shape Kenya’s Trade Trajectory?": "Kenya’s much anticipated presidential election recently concluded with the Supreme Court confirming President William Ruto’s victory. In the runup to this close contest, Kenya’s political discourse was for once focused on economic and policy concerns. As the new government takes up the reins of administration, trade will feature in the policy solutions to ongoing challenges like rising unemployment rates, Kenya’s large public sector debt, concerns around equitable taxation, and the residual effects of global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In charting the direction of the country’s post-election economic policy, trade will be important in various ways: its volume, bridging Kenya’s trade deficit, and the country’s external relations.\n\nA cursory look at Kenya’s international trade reveals some striking patterns (see figure 1). The country’s total merchandise trade volume in 2020 amounted to $21 billion or 21 percent of GDP. More than 16 percent of this total is from trade with China (the country’s top trading partner), followed by the EU ($2.9 billion), India ($1.8 billion), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ($1.2 billion). The United States (nearly $1.0 billion) is Kenya’s fifth-largest trade partner. Other major economic partners include Uganda and Tanzania, both in East Africa. These trade relationships with major external partners will shape the new Kenyan government’s policy objectives especially around increasing the productivity of agriculture, manufacturing, and small businesses.\n\nKenya’s international trade is also an area where great power competition could play out. The country’s main exports to the United States, in 2019, were fairly diversified and included woven apparel ($286 million); knit apparel ($168 million); edible fruit and nuts ($55 million); ores, slag, and ash ($52 million); and coffee, tea, and spice ($41 million). This trade was enabled in large part by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the preferential market access agreement for countries south of the Sahara. Meanwhile, Kenya imported aircraft ($59 million), plastics ($58 million), machinery ($41 million), and cereals ($30 million) from the United States.\n\nZainab Usman Zainab Usman is a senior fellow and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Her fields of expertise include institutions, economic policy, energy policy, and emerging economies in Africa. More >\n\nThere are ongoing discussions between the United States and Kenya for a free trade agreement as Kenya seeks to become a manufacturing hub for U.S. companies looking to diversify or relocate out of China. In the interim, the two countries signed the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) in July 2022, an agreement that identified areas around which to “develop an ambitious roadmap for enhanced cooperation with the goal of negotiating high-standard commitments in order to achieve economically meaningful outcomes.” The initial areas of collaboration include agriculture; digital trade; micro, small, and medium enterprises; supporting the participation of women, youth, and others in trade; collaboration on standards setting; and trade facilitation and customs procedures.\n\nThe U.S.-Kenya STIP was launched against the backdrop of China’s rapidly rising trade relationship with Kenya. Since 2000, China-Kenya trade has grown nearly thirty-fold, from $106 million to $3.5 billion in 2020. As these trade volumes have grown, so has Kenya’s trade deficit. The country’s total trade deficit as of 2020 stands at around $9.7 billion, and China ($3.3 billion) accounts for about one-third of this imbalance (see figure 2). Between 2015 and 2019, for instance, Kenya’s main exports to China were “titanium and zirconium ores and concentrates” (around 60 percent), vegetable textile fibers (4.9 percent), and petroleum oils (4.7 percent), among others. Its major imports are “electrical machinery and equipment (19 percent); nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and mechanical appliances and parts (18 percent); iron and steel (7 percent); and plastics (6 percent).”\n\nClosing this trade deficit is a salient topic that features regularly in diplomatic engagement between the two countries. Indeed, it was one of the announcements at the 2021 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. In January 2022, China and Kenya also signed six bilateral trade agreements that focused on removing tariffs and other trade and nontrade barriers. These agreements promised access to China’s large market for Kenyan exporters and included protocols to facilitate bilateral trade, especially exports of avocados and aquatic products. In August 2022, Kenya became the first African country to export fresh avocados to China.\n\nAline Abayo Aline Abayo is a James C. Gaither Junior Fellow in the Carnegie Africa Program.\n\nBeyond the United States and China, Kenya has strong and growing trade relations with other major countries. The UAE imports refined petroleum, tea, and meat from Kenya. In July 2022, the UAE and Kenya announced the start of trade negotiations to initiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement that aims to reduce trade barriers between the two countries. With this agreement, the UAE will invest in Kenya's vital economic sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, and boost non-oil trade and investment. Kenya also signed an economic partnership agreement with the UK in December 2020; the agreement provided quota-free and duty-free market access for all Kenyan products, including manufactured and processed ones. The agreement also guaranteed tariff-free access to Kenya’s market for UK suppliers of machinery, electronics, and technical equipment, among others.\n\nWithin Africa, Kenya is a critical actor driving some aspects of regional integration. With its 2021 GDP of $110.3 billion, it is the largest economy and major driver of rapid integration in the East African Community (EAC). It is no surprise, therefore, that Kenya ranked second on regional integration in Africa. The EAC ranks highest on the Africa Regional Integration Index, with the free movement of people as its most robust dimension. An Afrobarometer survey on East African integration shows that 52 percent of Kenyans approve of the free movement of goods, services, and labor. However, there is still a gap in public awareness and support for this integration.\n\nKenya’s notable progress in securing regional and international trade deals is positioning the country as an important trading economy. It will be crucial for Kenya to balance its overlapping and complicated relationships with the great powers, its trade ties with neighbors in the EAC, and its interest in advancing the African Continental Free Trade Area. As Kenya’s new president takes office, trade policy will be at the heart of the country’s plans to close its trade deficit, generate jobs, increase public revenues, and boost productivity.",
    "When Kenya's Treasury had Sh24m cash 111 years ago": "DP Rigathi Gachagua in Kisumu for the National Music Festivals. [DPPS]\n\nWhen the new regime of President William Ruto took office this month, Kenyans’ jaws dropped when they heard that the country’s coffers were empty.\n\nIn the words of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, by the time they were sworn in on September 13, the coffers at Central Bank had just Sh93 million.\n\nAlthough experts have tried to explain that this does not necessarily mean the heavily indebted country is broke, the current circumstances bring back memories of where Kenya was at a time like this in September 1911, exactly 111 years ago.\n\nThe state of the economy then was not rosy and although it was not incumbent on politicians then to expose the nakedness of their motherland, the official statement issued then was quite enlightening.\n\nAccording to a statement by the man in charge of Treasury, H A Smallwood, as at September 30, 1911, the East African Protectorate had £322,922 in various accounts. This by the current exchange rate of Sh136 to translates to about Sh43.9 million.\n\nThere was only £177,349 (about Sh24 million) in cash while the government had £1,036 in suspense account amounts which was at the time classified as a liability.\n\nOther liabilities of the protectorate then were listed as £45,362 while nickels and aluminum coinage accounted for £1,870\n\nAlthough the East African Protectorate morphed into the Kenya colony in 1920, and later became a republic in 1963, the country’s economy is not what it was a century ago.\n\nFrom a country whose capital city, Nairobi started off as a tin shack, the economy, going by the Kenya Economic survey 2022 is now valued at Sh12 trillion.\n\nDespite the expansion, the country in some areas is still grappling with adverse effects of drought as happened shortly before the coming of the colonialists.\n\nThe question of where the next meal will come from still dominates homesteads today, just as it did a century ago.\n\nWhile Kenyans in urban areas are crying out to the government to lower the price of unga, in the remote areas millions are thirsting for a few drops of water to quench their thirst and any kind of pasture for their emaciated animals being wiped out by drought at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Lunatic Express (Uganda Railway) has since given birth to Standard Gauge Railway but most of the lines where the old trains used to ferry passengers and goods have since ceased operations.\n\nYet, although so much has changed in 111 years, some regions have been caught in a time warp and Kenya now just like then is in desperate need of injection of capital.",
    "Wash-wash: Jitters as Kenya set to know its fate on money laundering controls": "Kenya's broken systems breed wash-wash cons. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]\n\nKenya faces an acid test in the next two months on the status of reforms to strengthen anti-money laundering controls with the global dirty money watchdog expected to release its scorecard for the country.\n\nThe looming report backed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will either place or exclude Kenya in an infamous grey list for its efforts or lack of in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nInclusion in a ‘grey’ watchlist by the Paris-based agency, could risk reputational damage to Kenya which is East Africa’s largest economy and business hub which may hurt foreign investment.\n\nThe agency’s regular reports and assessments usually group countries from the United States to China based on their responses to tackle financial crime.\n\nThe assessments usually highlight a series of failings or successes, including lack of or adequate control of those who handle large sums of money.\n\nThe report is supported by the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) of which Kenya is a member of and whose role is to combat money laundering by implementing the FATF Recommendations.\n\n“Kenya has been undergoing a mutual evaluation led by FATF regional partner ESAAMLG, which is in the final stages and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of Kenya’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorist (CFT) system,” said the FATF in response to queries by Financial Standard.\n\nBroadly, the result of being added to the grey list is that it will increase the cost of doing business for local companies with foreign trading partners.\n\nFor instance, a Kenyan multinational now doing business in European or American markets would have to provide detailed information on its activities to banks there and its procedures to mitigate possible money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe specific implications of this are that global correspondent banks and other intermediary financial institutions involved in transactions with Kenyan entities are likely to demand a higher level of due diligence.\n\nAnalysts said this year’s assessment is crucial at a time Kenya is clamouring to ease decade-old rules for transacting in large cash risking the wrath of the global dirty money watchdog.\n\nPresident William Ruto has said that he wants the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to relax the rules for reporting transactions beyond Sh1 million.\n\nThe rules fall under the Proceeds Of Crime And Anti-Money Laundering Act (the POCAMLA) which is the key enactment which supports the AML legal framework in Kenya.\n\nThe CBK has been hesitant to implement a similar order given by retired President Uhuru Kenyatta citing money laundering concerns and breach of international obligations.\n\nCBK governor Patrick Njoroge recently reiterated that any fresh review would not lose sight of Kenya’s international obligations adding that Kenya is committed to meeting international standards on anti-money laundering.\n\nDr Njoroge maintained that banks should refer to a history of regular cash transactions in flagging suspicious deals so that they do not subject customers to questions on the source and use of the cash every time they visit banking halls. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. [File, Standard]\n\nThis came as the FATF which is said to be watching Kenya on its latest plans refused to be drawn into the possible implications of easing rules on large cash transactions.\n\n“The FATF cannot comment on planned legislation or legislative changes outside of the framework of a mutual evaluation or follow-up process,” said the global agency in response to questions by The Standard.\n\nA previous report welcomed Kenya’s efforts but warned that lawyers and certified public secretaries were not captured as\n\nreporting persons under the POCAMLA obligations.\n\nPresident Ruto recently asked the CBK to implement the order without further delay citing ongoing hindrances to small businesses.\n\n“In our engagements, traders also complained about the onerous burden involved in cash transactions exceeding Sh1million,” he said recently, adding that many traders have reverted to storing money under their mattresses at great risk, which is clearly not the intention of the anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nChapter 231 of the Constitution says the CBK “shall not be under the direction or control of any person or authority in the exercise of its powers or the performance of its functions.”\n\n“While we remain fully committed to mitigating this risk, we believe that there is scope to make compliance less burdensome on genuine business transactions,” he said.\n\n“I have been assured by the Central Bank that work on how to ease this burden without compromising the security of the financial system is underway.”\n\nRetired President Kenyatta last October issued a directive to raise the limit of suspicious cash transactions commercial lenders are required to report under anti-money laundering laws to facilitate cash deals among traders.\n\nUhuru had ordered the immediate raise of the reporting limit for both deposits and withdrawals above the current Sh1 million, without saying what the new figure will be.\n\nLenders earlier said they were waiting for the CBK’s nod to raise the threshold for reporting transactions beyond the Sh1 million.\n\nThe law mandates financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the FRC. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). [File, Standard]\n\nInsiders say banks would benefit from the increase in the threshold for reporting but the regulator is hesitant as it would breach some international obligations.\n\nThe CBK issued a circular in 2016 reminding banks not to relent on prudential disclosures. Business people have complained that the cash limit has hindered their ability to carry out smooth transactions.\n\nThe law requires financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the Financial Reporting Centre (FRC) – the agency operationalised in April 2012 and tasked with identifying and combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nBusinesses and individuals transacting more than Sh1 million are required to declare to their bankers why the money cannot be deposited or withdrawn through electronic means under the Kenya Electronic Payments and Settlement System and Real-Time Gross Payment System (KEPSS/RTGS).\n\nThe disclosures include the source of the cash, how it will be spent, who are direct and indirect beneficiaries as well as the full identity of the intended beneficiaries.\n\nThe global dirty money watchdog evaluates countries on 40 recommendations that should be in place to combat illicit financial flows.\n\nKenya recently launched its international financial centre in the capital after years of preparation to attract large foreign firms and boost capital flows.\n\nThe Kenyan hub is expected to model Nairobi as a financial district in line with existing financial centres in European, Middle East and the Far East capitals such as London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\n\nDespite Kenya’s relatively developed capital markets, 75 per cent of all business financing in the economy was from the banking sector, while the balance came from the capital markets, the Treasury said earlier, adding that the situation was not ideal.",
    "HOMETOWN HERO: Local teacher continues efforts to improve education in western Kenya": "",
    "DARIUS OKOLLA - The Myth That Is Plastic Waste Recycling in Kenya": "Brexit Britain’s dismal plan to export its “immigration problem” to Rwanda through the forced deportation of asylum seekers is in some ways redolent of how, more than a century earlier, Kenya Colony dealt with its “native question”. That centred upon how to control the “natives” in a white European colony.\n\nSome of the same buzzwords can be heard again this time around. Morality, betterment, economics, labour, containment, segregation and deterrence. Africans (and migrants of other ethnicities) must be contained in the equivalent of “native” reserves so that states can better control them. Moving them into reserves (aka migrant hostels, barracks, camps or detention centres) is for their own good. They will learn to give up whatever they were doing and labour for the white man (or in Rwanda’s case, industrious black and brown people). They will learn by example to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as if they had never worked hard before. They will be mighty grateful for the opportunities offered – or they damn well ought to be. Saviours, of whatever colour, will save the lazy “natives” from themselves – or in the case of cross-Channel migrants, from people smugglers. Morally, it is the right thing to do. Civilisation will rub off on them. But whether the deported migrants will be treated as citizens or subjects in their new “home” remains unclear.\n\nWriting in The Times in April, the then Home Secretary Priti Patel, chief architect of the UK-Rwanda deportation scheme, said, “We can provide legal, safe, orderly and controlled ways for people to better their lives, flee oppression, persecution or conflict and enjoy new opportunities” (emphasis mine). This ignores the fact that forced deportation is itself oppressive, and a form of trafficking. The “best interests” argument was regularly used by colonial administrators, in Kenya and in other British colonies, to justify forced removals and other oppressive measures against Africans, such as the Maasai removals and the Talai resettlement (discussed below).\n\nContinuities in the colonial treatment of mobile Africans, and the modern-day treatment of refugees and asylum seekers (both African and other non-whites), are plain to see. Scholars Hanna Brankamp and Patricia Daley write of labourers, migrants and refugees, then and now: “Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”. Discussing both colonial migrant labourers and post-colonial refugees and migrants, and historical trajectories of migration control, their term “racialized subjects in need of spatial fixation” is a useful one. They draw parallels between measures of regulation, control and containment that are still in vogue today.\n\nThe role of Brexit\n\nThe goal of ending unfettered immigration to Britain lay at the heart of the Brexit vote in 2016, when a slim majority of British people voted to leave the European Union (EU). Those voters, known as Brexiteers, seem to forget that 47.5 million people did not vote to leave. Though this figure includes 13 million people who did not vote at all, those who voted to stay in the EU are called Remainers. The country formally left the EU in January 2020. But Brexiteers are furious that Brexit has not delivered what they expected, or were promised. In particular, they rage at what they see as out-of-control immigration, and the spectre of “hordes” of young men “of fighting age” from Africa and the Middle East arriving on our beaches. The majority are wrongly assumed to be Muslims, who are believed, in the wake of several terrorist attacks by young Muslim men living in Britain, to pose a terror threat. Immigration, especially by cross-Channel dinghy from France, aided by people smugglers, has soared under successive Tory governments; 28,500 migrants crossed the Channel this way in the past year, treble the figure for the previous 12 months. More than 20,000 people have crossed since the start of 2022. Crossings have continued since the Home Office announced its deportation plan, which indicates that it is not a deterrent. Some 1295 people crossed in one day (22 August), a record for 2022 so far. The fact that the migrants are escorted ashore by Border Force officials, housed in hotels, fed and watered, and “paid” £39 a week, all at taxpayers’ expense, only infuriates Brexiteers more.\n\n“Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”.\n\nGloating over this fiasco is the divisive figure of Nigel Farage, an éminence grise obsessed with immigration and the EU, who has never managed to get elected to the British parliament, despite seven attempts. He was, nonetheless, the driving force behind Brexit, when leader of the fringe UKIP (UK Independence Party) and Brexit Party. Farage continues to whip up anti-migrant sentiment on right-wing broadcast channels such as GB News, but also in the pages of serious national newspapers. If one person is single-handedly responsible for the anti-migrant rhetoric, it is Farage. Shamefully, the two final candidates who fought to succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, parroted Farage in their frantic attempt to appeal to Tory Party members who chose the new PM. As predicted, Truss won. (The British electorate as a whole was not allowed to vote.) At an earlier stage of the contest, all the candidates said they supported the Rwanda deportation plan – despite the fact that several of them are, like Patel and Sunak, the children of immigrants to the UK. (Sunak’s parents were born in Kenya and Tanganyika, Patel’s are from Uganda.)\n\nFear of a mass invasion by Africans features in much of this rhetoric. Online comments contain hysterical claims that “the whole continent” is headed for Europe. “Most of Africa would prefer to live in Britain”, posted a reader at the Daily Telegraph on 22 June, one example that stands for many. In fact, the top countries of migrants’ origin include non-African countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago. In 2012, the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a strategy aimed at tackling “illegal” immigration by making life so unbearable for certain migrants they would voluntarily choose to leave. May herself used the words “a really hostile environment”. (Ironically, she now criticises the Rwanda deportation policy.) However, the opposition Labour Party first coined the expression in 2007. The then Labour immigration minister Liam Byrne referred to the desirability of creating a “hostile environment” in a consultation document that year, although the policy was not implemented. He has angrily denied May’s claims that Labour invented it.\n\nMigration within colonial Kenya\n\nSwitching my focus to Kenya and the deeper historical context of forced migration, many of the internal relocations that took place in colonial Kenya (and the British protectorate that preceded it, before 1920) involved coercing Africans into leaving home to labour for white settlers. They moved seasonally in large numbers. “Squatters had not looked for work; [Lord Delamere] had sent for them, fetching their families and flocks by train”, writes historian John Lonsdale. However, not all displacement was coerced; this denies African and Asian agency, and overlooks all the other reasons why men, and women (often ignored in migration studies), moved as individuals in search of work.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago.\n\nNorman Leys (a medical doctor and rights activist) reported how many colonial district officers initially refused to comply with demands from settlers and other private employers to use their influence and procure labourers. “Then an agitation began in Nairobi and in London. As a result of that agitation instructions were sent to district officers that, while no compulsion was to be used, ‘moral suasion’ was to be resorted to, chiefs were to be ‘encouraged’ to persuade their people to leave home to work for Europeans.” Then as now, Anglican bishops issued a statement condemning the plan. “We believe that ideally all labour should be voluntary. We recognise that, at present, this is impossible … [But] we are of the opinion that compulsory labour, so long as it is clearly necessary, should be definitely legalised.”\n\nUnder colonial vagrancy laws, it even became impossible for Africans who were not in employment to move around the country. The raising of the hut and poll tax also “encouraged” (Leys’ word, he was being ironic) Africans to seek wage labour outside their home areas. Settler estates depended on African labour to function, but recruitment proved difficult. Some settlers resorted to “exceptional violence” in order to get labour, in the words of scholars Bruce Berman and John Lonsdale. “The ferocity and unpredictability of the settler assault on the African population threatened to undermine the whole apparatus of colonial control”. The state had to step in to control labour supply, and did so after World War I when mass forced conscription into the Carrier Corps was seen to have been a “success”. (Some success; 95,000 African porters died.) It was a matter of carrots but more often sticks, as this appalling statement exemplifies:\n\nI always treat my natives the same as I treat my children, I try to be kind to them, and to advise and direct them, but when kindness has no effect you have to do the same as they do in the public schools at home and throughout the empire – cane them. (Lt. Col. J.G. Kirkwood, Legislative Council member, Legco debate, 28 November 1941).\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nAlthough the state, including the railway, was the largest single employer in the country at this point, thousands of men moved seasonally between the settler estates and African reserves, where their families tended to remain on the land. But over time, whole families moved to live on settler estates as squatters, and were initially allowed to bring their cattle with them. They grew subsistence crops, while women and children also provided labour to settlers during peak harvest and planting times. By 1931, the number of squatters in the highlands had risen to 113,176, the majority Kikuyu. They occupied one million acres of settler land, some of it land that the Maasai had formerly occupied. Although this arrangement brought some benefits for squatters (for one, it allowed them to expand beyond crowded Kikuyuland, creating a toe-hold that lasts to this day), harsh new laws forced African compliance with government. One of the most hated was the Registration of Natives Ordinance of 1915, which forced all males over the age of 15 to carry a form of identity called the kipande.\n\nOver time, settlers became alarmed about the large number of squatter stock on their land, and fearing the diseases that this stock allegedly carried, began forcing squatters and their stock off farms. Resentment at this was among the issues that sowed the seeds of Mau Mau (aka the Land and Freedom Army). “The squatters saw their economic deprivation as linked to their political subordination and it was these two problems that they hoped to eradicate when they took the oath and swore to support the Mau Mau movement,” wrote Tabitha Kanogo in her ground-breaking book Squatters and the Roots of Mau Mau.\n\nMaasai and other forced moves\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya. The most infamous forced migrations were the Maasai moves following two treaties or “agreements” made between Maasai leaders and British protectorate officials in 1904 and 1911. The moves were ordered to make way for white settlement, first in the central Rift Valley, later in the highlands of Laikipia. Maasai from certain socio-territorial sections (not the Maasai as a whole) were initially moved into two reserves, one in the north, the other in the south on the border with German territory (later Tanganyika and Tanzania). In 1904, the British promised the Maasai they could keep Laikipia for ever. But only seven years later, under pressure from settlers, they broke their pledge and moved the Maasai again, this time at gunpoint, into an enlarged southern reserve in what is now Narok County.\n\nIt is estimated that the Maasai lost up to at least 50 per cent of the territory they had once used, but the figure could be nearer 70 per cent. The losses did not just involve land, but included the loss of good grazing, access to water sources and sacred sites, and the fatal exposure of both humans and livestock to diseases like East Coast fever and malaria, which were unknown in Laikipia in those days. The ripple effects of these events continue to the present day, in agitation by Maasai for the return of lost land or compensation. Neither is likely to materialise, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nFears about Maasai warriors and the assumed threat they posed to Europeans in the early years of colonial rule were remarkably similar to the current rhetoric in Britain, centred on the irrational fear of “hordes of young men of fighting age” arriving on our shores. Not only is their potential (but unproven) violence feared, but also their perceived sexuality – “Lock up your daughters!” is the cry of the anti-migrant Tory right. This is obviously part of a larger racist trope, referred to as the “black peril” in the scholarship on settler colonies, but also prevalent in the USA, especially in the formerly segregated Deep South.\n\nBritish administrators saw the warriors as a dangerous standing army, which could let rip at any moment. In a discussion of the merits of confining the Maasai to reserves, Protectorate Commissioner Sir Charles Eliot (the equivalent of a governor) wrote to the Foreign Office in 1903: “[Maasai] simplicity, loyalty, and soldierlike qualities inspire a sympathy which makes people forget that a race which regards fighting and raiding as the only occupations for a young man of honour can never be anything but a dangerous race.” He also condemned the warriors’ alleged “immorality”. In fact, as other officials who knew the Maasai better than Eliot were constantly telling him, they had never attacked Europeans and posed no danger. “And they are not likely to,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Frederick Jackson, “so long as they are treated fairly”. On the contrary, several administrators sympathetic to the Maasai feared that racist South African settlers in the Rift Valley might attack the Maasai if they were not physically separated. For these and other reasons, they were forced into reserves.\n\nToday, the Maasai are not alone in their grievance with historical injustices. The Talai clan of Kericho County, part of the Kipsigis community, has for years sought reparations for forced resettlement. The British evicted them in 1934-36 from the Kipsigis Reserve to an allegedly mosquito-infested valley at Gwassi near Lake Victoria, where they stayed, under supervision, until the mid-1950s. They claim to have been moved to make way for tea plantations, some of which are still owned by UK-based multinationals. A group of Talai wrote to Prince William (elder son of King Charles III) in May this year seeking an apology and his support for reparations. The letter says: “We inherited the pain, you inherited the profit.” They hoped for sympathy from Will “because Kenya is special to him”. Earlier appeals to the British government appear to have received no reply.\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya.\n\nHistorians who have researched Talai history, most particularly the role of ritual leaders or orkoiik, say there is in fact no evidence that the Talai were evicted from land that became tea estates. But they were certainly evicted under colonial laws, said one leading scholar, and “unquestionably have a case”. UN human rights rapporteurs investigated the case and found for the Talai in 2021, which the community hailed as a great victory. However, the UN may have “ordered” the British government to apologise and pay compensation, but that does not mean anything will happen. The Tory government has been a tad preoccupied since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted, and a bitter struggle ensued to replace him. And since Prince William has no political power or influence, all he can say is pole sana.\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is becoming more bogged down by the day. It recently emerged that British ministers who backed the plan were warned months ago, by the government’s own advisor, that Rwanda tortures and kills political opponents. The government wants to keep these comments in a Foreign Office report secret, partly in order not to offend Rwanda. Media houses, including the BBC, are challenging this. The doomed flights are postponed until after a judicial review of the policy at the High Court, London, which began on 5 September and is expected to last five days. President Paul Kagame has also thrown a spanner in the works by announcing, after pocketing the £120 million down-payment, that Rwanda will only take 200 migrants – a drop in the ocean. Patel and the Home Office she previously headed (she resigned on Monday 5 September, hours after Truss’s victory) made a major mistake by not specifying, in the MoU with Rwanda, how many migrants Britain planned to deport. Some of us suspect that our government never intended to carry out the policy in the first place. It was simply red meat thrown to Brexit voters.\n\n–\n\nThis article is part of a series on migration and displacement in and from Africa, co-produced by the Elephant and the Heinrich Boll Foundation’s African Migration Hub, which is housed at its new Horn of Africa Office in Nairobi.",
    "Kenya’s Central Bank forecasts economy reboot after peaceful political transition": "By JAMES ANYANZWA More by this Author\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya is projecting a better performance for the country’s economy, leaving behind months of electioneering and uncertainty that saw it fail in a Eurobond launch earlier in the year.\n\nKenya swore in its new president on September 13, bringing to an end uncertainty around its political future.\n\nNow the banking regulator says the peaceful change in leadership has coincided with stabilising global prices for basic commodities, which could reboot the economy.\n\nCentral Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge told Kenyan MPs this week that the economy is expected to remain “strong” this year despite weaker global growth and economic shocks triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“Economic growth is expected to remain strong in 2022. Prices of palm oil, DAP fertiliser and wheat have moderated,” said Dr Njoroge at an induction session for new MPs.\n\n“The price of oil has moderated but remains volatile,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKenya’s economy has been going through lean times. It has seen its forex reserves shrink as food and fuel prices rise, its shilling depreciates and credit to the private sector falls.\n\nThe economy is also saddled with debts, which now stand at $70 billion.\n\nIn June, the government cancelled a $1 billion Eurobond as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. President William Ruto has scrapped the fuel and maize meal flour subsidy programmes to ease the government’s growing expenditure pressures.\n\nResearchers at Cytonn Investments noted that the government’s increased accumulation of debt has not translated into economic growth, as more than 40 percent of the collected revenues have gone to repay debt.\n\nKenya’s public debt has increased more than five-fold to Ksh8.6 trillion ($71.66 billion) in May 2022 from Ksh1.6 trillion ($13.33 billion) in May 2012.\n\nCytonn noted that the public debt increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.2 percent in the last 10 years, compared to an average Gross Domestic Product growth of 3.9 percent over the period.\n\n“The increase in debt is not translating into GDP growth,” Cytonn Investments said in a September 11 market report.\n\nDebt accumulation\n\nMounting debt has put pressure on central bank forex reserves, further eroding the value of the shilling which is swinging at around Ksh120 against the US dollar.\n\n“Kenya’s general business environment continues to be weighed down by the elevated inflationary pressures emanating from supply chain constraints and a depreciating local currency,” Cytonn Investments said.\n\n“The recovery of the private sector business environment in Kenya is largely pegged on how quickly the global economy stabilises and how soon the inflationary pressures ease,” it added.\n\nKenya’s GDP increased by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a 2.7 percent growth in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, overall inflation accelerated for six consecutive months to 8.5 percent in August from 8.3 percent in July, largely driven by high fuel and food prices.\n\nDisbursement of loans to key economic sectors declined to 2.5 percent between April and June compared to 4.1 percent in the previous quarter.\n\nBusiness environment\n\nThe elevated credit risk has led to 8.6 percent increase in gross non-performing loans to Ksh514.4 billion ($4.28 billion) in June 2022 from Ksh473.7 billion ($3.94 billion) in March 2022.\n\n“This is largely attributable to the deteriorated business environment as a result of the increased inflationary pressures emanating from imported inflation bill,” CBK said.\n\n“Going forward, we expect the business environment to remain subdued given the persistent supply chain bottlenecks that have seen the cost of inputs continue to rise.”",
    "Kenya needs to eliminate tariff, non-tariff barriers to U.S. pork": "In comments submitted recently to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the National Pork Producers Council urged U.S. trade negotiators to use the recently launched Strategic and Investment Partnership with Kenya to eliminate that country’s unjustified restrictions on U.S. pork imports.\n\nWith a population of more than 50 million, an expanding middle class — and relatively strong tourism-driven demand from the hotel, restaurant, and institutional food service sector — the African nation has the potential to be a significant export market for U.S. pork products, NPPC noted in its comments.\n\nBut Kenya has tariff — a 25% duty — and non-tariff barriers, including complex, opaque and costly requirements that limit U.S. pork imports. USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service reports that all imports of certain agricultural products, including meat, must be physically inspected and tested at the port of entry to ensure conformity with relevant Kenyan standards.\n\nIn the comments, NPPC pointed out there is no reason why Kenya should impose such onerous inspection and testing requirement on U.S. pork products that are accompanied by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service Certificate of Wholesomeness and meet other relevant import requirements.\n\nNPPC requested that Kenya eliminate its onerous testing and inspection requirements for U.S. pork, eliminate non-science-based sanitary and phytosanitary barriers, and recognize the equivalence of U.S. pork production practices and the U.S. food safety inspection and approval system for pork slaughter, processing and storage plants.\n\nSource: National Pork Producers Council, which is solely responsible for the information provided, and wholly owns the information.

    "Away Game: Kenya’s Borana reserve is your wildest dream": "I f you digest travel writing on the regular, you’ve likely heard the phrase (eye rolls at the ready) ‘trip of a lifetime’ more than enough. But you’re going to have to forgive me, please, because I can’t think of a better way to describe my formative experience of Africa and, more significantly, Kenya.\n\nThe adventure began with a flight on a tiny plane from Nairobi airport to the Borana Conservancy’s barely-there landing strip. The pilot warned us rather too casually that it ‘may have a few animals loitering on it’ because the area was a wildlife preserve and Kenya’s newest rhino sanctuary. Made up of 32,000 acres on the rolling Laikipia Plateau near Mount Kenya, the Conservancy is where Lengishu lodge is nestled, a serene, 12-person residence of four vast, homely cottages and several outbuildings built and thatched by local craftsmen to reflect the warm, eclectic Kenyan spirit and style.\n\nUpon touchdown, lodge owners and part-time residents Joe and Minnie MacHale greeted us with iced tea before we were whisked off to Lengishu in custom-built safari Land Rovers. Over the next three days we saw mesmerising sunrises in hues of orange, pink, red and purple, enjoyed sundowners while wrapped in tartan shuka blankets on the hilltop and indulged in snooze-inducing massages. While not Kenyan, the food — think red snapper tacos and poached pears with raspberry ice cream — that we tucked into at a candlelit setting by the pool, within the main house and also among the wildlife in the unspoilt bush, was always a delight.\n\nOut in the wilds | Joanna Taylor / Out in the wilds | Joanna Taylor\n\nThose exploits alone would have made for a dazzling time but they were simply the icing on the cake. The most memorable moments came from the 6am game drives and rhino tracking on foot, of course. There, perched in the only vehicle for miles, we witnessed pairs of lions prowling metres from the car, giraffes peacefully munching breakfast, rhinos stomping from a distance and many, many elephants on the move.\n\nIt didn’t end there. After a short, slightly bumpier flight back to Nairobi, we entered Eden, the nine-bedroom ex-residence of German-born, Kenyan-raised fashion designer Anna Trzebinski bursting with art in the leafy Langata area. Here, when not soaking in the abstract artworks, chasing the resident chickens or enjoying open fires tended to by Trzebinski’s Samburu friends, we’d mingle, then dance the night away, with the designer’s other friends, some of Nairobi’s most talented artists including Nedia Were, Peter Elungat and Syowia Kyambi.

    "Kenya adopts new pro-business stance towards Morocco – media – The North Africa Post": "Kenya has adopted a new pro-business stance towards Morocco, writes the Kenyan economic newspaper Business Today, in an analysis published on Saturday, following Kenyan President William Ruto’s decision to rescind recognition of the so-called ‘SADR’.\n\nThe Kenyan newspaper recalls that the newly sworn President vowed to accelerate economic relations with Morocco and that a week ago, President Ruto promised to lower the price of fertilizer from Ksh 6,100 to Ksh 3,600 (Ksh 100 = USD 1).\n\nThe newspaper reports in this connection that 1.4 million bags of fertilizer will be imported mainly from Morocco, noting that the OCP Group is the world’s leading manufacturer of phosphate fertilizers, and covers a third of the world market.\n\nLast Monday, William Ruto, had promised to announce new prices for cornmeal and fertilizers, noting that his “realpolitik” implies a rapprochement with Morocco in the decisive field of fertilizers, analyzes the author of the article, who recalls that an agreement in the same field between Morocco and Nigeria, signed in 2017, had reduced the price of a bag of fertilizer from 5,000 to 1,700 shillings.\n\nThanks to its South-South policy, the Kingdom of Morocco considers Kenya as an outstanding nation with which it can establish economic cooperation, especially in the fields of agriculture, health and tourism, the newspaper stresses, indicating that, according to experts, in the coming years, Kenyan tea will be very present in Morocco.\n\nAnother Kenyan newspaper “The Easta African” also commented on the revocation by Kenyan President William Ruto of the recognition of SADR, recalling that William Ruto, then Deputy President, had pledged in 2021 to support Morocco to achieve a just solution to the Sahara issue.\n\nFor the paper, this move is likely to bolster cooperation between the two countries and Kenya has everything to gain from the Moroccan tea and coffee markets. In addition, Nairobi can draw inspiration from the Moroccan tourism sector, the publication said.\n\nIn an interview with the paper, Morocco’s ambassador to Nairobi, Abderrazzak Lassel, said that the Kingdom which welcomes the economic model of President Ruto, can provide significant assistance in the field of food security, especially that it is the largest producer of fertilizer in the world.\n\nIn this regard, the newspaper pointed out that the new president had pledged to ensure cheaper fertilizers, the aim being to improve production and food security in the long term and reduce food prices in the short term.\n\nThe Moroccan diplomat said that the two countries can have fruitful cooperation in several other areas, including in the social housing sector in which Morocco is willing to share its successful experience.

    "Ruto hints Kenya Defense Forces [KDF] could prolong their stay in Somalia": "Ruto hints Kenya Defense Forces [KDF] could prolong their stay in Somalia\n\nWASHINGTON - Kenya's President William Ruto has hinted that the Kenya Defense Forces [KDF] could prolong its stay in Somalia, a move which he insists will help stabilize the Horn of Africa nation, which has been struggling with instability for the last three decades.\n\nWhile fielding questions from France 24 TV, Ruto, who is barely two weeks old in office, said instability in Somalia will continue to affect Kenya negatively, noting that the troops will continue staying in the country to bring order which is much needed within the region.\n\nRuto said instability in Somalia was giving terrorists a breeding ground, adding that the situation ought to be contained for the region to prosper. He outlined his efforts to work closely with the current leadership and stakeholders to help the country eliminate terrorists.\n\n“Those troops will be back home as soon as we've done with the assignment that we have in Somalia,\" said Ruto, who was previously Kenya's Deputy President for ten years, and who is not a stranger to the current situation in the country which neighbors Kenya.\n\nIn the last month, Ruto has met Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with whom they have discussed mechanisms of making the war succeed. Ruto lauded efforts being made by Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to degrade the militants, having served previously as president from 2012-17.\n\n“I think with the election of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who I have met twice now, he has a much clearer view of where we need to go, I think he is more committed to fighting Al-Shabaab. His resolve is clear to many of us who are in that space,\" the Kenyan president added.\n\nThere are close to 3,500 KDF troops serving in the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia [ATMIS] and have been in the country for the last 10 years. KDF first entered Somalia in 2011 through the Linda Nchi operation under former President Mwai Kibaki before being absorbed into the peacekeeping mission in 2013.\n\nWhile serving in the country, the troops have been instrumental in liberating key towns among them Kismayo, which was once under the control of the militants. However, the troops have suffered a number of casualties including in El-Adde in 2016 where Al-Shabaab killed over 200 KDF soldiers.\n\nKenya has also been battling Al-Shabaab, especially in Garissa, Mandera, and Wajir counties with the militants often targeting non-locals. But with increased surveillance, the attacks have since been minimized, leading to relative stability in the country.\n\nAl-Shabaab threatens last month to carry out more attacks in Kenya and against KDF in Somalia if new president William Ruto keeps troops in the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, the peacekeeping troops have been working closely with Somali National Army, killing hundreds of Al-Shabaab terrorists in the Hiiraan, Galgaduud, and Bay regions.\n\nGAROWE ONLINE",
    "Kenya App Allows Users to Help Track Rare Mammals": "Kenya's wildlife authorities have launched a free mobile phone app that allows users to track sightings of rare mammals to help authorities protect them.\n\nThe Mammal Atlas Kenya, or Makenya, allows any user who spots a wild mammal to identify it and log the location.\n\nKenya is home to nearly 400 species of mammals, 22 of them natives to regions of Kenya, according to national figures. Authorities say it is getting more difficult to protect them, as climate change and human activities take a toll on their natural habitats.\n\nSo the National Museums of Kenya, the Mammal Committee of Nature Kenya and partners designed the mobile app, which also provides a way to upload photographs and details, such as the number of mammals sighted and their exact locations.\n\n\"You can also add the behavior,\" said Dr. Simon Musila, a researcher at the National Museums of Kenya. \"When you see this animal, what are they doing? Are they resting? Are they running away? Are they feeding? What are they doing at the moment you see them?”\n\nMusila said it’s important to engage the public using technology to help the country’s limited number of mammal specialists. Wildlife authorities said staff would keep records of the animals’ changing environment and survival conditions.\n\nThere's a need \"to bring in many people who can contribute a lot of data,\" he said. \"These are people like safari guides. These are people like students, tourists, people who go out and come across animals and will be willing to submit data.\"\n\nSamson Onyuok uses the Makenya app. Users like him have reported more than 2,500 mammal sightings since the app launched in August.\n\n\"First, I think I take pride in contributing to conservation initiatives in the country,\" he said. \"I think as a Kenyan, that is my little way of contributing to the conservation initiatives. So, yes, there is a fulfillment that comes with that.\"\n\nExperts say Africa contributes minimally to climate change but is bearing the brunt of its consequences. Dr. Philip Muruthi, vice president of the African Wildlife Foundation, told VOA that reproduction of the rare mammals and the survival rate of young ones are dropping.\n\n\"It is very hard to benefit or manage what you don't know,\" he said. \"That is why this is so important. It is going to tell us which species we have, where they are, and maybe which ones are highly endangered, what we need to do about them. And especially not just the big things but also the small things, like the bats.\"\n\nWildlife officials say Kenya is a habitat to at least a third of mammal species in Africa and are hopeful app users will boost efforts to protect them."
