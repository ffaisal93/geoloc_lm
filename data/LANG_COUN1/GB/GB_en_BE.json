    "Four arrested over alleged plot to kidnap Belgian justice minister": "Police in the Netherlands have arrested four suspects over what Belgium’s justice minister described as a plan to kidnap him.\n\nVincent Van Quickenborne, who is also the mayor of the city of Kortrijk in western Flanders, appeared to blame a “drug mafia” in a video message run by state broadcaster RTBF.\n\nAddressing an audience at a local ball, he said that in a phone call on Thursday, a federal prosecutor had warned him of a kidnap plan targeting him.\n\nOn Saturday Van Quickenborne said: “I will be placed under strict security for the time being and will not be able to participate in some planned activities in the coming days. It’s not pleasant, but understandable.\n\n“Let me be clear: the people behind this are achieving the opposite of what they aim for. It strengthens me in the belief that we need to keep fighting. The criminals feel trapped. That feeling is right. Because we will continue to fight organised crime, with more manpower and resources than before.\n\n“In our democratic rule of law we will never fold to violence. Never.”\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Saturday that police had beefed up security for Van Quickenborne, citing a serious “threat”. They said three people had been detained in the Netherlands and that Belgian authorities were seeking their extradition.\n\nA spokesman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office in the Hague said the trio, all Dutch, were aged 20, 29 and 48. On Sunday, a judicial source said a fourth suspect had been arrested in the Netherlands.\n\nBelgian prime minister Alexander De Croo tweeted on Saturday that the threat to Quickenborne was “totally unacceptable. But it must be clear: we will not be intimidated by anyone. The work continues.”\n\nFollowing a report in the Flemish daily Het Laatste Nieuws, the source confirmed to AFP that an automatic weapon had been found in a vehicle spotted near the minister’s home in Kortrijk. Belgian news outlet VRT reported that the vehicle contained Kalashnikovs, other firearms and two bottles of petrol.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said it had been informed last week of a “possible threat”, which led to an investigation. It would not provide further details.",
    "Report: England MU18s 2-1 Belgium": "A well-worked move saw Belgium create their best chance of breaking the deadlock ten minutes before the interval when Manchester City stopper True Grant, son of former Derby, Burnley, and Manchester United goalkeeper Lee, had to make a fine save to keep the scores level.\n\nBut the Young Lions responded well after the break and came out of the blocks refreshed in the second half – having two efforts in two minutes.\n\nThe first chance in particular showed England’s ability to move the ball incisively and with purpose. Ndala, who switched to the left flank to get at the Belgium defence, picked out Arsenal’s Amario Cozier-Duberry on the right but he could only shoot straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nA fast-paced beginning to the second half continued when Belgium had a huge chance to take the lead, but Fofana was unable to stretch enough to make clean contact from six yards after the ball was flashed in low from the left by Idumbo Muzambo.\n\nA frantic five minutes then ensued, with Grant having to make a crucial double save – first low to his right and then high to his left as England were put on the backfoot.\n\nAnd after 68 minutes, an unfortunate breakdown in communication between Grant and captain Josh Feeney (pictured above) led to the defender heading backwards over his oncoming goalkeeper and into an empty net to give Belgium the lead.\n\nBut England didn’t let their heads drop and were back level three minutes later as Cozier-Duberry linked up cleverly with Jamie Donley to break into the box and smash the ball home from a tight angle.\n\nGrant, quickly becoming the standout performer on the day, again had to be on his toes to produce another superb stop, this time from point blank range, and again from a low ball across the face of goal from the Belgian left which was stabbed goalward.\n\nIt was to prove crucual, as ten minutes from time substitute Dominic Ballard, scorer of both goals on Friday, got the winner for England as he poked home past Belgium ‘keeper Tom Poitoux.\n\nThe Little Red Devils’ second-half showing was chalk and cheese from their first, but they had two final opportunities to snatch a draw. Firstly, a good run by Enock Agyei saw the ball cut back to Roméo Monticelli on the edge of box but the substitute couldn’t find the net.\n\n\n\nA series of hopeful long balls forward were largely dealt with by the Young Lions, as Belgium looked for one last chance to salvage something.\n\nThat chance came with the final action of the match on 94 minutes, as a Belgian cross from the right was headed on target and destined for the bottom corner, only for Grant to ‘save’ his best until last, as he got down to his left once more and ensured the hard-fought win was England’s.\n\nEngland: 1 True Grant (Manchester City), 2 Jacob Wright (Manchester City), 3 Lino Sousa (Arsenal), 4 Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), 5 Tyler Fredricson (Manchester United), 6 Josh Feeney (Aston Villa) (c), 7 Joel Ndala (Manchester City), 8 Jobe Bellingham (Birmingham City), 9 Jamie Donley (Tottenham Hotspur), 10 Nico O’Reilly (Manchester City), 11 Amario Cozier-Duberry (Arsenal).\n\nSubstitutions: 14 Bobby Clark (Liverpool) on for O’Reilly (45’), 21 Kane Taylor (Manchester City) on for Sousa (45’), William Alves (Leicester City) on for Ndala (60’), 23 Sai Sachdev (Sheffield United) on for Wright (60’), 20 Dominic Ballard (Southampton) on for Donley (74’), 16 Leo Castledine (Chelsea) on for Bellingham (77’), 12 Alfie Dorrington (Tottenham Hotspur) on for Fredricson (77’), 15 Harry Whitwell (West Bromwich Albion) on for Mainoo (89’), 18 Samuel Rak-Sakyi (Chelsea) on for Cozier-Duberry (89’), 19 Max Alleyne (Manchester City) on for Feeney (89’).\n\nSubstitutes not used: 13.

    "Nations League: Denmark stun France while Van Dijk sinks Belgium": "Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group A game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday.\n\nDidier Deschamps’ side, who will face Denmark in the World Cup in November, finished third in the Nations League standings with five points from six games after Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen scored first-half goals for the hosts. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 defeat at home to Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points.\n\nCroatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes. World champions France, who had several first-choice players out injured including Paul Pogba, Karim Benzema and Hugo Lloris, were a far cry from their best and Deschamps will be crossing fingers that all have recovered for the tournament in Qatar.\n\n“We had a lot of chances, but we were not aggressive enough and made several technical mistakes,” Deschamps said. “We had a young team and they don’t have the experience of a high level. Tonight was a reality check. I’m not worried for the World Cup because we’ll get most of our injured players back in time. We don’t however think we’re stronger than the others and we know it’s going to be a big fight.”\n\nCroatia, who needed victory to assure top spot, went ahead through Luka Modric but were pegged back three minutes later. The points were sealed when Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Dejan Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer’s cross.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps said he was not worried about their form going into the World Cup Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/Reuters\n\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year’s finals tournament. Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four.\n\nThey finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so.\n\nIn Group C1, the Faroe Islands stunned Turkey with a 2-1 home win, although Turkey will still be promoted to League B as group winners, with the Faroes in third place.",
    "Netherlands vs Belgium: Live stream, TV channel and team news": "The Netherlands host Belgium tonight in the Nations League, in what is essentially the League A Group 4 decider.\n\nThe Dutch national team merely have to avoid defeat in Amsterdam to qualify for the competition’s finals, which will take place next June.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium must beat their North Western European rivals by two clear goals in order to make next year’s four team showdown.\n\nRoberto Martinez’ side come into this fixture having beaten Wales on Thursday night in Brussels, with goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Michy Batshuayi ensuring a 2-1 victory over the Dragons.\n\nThe Netherlands also enjoyed success on Thursday, brushing past Poland with goals from Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn.\n\nThe reverse fixture between these two sides came back in June, when Oranje thrashed the Red Devils 4-1 in the Belgian capital.\n\nThis game represents the final match for both teams prior to the World Cup in Qatar in November, so both Louis Van Gaal and Martinez will be eager to see a performance from their sides.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Netherlands vs Belgium.\n\nNetherlands vs Belgium TV Channel and live stream\n\nNetherlands vs Belgium will be shown live on Premier Sports 2 for UK viewers and can be streamed on the Premier Sports player.\n\nWhat time does Netherlands vs Belgium kick off?\n\nNetherlands' encounter with Belgium kicks off at 7:45pm (BST) at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam.\n\nNetherlands Team News\n\nLouis Van Gaal currently has the majority of the squad he called up available to him, although there are two potential notable absentees.\n\nTeun Koopmeiners was withdrawn in Warsaw due to a head injury, while Memphis Depay suffered a muscle problem, both of which look likely to keep the pair out for the visit of Belgium.\n\nDepay’s absence means Gakpo could move centrally, while the likes of Matthijs de Ligt and Tyrell Malacia could make their way into the side as competent rotation options in the backline.\n\n38-year-old goalkeeper Remo Pasveer made his international debut on Thursday in Poland, and is expected to retain his place for this one.\n\nBelgium Team News\n\nUnlike the Netherlands, Belgium came through their Thursday night fixture unscathed, so Martinez has an array of options at his disposal in this crunch match.\n\nBatshuayi filled in for the injured Romelu Lukaku against Wales, and repaid his manager’s faith with a goal, so he’s expected to retain his place.\n\nThomas Meunier could be rested for Leicester’s Timothy Castagne on the right, while Arthur Theatre is an option in the back three.\n\n\n\n",

    "Belgium’s secret princess, Delphine, reveals why she took her royal father, former King Albert to court": "Two years after she was named as a princess of Belgium, Delphine of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha insists that the title has not gone to her head.\n\n“Princes and kings never impressed me,” she says. “I never, ever dreamed of becoming a princess. But I knew that if I didn’t do something, I was always going to be known as the bastard.”\n\nDelphine is finally speaking out after winning her legal case against her father, Belgium’s former king, Albert II, who refused to admit that the “secret princess” was the result of his 18-year, extramarital affair with her mother.\n\nIt was only in January 2020, after a court-ordered DNA test proved he was her biological father, that Albert – who had abdicated the throne by then – acknowledged Delphine as his love child. A few months later, she was formally accorded the right to the title of princess and a royal surname: Delphine Boël became Delphine of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThe 54-year-old artist, who studied at Chelsea College of Arts in London, is candid about her long ordeal to be recognised as the king’s daughter.\n\nFrom an early age, Delphine knew who her biological father was. Albert, who she nicknamed “papillon”, or butterfly, was a constant presence in her childhood, even taking her on holiday.\n\nHer mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, was married to industrialist Jacques Boël. Albert was seen as a playboy prince but was married to Paola, a glamorous Italian aristocrat. Albert’s elder brother, Baudouin, was king at the time of the affair.\n\n“My mother thought she couldn’t have children,” Delphine says. “She had nine miscarriages with Jacques. And then she started seeing Albert. She was separated from Jacques but still officially married to him.” The outside world did not know the truth, even after Albert was crowned King in 1993.\n\nThe story only became publicly known in 1999. “And then it all went bonkers,” Delphine says. At the time, she was in London, where she had spent most of her life. “I suddenly found myself a bit like in the movie Notting Hill, with paparazzi all over.”\n\nShe initially remained in contact with Albert, who reassured her that it would blow over. But in 2001, his tone changed: he told Delphine he wasn’t her father and broke off their contact, leaving her in a state of shock.\n\nIt was only a few years later, when Delphine had children of her own, that she began to question her father’s behaviour. “I started to think, ‘This is not normal.’ I also wondered whether this would carry on, and what would happen to my children. What’s going to happen to them when they’re older? Are they always going to question who their mother’s father was?”\n\nBelgium’s Princess Delphine with her family, Oscar O’Hare and Josephine O’Hare, at the wedding service of Princess Maria Laura of Belgium and William Isvy at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels (Photo: Johanna Geron/Reuters)\n\nShe eventually launched a legal action to secure her recognition in 2012, but it dragged on for years. Albert continued to deny his paternity, but when he stepped down from the Belgian throne in 2013 in favour of his son, Philippe, he lost his legal immunity. In 2019, a court eventually ordered him to provide a DNA sample, or face a fine of €5,000 (£4400) for every day that he refused.\n\nAfter the test came back positive, Albert grudgingly admitted he was Delphine’s father. A later court ruling granted her the same rights and titles as her father’s legitimate children – while her children were recognised as princess and prince with the style of Their Royal Highness. “Sometimes in life, you have to go through the muck,” she says. “Sometimes, there will be horrible moments. But you need to get through them.”\n\nShe also takes pride in breaking taboos about children born out of wedlock, who now outnumber those from married couples in Belgium. “Or if you have a bastard child, or if you have children from a first marriage that you don’t want to hear anything about anymore,” she adds.\n\nDelphine is adamant that she wants to continue her day job as an artist. “I’m very happy that I have had a whole career behind me. That was also very important for me to prove myself before anything like this could ever happen,” she says. Next month, she has an exhibition in Saint-Tropez featuring massive paintings with slogans such as ‘Everything is going to be fine’, wrapped in heavy gold picture frames.\n\nPrincess Delphine with one of her artworks in a photo taken by her husband, Jim O’Hare (PHOTO: Jim O’Hare)\n\nShe has also used her platform to support her favourite causes, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which was her chosen charity last year when she took part in a celebrity edition of Belgium’s Dancing with the Stars TV show. And she is championing young Belgian fashion designers by wearing their clothes in her official appearances. “I like the idea of being able to help,” she said. “I like the idea that I can put Belgian talents in the limelight because we have a lot of amazing fashion designers, shoemakers, hat makers, bag makers.”\n\nBut for all the pain of her break with Albert, and the long legal battles, Delphine jumped at the offer of reconciliation. King Philippe – who attended the Queen’s funeral in London – made the first move at the end of 2020, inviting Delphine to join him for lunch at the palace.\n\nThen, a few days later, Albert and Paola invited her to the Belvédère Castle, the royal couple’s official residence just outside Brussels. Was this awkward? “No, it wasn’t at all,” she says. “It’s as if we had never parted, which is very, very strange.”\n\nThat led to meetings with the rest of the family. Again, Delphine says it was not nearly as tricky as one might imagine. “When you are really related, something happens and it’s natural,” she says. “The whole family is trying. We don’t see each other every five minutes. I’m busy, they’re busy. Some people think that we sit around all the time and drink tea. It’s not like that. But little by little, we are getting to know one another.”",
    "Belgium 2-1 Wales: Nations League – as it happened": "4d ago 16.55 Kevin De Bruyne talks to S4C, and isn’t particularly impressed with the suggestion that Wales made Belgium defend a lot during the second half. “I think we fully deserved to win. The first half we fully dominated, created a lot of chances. The second half we started badly. The only thing from our side is that we had to keep the ball, Wales were so deep, we had to wait for the right moment. That was the only thing that could have got better, but I never had the feeling that Wales were going to press us. I saw two chances for Wales, I don’t know what everyone else saw, but it is what it is.” As for the overturned penalty decision? “I was already running to the corner, but even then the rules are so stupid, because it was just a normal corner [and not a drop ball].”\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.48 Brennan Johnson talks to S4C: “It was a game of two halves. In the first, we lacked a lot of belief, we didn’t know how good we could be on this night, and especially what we could bring going forward. We didn’t show any of that. In the second half we came out with a different mentality and did ourselves proud. Rob Page told us to believe ourselves, to show why we’re here, and I think we did that. Poland is a massive game to stay in this league. It’ll be a really big game and we’ll all be ready for it.”\n\nUpdated at 16.48 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.46 The other result in Group A4: Poland 0-2 Netherlands. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn have given the Dutch all three points in Warsaw. They remain top of the group with 13 points, three clear of Belgium on 10. Wales are still bottom with just the one point, but they’re only three behind the Poles, who visit Cardiff on Sunday. They’re not down and out yet.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.41 FULL TIME: Belgium 2-1 Wales The whistle sounds on a deserved victory for Belgium … but Wales will be very happy with their second-half performance. They’d been given the runaround in the first half, but stood firm in the second, and could easily have snatched a draw.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.40 90 min +6: … but the long ball goes straight down Courtois’ throat.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.39 90 min +5: Martinez swans down the tunnel wearing a wry smile. If nothing else, from the stand, he’ll have a good look at Williams launching a Hail Mary from the halfway line …\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.38 90 min +4: Mertens finally takes it. Wales clear and launch a counter through Johnson down the right. Meunier comes across with a crunch tackle, just as it looks like Johnson would sprint clear. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez deliberately throws the ball away to waste time, and is sent off!\n\nUpdated at 16.45 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.36 90 min +3: Trossard wins a corner down the left. Mertens is in no rush to take it.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.35 90 min +2: De Bruyne, amazing in the first half, not so eye-catching in the second, makes way for De Ketelaere.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.34 90 min +1: Meunier has a dig from distance. Always wide right, always high.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.34 90 min: Johnson makes good down the right again, like he did for the Welsh goal. His fierce cross is tipped away from the danger zone by Courtois. Wales are pushing for a sensational equaliser, and they’ll have another six minutes in which to find one!\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.33 89 min: Bale shimmies down the left and backheels for Williams, who sends a powerful low fizzer towards goal. Courtois parries well and the hosts clear their lines.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.31 88 min: Trossard runs at Wales again and lays off for Vanaken, who slips a pass down the left for Mertens. He shapes a curler towards the top right … but it’s always curling the wrong way. Well wide.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.30 86 min: Mertens whips a cross in from the left. Mepham, bravely sliding to block, takes one in the swingers. After taking a few deep breaths and an inventory, he’s back up and running.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.29 85 min: Williams crosses from the left. Connor Roberts cushions a header down at the far stick. Johnson drags a shot wide left from 12 yards. Had that been on target, tucked into the corner, Courtois was never getting it. Not a gilt-edged chance, but a chance nonetheless.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.27 84 min: Tyler Roberts comes on for Norrington-Davies, as Wales opt to go for it with time running out.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.27 83 min: The home crowd weren’t too happy with the overturned decision, as you’d imagine. Now they’ve howled themselves out, it’s the Welsh travelling support making the most noise.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.26 81 min: Good old VAR, huh. That was a ridiculous penalty decision. We play on.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.25 VAR: No penalty! 79 min: VAR has a look, and justice is done. Morrell clearly toed the ball out of play, and De Bruyne then went over his outstretched leg. It’ll be a drop ball, and not a corner, while it turns out Bale was booked for arguing the toss. Surely that will be rescinded. Morrell’s yellow too, else he’ll miss the Poland game.\n\nUpdated at 16.50 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.22 Penalty for Belgium! 77 min: Belgium ping it around patiently. Suddenly Meunier rolls a pass down the right for De Bruyne, who strides into the box. Morrell sticks out a toe and pokes out for a corner. De Bruyne goes over, the referee points to the spot, and Wales are incensed! Morrell is also booked.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.19 75 min: For the second time in as many minutes, Trossard embarks on a dangerous dribble down the middle of the park. The Brighton midfielder has been lively since coming on.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.17 73 min: Johnson tears towards the Belgian box and slips James into space on his right. James one-twos with Morrell and dinks to the far post, where Vertonghen is forced to head behind for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but Wales are asking a few questions now.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.14 71 min: Free kick for Belgium out on the left. De Bruyne takes. Wales deal with it easily. The hosts haven’t been half as dangerous in this second half. All credit to Wales for making a match of this.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.13 69 min: James curls a cross in from the left. Bale gets in ahead of Alderweireld and heads goalwards. The ball flicks off the defender and out for a corner, at which James showcases his slapstick skills, slipping over onto all fours under no pressure, then getting up to needlessly barge Openda, shepherding the loose ball out of play, to the floor from behind. Goal kick.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.10 67 min: The presence of Meunier down the right forces Williams into conceding a corner. De Bruyne curls it in. Alderweireld slaps a sidefoot way over the bar.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.09 66 min: Belgium respond with a triple change. Batshuayi, Hazard and Carrasco are replaced by Openda, Mertens and Trossard.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.08 65 min: Wales make a double change. Off go Moore and Smith, on come Morrell and – to loud cheers of appreciation – Bale.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.05 61 min: De Bruyne takes the free kick. It’s an over-elaborate training-ground routine that ends with Tielemans taking a long-distance potshot that’s deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of it.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.04 60 min: Some pre-free-kick faffing, as Moore goes down to get the physio to take a look at his arm. Ian Burch helps us to kill some time: “Batshuayi now finally free from the graveyard of strikers which is Stamford Bridge where in truth he wasted six years of his life as well as ours. Hapless in front of goal, frequently offside and short of confidence, he looked every inch a Chelsea centre forward. He’ll be remembered for his title-clinching goal late on at West Brom, but even then he managed to upset the travelling support by running to the wrong corner of the ground to celebrate, well his sense of direction was never very good. He’ll never been forgiven for doing that.”\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.02 58 min: Hazard dribbles down the middle of the park with purpose, and is hauled back by Ampadu. Another booking, and another player who’ll miss the Poland game on Sunday.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.00 56 min: Belgium ping a few triangles. Vertonghen fires a low cross into the six-yard box from the left. Ampadu is on hand to hook clear.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.58 54 min: De Bruyne makes ground down the right and chips into the Welsh box. Some head tennis. Wales are defending desperately when Meunier bumbles onto the scene and witlessly clatters Apmadu on the edge of the box. A completely pointless challenge. The pressure on Wales released.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.57 53 min: Belgium will be wondering how they’re just a goal ahead. But here we suddenly are. The hosts attempt to rediscover their equilibrium with some patient midfield passing.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.55 52 min: That was a superb run by Johnson, who is a prospect all right. Moore could hardly miss, so good was the cross, though take nothing away from a perfectly placed header.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.54 GOAL! Belgium 2-1 Wales (Moore 50) Now then! Now then! Johnson dribbles down the right. He takes on both Witzel and Carrasco, dropping a shoulder to advance towards the byline. He stands one up to the far post, where Moore rises highest, planting an unstoppable downward header past Courtois. Game on!\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.53 49 min: Mepham is awarded the first yellow card of the evening for unceremoniously clattering into the back of Hazard. He’ll now miss the home fixture against Poland on Sunday.\n\nUpdated at 15.53 EDT\n\n4d ago 15.52 48 min: Tielemans shovels a diagonal pass towards Carrasco, just inside the Welsh box on the left. Carrasco takes the ball down, thinks about shooting, but tries to tee up Hazard instead. Wrong choice. Wales clear their lines.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.50 47 min: A slow start to the second half. Nobody seems in too much of a mood to push things.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.35 HALF TIME: Belgium 2-0 Wales Wales have looked half-decent in attack, but otherwise they’ve been very much second best. Belgium could easily have had a few more. They’ve been magnificent. Here’s Peter Oh: “I’m afraid even a rousing half-time speech by Michael Sheen himself won’t fix this one.”\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.33 45 min: Roberts races down the right and wins a corner. Could Wales grab something that could totally alter the momentum of this game? Well, nearly. The corner gets all the way through to Williams on the left. He’s got time to trap and shape a shot towards the top right. Unfortunately it pings off Norrington-Davies’s shoulder and over for a goal kick.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.31 44 min: Nothing comes of that corner either. Wales could do with half time.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.31 43 min: Nothing comes of the corner, which is half cleared. Hazard comes back at Wales and wins another.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.30 42 min: Belgium, unruffled, go back up the other end and continue to probe. Suddenly Tielemans creams a long pass up the right flank. De Bruyne strides towards the box and threads a shot towards the bottom left. It’s heading in, but Hennessey sticks out a boot to deflect it wide of the post.\n\n",

The company provides work for around 1,500 families.\n\nRichard de Haas, CEO of DPD BeLux, said, “Our ambition is to become the international reference for sustainable parcel delivery. We will put even more emphasis on international growth, innovation and the transformation required by the current market. The figures show that e-commerce continues to grow and that the potential of the Belgian and Luxembourg market is significant. During the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to our strengths in the B2C [business-to-consumer] segment, we had additional opportunities and made our mark on the market. With the new depots and our new hub, we are absolutely ready for the future.”\n\nHans Bonte, the Mayor of Vilvoorde, added, “As a city, we are extremely pleased with the arrival of DPD BeLux. As an important player in the ‘new economy’, the company is fully committed to sustainability and climate-friendly entrepreneurship. Without exaggeration, the new hub can be considered a leader for many other companies in our region. Moreover, the company is a boon to our labor market. On the one hand, Vilvoorde has an exceptionally high number of hard-to-fill vacancies. On the other hand, the city has a high level of structural unemployment among relatively unskilled people. This opportunity makes the situation a win-win situation. In any case, the city council is ready to determine, together with the VDAB [the Flemish Service for Employment and Vocational Training]and DPD, how we can mutually combine our efforts.”",

    "Illicit tobacco worth €73m seized in Belgium": "More than 57m cigarettes and 48 tons of cut tobacco destined for the UK market has been seized in Belgium.\n\nIn an ‘action day’, organised by Belgian Customs (Algemene Administratie van Douane en Accijnzen/Administration Générale des Douanes et Accises) with support from Europol, tobacco products with a total tax value of more than €32m were seized.\n\nAccording to Europol, the market value of the seized cigarettes amounts to around €73m in the United Kingdom, the presumed country of distribution for the majority of the products.\n\nBelgian customs authorities carried out searches based on intelligence provided by the Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau on suspicious deliveries to addresses in Belgium. The authorities also discovered two full production lines for cigarettes bearing a variety of well-known name brands.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies were also able to secure a massive number of empty packages, filters, cigarette paper, glue, cardboard and packaging film, as well as seven new machines intended for a new production and packaging line.\n\nAlong with confiscating massive amounts of material used for counterfeit cigarette production, authorities seized various vehicles and arrested several persons of Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian and Jordanian nationality.\n\nThis year alone, five illegal tobacco production sites and 15 storage warehouses have been uncovered and dismantled by Belgian authorities. This has led to more than 274m cigarettes, 88 tons of cut tobacco, 65 tons of water pipe tobacco and 40 tons of raw tobacco being confiscated.\n\nThe total payables on these seized illicit tobacco products - consisting of the excise duty, special excise duty and value added tax - totals more than €139m.\n\nEuropol believes factors such as its proximity to the French and British borders, rising excise duty rates in neighbouring countries, and short distances to certain black markets, have together led to Belgium becoming a major hub for illegal tobacco production and trade.",
    "Belgium Business Confidence Plunged in September": "By Maria Martinez\n\nBusiness confidence in Belgium fell sharply in September, declining for the fifth consecutive month amid higher energy prices and weaker demand.\n\nThe business confidence index fell to minus 11.8 in September from minus 5.8 in August, data from the National Bank of Belgium showed Monday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the indicator to come in at minus 8.8.\n\nThe acute deterioration in the business climate is affecting all sectors of activity covered by the survey, with the exception of the building industry, with the indicator remaining virtually stable, the Bank of Belgium said.\n\nThe loss of confidence was particularly abrupt in the retail sector, with its indicator falling to minus 24.1 in September from minus 11.9 in August. Demand forecasts collapsed and those for orders placed with suppliers fell again.\n\nDemand forecasts in the manufacturing industry were considerably weaker as well. The indicator for this sector declined to minus 13.9 from minus 7.2 in the previous month.\n\nThe economic climate in the services sector is also suffering from much more unfavorable forecasts concerning both firms' own activity and general market demand. The indicator for the sector deteriorated to minus 4.5 in September from 2.1 in August.\n\nIn the building industry, the indicator remained more or less stable, falling to minus 6.0 from minus 5.6, with demand forecasts even improving. However, business leaders were less optimistic about the level of their order books.\n\nWrite to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com",
    "Belgium’s diamonds lose shine amid Russia sanctions talk": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nANTWERP, Belgium — Russian diamonds are on Europe’s radar once again — as is Belgium’s fraught role in the industry.\n\nDespite six rounds of sweeping European Union sanctions against Moscow, Russian diamonds have remained a shining absence from the embargo list.\n\nTheir omission is due in part to Belgium’s prominent role in the diamond industry. Antwerp has, for generations, served as the main hub for diamonds arriving in Europe — including from Russia.\n\nBut that may change. Russia’s pledge to ramp up its military campaign in Ukraine has prompted the EU to accelerate work on a new sanctions package. And several diplomats said Belgium’s hesitance about a Russian diamond ban is increasingly untenable.\n\nPublicly, Belgium has pledged not to block diamond sanctions. It has also expressed concerns that such a move may harm EU economies more than Russia’s purse. Privately, Belgian diplomats have successfully lobbied EU officials to keep the precious stones off the sanctions list, according to numerous diplomats familiar with the sanctions discussions.\n\n“This position is becoming more difficult,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nThe result is that Belgium — and its unyielding support of an industry long linked to autocrats, dictators and conflict zones — is once again in an uncomfortable spotlight. The EU has already sanctioned Russian gold and other luxury goods. And now those long pushing for diamond sanctions, including the Baltic states, Poland and the Netherlands, are trying to pounce.\n\n“We’ve been pushing for sanctions on Russian diamonds for months,” said another EU diplomat.\n\nDiamond divergence\n\nRough Russian diamonds currently account for 30 percent of the global trade in the precious stone. And the U.S. Treasury Department estimates that diamonds are one of Russia’s top-10, non-energy exports, totaling over $4.5 billion in 2021.\n\nYet even amid the war, Belgian leaders have not distanced themselves from the country’s diamond industry. Just last week, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was in Antwerp expressing his support at an industry conference. He has repeatedly argued that any diamond ban would hurt Europe more than Moscow.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” he said in a speech that didn’t mention Russia.\n\nDiamond industry leaders in Antwerp remain confident, even after the renewed debate on sanctions started this week.\n\nOther countries have taken a different approach.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo | Paul O'Driscoll/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. barred the import of “non-industrial” diamonds from Russia shortly after the invasion. It also sanctioned Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, the chief executive of Russia’s largest diamond mining firm, Alrosa, and his father, Sergei Borisovich Ivanov, a former chief of staff to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe EU has not followed suit.\n\nRoland Papp, who follows illicit financial flows for Transparency International, said the EU was demonstrating “moral hypocrisy” on the subject.\n\n“Over the summer the EU added Russian gold to the sanctions list, it is not too late to add diamonds,” he said.\n\nIn July, the anti-corruption NGO wrote to EU officials urging them to include diamonds in its Russian sanctions regime. Papp said the EU did not respond to the letter.\n\nTom Neys, a spokesperson for the Antwerp World Diamond Center, argued that the diamond business, already under huge pressure from regulators and consumers, organically responds to consumer demands, which currently include ethical and sustainable practices.\n\n“We have invested for 20 years in making the diamond trade more transparent,” said Neys in an interview with POLITICO at the Antwerp conference. “Are we really going to throw that all away to reward Dubai, which is already opening its doors for Russian oligarchs?” he added.\n\nThese arguments have left Ukrainian officials fuming. In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at Belgian lawmakers in a video appearance before the country’s parliament.\n\n\"There are those for whom Russian diamonds, sometimes sold in Antwerp, are more important,” he said.\n\nA historic bond\n\nAnti-money laundering, tax regulation and greater transparency haven’t come naturally to Antwerp’s diamond traders.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Belgium’s diamond industry has been linked to civil war, armed struggle and corruption across Africa. The world’s first-ever trial against a smuggler of “blood diamonds” from Sierra Leone was held in Antwerp in 2004.\n\nBelgium’s government has long faced criticism for looking the other way.\n\nIn 2008, Human Rights Watch wrote to Belgium’s then-Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders, now the EU’s justice commissioner, urging Brussels to crack down on Zimbabwe’s diamond smuggling and the human-rights abuses that accompanied it.\n\nBut NGOs later accused Belgium of doing the opposite and lobbying the EU to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe’s major diamond producer, which it did in 2013, providing a boost for the country’s despotic ruler, Robert Mugabe.\n\nSimilarly, a group of Antwerp-based politicians in the early 2010s known as the “diamond club” were accused of dictating government policy and laws to benefit the industry.\n\nWhen it comes to Russia, then-Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, now the European Council president, was another advocate for Antwerp’s diamond scene. In January 2018, Michel met Dmitry Medvedev, then Russian premier, in Moscow to discuss business opportunities.\n\n“Our investment cooperation has not come to a standstill,” Michel said at the time, referencing recent EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea. “Russian companies have long been working in Antwerp.”\n\nMichel and Reynders declined to comment.\n\nRussia divides diamond industry\n\nSanctions aside, the diamond industry has also split over how to address Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSince 2002, the so-called Kimberley Process has been a United Nations-endorsed certification scheme designed to assure consumers and traders that the diamonds they buy are not fuelling wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBut critics say the Kimberley Process fails to address current conflicts, like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Still, Bruce Cleaver, the chief executive of De Beers, told POLITICO his company supports reforming the Kimberley Process instead of eliminating it.\n\n“We think it's an important building block in maintaining consumer confidence that the diamonds they're buying are not conflict diamonds or [had] child labor involved in them,” he said.\n\nReform may be impossible, though. Papp, of Transparency International, said pro-Russian members are resisting pressure to expand the Kimberley Process’s narrow conflict definition, which only covers diamonds financing rebellions seeking to overthrow legitimate governments.\n\nIndeed, at a Kimberley Process meeting in June, members like China, Belarus and the Central African Republic, stopped any debate on the topic.\n\nHans Merket, who covers natural resources for the Antwerp-based IPIS think tank, said the Kimberley Process is struggling to protect consumers from fears they are funding Russia’s conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It runs the risk of becoming increasingly irrelevant,” he said.\n\nBarbara Moens contributed reporting.",

    "Russia Arrests More Than 1,300 Anti-Mobilization Protesters": "Russia’s security forces arrested on Wednesday more than 1,300 people who gathered in various cities to protest against the partial mobilization ordered by Vladimir Putin, who upped the ante in the war in Ukraine with the most serious escalation since the invasion in February.\n\nIndependent Russian protest monitoring group OVD-Info says on its front page that 1,314 people were detained on Wednesday during protests against the mobilization of 300,000 reservists which Putin ordered yesterday.\n\nHundreds were arrested at protests – illegal under Russian law – in the capital Moscow and the second-largest city St Petersburg, according to the group.\n\nOn Wednesday, Putin announced in a televised speech an immediate “partial mobilization” of Russia’s military and claims to be ready to defend \"our people\" in the Donbas. Four eastern Ukrainian regions under Russian occupation are set to hold rushed referendums to join the Russian Federation amid continued fighting.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the immediate partial mobilization, one-way flights out of Russia to visa-free destinations for Russians, such as Istanbul in Turkey and Yerevan in Armenia, were sold out in hours.\n\nThe first Russian troop mobilization since World War II sent oil prices surging early on Wednesday on fears that escalation of the war could lead to further isolation and more Western sanctions against Russia, including on its energy exports. Security of energy supply, including of gas, is also a concern with the most recent moves from the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Wednesday, oil prirces pared gains and dropped after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 1.1 million barrels for the week to September 16, as well as inventory increases in gasoline and middle distillates. Hours later, oil extended losses after the Fed announced another rate hike by 75 basis points - the third such large increase in rates in a row. The 75-bp hike was largely expected, but it dragged prices down anyway, due to concerns about the economy and oil demand.\n\nOil opened higher on Thursday amid concerns that an escalation of the war in Ukraine would endanger supply.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Dutch coach Van Gaal insists side will beat Belgium": "Louis van Gaal insisted the Netherlands would beat neighbours Belgium on Sunday to secure top spot in their Nations League group and go into the World Cup unbeaten since he took over as coach.\n\nThe Dutch have a three-point lead at the head of League A Group Four and will win the group as long as they avoid a heavy defeat to Belgium at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday.\n\n“We’re going to win tomorrow. Better to go to the World Cup undefeated than to lose the last game. That’s what I told the boys,” Van Gaal told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nBelgium, who lost 4-1 to the Dutch in Brussels in June, must win by three goals to snatch top place and advance to next June’s finals tournament.\n\n“If that happens, it will be deserved,” said Van Gaal.\n\n“But I believe in my players and that they will win it. That’s how I prepare them. I don’t expect an upset. My players are always focused and that’s why I always tell them the line-up two days in advance so that they can focus.”\n\nThe Netherlands coach said he did not expect much different from Belgium. “We’ve analysed them and I see a team that always plays with the same concept of the game. I can’t see that Belgium is suddenly doing something different.”\n\nBut he said he was pleased that the Dutch would get a tough test in their last international before the World Cup in Qatar, where they are in Group A with the hosts, Ecuador and Senegal.\n\n“I prefer to play against these kinds of opponents. I am incredibly happy because there are players of the highest quality playing for Belgium,” he said.\n\n“I’ve often said that I think Kevin De Bruyne is fantastic. He dictates the game and also scores goals. How are we going to tackle that? And how do my players react? That is going to be good to see.\n\n“And then there’s the rivalry,” he added. “I think it’s fantastic to play against the Belgians. I’ve mentioned De Bruyne, but they have more.

    "Migrant smugglers using private aircrafts grounded in Belgium and Italy": "Supported by Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the United States dismantled a criminal network involved in migrant smuggling, document fraud and money laundering.\n\n© Belgian authorities\n\nUp to EUR 20 000 for a place in private aircraft\n\nThe migrants, mainly Iraqi and Iranian of Kurdish origin, boarded private aircrafts in Türkiye carrying false diplomatic passports. However, the official destinations of the trips (usually the Caribbean) were never reached. During the stopovers at different European airports, including in Austria, France and Germany, the migrants left the plane, disposed of their false passports and systematically applied for asylum. The suspects charged up to EUR 20 000 per smuggled person.\n\nIt is believed that, between October and December 2020, at least five smuggling operations took place in five different European countries. In addition, several plans were made to carry out other smuggling operations. In addition to migrant smuggling and forging identity documents, the organised crime group is also suspected of issuing false checks and scamming airlines in an attempt to build its own fleet.

Europol facilitated the operational information exchange and provided analytical and financial support. On the action day, Europol activated a Virtual Command Post to facilitate the information exchange in real time.

    "Brussels: discover Belgium’s vibrant capital": "Beyond the posh chocs, politics and rowdy stag dos, Brussels has for a long time struggled to find its USP as a city break destination. Best known as the place where warring bureaucrats tussled over Brexit negotiations, the unshowy municipality is often disregarded as a hive of suits and briefcases; a stomping ground for highfalutin members of the European parliament that doesn’t promise much fun. But that’s not the case. Scratch a little deeper beneath its surface and you’ll find an eclectic city bursting with self-confidence and surprises: ornate buildings dripping in history; flea markets stuffed with dazzling art deco treasures; a heady jazz scene that fills its old buildings with sax riffs and ragtime rhythms.\n\nLately, the city’s increasingly muddled identity has enabled a wave of grassroots artisans and creatives to sidle quietly in, setting out tablecloths at lo-fi seafood joints, claiming old industrial spaces for their experimental art galleries, putting on events in unexpected places. The upswing in no-fly travel has seen more people take the affordable two-hour trip from London on the Eurostar too, the influx of different sorts of people helping to support new sorts of businesses. And for those watching their wallets, this underrated destination is a more viable option than pricier cities such as Paris, Venice and Rome.\n\nSo while its medieval Grand Place and the much-treasured Mannekin Pis (a 2ft statue of a small boy peeing) may be the ostensible jewels in its crown, below-the-radar openings are helping to create a new dialogue for this energetically creative city. Here are some of the trends, showing why you should give Brussels a try.\n\nInvader Rubikcubist show PHILIPPE DE GOBERT\n\nCulture — cutting-edge art shows\n\nBrussels has always had big-hitting fine arts credentials. Its lofty Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (entry £9; fine-arts-museum-be) shelters works by Rubens, Rodin, Gauguin and the surrealist René Magritte. Now, with property prices lower than in Paris, contemporary galleries are choosing to move their collections over to Brussels, but it’s the growing clutch of small, ambitious exhibition spaces that is bringing an eclecticism to this once-staid city.\n\nGalleries such as the Vanhaerents Art Collection (entry £15; vanhaerentsartcollection.com) — founded in the Seventies to showcase works that were considered fierce and radical at the time — and “contemporary cabinet of curiosities” Galila’s P.O.C (entry £17.50; galilaspoc.com) are helping to push the agenda when it comes to both established and emerging artists. Beautiful house museums including the Van Buuren Museum in Uccle (entry £13; museumvanbuuren.be), which has a sculpture labyrinth, and La Maison des Arts (free entry; lamaisondesarts.be), tucked away in a bourgeois 19th-century house, are also leading the way when it comes to alternative exhibition spaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis autumn brings a run of intriguing shows throughout the city. For Invader Rubikcubist at the Millennium Iconoclast Museum of Art (until Jan 8; entry £12; mimamuseum.eu), the urban artist Invader unveils his love letter to the Rubik’s Cube, reproducing the Mona Lisa and other pop culture icons to surprisingly impressive effect using the cubes. Kinshasa (N)tóngá: Between Future and Dust at the Kanal Centre Pompidou (until Nov 20; free entry; kanal.brussels) offers a unique vision of the Congolese capital, exploring the impact that colonialism has had on the architecture of Africa’s third largest city. And Frida Kahlo’s work and life get an unexpected refresh with Miradas de Mujeres at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (Oct 14-Feb 12; entry £9; fine-arts-museum-be). “The Queen of paper art” Isabelle de Borchgrave will reconstruct the decor of Casa Azul, Kahlo’s house and workshop, as well as carpets, trees and dresses, using 4km of bright, bombastic paper and cardboard.\n\nFor a different sort of experience, the 13th-century gothic Cathédrale des Saints Michel et Gudule (entry free; cathedralisbruxellensis.be) is beautiful, with an incredible carved wooden altar, and feels otherworldly if you come while the choir is practising.\n\nThe Music Village ALAMY\n\nNightlife — jazz, clubs and beer\n\nBrussels’ jazz roots run deep. The city played an important role in the development of the genre, with many New Orleans brass bands performing here in the early 20th century. Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, lived here when he conceived of the unique instrument in 1846.\n\nMany of the city’s old jazz joints have been repurposed, including the internationally renowned Blue Note which, with its stucco ceilings, gilded columns and mirrored walls, is now arguably one of the most beautiful bookstores in Europe, Tropismes (tropismes.com), in the Galeries des Princes. But you’ll still find plenty of places to get your fix. The Music Village (entry from £13; themusicvillage.com), just a stone’s throw from the Grand Place, is a New York-style club that hosts emerging artists as well as international legends. There can be long queues, especially at weekends, but it’s worth the wait for the buzzy, retro vibes. Sounds (some gigs free, some from £10; sounds.brussels/jazz-live-concert), on Rue de la Tulipe, is a similarly iconic institution, where Belgian musicians have been sharing the stage with global performers since the Eighties. Since 2021 it has had new management, a human rights non-profit, Buen Vivir, which engaged a local pianist to develop Sounds Live, the club’s new musical organisation.\n\nSponsored\n\nFor improv in more unusual environs, head to Jazz Station (gigs from £8; jazzstation.be), where concerts are laid on in the surrounds of an old railway station, or take a walk over to L’Archiduc (free entry; archiduc.net), a dazzling art deco bar where the Belgian jazz pioneer Stan Brenders first performed in the smoky glory days of the Fifties.\n\nThe city’s dance music scene grows apace, with a surprisingly strong underground scene whose interesting factions include Cat Club (catclub.be), which hosts itinerant club nights in abandoned buildings, such as a roller rink in a disused supermarket. On Thursday nights the Abattoir — the city’s meat market — turns into the after-work party zone Boeremet (abattoir.be) with DJs and food trucks.\n\nBelgium is rightly famed globally for its beers, but in Brussels you can sample those made just for local consumption, from Trappist beers to kriek, made by adding sour cherries to a slow-fermented lambic. Try countless varieties in a classic beer hall such as Le Roy d’Espagne (roydespagne.be), a brasserie on Grand Place with weirdly eerie decorations — figures hanging from the ceiling and so on. The cosy iconic beer bar Moeder Lambic (moederlambic.com) has 42 beers on tap and 700 in bottles, or there’s La Fleur en Papier Doré (lafleurenpapierdore.be), an old tavern where Magritte and his fellow surrealists used to drink, which is filled with their little mementos, and sometimes hosts theatre and poetry.\n\nThe Sablon Antiques Market ALAMY\n\nThe food scene — Japanese is having a moment\n\nThe city may be best known for its glut of Michelin-starred restaurants — as well as for that Belgian classic, chips with mayo — but stroll around the cobbled streets and you’ll find enticing offbeat spots that reflect Belgium’s multiculturalism. Beyond the see-and-be-seen cafés in the glass-roofed shopping arcades, the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, and the busy friteries and waffle shops abutting the Grand Place, hip but unpretentious locals gather each evening at bars, alfresco restaurants and cocktail trucks, gobbling up rice paper rolls at neon-lit Vietnamese joints, or treating their taste buds at hole-in-the-wall Nepalese and Malagasy spots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is Japanese food that’s really striding ahead here now. Out of the city centre, among frenetic market stalls overflowing with yams, ochre and plantain, La Paix, near the Abattoir, is a quiet haven of European-Japanese fusion (nine-course tasting menu from £118pp; lapaix.eu). The ceiling of this two Michelin-star restaurant is hung with “lucky” origami cranes. The tasting menus are creative and display clever illusion, with perfectly executed dishes such as crab and coffee soup and marbled squid inspired by Martin’s many research trips to Japan. At the fashionably stark Samouraï (mains from £30; samourai-bruxelles.be), in an unassuming shopping mall near Rue Neuve, the chef Saito Harumi showcases his unrivalled skills in traditional, high-precision sushi-making. Those looking for something more modestly priced, however, should try Hinodeya (mains from £12; hinodeya.jimdofree.com) in the Ixelles area to the south of the city, where seafood hotpots are served in unfussy, homely surrounds.\n\n● The most beautiful river cruises in Europe\n\n● Short breaks: the ultimate guide to European city breaks\n\nJapanese refuseniks might instead plump for the best mussels in town at La Marée (mains from £19; lamaree-sa.com), a family-owned seafood restaurant with tables on the street. Unmissable too is the weekend street food market at Place Flagey, where stalls tout champagne, oysters and crepes.\n\nShopping\n\nIt’s really Antwerp and, to some extent, Ghent that are considered at the forefront of Belgian fashion and design, but Brussels too has great spots for perusing native labels. The concept store Kure (kurebrussels.com) for Belgian, French and Scandi brands; the vast Hunting and Collecting (huntingandcollecting.com), with an exhibition space in the basement; or potter between the hip boutiques of Rue Antoine Dansaert.\n\nMagpie types will adore the antiques shops of the Sablon area, in the oldest part of the city, and unearth treasures while chatting to locals at the daily flea market at Place du Jeu de Balle in the Marolles district.\n\nThe Juliana MARTINO DINI\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Juliana\n\nThe elegant Juliana looks out onto Brussels’ poignant Place des Martyrs, below which sits a crypt housing the bodies of more than 400 people who fought in the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Beyond the hotel’s manicured bushes and white neoclassical façade, you’ll find 43 great-looking rooms and suites, each individually and eclectically decorated (oceans of swirling marble here; supersized rose petal wallpaper there) and hung with artworks from the owner Eric Cléton’s private collection. There’s a maximalist feel to the whole space, with intriguing sculptures, objects and paintings throughout, including two squat bronze baboons ceremoniously flanking guests as they enter the building and an OTT floor-to-ceiling marble mosaic of Cleopatra, which took three artists four weeks to piece together. Even more eccentric are the taxidermy puffer fish in glass cabinets and an intricately carved wooden sculpture depicting Theseus and the Minotaur, which used to have pride of place on the Greek cruise liner Stella Oceanis but now keeps guests company as they sip old fashioneds at the bar. Below ground is a petite and steamy wellness centre, while the hotel’s Italian Juliana Restaurant (mains from £22) allows 28-year-old chef Rosa Caldarola to showcase traditional fare with a Belgian twist (the shrimp croquettes are particularly scoffable). The hotel is within striking distance of the Grand Place and the Sablons museum district, and you’d be hard-pressed to find such an interesting luxury hotel so centrally located in any other European city.\n\nDetails B&B doubles from £266 (slh.com)\n\nCraves\n\nHaving opened this summer, this playful new property is still something of a work in progress (most of the bathrooms still need updating from their beiges and browns and a rooftop terrace is yet to be added). But the 55 burlesque-themed rooms — awash with deep velvets and palm-frond ceiling fans — are nicely moody, and Le Conteur restaurant (mains from £16) downstairs is well worth a visit. Sourcing fish from the North Sea, meat from the Netherlands and spices directly from his home soil in Israel, the consultant chef Ronnie Bush lays on a riot of decadent Levantine cuisine. The silky labneh za’atar and the onglet steak (served with chimichurri made using Bush’s secret family recipe) shine, but the pulpo diablo — grilled octopus glazed in aubergine syrup — is worth the Eurostar trip alone. Book an early or weekday table, unless you’re feeling particularly energetic and fancy being swept up in the weekend party vibe, when guests dance on the tables and free shots are doled out to diners.\n\nDetails Doubles from £90 (craves-hotel.com)\n\nHoxton Brussels\n\nComing soon — Hoxton Brussels\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInhabiting a brutalist-style tower block that once housed IBM’s Brussels headquarters, the first Belgian outpost for the trendy Hoxton group will have 198 rooms, a bar, restaurant, rooftop terrace and a five-floor co-working space, all encapsulating the hotel group’s typical pared-back retro design. Situated next to the pretty botanical gardens (free entry; gardens.brussels), it’s also within easy walking distance of the Parc Royal de Bruxelles (free entry; gardens.brussels) and Palais Royal (summer only; free entry; monarchie.be), making it ideal for a quick city break.\n\nDetails Opening February 2023; room-only from £130; (thehoxton.com)\n\nLizzie Pook was a guest of the Juliana, Craves and Eurostar, which operates seven trains a day from London St Pancras International to Brussels, with one-way fares starting from £39 (eurostar.com)\n\nSign up for our Times Travel newsletter and follow us on Instagram and Twitter",

    "Critical Mass Belgium: Around 1,200 cyclists join anniversary ride in Brussels": "Critical Mass movement, urging for better bicycle infrastructure. Credit: Belga / Nicolas Maeterlinck\n\nAround 1,200 cyclists took part in the Critical Mass Belgium protest ride on Sunday afternoon from the Parc du Cinquantenaire in Brussels to Tour & Taxis, according to police estimates.\n\nCritical Mass Belgium demands better visibility for cyclists in the city and more developed infrastructure for road users. It brings together dozens, if not hundreds, of cyclists every last Friday of the month.\n\nThis Sunday, organisers of the Brussels chapter of the movement met with other “critical masses” from Aalst, Charleroi, Louvain, Ghent, Antwerp, Ottignies and more to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the very first “critical mass,” organised on September 25, 1992 in San Francisco in the United States.\n\nRelated News\n\nOn the last Friday of each month in Brussels, cyclists usually meet at Trône at the end of the day, to then cycle through the streets of the capital together for an hour and a half. This is a visible way for them to campaign for future-oriented mobility and to demand a public space “on a human scale.”\n\nWhile some take part simply to seize an opportunity to ride a bike with friends and show that cyclists also matter in urban traffic, others come with more ambitious demands, such as asking for greater consideration by political leaders of the air quality in the Brussels region, and therefore climate issues.",
    "Northern Ireland WU17s suffer narrow defeat to Belgi...": "Northern Ireland’s Women’s Under-17 team narrowly lost 1-0 to Belgium’s WU17s in a friendly in Belfast this afternoon.\n\nA goal from Belgian winger Sam Van Rompuy separated the two sides at Cliftonville FC’s Solitude stadium.\n\nThe visitors looked strong throughout, and enjoyed lots of possession, however Northern Ireland competed well and played some fine football, too.\n\nBoth teams had half-chances before Belgium almost grabbed the lead as the 20-minute mark approached.\n\nA clearance fell at the feet of striker Pia Bosmans just outside the area and she produced a thunderous shot which smashed off the underside of the bar. The ball bounced on the goal-line before Northern Ireland keeper Ellie Scott grabbed it.\n\nNorthern Ireland winger Rachel McIntyre tricked her way into the area but her shot was comfortably gathered by Belgian keeper Zoe Van Wijmeersch.\n\nDown the other end a low drive from Anisa Ademi was collected by Scott, who then clasped a shot from Bosmans.\n\nBelgium took the lead on 29 minutes. Scott pushed out a looping long range drive from defender Tabagari Gvansta and Van Rompuy was quickest to the loose ball to stab it home from close range.\n\nWith captain Margaux Martle pulling the strings in midfield, Belgium continued to press without creating clearcut chances.\n\nNorthern Ireland defended resolutely. Debutants Sophie Magee and Orleigha McGuinness looked extremely solid alongside Abi Sweetlove and Niamh O’Donnell.\n\nAs half-time approached McIntyre slipped past her marker and played in Kascie Weir inside the area, however her shot was smothered by the keeper.\n\nJust after the break Northern Ireland captain Aimee Kerr screwed a shot inches wide of the post.\n\nThe home side pushed forward with Weir and McIntyre combining well, while Belgium had a couple of half-chances and Belgium substitute Adewusi Rose smashed an effort off target.\n\nOn 66 minutes Kerr’s superb pass sent substitute Rhianna Breen free, however Belgium’s substitute keeper, Shirley Solheid, cleared her low shot from an angle with her feet. It was a fine stop.\n\nBelgium, who travelled to Belfast with a 24-strong squad, made several substitutions throughout the second half and that disrupted their rhythm.\n\nNorthern Ireland substitute keeper Kate Smith handled well as Belgium threatened to score a second in the closing stages.\n\nThe final chance of the game fell to substitute Gracie Conway who dragged her effort across the face of goal.\n\nNext up for Noel Mitchell’s side are qualifiers for WU17 Euro 2023 (stage one). They will be competing in League A against the Republic of Ireland, Finland and Austria.

    "Analysing Belgium's 2022 UCI Road World Championships teams": "Ahead of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships, Cyclingnews is taking a deep dive into the key teams for the elite road races. Here, we put Belgium under the microscope.\n\nHistory\n\nBelgium is the most successful nation in men's road race history at the UCI Road World Championships. They've amassed 26 rainbow jerseys, while on the women's side they are the fourth-most successful nation with six wins.\n\nHowever, the past two decades have been relatively barren for the Belgian teams, with only two gold medals and a total of five since the turn of the Millennium. Long gone are the dominant years of Rik Van Steenbergen, Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx, and Freddy Maertens.\n\nOn the women's side, meanwhile, the cupboard is barer still. They haven't collected a medal since 1982 and there hasn't been a rainbow jersey since Nicole Van den Broeck's triumphant ride in Barcelona nine years before that. Two-thirds of their rainbow jerseys came via Nicole Reynders between 1959 and 1966.\n\nThe Belgian men's last three medals have been spread out across 16 years, which is some achievement given the depth of talent the country has turned out in that time. Philippe Gilbert's win in Valkenburg a decade ago counts as their most recent victory.\n\nLine-up\n\nMen elite\n\nWout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nStan Dewulf (AG2R Citroën)\n\nRemco Evenepoel (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nQuinten Hermans (Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert)\n\nYves Lampaert (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nPieter Serry (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nJasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo)\n\nNathan Van Hooydonck (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nWomen elite\n\nLotte Kopecky (SD Worx)\n\nValerie Demey (Liv Racing Xstra)\n\nJulie De Wilde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJustine Ghekiere (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJesse Vandenbulcke (Le Col-Wahoo)\n\nJulie Van de Velde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nKey riders\n\nVan Aert and Evenepoel will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2021 road race fall-out (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nMen\n\nFew other nations in the peloton can boast a squad of left-behind riders which could feasibly compete as a standalone team in Wollongong, but Belgium have seen fit to leave a plethora of notable names back home.\n\nClassics men Greg Van Avermaet, Dylan Teuns, Tim Wellens, Oliver Naesen and Victor Campenaerts join climbers Mauri Vansevenant and Ilan Van Wilder – plus sprinters Tim Merlier, Jasper Philipsen and Arnaud De Lie – in all missing the cut for the final eight-man selection.\n\nHeading up that group in Australia, though, is one of the top favourites for the rainbow jersey in Wout van Aert. The 28-year-old has once again been one of the best riders in the world this season and will be racing to plug a rare gap in his palmarès on Sunday.\n\nHe can win from large groups, reduced sprints, solo moves, and can last over the hills as well – a perfect combination of strengths for the tough hilly finishing circuit. He's in great form, too – the past month has seen him win the Bretagne Classic, take second at the Bemer Cyclassics and GP de Montréal, and finish fourth in the GP de Quebéc. It will take some doing to get the better of Van Aert.\n\nFresh Vuelta a España champion Remco Evenepoel is his main lieutenant, with the pair hopefully avoiding a fall-out that tarnished their home Worlds last time out. The 22-year-old has stepped up several levels this season with Liège-Bastogne-Liège another new addition to his palmarès. If he races for the team and avoids getting caught up in media spats, he'll be a key cog in the potential victory machine.\n\nNext in line is Jasper Stuyven, a man who was inches away from a medal in his hometown of Leuven last year – yep, such is Belgium's strength in depth. The 30-year-old is a top calibre Classics man but with the harsh hills on the menu throughout the day he's likely to serve firmly in a team helper role.\n\nQuickStep-AlphaVinyl strongman Yves Lampaert is another Classics specialist who will be flogging himself at the service of his leaders, while Quinten Hermans – who last month said he wasn't expecting a call-up – is a dangerous option to have in reserve on the hilly course.\n\nKopecky won in Belgian colours on home ground at the Tour of Flanders – can she do it in Australia? (Image credit: Bas CzerwinskiGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men's team have an overall favourite and a couple of other options should things go south for Van Aert, for the women it's all about Lotte Kopecky if they're to take the rainbow jersey for the first time in almost half a century.\n\nIn recent seasons, the 26-year-old has done little but improve, to the point where she's enjoyed the best campaign of her career in 2022. She may not have won since her June national time trial title, but spring saw Kopecky take glory at Strade Bianche and the Tour of Flanders in addition to a second place at Paris-Roubaix.\n\nAs evidenced by her victory over fellow Worlds favourite Annemiek van Vleuten in Siena back in March, she has evolved far beyond the rider she was in seasons past and represents Belgium's best chance at victory in the women's race in years, even if her participation had initially looked in doubt following a hard Tour de France Femmes.\n\nOf Kopecky's five helpers in Australia, none are serious threats to win or medal as Evenepoel or Stuyven could be. The team will be dedicated to helping her break their country's lean spell in the race. Teen talent Julie De Wilde is the next-strongest woman in the squad, the 19-year-old having put in several impressive rides throughout 2022.\n\nShe recently headed up a Plantur-Pura podium sweep at the women's GP de Wallonie and was second at Dwars door Vlaanderen back in March. It won't be her year this time around but she's certainly a rider to take note of for the future.\n\nStrengths\n\nMen\n\nThe strength of the men's squad comes through their depth, with perhaps only the French squad their equal in that regard. Year after year, others look to the Belgians to take control of the race, and that is unlikely to change on Sunday.\n\nFew other nations can boast a series of helpers like Stuyven, Hermans, Lampaert and Van Hooydonck, and fewer still have a one-two punch like Van Aert and Evenepoel.\n\nIt looks like it will take some doing to derail the light blue train in Wollongong, with repeated attacks likely to be the order of the day to disrupt Van Aert's best-laid plans.\n\nKey option Jasper Stuyven took fourth last year in his hometown of Leuven (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the Netherlands come to the start of almost every major championship with the strongest squad in the race, it doesn't always translate to the expected glory at the finish. Last year in Leuven and at the Tokyo Olympics things didn't turn out their way despite boasting a plethora of favourites.\n\nAgain, they take the start in Australia in a similar situation, the potential for a muddled tactical race lurking below the surface of the powerhouse squad. For Belgium there will be no such dilemmas or recriminations as Kopecky enjoys sole leadership.\n\nIn a race such as the Worlds, which can be chaotic and unpredictable, there is value in having a defined team structure with a clear leader. Every woman in the Belgian squad will take the start in Helensburgh with a clear role and strategy in their head.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMen\n\nOne worry among very few for the men's squad is Van Aert's sprint at the end of a long, hard race – assuming he's in the lead group at the finish, of course. While the superstar has shown time and again that he can do it all, there have been several pertinent examples of him just falling short at the final hurdle when he might, on paper, be expected to clean up.\n\nAt the recent GP de Montréal, Van Aert gave a glimpse of how he might be beaten in Wollongong, missing out in the sprint to Tadej Pogačar at the end of a 221km race with over 4,000 metres of elevation – a parcours similar to Sunday's road race.\n\nDespite being one of the best finishers in the world, a worn-down Van Aert won't be a dead-cert to triumph in a finishing sprint even against non-sprinters. It's something to keep in mind if his rivals can't get away from him before the finale.\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men have a plan B in Evenepoel and even something approaching a plan C or D in Stuyven and Hermans, it's hard to say the same about the women's squad. It's going to be all-in for Kopecky on Saturday, barring a miraculous overperformance from one of her domestiques.\n\nThat's not to do down the squad, though, but not every nation can be like the Netherlands or Italy, those squads blessed with various leadership options. It's worth remembering, though, that in Kopecky they have a real option for victory, which has been a rarity for some time.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt's astounding to look at the list of top riders Belgium have enjoyed in their colours over the years and remember that they haven't taken home an elite road race rainbow jersey in a decade – far longer in the women's case.\n\nNothing is certain at the Worlds, some of the longest days in the saddle all season. That's true for Belgium as it is for any other nation in the race. The country does have legitimate hopes, rather than far-fetched dreams, of taking a rainbow jersey at the weekend, though.\n\nIn Van Aert, Evenepoel, and Kopecky, they have a trio of leaders that most nations would envy, and it would take a brave onlooker to bet against them taking home one medal, whatever colour.",
    "Projects in Walloon, Belgium point to a future of biomass as an energy source": "The cost of energy is historically high in Belgium and, to add to the problem, fossil fuels are becoming scarcer as we consume them. To adapt, farmers in Wallonia are developing more sustainable and local alternatives, reported Brussels Times One alternative to fossil fuels is biomethanation which consists of the degradation of biomass, such as manure from a livestock farm or organic waste from an agri-food plant. The biomass is heated in a tank to become biogas, which is composed of 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide. This biogas is then purified in order to isolate methane as energy.Simply put, organic matter is recycled to transform it into a source of energy, such as heating systems and compressed natural gas (or CNG, fuel for motor vehicles.)Farmers are able to use the organic matter produced by their livestock to transform it into biomethane (renewable natural gas) to heat farm buildings or sell CNG.The first Walloon biomethanation site was inaugurated in 2020 in Fleurus, Hainaut, and already produces 100,000 tons of output each year.This idea of \"energy community\" also appeals to those on the side of public authorities, such as the municipality of Dour in the province of Hainaut, which hopes to use the biomass from their citizens to produce gas by 2024.The equivalent of one ton of organic waste from households in the municipality would be converted into a product that will either be gas for the network or made into CNG for vehicles.Wallonia has a high potential of 8.7 Tw/h in terms of biomethane and other studies even suggest the figure could go up to 15 Tw/h.

Since Russia launched the war in Ukraine, the Belgian prime minister has been a strong advocate of introducing a price cap on gas at the EU level, warning last week warned that the \"next five to 10 winters will be difficult.\"\n\nDe Croo's government plans to impose windfall taxes on energy producers. While the tax would initially target the nuclear sector, a working group will look into other energy producers, but De Croo did not specify which ones. Spain, Italy, Romania and Greece have already implemented similar measures, and the idea is also gaining traction in Germany.\n\nBelgium will also cut energy use in public buildings by, for example, requiring air conditioning use to be reduced and heating only be turned up to 19 degrees Celsius maximum. Lighting in public buildings will be switched off between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nThe government is also holding discussions with the financial sector about potentially pausing mortgage payments for households most affected by soaring prices, and will work with employers' federations to find solutions for businesses and small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs).\n\nBelgium plans to extend other energy measures currently in force until the end of March 2023, such as a social tariff for low- income families; a 6 percent VAT on electricity, gas and heat; as well as reducing the excise tax on petrol and diesel.\n\n\"I will remain in contact with the European Commission so that these measures can be taken,\" De Croo said. \"Europe must show that it is capable of protecting its citizens, of protecting its companies.\"",
    "Air Belgium to connect Brussels with South Africa and other countries": "LONDON – Air Belgium will be connecting Belgium with countries in southern Africa, such as South Africa, Madagascar, Lesotho, and others.\n\nRoutes\n\nAir Belgium will be flying to South Africa as a seasonal route. Starting September 14th, the airline will be flying every Wednesday and Sunday to Johannesburg, with a continuation flight to Cape Town.\n\nThis route will fly under the 8th freedom of the air, stating that a foreign airline is allowed to fly cabotage flights while starting in its own country.\n\n“This is an exciting and important chapter for Air Belgium“, says Niky Terzakis, CEO of Air Belgium.\n\n“For Brussels Airport, the launch of the South Africa route by Air Belgium marks an important step in the extension of our network of destinations with Cape Town and Johannesburg,” explains Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport.\n\n“After no less than 20 years, we are particularly proud that this route is open again. This confirms that Brussels Airport is the right choice for Air Belgium’s long-haul services.”\n\n“We both have a diverse clientele, including Belgian and foreign residents, as well as transfer passengers. We also share a passion for exceptional passenger experience and tailored services.”\n\n“This new destination will be operated with Airbus A330-900neo aircraft, which combine environmental and economic performance with excellent comfort. This aircraft fits perfectly with our commitment to developing a sustainable future for aviation.”\n\nThis route is one of the most important for many Belgians. Belgium and South Africa have a deep economic tie, with a yearly amount of 60,000 passengers flying between South Africa and Belgium, and it is expected to rise up to 80,000 at the end of 2024, according to aviation24.be.\n\nAir Belgium will not only be flying directly to South Africa, but they will also open up a partnership with South Africa’s largest airline, Air Link. Together, they will be offering an incredible amount of destinations to the passengers.\n\nDestinations\n\nThe routes that are flown by Air Belgium and Air Link will be to the following destinations:\n\nSouth Africa: Durban, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, George, Skukuza, Upington, Hoedspruit, Nelspruit, Port Elizabeth, Pietermaritzburg, Mthatha, Sishen, Polokwane, Richards Bay, Cape Town, East London\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: Lubumbashi\n\nTanzania: Dar Es Salaam\n\nAngola: Luanda\n\nZimbabwe: Harare, Victoria Falls\n\nNamibia: Windhoek, Walvis Bay\n\nZambia: Lusaka, Ndola, Livingstone\n\nUganda: Entebbe\n\nBotswana: Gabarone, Maun, Kasane\n\nMozambique: Maputo, Vilanculos, Nampula, Pemba, Beira, Tete\n\nLesotho: Moshoeshoe\n\nMadagascar: Antananarivo, Nosy Be\n\n“The social and economic ties between Belgium and South Africa are historic and well established. The historical link between South Africa and Belgium is important, especially considering the importance of Brussels to the European Union.”\n\n“Air access and connectivity in South Africa have seen a watershed moment caused by the COVID pandemic. Airlink is privileged to have survived this change and capitalized on the opportunities that presented themselves.”\n\n“Our reputation is built on our ability to provide exceptional service, unparalleled reliability, on-time flights, and genuine service.”\n\n“Air transport markets are rapidly returning to pre-crisis levels, and there is currently an imbalance between demand and supply, so the timing could not be better for Air Belgium to enter the market with Brussels Airport as a central gateway to Europe, and Johannesburg and Cape Town ensuring reciprocity.”\n\n“It is therefore with great pleasure that we enter into this commercial partnership and welcome Air Belgium to South Africa and Airlink’s comprehensive network of destinations in Southern Africa”, said Rodger Foster, CEO of Airlink.\n\n“We often talk about ‘Belgitude’ and our motto is ‘Fly Belgian Class’, which consists in giving pleasure and comfort to passengers in all travel classes“, says Niky Terzakis.\n\n“And while our travelers appreciate our fun and engaging approach to travel, we also offer them what really matters: a safe and seamless trip, all-inclusive prices including a generous baggage allowance.”\n\n“We also offer travelers an eco-friendly travel option as the Airbus A330neo consumes on average 25% less fuel compared to previous generation aircraft.”\n\n“In terms of comfort, our aircraft offer the best: quieter cabins, adjustable lighting, a state-of-the-art in-flight entertainment system, and Wi-Fi internet connection throughout the flight”.\n\nOverall, this is a big step forward for Air Belgium, especially as the carrier continues its growth strategy overseas.",
    "Teleworkers more than double in four years in Belgium": "Teleworking is growing in Belgium and impacts mobility habits, FPS Mobility and Transport explained in a press release published on Monday based on a survey of 1,250 Belgian workers between June and July this year.\n\nIn four years, the share of teleworkers has more than doubled. In 2018, 17% of Belgians were teleworking at least one day a week compared to 32% today, a trend that has primarily been driven by COVID-19 measures, the press release stated.\n\nBrussels residents telework the most regularly, with 43% of respondents teleworking at least once a week, compared to 28% in Wallonia and 33% in Flanders.\n\nOn the mobility side, the survey notes that, in 2022, 35 million kilometres travelled each day were avoided thanks to teleworking, of which 14 million kilometres would have been done by car. Results also highlighted that the proportion of teleworkers increased based on the distance between their homes and workplace.\n\nOver 50% of responders who live farther than 50 km from their workplace telework at least once a week.\n\nTeleworking has also changed the modes of transport workers use, shifting to more sustainable modes of transport like cycling and riding trains which are more prevalent (61%) among teleworkers than non-teleworkers (40%).\n\nAnother positive aspect of mobility is that teleworking allows for the distribution of trips throughout the day or the week. Trips for shopping and services increase on teleworking days (28%) or are made during the week and the day rather than in the evening, during weekends or holidays (32%).\n\nTeleworking has allowed for a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, which has a direct impact on road safety. According to estimates by the Vias Institute, in 2021, with teleworking, the number of traffic fatalities was reduced by 35, the number of severe injuries by 242, and more than 3,000 accidents leading to death or injuries have also been avoided.\n\nThe FPS aims to continue to promote teleworking to achieve the objectives of a 50% reduction in road deaths by 2030 and zero deaths by 2050 set in the “All for Zero” road safety plan.\n\n(Anne-Sophie Gayet | EURACTIV.com)",

    "Ghent is Belgium’s unsung capital of cool": "Listen 14 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe sun beat down on Ghent. It was the hottest day I could remember ever spending in Belgium, and it was a relief to be on the water. I paddled the canoe through the confluence of the Lys and Scheldt rivers. The voices of sunbathers carried from the quay, where moored houseboats bobbed beneath gabled houses and planters popping with pink flowers. But I didn’t dwell on Ghent’s undeniable charm. Instead, I watched the water … until I saw it up ahead, partially submerged: a plastic bottle, riding the currents on its way to the North Sea. I extended my trash-grabber and snatched it.\n\nOver the years, I keep returning to Belgium’s second city. Once I made a pilgrimage to see a world-famous masterpiece, Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,” also called the Ghent Altarpiece. (It’s also known as the most stolen painting in history, but more on that later.) The city’s energy was so irresistible that I’d returned to survey the happening restaurant scene with a friend from Brussels. On each successive trip, I’ve been amazed that Ghent — just about half an hour by train from Bruges and Brussels, and about an hour from Antwerp — isn’t overrun with tourists. Most recently, I wanted to dive into Ghent’s green ethos. Beyond its cool vibe, the city has been making waves for its sustainability initiatives and eco-minded tourism strategy.\n\nSo I boarded a boat by DOKano. The idea behind this nonprofit: Rent a canoe for the price of a bucket of trash that you retrieve yourself from Ghent’s waterways. (A donation is also welcome.) What started in 2017 as the brainchild of five parents at school pickup has morphed into an organization that’s popular with both locals and visitors. DOKano also offers team-building outings and educational excursions with school groups, who are encouraged to sort the trash before nominating the “catch of the day.” Some of the more curious finds? A toy monkey, sneakers and perfectly usable heart-shaped luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“DOKano’s mission is to take action with as many people as possible to create plastic-free waters,” says co-founder Hans Marly. “The goal is to remove litter while raising public awareness of the problem.”\n\nThe plight of plastic in our environment can be depressing. For me, going canoeing with DOKano was a means of exploring the beautiful waterways while doing something proactive. “Projects like this are positive for both tourists and locals and reflect the city’s goals,” says Deputy Mayor Bram Van Braeckevelt. “We aim to keep tourism in Ghent sustainable — to find a balance with the city’s livability, to invest in projects that provide a return to the local community, to take measures to avoid overtourism in the future.”\n\nThe rebellious noose bearers\n\nGhent’s vibrant spirit and political engagement stem from its history. The story is told with flair at STAM, the Ghent City Museum, whose very architecture — an amalgam of restored medieval cloisters and contemporary glass — reflects the modern city itself. Back around 630, a wandering French missionary named Amandus arrived to proselytize the local population, building a church that later became St. Bavo’s Abbey. Ghent grew into a medieval powerhouse thanks to the cloth trade. In the oldest written description of Ghent (1154), geographer al-Sharif al-Idrisi waxed poetic in Arabic: “It is a beautiful, flourishing city with many stately homes and grand vistas. It possesses gardens, orchards and fields that provide a continual harvest.”\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Ghent was the second-largest city in northern Europe after Paris. This prosperous trade hub even boasted its own army, with which it challenged the Counts of Flanders and Dukes of Burgundy. Over time, the creation of craft guilds — each demanding political participation — encouraged diplomacy and the exchange of ideas.\n\n“Ghent has always had a rebellious streak,” says Luk Darras, a former Belgian ambassador who has lived here for 17 years, referring to an infamous 16th-century episode. Charles V, the future Holy Roman Emperor, was born in Ghent but later squashed a revolt, forcing the locals to parade through the streets wearing hangman’s nooses around their necks in punishment. To this day, Ghentians are called “stroppendragers” (or noose bearers), and you can find a noose proudly depicted on a local beer label.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the population numbers more than 265,000 people of about 160 nationalities, with approximately an additional 85,000 university students arriving each autumn. “It brings an injection of youthful energy,” says Mieke Thienpont, a professional guide and president of the Ghent Guides association.\n\n“The city is very much alive,” Darras says. “It’s friendly and dynamic — open to industry and change — and also socially engaged.”\n\nGhent’s heritage is reason enough to travel here. There’s the formidable Castle of the Counts, the 15th-century Great Butchers’ Hall, the UNESCO-listed belfry lording over it all. Founded in 1235, the Beguinage of Our Lady at Hoyen — also a UNESCO site — once housed religious women in a unique, self-sustaining community. Guildhalls with ornately sculpted facades flank the quays of Graslei and Korenlei. The Museum of Fine Arts (MSK), considered Belgium’s oldest museum, is celebrating its 225th anniversary with a rich program. And back to the aforementioned Ghent Altarpiece, of which Darras says is “the one painting you have to see in your life,” a visitor center inside St. Bavo’s Cathedral brings the newly restored work to life through an augmented-reality experience that’s an immersion in the Van Eyck brothers’ world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut besides all this cultural wealth, it’s the energy and ambiance that keep luring me back. As I walked Ghent’s cobblestoned streets, I fed off the laughter from the busy cafes, the rush of commuting bikes, a flamenco concert at ENTR, where I nursed a local Lousberg beer. Admiring the city’s prolific street art, I met local legend Klaas Van der Linden as he painted a wall on Graffiti Street. His works are all over Ghent; for example, the astonishing “Lost at Sea” is an enormous self-portrait in exuberant color. He has a master’s degree in arts, though he learned spray-paint techniques on the streets, and his paintings are exhibited in shows across Europe. A crowd had gathered to snap photos, and Van der Linden was gregarious, inviting some passersby to check out his studio: a medieval cellar with vaulted ceilings that’s quintessentially Ghent.\n\nIt’s this authenticity that the city champions (and promotes through measures such as the “Walk Local” campaign, showing where famous residents hang out to entice visitors away from the city’s Instagrammable historical center). “Ghent is so much more than just a selfie,” Van Braeckevelt says. “We invite people to bring their pajamas and stay overnight — to feel the city’s vibe like Ghentians.”\n\nWhen I checked into the Yalo Urban Boutique Hotel, opened in 2021, I found a buzzing hangout with great energy. It draws locals for coffee and co-working in the morning (the coffee is by a neighborhood roastery called Vandekerckhove), after-work cocktails in the bar (try “Lucifer’s Kiss,” with jalapeño-infused Pisco), and dinner in the glass-roofed atrium (served by friendly waiters wearing white Puma sneakers). A soon-to-open rooftop will no doubt attract the cool crowd for DJ sets with a panoramic view. There’s a real focus on design here, along with sustainability. As Belgium’s second hotel with Green Globe certification, its eco-friendly measures include solar-heated water, upcycled glasses by Belgian company IWAS and kitchen ingredients sourced from local farms.\n\nRevolutionary creativity\n\nA playground for artists, Ghent is fertile ground for experimental ideas, particularly in sustainability. Most recently, the city’s tourism recovery plan, launched in 2021 with a green focus, was the result of diplomacy and compromise. To determine the future of tourism, local residents were engaged alongside business managers in citywide debates.\n\nOther examples abound. The Ghent Light Plan was launched in 2007 as a means of illuminating the city’s monuments and buildings at night in a dazzling yet energy-efficient way. Cycling culture is pervasive, boosted by infrastructure (such as bike parking garages) and city incentives. A low-emission zone was established in January 2020 to keep polluting cars out of the city center. In fact, many locals have ditched their cars in exchange for bikes or community car-sharing services. Ghent was the first Belgian city to launch Fairbnb, the sustainable vacation rental platform that reinvests 50 percent of its revenue in local communities. But perhaps the biggest example of pioneering initiatives: In 2009, Ghent witnessed the launch of “Thursday Veggie Day,” now a global phenomenon that encourages people to skip meat for a day to help fight climate change. Ghent is today a vegetarian capital with a variety of restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We couldn’t have launched anywhere else but Ghent,” says Paul Florizoone, who founded the trendsetting Greenway brand 26 years ago. Before vegetarianism went mainstream, Greenway innovated with meat alternatives, and today, alongside its three restaurants in Belgium, it offers a range of retail products, such as sausage made from locally grown cauliflower and cordon bleu from celeriac. Newer to the scene is Epiphany’s Kitchen, a lively spot named Belgium’s best vegan restaurant by BE Vegan in 2021. You won’t find avocado toast on the menu. The dishes are the result of creative kitchen experimentation — such as the pizza crust made from crushed yuca root — which you can taste among flickering candles and a riot of flowers. Everything is made in-house. “It was a success since the beginning, and I didn’t initially market it as vegan,” explains owner Epiphany Vanderhaeghen. “I wanted to invite people into my world to experience it.”\n\nOn my last night, I sat at the bar at Publiek, a Michelin-starred restaurant with a real cool factor. Chef Olly Ceulenaere is a champion of the Flemish terroir, reputed for exalting local products (whether that be endives, Bintje potatoes or North Sea fish) in refined cuisine that’s also accessible. Appetizing smells wafted from the open kitchen while I slurped an oyster topped with berry-infused granitas, washed down with a rhubarb and raspberry beer. The ambiance is fun and relaxed — the non-harried waiters open to chatting — and it struck me that, with its laid-back style, the restaurant captures the spirit of Ghent. Tipped off by the waiter, I tried the Dame Blanche, a dessert that’s not on the menu. It’s a seemingly simple classic: vanilla ice cream made fresh when you order, accompanied by warm choux pastry and cups of melted chocolate and whipped cream. But it’s sublime because of the quality of the ingredients.\n\n“I want people to have a good time,” Ceulenaere says. “I run the restaurant to be a place where I would want to eat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was late when I left the restaurant. But the buildings were aglow, the streets humming with cyclists on their way home from a night out. I resolved to return for one of the city’s epic festivals; during the Ghent Light Festival, the gilded dragon that’s perched atop the belfry even spits fire — a fitting mascot for such a spirited place. A light rain began to fall as I followed De Reep, the same waterway I had earlier traversed by canoe. Then the skies above Ghent crackled with the electricity of a thunderstorm.\n\nWinston Nicklin is a writer based in Paris. Her website is marywinstonnicklin.com.

It speaks volumes about that group of players.”\n\nBrennan Johnson showcased just what he was capable of as he set up Kieffer Moore’s consolation goal with a fine assist.\n\nThe Nottingham Forest youngster has impressed in the Premier League with two goals this season and Page has hailed his impact.\n\n“Brennan has been superb, he has come on so much in such a short time.\n\n“I asked something different of him, in midfield.\n\n“When you see him run with the ball it is brilliant, that is his game, that is his strength.”\n\nWales were drawn into Group B for the World Cup, alongside England, Iran and the USA.\n\nThe Poland fixture will be the last chance for Page to assess his squad before he names his final squad ahead of the tournament.",
    "Lalengmawia Ralte after Belgium stint: We have to start early, need better academies": "Starting early and upgrading academies are crucial to lifting the standard of Indian football, feels Lalengmawia Ralte, who has returned from a two-week training camp with Mumbai City FC's sister club in Belgium, Lommel SK.\n\nThe prodigious midfielder, Apuia scored his first goal for the Islanders in the 2022 Durand Cup final against Bengaluru FC.\n\nAlthough Mumbai City FC ended the final on the wrong side of a 2-1 scoreline, the 21-year-old midfielder put in a stellar display in Asia's oldest football tournament and in the AFC Champions League earlier this year.\n\nHe suggested how Indian footballers can compete with foreign players.\n\n\"I think Indian players will be able to compete with or against them, but we need to have better academies. We need to start sending kids from a young age so that they can follow the style of Europeans and then we can compete with them at any level,\" Ralte said in a release.\n\nAlso known as 'Apui', he talked about his training stint at Lommel SK.\n\n\"Training with Lommel SK in Belgium was a good experience for me. Learning new things with European players and being at the top of the game was a great experience. I gained a lot of knowledge, which is the most important thing for me.\" The Aizawl native described a day in the life of the players at Lommel SK and said, \"The training starts at 10 and ends around 11:30. At 12 they have lunch and then if there is a gym session, we have gym after lunch and later, they go back to their own homes.\" The training stint in Belgium at Lommel SK was an intense experience for the young midfielder as Apuia expressed how fast-paced and gruelling the training was at the Islanders' fellow club from City Football Group.\n\nThe midfielder talked about the main difference between the training at Mumbai City FC and Lommel SK.\n\nAlso Read | AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey: Have to weigh pros and cons regarding promotion-relegation in ISL\n\n\"Training in Belgium was quite difficult since the intensity was high compared to other countries. The main difference was the intensity but the training style was not so different.\" \"...the intensity was so high that you don't have much time on the ball and making quick decisions is a must. I had to adapt to the speed of the game as I was playing one or two touches and making quick decisions.\n\n\"My training at Lommel SK has helped me refine my decision making on the field.\" Apuia also recalled how he fit into the squad. \"It was not too difficult fitting in the squad, but you need some time to fit in on and off the field. I didn't have much difficulty fitting in though.\"",

REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nBRUSSELS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - European consumers need a cap on wholesale gas prices rather than just a \"political\" one on Russian imports, Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking ahead of emergency European Union talks aimed at lowering runaway energy prices on Friday, Van der Straeten said Belgium wants an EU-wide, dynamic price cap on exchange traded gas linked to Asian markets to ensure security of supplies.\n\nThe price cap on Russian pipeline gas imports, proposed by the EU executive ahead of Friday's ministerial talks, has so far had a mixed reception among the bloc's 27 nations. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEuropean power prices have risen sharply up since economies began to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis last year, with the increase fuelled by Russia cutting gas supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Our intention first and foremost is to bring prices down.

    "First signs of new COVID-19 wave seen in colder countries": "Belgium's health authority said its modeling points to a new COVID-19 wave hitting in mid-October | Stephanie Le Cocq/EFE via EPA\n\nCOVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are creeping up in Northern Europe where the colder and wetter weather is first being felt across the bloc.\n\nLatest data from Belgium, the U.K. and Denmark points to a gradual uptick in the number of cases and hospitalizations.\n\nBelgium's health authority said its modeling points to a new COVID-19 wave hitting in mid-October. Its data published on Friday suggests the first ripples of this wave have already arrived.\n\nBelgium reported a 17 percent increase in the number of new cases of coronavirus in the week to September 19 from the previous week. Hospitalizations in the week to September 22 were more stable, rising 4 percent, the public health authority said.\n\nDenmark's infectious disease institute reported first data indicating a reversal in infection rates, which after a long period of decline are now stabilizing or rising slightly across the regions.\n\nThe institute also noted that hospitalizations rose 6 percent over the last week, compared with the week before. “People aged 70 to 89 remain the largest group among the newly admitted, as has been the case since the beginning of the year,” the institute said.\n\nAnd in the U.K., the number of new cases in the week up to September 17 was 13 percent higher than the previous week, while hospitalizations were up 17 percent in the week up to September 19.\n\nPublic health authorities including the World Health Organization have been warning for some months of the likely rise in cases again this cold season. Of particular concern is the pressure on health systems, especially with an anticipated surge in other respiratory viruses like flu this winter.\n\n“While COVID-19 rates are still low, the latest data for the last seven days indicate a rise in hospitalizations and a rise in positive tests reported from the community,” said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the U.K. Health Security Agency.\n\nHopkins urged those eligible to come forward for their fall vaccine booster, \"sooner rather than later,\" to build up immune protection ahead of the winter.\n\nEurope has authorized boosters that target two types of the Omicron variant, including the one that is dominant now. The U.K. has so far approved one new booster that targets the first Omicron strain, and has bought enough for almost the entire population.\n\n“All of the available boosters provide good protection against severe illness from COVID-19,” Hopkins said.",
    "Why has Belgium got so cold recently?": "Credit: Belga.\n\nThe sudden dip in temperatures felt in Belgium and France is due to chilly winds descending from the British Isles onto our shores, French meteorologists explain.\n\nEven if 21 September marks the first day of Autumn, most Belgians heading into work last week will still have been surprised by just how cold it is all of a sudden.\n\nIn the capital, those already having to contend with public transport being disrupted due to Wednesday's strike also had to choose between a scarf and a beanie when heading out, as temperatures had dropped to 7°C. Thursday morning wasn't much warmer.\n\nThis week's temperatures are a stark contrast to the fairly mild conditions last week, leaving many pondering if the cold has come round earlier this year.\n\n'Contrasting temperatures from week to week'\n\nThe sudden cold was also felt in France these past days. A regional paper in the southwestern of the country, La Dépêche, investigated the matter.\n\nThey spoke to Tristan Amm, a meteorologist at Météo France, asking him to explain whether this was going to be the new norm, and what the sudden drop in temperature was due to.\n\nAmm explained that this is not abnormal and that at this time of year \"masses of cold, dry air from the British Isles is something that we often see in all seasons.\"\n\nRelated News\n\nAll the same, the meteorologist did say that the contrast in temperatures is remarkable although \"no (minimum or maximum) records will be broken.\"\n\nAmm stated that Autumn can often bring \"marked weekly contrasts in temperatures.\"\n\nForecast for the end of the week\n\nWill the cold weather continue? Belgium's Royal Meteorological Institute forecasts a slight rise in temperature. While Thursday morning started off cold, the day has become increasingly sunny, reaching a maximum of 20°C in the centre of the country.\n\nOn Friday, Belgium will remain dry but clouds will become thicker. In the south, temperatures will reach a maximum of 15°C, and 19°C to 20°C in the west of the country.\n\nOn Saturday however, there will be a chance of rain in the north of the country, with strong winds. The maximum temperature will vary between 15°C and 19°C.",
    "Special Village to Be Built in Belgium for Ukrainian Refugees": "The city of Ghent in Belgium has announced that it will start building a village for Ukrainian refugees who settled in the country because of the war.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Ghent city authorities, the project is planned to be implemented in the first quarter of 2023, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nThe data provided by the United Nations Agency Refugee revealed that from the beginning of the war in Ukraine on February 24 until August 16, more than 52,000 Ukrainians arrived in Belgium. Meanwhile, according to the Ghent city government, only 332 refugees were registered in Ghent, to whom local residents gave shelter.\n\nIn this regard, the city government has emphasized that this is the reason for starting the construction of a special village closer to the city’s outskirts so that it could easily accommodate many people.\n\nAt the same time, it was reported by the city authorities that the construction process is planned to start already in September and to prepare at least 200 housing units to accommodate 600 people.\n\nMoreover, the Flemish government will be an active part regarding organizational, financial and construction issues so that the solution to the problem is effective and fast.\n\nPreviously, Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg have received an additional €433.79 million from the European Commission for supporting people fleeing the war in Ukraine, their employment, and health care.\n\nAs the EU Commission explains, Belgium, with the amount of €33.4 million from the European Social Fund (ESF), would increase orientation, counselling, and employment support.\n\nIn addition, in May, the EU Commission announced that refugees from Ukraine who have moved to Belgium now and have temporary protection are allowed access to the labour market and various social benefits.\n\nThe Commission also pointed out that refugees must undertake essential administrative procedures, including opening a bank account.\n\nAccording to the Commission, in May, about 30,000 refugees from Ukraine were registered at the Federal Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (Fedasil) in Belgium. Meanwhile, the data showed that more than 40 per cent of those refugees are minors, and 37 per cent are of school age.\n\nSeveral EU countries are facing with shortage of accommodation for Ukrainian refugees due to their large influx. In Germany, the authorities have announced that childcare centres, schools, and health care have expressed concern about this situation.\n\nCommenting on this situation, the head of the Landkreistag (Association of Districts), Reinhard Sager, has also added that many districts in Germany have already reached the limits of their capacity to accept more refugees coming from Ukraine.",
    "Museums on prescription: Brussels tests cultural visits to treat anxiety": "A tour of ancient sewers? An encounter with a masterpiece of 16th-century lace-making? These are two of the therapies on offer to people in Brussels suffering from depression, stress or anxiety.\n\nFrom this month, psychiatrists in one of the city’s largest hospitals have been able to offer patients “museum prescriptions”, a free visit with a few friends or family members to discover one or more of Brussels’ cultural institutions.\n\nDelphine Houba, a Brussels deputy mayor in charge of culture, believes the project is the first of its kind in Europe. The first objective is to reinforce access to culture after the pressured days of lockdown, she told the Observer. “I want everybody back in our cultural institutions… but we know that, even before Covid, for some people it [was] not easy to open the door of a museum, they don’t feel at ease, they don’t think that it’s for them. And I really want to show that cultural venues are for everybody.”\n\nThe second goal, she said, is to give doctors “a new tool in the healing process”. The young socialist politician was inspired by a similar project in Canada, where doctors have been issuing prescriptions to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts since 2018.\n\nIn Brussels, the pilot project is running for six months, involving five museums that are directly under the control of city authorities. These include the city’s history museum, a centre for contemporary art, and the fashion and lace museum.\n\nPatients may also discover the sewer museum, which allows them to stroll 10 metres underground along the banks of the Senne, the hidden river of Brussels, largely paved over in the 19th century. Or they could explore the collection of outfits belonging to the Manneken Pis, the statue of a peeing boy that has become a symbol of Belgium’s self-deprecating humour\n\nThe cherubic bronze figure has nearly 1,100 costumes, including one from King Louis XV of France from 1747 to make amends for his soldiers’ theft of the statue, and a gift from the Rolling Stones, adorned with the band’s tongue logo, that made its first appearance in July.\n\n“Anything could have therapeutic value if it helps people get a good feeling and get in touch with themselves,” said Dr Johan Newell, a psychiatrist at Brugmann University Hospital, which is taking part in the pilot scheme.\n\nThe Museum of the City of Brussels. Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy\n\nHe expects museum prescriptions would suit people suffering from depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, psychosis and bipolar disorder. “I think almost anyone could benefit from it,” he said. “It would probably be more adapted for people who are already a little bit further on in the recovery process”, rather than those who are severely ill, he said.\n\nMuseum prescriptions, Newell stressed, were a voluntary addition to medication, psychotherapy, individual or group therapy, as well as exercise, healthy eating and other forms of relaxation.\n\n“It’s just one extra tool that could help people get out of the house: to resocialise, reconnect with society.”\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People recovering from brain injuries, as well as older people and children, could also benefit, suggested Newell.\n\nHouba, who chaired the board of Brugmann hospital before her election in 2019, said the one-page prescription was designed to be as simple as possible. People “won’t have a guide or something special because we don’t want them to be stigmatised or to feel different.”\n\nPatients would discuss their visit before and after with their doctor, who would check “how the experience was for them, what they liked, what they didn’t like,” Newell said. As well as a chance to reconnect with society, he also sees an opportunity for quiet reflection away from the bustle of life. “Our society is so, so busy, so full of stress and stimuli,” he said. A museum prescription gives people an “opportunity to settle down for a moment”.",
    "Wout van Aert relishes ‘perfect’ day for Belgium as Remco Evenepoel dominates road world championships": "Wout van Aert and Remco Evenepoel rewrote the ending of last year’s script of the 2021 derailed rainbow jersey bid to score big Sunday at the Wollongong road world championships.\n\nLike the disaster day that saw the Belgian team implode in front of thousands of fans in Leuven, Evenepoel escaped into an unlikely early move Sunday.\n\nBut unlike in 2021, the pocket rocket long-range specialist rode everyone off his wheel and dived straight into the rainbow jersey in a move that was straight out of the team bus briefing.\n\nAlso read: Evenepoel goes solo for sensational UCI Road World Championship victory\n\nCo-captain Van Aert missed the medals with a fourth-place finish but was more than consoled by a redemptive day for his blue-clad crew.\n\n“Of course, I am very happy with this title,” Van Aert said. “It was a fantastic race. You can determine tactics in advance, but if it also works out that way, awesome. When Remco moved with that group, I knew it was dangerous, but it was also a good situation for the team.”\n\n‘It will be a big party tonight’\n\nAll eyes were on Van Aert and Evenepoel this weekend. Last year, the two dissolved into dispute and accusation when Evenepoel rode clear in the chaotic streets of Flanders and didn’t look back when the team tactic was to ride for Van Aert as the sole leader.\n\nThe Belgian beef simmered some time before the two towed the party line, and insisted they would race Sunday with two clear leaders.\n\nBut with Evenepoel hot off Vuelta a España victory and Van Aert the terminator of the Tour de France, would the two Belgian ballers ride for national pride or personal ambition?\n\n“I think how we raced today really like a team. Like I said before, we wanted to become a world champion as a team, it didn’t matter how,” Evenepoel said.\n\n“It was Wout’s chance or my chance, it was my chance to go from early and Wout was to follow along and sprint. I guess the early attack made it today. But I just think we deserve it. We really deserve it.”\n\nAlso read: Can Evenepoel, Van Aert right the wrongs of 2021 at UCI Road World Championships?\n\nAs one of the leading nations in pro cycling, it seemed off-key that Belgium hadn’t worn elite rainbow bands for 10 years.\n\nPhilippe Gilbert was last into rainbows when he won the Valkenburg race in 2012, and home fans expected big things from a Van Aert-Evenepoel twin assault.\n\nVan Aert buried any personal pride at missing his own chance Sunday, and was among the first to congratulate Evenepoel at the finish.\n\n“It was our tactic that Remco would join attacks early with Quinten [Hermans] and when they did, it was a perfect situation also for me,” Van Aert said.\n\n“It took really long before countries realized it was dangerous when normally you should expect the chase would be full-on. But instead, it was a comfortable situation. It was our tactic, and when you see how Remco finished it with a long solo, he was just the strongest.”\n\nEvenepoel profited from the confusion and chaos of championship racing Sunday. Top favorites like Julian Alaphilippe, Michael Matthews and Tadej Pogačar missed the decisive split that let Evenepoel off the leash and only caught back in time to sprint for consolation places.\n\nVan Aert didn’t fully realize the situation on the road, and missed out on scoring a Belgian one-three when he was beaten to the line by Matthews and Christophe Laporte.\n\nBut for him, the race was already won.\n\n“We knew going into the last lap Evenepoel was alone, but without radio it’s really hard to have proper information and it’s already a strange race with nations, and without radio it makes it even more complicated,” Van Aert said.\n\n“That’s why I didn’t sprint for podium places. That’s a bit disappointing but I cannot complain. We won the race and I’m super happy with that.”\n\nThe sound of beers in the Belgian team bus will ripple across the world to the beerhalls of their bike-mad homeland Sunday.\n\n“It will be a big party tonight,” Evenepoel said. “I’m not going to see my bed I guess.”",
    "Iran-Belgium prisoner swap: Belgian court to decide on controversial exchange treaty": "\"It's been more than 203 days since I last saw my best friend,\" said Olivier Van Steirtegem as he runs his fingers swiftly across his piano in his home in Brussels, playing a mesmerizing jazz tune. It's a tribute to his friend, Olivier Vandecasteele, who was arrested on February 24 by Iranian authorities on charges of spying.\n\n\"This song I'm playing is 'John Boy' by Brad Mehldau. It was the last one Olivier and I listened to together, before he was arrested by Iran,\" Van Steirtegem, 42, who is the owner of an office furniture store, told DW. \"He is now in complete isolation in a cell and in a poor psychological state. He isn't eating well, has an infection and has lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nVandecasteele, a 41-year-old humanitarian aid worker, had been living and working in Iran since 2015. He had been exploring options to move out of the country and eventually start a new project.\n\n\"But the Iranian authorities had different plans for him,\" said Van Steirtegem.\n\nOlivier Van Steirtegem, right, has started a petition asking the Belgian government to take action to free his friend\n\nFlipping through an album of pictures together, he remembered the fateful day in February when he got the phone call about Vandecasteele's arrest.\n\n\"The neighbors said he was in his apartment in Tehran and was waiting for a pizza delivery. But when his doorbell rang, instead of the pizza delivery person, Iranian authorities forced themselves into his flat and arrested him,\" Van Steirtegem said.\n\n'We are sending a message that we are weak'\n\nIn order to get him released, on July 21, the Belgian government ratified a prisoner exchange treaty with Iran. According to the treaty, Iranians imprisoned in Belgium, would be allowed to serve their sentence in Iran and vice versa.\n\nBut the treaty has been slammed by some members of the Belgian parliament, including some Iranian dissidents, critics of the regime in Teheran, as well as human rights groups who fear that this would lead to the release of Assadollah Assadi — an Iranian diplomat who has been serving a 20-year prison sentence in Belgium for trying to plot a bomb attack on a rally organized by rivals of the Iranian regime, in France in 2018.\n\nThey also say that the accord will give Iran a free pass to continue engaging in terrorism and taking people hostage in Iran and around the world.\n\nBelgian court to decide on prisoner swap deal with Iran\n\n\"If Belgium appeases the regime in Iran in this manner, we are sending across a message that we are weak and are ready to give them what they want,\" Darya Safai an Iranian-Belgian Member of the Belgian Parliament, from the Flemish nationalists party, told DW.\n\n\"I have been imprisoned in Iran myself for fighting for women's rights. I completely understand what Olivier's family is going through. But this is not the only isolated case. There are other European hostages in Iran and we need a better solution to ensure they're all released,\" she said.\n\n'Not fair to keep an innocent man in jail'\n\nVandecasteele was arrested and imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges which the Belgian government says are baseless\n\nBesides Vandecasteele, Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Dijalali and French tourist Benjamin Briere are some of the other Western nationals being held hostage in Iran.\n\nOut of 131 Belgian parliamentatians, 79 voted in favor of the prisoner-exchange treaty, while 41 rejected it and 11 abstained from voting.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo acknowledged that it was a tough decision, but said it was not \"blackmail\" and Belgium had to consider the pleas of Vandecasteele's family.\n\n\"What do you say to his family, that we will let him rot in his cell?\" he said in response to criticisms of the treaty.\n\nAccording to AFP, a lawyer representing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an Iranian opposition group in exile, said the Brussels appeal court had agreed to cross-examine the case before allowing the swap.\n\nThe court is legally challenging the Belgian government's decision at a hearing that began on September 19.\n\n'Negotiate with force'\n\nPrisoner swaps often takes place between autocracies and democracies where the latter is keen to bring their citizens back home, and the former is keen to use this tactic to achieve their political goals.\n\nExchanges can take place by either exchanging people held captive, or by exchanging money as in the case of British Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, where the UK transferred money to Iran in order to guarantee her release.\n\nBut Belgian parliamentarian Safai believes that prisoner swaps don't work with Iran, and the only true way to negotiate with the country is with force.\n\n\"That is the only language that the Ayatollahs understand. So solutions in the form of sanctions could work better. It is important for the West to take a united stance in confronting Iran. That's the only way that you can ensure security in Europe and stop the process of Iran taking people hostage,\" she told DW.\n\nA man protests outside the Antwerp Criminal Court, during the trial of Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi, who was sentenced to prison in Belgium last year for his role in a bomb plot.\n\nAt a press conference in Brussels last week organized by the NCRI, John Bercow, a former British politician who was speaker of the House of Commons, shared a similar view and highlighted that such a prison swap would not prove fruitful in the long run.\n\n\"If you give the beast what the beast wants, then the beast will repeatedly follow the same tactics. We have to look at the wider picture and not just focus on isolated cases,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem understands the complexity of this case since it involves swapping an innocent person in exchange for a terrorist. But he believes it is the only way to get his friend released.\n\n\"I might be biased but I think right now, Olivier needs all the support from the Belgian government. This will also give Belgians the impression that their government cares for innocent people like Olivier,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem has also started a petition asking the Belgian government to enable the prompt release of his friend. More than 25,000 people have signed it so far.\n\nCould the Iranian nuclear deal provide an opportunity?\n\nWhile a final decision is still pending from the court, Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a British lecturer in international politics at the University of Cambridge specializing in Iran, told DW that the Iran nuclear talks could also provide an opportunity for the West to negotiate with the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans have advised Belgium not to proceed with this prison swap since they wish to add on to the nuclear negotiations a larger swap of prisoners, which would involve prisoners from a number of European countries as well as Americans,” she told DW.\n\nThree members of US Congress — Randy K.Weber, Louie Gohmert and Brian Fitzpatrick — have sent a letter to the Belgian prime minister asking him to oppose the treaty.\n\n\"I think Belgium feels as though the time is right and there is no guarantee that the negotiations with the nuclear deal will go through. So they don't want to wait and make their citizens in Tehran wait until something on a larger international scale takes place,\" Farmanfarmaian added.\n\nIrrespective of how the law and politics shape the future of the treaty, Van Steirtegem has not lost hope.\n\n\"I know it is going to be a long fight, but I hope to get a call from the government telling me, okay, listen, everything has been cleared and Olivier will be back before Christmas,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what his family and I are looking forward to right now,\" he added.\n\nEdited by: Sonia Phalnikar",
    "Belgium – Investment in 40 local mini-pitches | Inside UEFA": "Supported by Proximus, Belgium’s largest mobile telecommunications provider, and the national lottery, this social project is built around renovating old mini-pitches for the benefit of football fans of all ages. “Work will also begin soon in Sint-Niklaas and Waregem, and we’re in the final phase of planning the construction of Belgian Red Courts in a dozen other towns and districts in 2022,” explained Peter Bossaert, the RBFA’s general secretary.\n\nThe association announced the creation of these 40 mini-pitches on its 125th anniversary in autumn 2020. Progress was hampered by the pandemic, but with the first pitch now up and running, the project is well under way.\n\n“The Belgian Red Courts project is important to us because it’s a way of using football to help to shape society,” said Robin Cnops, the RBFA’s social responsibility coordinator. “It is also a good opportunity to work with local authorities. The Belgian Red Courts will be open to everyone, as players or supporters, and we have no doubt that they will bring together people from all walks of life. The towns and districts involved are looking forward to developing activities involving specialised coaches trained by us, but also local youth groups, schools, football clubs and organisations providing social support, with the aim of fostering cohesion within their communities while also promoting football.”\n\n'Incredible project'\n\nAs sponsor of Belgium’s national football teams, adidas will be supporting the coaches and managers of the 40 mini-pitches with training and coaching materials for their various activities. The town of Lier is also looking forward to getting involved.\n\n“We are proud to be pioneering this incredible project,” said Rik Werwaest, mayor of Lier. “We would like to thank everyone involved. We are lucky to have a fantastic ambassador for our Belgian Red Court in former Red Devil [Belgian men’s international] Jan Ceulemans, one of Belgium’s best-known footballers, who had his first taste of the game right here in Lier. Maybe we will discover the next Jan Ceulemans here too! That said, for us the most important thing will always be the fun that can be had playing football among friends.”\n\nMore Belgian Red Courts will be opened between now and 2024 in various other towns and districts that have expressed an interest. Each pitch will have its own ambassador, in the form of a Red Devil, a Red Flame [Belgian women’s international] or a Belgian footballing legend. In addition, the first Belgian Red Courts Cup is planned for next year. This will be a national tournament for boys’ and girls’ teams, including disability and walking football teams. The final will take place at Proximus Basecamp in Tubize, where the national teams train.\n\nVisit the RBFA website for more information about the Belgian Red Courts\n\nThis article originally appeared in UEFA Direct 198"
