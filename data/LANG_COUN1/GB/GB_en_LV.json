    "Latvia Registered 2 Asylum Requests From Russians Fleeing Mobilisation as of Saturday": "The Latvian authorities have revealed that two citizens of Russia requested asylum in the country as of Saturday, September 24.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ministry of Interior of Latvia explained that the requests for asylum were received following Russia’s mobilisation, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nNonetheless, despite receiving these two applications, the authorities have made clear that they will not grant asylum to those fleeing mobilisation.\n\nAccording to the Public Broadcasting of Latvia (LSM), the Minister of Interior of Latvia, Kristaps Eklons, said that mobilisation in Russia does not constitute sufficient grounds for being granted asylum in the country.\n\nIn addition, the Minister noted that each case would be assessed individually and, at the same time, pointed out that asylum en masse has never been granted in Latvia, and it will not do so in the future.\n\nLSM explains that the State Border Guard has already stepped up controls at the border in order to prevent the border from being crossed by citizens of Russia who are trying to avoid mobilisation.\n\nApart from receiving two asylum requests, the Ministry of Interior revealed that the country refused entry to a total of 23 Russians since September 19, when the entry ban officially entered into force.\n\nLatvia, together with the other Baltic States and Poland, introduced an entry ban for Russian on September 19 and stopped issuing Schengen visas for them.\n\nIn line with the current rules that Latvia has, citizens of Russia holding a visitor Schengen visa issued by the Latvian authorities or any other country are not permitted entry. However, the authorities have not that certain exemptions apply.\n\nAs soon as such strict measures entered into force, the authorities reported that the number of Russians attempting to cross the border significantly decreased. The government said earlier this week that the number of citizens of Russia who tried to enter Latvia was around 1,000 since September 19.\n\nAdditionally, the same revealed that 27 of the Russians attempting to cross the border had C visas, seven per cent of them had D visas, 53 per cent of them had residence permits that are issued to family members of Latvian nationals, and another 13 per cent of them were seafarers who cannot leave the ship.\n\nSimilar to Latvia, the other two Baltic countries, Lithuania and Estonia, have also said that they will not grant asylum o citizens of Russia fleeing mobilisation. The foreign ministers of the three Baltic States said that Russians fleeing their country to avoid mobilisation will not enjoy special treatment.",
    "Ready to die for Latvia?": "Editor’s note: Our world is complex. The Global Watchdawg fetches events from across the globe, aims to build relevance to the UW community, and strives for action through the lens of geopolitical pragmatism.\n\nThrough the window of a bus, while staring at old Soviet mid-rise apartments, I reminisced about the last six weeks I spent speaking Russian with my host family, discussing furniture choices over tea, playing “Durak,” and watching the entire dubbed version of “Shutter Island” without English subtitles.\n\nWhile all of this was occurring, Ukrainian civilians in Izium were being killed, tortured, and buried in mass graves by Russian soldiers about 850 miles southwest of me.\n\nUpon my arrival to the United States, the news worsened — Putin had ordered a partial mobilization of those in Russia’s military reserve.\n\nNot to mention, renewed conflicts between Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to take lives, and border conflicts between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are reaching a death toll of 100.\n\nOver which, Russia has, ironically, urged a peaceful and diplomatic de-escalation.\n\nPoorly drawn Soviet borders, internal politics in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and a weakening Russian influence over the area have all contributed to this Balkan powder keg-esque situation in a post-colonial space.\n\nMy experience abroad was not in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, or Tajikistan — nor was it in Russia.\n\nMy home base was in Latvia’s second largest city, Daugavpils, located just 75 miles from the Latvia-Russian border. Well within the bounds of NATO protection, the city houses an approximately 80% native Russian-speaking population.\n\nFrom there, I traveled through Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, studying the Baltic countries and their long, dark history with Soviet occupation.\n\nUnfortunately, my excursion doesn’t even begin to capture the full extent of Soviet imperialization. In fact, every single country mentioned thus far has been a Soviet republic.\n\nThe aforementioned Daugavpils sits in an interesting cultural and political environment, due to the fact that it’s ethnically Russian, but also Latvian, by nationality.\n\nIn the city center, I could see Ukrainian flags being flown outside homes, but when talking to older citizens, there was a clear hesitation about discussing the war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of the folks I conversed with declared that the war is “bad for both sides” and remained lukewarm. While not factually incorrect, there is a clear aggressor in this war.\n\nIt would be unfair to characterize Daugavpils as pro-Russia, as it actually leans pro-Ukraine. However, during my time abroad, I’ve learned that leaning pro-Ukraine doesn’t cut it anymore.\n\nThis “Daugavpils effect” is something I worry about on our own campus.\n\n“It’s better to be on the map with positive views,” Māris Selga, ambassador of Latvia to the United States, said. “But in many ways, the war in Ukraine has put us on the map for completely different reasons.”\n\nHow many more countries need to first appear on the news in bloody conflicts before UW students can place them on a map? How many more “unpredictable” wars need to start before there is more proactive action rather than vapid performative reaction?\n\nCarl Larson, a soldier from Seattle who fought in the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine and organizer of Friends of Ukraine’s Military, expressed his anger.\n\n“This pisses me off … Most of my fellow Amercians seem to not care,” Larson said. “This was an opportunity to show my fellow Americans, with my own body, my own life, how important it is for us. It’s still our fight.”\n\nLarson is, arguably, absolutely right. While Larson’s choice is one potential avenue for activism, at an absolute, bare minimum we should be getting educated on this topic.\n\nThe next step for UW students who live in Seattle is to send a letter to Rep. Jayapal and encourage her to be more firm on her support of Ukraine with President Biden.\n\nIf you don’t live in Jayapal’s district, this site can help you identify your representative.\n\nDiplomacy is always the best first option. But as it stands right now, Ukraine needs continued military, humanitarian, and political support from the United States.\n\n“When dealing with a great power, the one thing you don’t do is appease,” George Beebe, former director of the CIA’s Russian analysis and staff advisor to former Vice President Dick Cheney, said. “Show that easy conquest will not be achieved.”\n\nIn this regard, Ukraine has been successful. Many thought that Kyiv would be taken in a matter of days. But fortunately, massive international support has shown leaders in the Kremlin that war is, and always will be, costly.\n\nAs we pass the 200 day mark, political fatigue and apathy become culprits of inaction. I urge UW students to possess the same level of energy and grit they had earlier this year on Feb. 22.\n\n“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, his success there will embolden China, North Korea, and every malevolent dictator in the world,” Larson said.\n\nZelensky has consistently outlined his demands, which include the reunification of Crimea, which had been annexed by Russia in 2014, into Ukrainian borders and reparations before peace talks.\n\nCrimea is considered by Russia to be Russian soil. If Zelensky isn’t bluffing with these demands and pushes forth with military action, this will mean a perceived invasion from Ukraine by Russia.\n\nIt is quite likely that there will be a quick and explosive response. Regardless, enabling unbridled aggression of a sovereign nation like Ukraine isn’t the M.O., we should be pursuing it.\n\nDespite Ukrainian counter-offensive success in Kharkiv and Kherson, Putin seems willing to bind his legacy to a brutal war of attrition.\n\n“If the freedoms and liberties deteriorate or are taken away from the more remote corners of the world … this is certainly something that will harm and affect the other guys,” Kristjan Prikk, ambassador of Estonia to the United States, said.\n\nThe longer this war goes on, the worse it gets, the more likely a full-blown world war will break out, and it’s not too extreme to say that it may include the United States.\n\n“Most NATO members are not ready for war with Russia,” Steven Pifer, former ambassador of the United States to Ukraine, said.\n\nThis is the unfortunate truth. Many NATO countries that border Russia like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Norway, and Finland will rely heavily on U.S. support if push comes to shove.\n\nThe United States, of course, has already been leagues ahead in its support of Ukraine.\n\nThough a world war is unlikely, it is worth noting that the countries we owe a defensive obligation to are much more connected to us than we think — and that includes Daugavpils.\n\nAfter the bus took off on our last day of formal study, the words of a young, patriotic Latvian echoed in my head.\n\n“I am ready to die for Latvia,” she said.\n\nAre you?\n\nReach writer Raj Kumar at opinion@dailyuw.com.

    "Sewage monitoring indicates a surge of Covid-19 spread in Latvia": "Sewage monitoring data for some of Latvia’s cities indicates an increase of coronavirus concentration, which indicates a surge of the spread of Covid-19, as reported on Twitter by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre representative Dita Gudra.\n\nSeptember’s monitoring data indicates increased concentration of the virus in sewer water in Riga, Jurmala, Liepaja and Jelgava. Measurements in Liepaja, however, show signs of stabilisation and reduced concentration of the virus.\n\nA sharp surge is reported in Ventspils, which contradicts data reported by the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\nIn Valmiera and Jekabpils there is an increase of coronavirus concentration reported, which indicates increased spread of the infection.\n\nA sharp increase of concentration of the virus is observed in Tukums as well, where measurements are on a sharp rise. The situation in Salaspils also indicates increased concentration of Covid-19.\n\nIn all Latvian municipalities surveyed the dominant Covid-19 variant is Omicron sub-variant BA4/5, which is found in more than 95% of cases.\n\nAs previously reported, Latvia has adopted a system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 particles in sewer water in order to predict outbreaks of the virus in populated areas.\n\nThe research included BIOR, Riga Technical University’s Water Research and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre.\n\nAccording to information published on BIOR website, sewer monitoring plays an important role in viral epidemiology. Analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples taken from sewage systems provides additional information to SPKC and other health institutions in order to predict and observe dynamics of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe advantage of this monitoring approach is that it is possible to determine the presence of infected people who have and don’t have symptoms in a municipality.\n\nCollection of sewage samples from centralised systems is done twice a week. These samples are then delivered to BIOR and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, which analyse those samples for presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles and viral RNA. Samples are tested for other public health related particles.",

The Ministers discussed bilateral relations, relations between the EU and the Republic of South Africa, and cooperation in international organizations,” the statement reads.\n\nIn this regard, Minister Rinkēvičs said that he hopes that the planned political consultations between the Foreign Ministries in Pretoria next October will provide an opportunity to identify areas of cooperation of common interest.\n\nAccording to him, Latvia is interested in developing business contacts in information technology, education and science, as well as in the logistics and transport sector, thus taking advantage of the benefits of Latvia’s ports and airports.\n\n“The signing of a convention on the prevention of double taxation, an air transport agreement, or a memorandum on economic cooperation would facilitate unlocking cooperation potential,” he also noted.\n\nAs the Ministry explains, the Ministers also exchanged positions regarding the war in Ukraine at the meeting. At the same time, the Latvian Foreign Minister said that for the first time in 2025, Latvia would be a candidate in the elections for the United Nations Security Council for the 2026-2027 mandate.\n\nMoreover, in 2015 Latvian exports to South Africa amounted to €6.9 million or 0.1 per cent of Latvia’s total exports, mainly wood and wooden articles, machinery, mechanisms and electrical equipment and vehicles.\n\nOn the other hand, imports from South Africa reached €1.0 million or 0.01 per cent of Latvia’s total imports, which included food, chemical and plant products.

    "Moscow Losing Another Nation’s Orthodox Church—This Time Latvia’s": "Since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Orthodox faithful and leaders in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries began to press for independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, the Russian Orthodox Church and equally the Russian government have been worried about these efforts and worked hard to oppose them. This anxiety was further exacerbated in January 2019 when the Ecumenical Patriarch granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which cost Moscow its largest presence abroad (Novayagazeta.ru, March 27). Indeed, the Moscow Patriarchate is clearly in retreat almost everywhere in the former Soviet space, a retreat that has increased in speed given the Kremlin’s all-out aggression in Ukraine (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Now, Moscow is in the process of losing control over yet another national Orthodox church—this time in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nOn September 5, Latvian President Egils Levits called for the Seimas (Latvia’s parliament) to give the Latvian Orthodox Church autocephaly and thus formalize its complete independence from Moscow. Three days later, the country’s parliament passed a law that requires the Latvian Orthodox Church to bring its statute into conformity with the new law by October 31 and thus become independent from Moscow (Eng.lsm.lv, September 5; Meduza, September 5). The parliament acted so quickly because, according to Levits, such a change was required for Latvia’s national security given the long history of Moscow using Orthodox churches abroad for political purposes (Orthodoxtimes.com, September 10).\n\nNot surprisingly, the Moscow Patriarchate and Kremlin media have reacted with fury. Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, an adviser to Moscow Patriarch Kirill, said this was a most unhappy development because Latvia’s constitution proclaims the separation of church and state. Balashov also characterized the move as totally unnecessary because the Latvian Orthodox Church has been self-administrating since 1992. He said it was a return to the medieval principle of cujus regio, ejus religio, which held that the ruler of a country determines its religion. Moreover, he made clear that, since the state has no right to grant autocephaly, Moscow has no intention of recognizing Riga’s action and that no other Orthodox church should either (Interfax-religion.ru, September 8; Stoletie.ru, September 9).\n\nMeanwhile, commentaries in pro-Kremlin media were even more emotional. One in Vzglyad, for example, labeled Latvia’s move as “completely fantastic and unprecedented in world practice” (Vzglyad, September 5). More independent Russian outlets were more cautious and apparently more accepting of something they consider inevitable in the current environment (Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 9).\n\nThe proximate cause of what Latvia has done lies in Ukraine, both in Russia’s war there and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate’s declaration of independence from Moscow because of the war and the earlier grant of autocephaly to the competing Orthodox Church of Ukraine. All this has echoed throughout Orthodox churches in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries, which, in Soviet times, and in some earlier cases, were subordinate to Moscow. But Riga’s latest move is also the product of uniquely Latvian concerns about ending arrangements that its people and government see as surviving from the time of Soviet occupation, and they have good reason to believe Moscow has and will again use these arrangements to compromise Latvia’s independence.\n\nLike most things connected with the Russian Orthodox Church, its situation in Latvia has been both complex and murky. In 1921, after Latvia gained independence, the Russian Orthodox Church recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as autonomous, but the Riga church remained nominally subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1936, following the Soviet assassination of the head of the Orthodox Church in Latvia, the Ecumenical Patriarchate recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as part of its dominion. The Soviets suppressed that arrangement when they occupied Latvia during World War II; but in December 1992, after Latvia regained independence, the Latvian Orthodox Church again became autonomous but did not depart from the canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate. That was not a program many Latvians welcomed because Moscow retained the right to appoint the church’s head and the Latvian church was required to follow Moscow’s decisions (Apn.ru, September 7).\n\nTensions regarding this have only increased over the past decade and have exploded since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, an action Latvia has vehemently opposed. First of all, the Latvian government has published records from Soviet times showing that the metropolitan of the Latvian Orthodox Church was a KGB agent. Second, the Seimas passed a law requiring that the heads of all churches in Latvia must be Latvian citizens, something the Orthodox ones had not been but eventually conceded to despite fears in Moscow that it was giving up too much (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1, 2019). And third, the hitherto microscopic Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church has begun to attract more followers and has become at least potentially a genuine competitor to the Latvian Orthodox Church, which has just over 100 parishes and a claimed membership of 350,000 (see EDM, October 17, 2019).\n\nGiven the small size of Latvia and the Latvian Orthodox Church, some may be inclined to dismiss this latest development as little more than a tempest in a teapot. But three primary reasons point to why that would be a mistake. First, Moscow has shown its willingness to use its church in Latvia to mobilize ethnic Russians against the regime and can be expected to do so in the coming weeks, thus creating another problem for Riga. Second, the Latvian action, one by the state regarding religion, may provide a model for other governments in the post-Soviet space to take similar actions, thus accelerating the departure of Orthodox churches from Moscow’s supervision—or at a minimum raising the battle of this possibility to government levels. And third, this Latvian action, coming as it does during the course of Putin’s war in Ukraine, will only intensify fissiparousness (cleavages) within the Orthodox world generally and indeed within Christianity as a whole regarding relations with Moscow by highlighting the unfortunate history of the Kremlin using the church for anything but religious ends.",

    "Latvia exposes NATO’s sham victory against Russia": "The Zelensky regime seems to be overjoyed by their recent supposed counteroffensive against the Russians. To tell you the truth, Moscow’s recent retreat on the battleground in some areas of Ukraine has been misunderstood to be Putin’s weakness.\n\nStill, it looks like NATO was indeed overjoyed by the development until Putin cleared his motive behind the war and now the baltic state Latvia has solidified the Russian’s position of strength.\n\nLatvia Knows Moscow better than the west\n\nThe Latvian cabinet recently approved suggestions from the Defense Ministry concerning the creation of the State Defense Service which will be responsible to oversee the annual military service.\n\nYou see, the Latvian’s proximity to the Russian megastate has enabled them to gather better intelligence than any of the western states. And the Latvians know that Moscow is far too big of a power to just back out of the war. The Latvian leaders knew that the whole development must be nothing but a part of a larger strategy inculcated by the Russians.\n\nWell, the doubts were soon enough cleared by Putin. In a rare address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the decree concerning partial mobilization of its 2 million-strong military reserves has been signed as the war in Ukraine reaches its seventh month.\n\nThe decision, which Putin said was taken “to defend the motherland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being viewed as an escalatory move by the West.\n\nPutin had initiated the military operation with the aim of liberating the oppressed people of Donbass. And now when the region is under complete Russian control, Putin plans to pull back the regular army and replace it with conscripts to maintain peace in the liberated regions and continue defending the territory if Ukraine launches a ‘counter-offensive’ against the ethnic Russian populace.\n\nThe Baltics Know that NATO is unreliable\n\nYou see, other NATO members like Poland and Hungary are just now coming to consensus with the realities of NATO. The alliance’s leaders have not been instrumental in protecting the interests of its members and have instead used them to carry out their own personal agendas.\n\nThe USA and Germany have extended unparalleled pressure on Poland to support Ukraine militarily. Although, Poland was not reimbursed for the support it was offered by Germany after Warsaw sent its essential military equipment to support Kyiv. The unapologetic refusal by Germany triggered the leaders of Poland who soon started taking anti-EU stands.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, has long taken an opposing stand and also refused to condemn Russia for its military operation and has continued with its energy deals with Russia.\n\nAlthough the Baltic nations know the capacities of the Russian defense system and had previously come to a consensus the west will not come to aid in the event of an escalation by Moscow.\n\nLatvia has so far been the only Baltic state where conscription has not been undertaken since 2007, it resumed in 2015 in Lithuania, and has continued uninterrupted since the 1990s in Estonia.\n\nThe current defense budget of Latvia is €758 million (2% of GDP). The establishment of the State Defense Service will be financed from the growing funds for defense, which would now reach 2.5% of GDP over the next three years.",
    "48 road deaths in eight months of this year in Latvia": "The results of a survey conducted this year show that nearly a quarter or 24% of drivers say they have undergone risky overtaking maneuvers. The data also show that risky maneuvers are more frequently carried out by young drivers aged 18 to 24. More than half, or 59% of respondents, say they have experienced risky overtaking maneuvers: 43% as car passengers, 4% on an intercity bus, and 12% both in a car and an intercity bus.\n\nWhile 85% of drivers assess their overall level of knowledge in road traffic management as generally good, 61% of drivers say they have violated road traffic rules over the last year.\n\nOf the 48 deaths on state roads this year, 20 were killed in collisions, eight as a result of the car tipping over, one killed in a collision with an animal, four were pedestrians, ten killed in driving into an obstacle, and three into a vehicle standing on the road. One person lost his life driving into a pond, and another died under 'other circumstances'.\n\nPhoto: LVC\n\nThis year, the number of cyclist deathss has fallen: ten cyclists lost their lives on the state roads in 2021, but this year there has been one incident, where a cyclist died after crashing into a parked vehicle.\n\nFirefighters rescued 88 people from cars and removed 28 dead. Last year, 149 people were rescued and 45 dead were removed.\n\nThe State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD) asks residents to stop if they see a road accident, to assess the situation and, if necessary, to call the emergency call number 112 immediately.\n\nThe VUGD has observed that, unfortunately, the tendency to film and photograph accidents is not diminishing. “The sight of spectators gathering at the scene of the accident makes it seem like someone must have called 112. Unfortunately, we occasionally face the situation of eyewitnesses filming, photographing, and commenting on the crash, but no one has thought about informing the rescue services. If there are victims of an accident, the timely lack of assistance may end up tragically. Therefore, it is always important to call 112 immediately. Then it is better to give victims emotional support, not to film and photograph,” said the VUGD representative Jānis Grīnbergs.\n\nLatvia's road are consistently ranked as among the most dangerous in Europe.",
    "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short": "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nTEREHOVA, Latvia — The road carrying a mile-long stream of semi-trucks waiting to enter Russia from Latvia is lined with port-a-potties and dumpsters full of junk-food wrappers and empty caffeinated soda bottles. The wait to get through this border crossing takes around two days.\n\n\"You should have seen this line two months ago,\" recalls Belarusian trucker Dmitri, who sits in the cab of his truck passing the time watching Russian television. \"There were more than a thousand trucks and it took at least seven days to cross into Russia.\"\n\nDmitri, who doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted for his opinions, has been idling here for two days, inching toward the front of the line. The mustachioed man in his 50s says he's transporting a trailer full of beer from Germany to Moscow, and he says because his country has aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has impacted his work and reputation.\n\n\"I've lost work from this and people treat me worse than before,\" he says. \"I was in Lithuania a few days ago trying to eat at a Ukrainian restaurant there, and they wouldn't let me. They kicked me out and told me to get my food from Putin instead.\"\n\nDmitri says he ate at a restaurant across the street, but the incident stuck with him. \"The leaders behind this war aren't suffering from it,\" he says. \"It's us, the regular people, who have to suffer.\"\n\nLatvia, a member of NATO and the European Union, has pushed for a strong global response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's 180-mile border with Russia has become tense as a result. Long lines of trucks at border crossings illustrate the toll economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus have taken, and anxieties among those living along the border are also on the rise.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nSome of those in Latvia are stateless\n\nFarther back in line is Anatoly Chibaterevsky, who's driving 1,000 miles from his home in western Latvia to his brother's funeral in Volgograd, a city in southwest Russia. The 75-year-old has lived in Latvia most of his life. He doesn't say what country he was born in, but explains that his family moved here as part of the Soviet occupation of the country shortly after World War II, and returned after being deported to Siberia for a decade's worth of hard labor in 1949.\n\nWhen Latvia gained independence in 1991, Chibaterevsky was one of tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who were never given Latvian citizenship. He is essentially stateless. He rifles through his suitcase and emerges with his passport, which says \"Latvian noncitizen\" on its burgundy cover.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nHe says he hopes the Russians let him enter. \"They usually let me cross with no problems,\" he says, \"but last time they told me, 'You ran away from Russia, so you're staying in Latvia.'\"\n\nEthnic Russians are a large minority in Latvia\n\nEthnic Russians like Chibaterevsky only make up a quarter of Latvia's population of 2 million, but they're the norm in the towns along the eastern border, where many of them speak Russian and identify with Russia. And up until recently, they got much of their information about the world from Russian TV.\n\n\"Russian channels are now blocked and since Russia has been declared the aggressor, we just follow orders and watch what we're being ordered to watch,\" says Nadezhda Kravchenko, who lives in the Latvian border town of Zilupe.\n\nWhen asked how Russia's war in Ukraine is affecting her, she says Latvia has no power over the situation, that it's none of her business, and then walks away without saying another word.\n\nNearly everyone NPR approached in Zilupe was hesitant to talk about the war.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid to tell you what they really think, but I'm not,\" says Jurijs, a 65-year-old pensioner who says he's not scared to talk about the war, but doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nHe says he watches both Russian and Latvian news and he's decided the Latvian side is propaganda. \"Ukrainians are fascists and the U.S. gives them weapons,\" he complains, repeating talking points from Russian state TV. \"Russia has liberated them, but they continue to plant land mines and bomb kindergartens and hospitals. Why is Ukraine doing this?\"\n\nLatvian authorities are cracking down on public support of Russia, and that's why Jurijs says nobody here wants to openly talk about the war. \"They can put you in jail for that,\" he says. \"But I'm old. Let them put me in jail for supporting Russia. When Russia invades, they'll come and liberate me.\"\n\nSome Russian-speakers seem to be changing their views on the war\n\nA poll taken earlier this year by Latvian research firm SKDS showed only 25% of Latvians who spoke Russian at home sympathize with the Ukrainian side in the war, while 83% of Latvian speakers supported Ukraine. In another poll conducted by the same firm, 36% of Russian-speakers in Latvia believed that Russia was fighting \"Naziism\" in Ukraine, a narrative pushed by Russian state television, while just 6% of Latvian speakers believed the same to be true.\n\n\"What we know from surveys done before the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that a majority of Russian speakers in Latvia actually had favorable views regarding Russia and Putin,\" says SKDS Executive Director Arnis Kaktins. \"The reason for that is quite a large part of this population lived in the Russian information field, and we know it is very specific, distorted propaganda, and inevitably you are going to believe it and start to think the same way.\"\n\nKaktins says the polls his firm have taken since the war began show an increasing number of Russian-speaking Latvians changing their views to a more nuanced and critical stance on Russian state narratives. Kaktins says young Russian-speaking Latvians tend to be the most critical of Russia's government.\n\nA Ukrainian seeks a roundabout route to the Donbas\n\nBack at Latvia's Terehova border crossing, cars inch forward toward Russia. Among them is the Toyota SUV of Natalia Kononenko, who never thought she'd be here. She's Ukrainian, and she's driven nearly 1,000 miles from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, where she's been staying, as her home region of Donetsk in the eastern part of her country is being fought over by Russian and Ukrainian troops. Her son, a young student, is stuck there.\n\n\"There's talk that the Russians will take over the rest of our region and then we'll have to make a decision to be on one or other side,\" she says. \"But until now, no one is forcibly taking us anywhere.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnd that's why Kononenko is on a rescue mission to pull her son out of the Donetsk region. Instead of driving a few hundred miles through the fighting on the front line and risking getting killed, she's driving thousands of miles, circumnavigating Ukraine, so that she can approach Donetsk from Russia, a journey that'll take several days.\n\nShe's praying that the Russian border guards will allow her into the country. \"There shouldn't be a problem, but we don't know,\" she says with a nervous grin. \"We'll just keep on driving and hope for the best.\"\n\nBehind her in the line is Anatoly Chibatersvsky, the Latvian noncitizen who's also hoping to get to the other side. \"There are benefits to being a noncitizen,\" he concedes. \"With my passport I don't have to buy visas for the EU nor for Russia.\"\n\nHe says even his children who are eligible for Latvian citizenship have opted to be like him and remain stateless. In today's world of national allegiance and the wars fought over it, he says being stateless is, in some ways, a relief.",

    "Police in Latvia dismantle major money laundering group": "Latvian State Police has dismantled a criminal group that provided professional money laundering services in the country using a network of more than 90 «money mules».\n\nIn February 2022 Latvian State Police Department of Cyber Crimes commenced criminal proceedings after receiving information from a Latvia-based credit institution that noticed systematic fraudulent payment activity on accounts of some of its clients.\n\nInformation acquired in the investigation indicates that there was a wide network of «money mules» in Riga, which consisted of youngsters aged 16 to 20 years, who received flash payments on their accounts. These payments mostly came from German citizens. Money from those accounts were then rapidly withdrawn in cash. In most cases this was done around midnight.\n\nVictims say that upon finding their accounts emptied usually tried to call off the transactions made during the night on the next day. However, considering that organisers of this criminal group ensured money was immediately taken from the «money mule’s» account, only a small number of victims were able to intercept and recover the stolen money.\n\nData analysis reveals that around 30 such crimes were committed in a single month. According to authorities, this criminal group may have been active in Latvia since September 2019.\n\nLatvian police performed numerous investigation-related activities to put a stop to the criminal group and identify the suspects. In to months efforts resulted with success.\n\nThe investigation revealed the criminal group consisted of 14 members. One of them was a citizen of Germany. This person coordinated the group from Germany. The organiser had recruiters look for «money mules» with bank accounts in Latvia. The group used these people to receive and move illegally acquired money.\n\nMoney withdrawn from «money mules» was then given away in the form of virtual currency.\n\nFollowing directions from organisers, members of the group also distributed acquired money among themselves. Money mules were paid 50 to 250 euros for their services if they participated in activities multiple times. This way the criminal group was able to launder more than EUR 555 600.\n\nIn April 2020 police detained 13 members of this group.\n\nAmong those detained individuals were also the leaders of the criminal group. Both were put under arrest.\n\nThe leader of the group was detained in Germany in May 2022 thanks to a European arrest warrant, which was issued as a result of long international cooperation between law enforcers of different countries. The German citizen was detained and later arrested after a number of several searchers, interrogations and special investigative activities. Germany extradited him to Latvia for criminal prosecution in summer 2022.\n\nIn August 2022 Latvian police handed criminal proceedings to the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organised Crime and Other Branches to commence criminal prosecution.\n\nConsidering the large number of youngsters that agreed to assist the criminal group by becoming «money mules», State Police stresses to society that such actions carry criminal liability.\n\nPeople who agree to become a «money mule» have to keep in mind that they will not only face criminal liability, but will also experience difficulties for the remainder of their lives because banks close down such people’s access to their bank accounts and access to internet banking services.",

They take second place despite having as their Prime Ministerial candidate Aivars Lembergs – a man sent to prison for five years and sanctioned by the United States.\n\nThird place is held by the right-of-center National Alliance (NA) on 7.3%, followed by the relatively new United List (AS) on 5.4%, which is made up of various smaller parties in an alliance that gives them more critical mass. Harmony (S), which describes itself as a social democrat party, is next with 5.1%.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nIn sixth and seventh place are two liberal-oriented parties the Progressives (P) on 4.9% and For Development/For! (A/P!) on 3.6%.\n\nNo other parties make it across the 5%-of-the-vote threshold required to win seats in the Saeima, though several parties are hovering just below that level. Thus anything from 7 to 12 parties might constitute the next Saeima. There are 19 parties contesting the election in all.

They are used for educational and scientific purposes. However, 2 154 people’s remains have been dissected in 100 years of the institute’s history,» says the author of this event and director of RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute, Prof. Māra Pilmane.\n\nShe stresses that dissecting is an important part of medical training: «Every person is unique and individual. Although plastic or digital 3D models are already part of medical education, they cannot convey a full picture of each person’s uniqueness! The word’s leading universities openly admitted at the Congress of International Federation of Associations of Anatomists in 2004 that it is necessary to return to dissecting real bodies during medical students’ training. The number of people who donate their bodies to medicine and science after death is unknown – this information is protected by the law. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest the number is not small,» says Prof. Pilmane.\n\nMemorial event will start off at 10:00 a.m. with a service at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Riga, Slokas Street 34.

From Aminata Savadogo coming second with the jury in the Eurovision 2015 grand final…to fan favourites Triana Park and Samanta Tina coming dead last in their semi-finals in 2017 and 2021, Latvia is a real roller coaster of results.\n\nAnd today we are one step closer to seeing what Fortune has in store this year with the opening of the song submission process for LTV’s Supernova 2023 — its national selection show.\n\nApplications are being accepted until December 1 on the official Supernova website https://supernova.lsm.lv/lv/.\n\nIn a press release, the producers clarified the basic rules.\n\n“Performers, authors and producers who have reached the age of 16 are invited to participate in the competition. Applications from soloists, duets and groups (up to six participants) are welcome. Foreign citizens may participate in the competition as authors of song lyrics, music authors or producers of phonograms. The submitted song must not have been published or played publicly before September 1, 2022.”\n\nA special jury will determine which songs and entries make it to the Supernova broadcasts. This jury will consist of professionals within the Latvian music, events and TV industry, as well as foreign professionals. LTV also reserves the right to invite performers and authors to participate in the competition.\n\nInterestingly, the broadcaster says it will not reveal the names of these jury members until after Eurovision in May “for security reasons.” This is likely to avoid any attempts to influence said jury members before the show and to reduce hostilities and hurt feelings within the industry after the reveal.\n\n“The participants and songs selected for the competition will be available for public evaluation in January 2023. The television shows are expected on the LTV in February 2023.”\n\nAgnese Strause-Kubliņa, Head of Children, Youth and Entertainment Broadcasting at LTV, sang the praises of the country’s most recent entry.\n\n“Supernova is the biggest competition organized by the Television of Latvia (LTV), the winners of which get a ticket to the Eurovision, which is not only a fantastic opportunity and an unforgettable experience for artists, but also a very responsible task of representing Latvia. We are proud of the audience’s recognition this year – the ratings of the Supernova were the best in recent years! The winners – Citi Zeni – allowed everyone to notice Latvia in the Eurovision, but who will be next?! Although there is no specific formula for creating a Eurovision winning song, we wish musicians creative flight and courage in submitting songs to the Supernova contest!”\n\nIn the run-up to Eurovision 2022, Citi Zeni established themselves as darlings of the promo tour, appearing at concert after concert while slaying social media with their unique sense of humour. Their song, which promoted the virtues of the vegan lifestyle, opened with that vulgar line about stimulating the female genitals using the tongue or lips.\n\nWiwiblogger Robyn was able to look past it. As she wrote in our Wiwi Jury review post:\n\n“The unavoidable opening line grabs a lot of attention, but if you look beyond it, Eat Your Salad is a funky bop. It’s reminiscent of Bruno Mars or even the feel-good tunes of Daði Freyr. The song has an environmental message, but it’s not delivered in a heavy-handed way, instead giving listeners something to groove to while they eat their salad and think about their cat.”\n\nAre there any artists you hope to see submit this year?

    "Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania to restrict entry of Russians": "The Baltic countries will almost completely restrict border crossings for Russians who have Schengen visas, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs announced Wednesday.\n\nFollowing a meeting between the eight Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers, Rinkēvičs announced a joint agreement was reached \"in principle\" to restrict entry through Russian and Belarusian borders to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania for Russian citizens with EU Schengen visas.\n\n\"What we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months, is that the number of border crossings by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,\" he said.\n\nThere will be exceptions for Russian citizens crossing the border for humanitarian and family reasons, lorry drivers and diplomats. Details will be announced in the coming days.\n\nFinal decisions will be made at the national level and will come into force at the same time, the foreign minister said. Rinkēvičs added that he expects the measures to apply within the next 10 days.\n\nFinland, which has cut the issuance of tourist visas to Russians to 10 percent of applications, won't restrict all Russians who are traveling on Schengen visas until a decision is made at the EU level.\n\n\"We are also expecting that the Commission ... might make a recommendation on the European level, because unfortunately, Finland and Helsinki airport has become one of the transit routes for people who are then flying to Greece or Spain or Italy,\" Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's very important that on the EU level, we tackle this problem,\" he added.\n\nThe move from the Baltic countries comes a day after the European Commission officially backed a proposal to suspend the EU's 2007 visa agreement with Moscow in retaliation for Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe issue of a ban on Russian visas has caused friction between European capitals. Countries including the Baltics, Finland and the Czech Republic pushed for a full travel ban, as senior officials in Kyiv have demanded; while others led by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz opposed such a step, arguing that it would also stop Russian dissidents and critics of Putin's war from entering the EU.",
    "Religion in Latvia: the Lutherans of Lestene": "The Reformation arrived in Latvia in 1522, bringing with it fanatical vandalism of ornate church interiors deemed as idolatrous. But within a few generations, beauty was once again seen as pleasing to the Almighty.\n\nAnd in this spirit, in 1700, Baron Karl Friedrich von Fircks decided to add a lavish Baroque interior to a modest country church in Lestene, 70 kilometers west of Rīga. To this end, he hired Ventspils woodcarver Nikolass Sefrenss the Younger who spent the next decade creating a timber masterpiece that has no equal in Latvia.\n\nPulpit of Lestene Lutheran church Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nAn elaborate pulpit and a towering 10.5 meter high altar retable were alive with Biblical saints and symbols from nature. The organ decking included moving angels, a three-dimensional show which so impressed worshipping peasants that they are said to have cried out “Ak, svētā Lestene!” (Oh, holy Lestene!) upon seeing it.\n\nSefrenss perished from the plague in 1710, and the job of painting and gilding the objects wasn’t completed for several more decades. Then the church enjoyed two centuries of peaceful splendor.\n\nHowever, in the final months of the Second World War, as western Latvia was ravaged by the battles of the Courland Pocket, the church steeple burned down. The building’s structural integrity was preserved, but the interior faced a mortal threat in the post-war years. Ordered by local communist officials to destroy the priceless artworks, some of the pieces being hidden by the local school principal at her workplace. When she was threatened, they were spirited to the attic of the Academy of Art in Riga, where once again communist functionaries raised their ugly heads.\n\nAnother group of sculptures was taken to another Kurzeme church for safekeeping. But as bad luck would have it, right at that time that refuge was used as a movie set, and the film crew inadvertently destroyed many of the items.\n\nEventually, the administrators of Rundāle Palace had the courage to pick up the pieces which could be saved and deposit them in their vast basement. Which was fortunate, as in the 1960s a granary was installed in the church, erasing what was left of the old grandeur.\n\n“Many cultural monuments in Latvia were being destroyed at the time, and Rundāle was like a lifeboat,” says Inguna Kokina, the lay head of church’s parish council.\n\nIn a sense, she muses, it was good that the local collective farm decided to use the building, as other churches had simply been razed to the ground in officially sanctioned campaigns of atheistic violence.\n\nIndeed, there had been plans to dynamite Lestene’s church, but there weren’t enough explosives to deal with its two-meter-thick walls.\n\nLestene Lutheran church interior Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nInguna’s grandmother worked for the barons before the war, and she herself recalls playing inside the church as a child. And for several decades she has been in the midst of efforts to bring it back to life.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a war cemetery was installed next door to bring together the many scattered graves of Latvian soldiers who died fighting in the Courland Pocket as part of the German-uniformed Latvian Legion. And after that weighty task was completed, Inguna says that a group of activists decided it was a shame to have the church in such a sorry state next to this place of remembrance.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the surviving parts of the pulpit and altar retable were returned to Lestene. Surviving figures from the ensembles have been rejuvenated and missing pieces have been created anew by skilled artisans, based on photographs from the 1930s.\n\nThe craftsmen often work for very modest fees out of their passion for the project. But the cost of materials means it doesn’t come cheap. State culture funds are elusive, Inguna sighs, as the officials in charge have repeatedly said that other sites have priority.\n\nBut the work continues as private donations trickle in. Once the elements now in place have been finished, the mighty organ setting will be brought back from Rundāle, completing the resurrection of this unique monument.\n\nSunday services are held fortnightly by a clergyman who covers a number of rural parishes around Tukums County. On average only about ten worshippers turn up each time (although pre-Covid Christmas events attracted a full house).\n\nAccording to Inguna, this is partly due to the shifting demographics of Lestene. Due to wartime devastation, many locals moved away, and they were replaced by immigrants from Latgale and other parts of the former USSR. Fourteen nationalities reside in the area, and although most are well integrated, there is a lack of historical continuity.\n\nStill, Inguna says that the regular parishioners are a tight-knit group. And the community of supporters of the church stretches around the world.\n\nNeed to know\n\nThe best time to see inside the church is during Sunday services. Services are held every second and fourth Sunday of the month at 12:00.\n\nThere is no direct public transport to Lestene from Riga. It’s a one-hour drive.\n\nThe church welcomes donations for the ongoing restorations.",

They made some repairs and celebrated the New Year in their new home.\n\n\n\nIldar (left) and Zhenya on a walk Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nThe move to Moscow happened spontaneously.

But in the end, we managed to persuade my grandmother to go west.”\n\nThe idea to leave Russia came to Zhenya first in 2014, the year the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia. Zhenya told Ildar, “All your doubts are garbage! Let’s go to Holland,” but Ildar didn’t want to leave then.\n\n“I began to look up information on Georgia on Google—everyone was talking about Georgia,” Ildar recounts. “Visas were not needed. Living was cheap. I could not discuss this with Zhenya; she was in some kind of coma. I now understand that we generally had very little contact then. She sat and read the news on Telegram all day long.” At that moment, Ildar was afraid of a new iron curtain and the mobilization of all men; this was what scared posters on the Telegram channel. And Ildar began to discuss with Zhenya leaving Russia.\n\nIldar did not discuss the war or leaving Russia with his parents. “They live in a village in Bashkiria. And we didn't talk much. When I visited them, Solovyov”—a popular propagandist state TV host—“was on all the time. At the beginning of the war, my mother sent me some playful poems about poor Mother Russia, how the West kept pecking at her. I tried to explain my position to her, and she hung up. Several times I tried to talk to her, but she abruptly turned off her phone. I hadn’t seen this before—we don’t hang up on each other in our family.”\n\nThrough work acquaintances, Ildar and Zhenya learned that they could get a humanitarian visa to stay in Lithuania (Ildar is working on several sociopolitical podcasts). And Zhenya and Ildar decided to go. Ildar changed all their money at an insane rate (he managed to get a little more than €6,000), and agreed with a friend that he could rent their apartment for $250. Ildar also lined up more work for himself. “When I'm worried, I always load up on work. First, it helps not to think. Second, in this way I can calm my fears about money.”\n\nWhile the visas and all the documents for two cats and a dog were being processed, Zhenya went to Noyabrsk to say good-bye to everyone. A week before leaving, Zhenya asked Ildar if he was going to say good-bye to his parents and if he understood that he might not see them for a very long time. So Ildar went: five hours one way and five hours return.\n\n“I called them and said I would come. When I arrived, they were horrified. They thought something terrible had happened, that perhaps I was getting divorced. I said, “But what I told you doesn’t scare you?!”\n\n\n\nIldar, pictured with his cat Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nAs they started talking, Ildar realized that his assumptions had been wrong: “They understand everything. They understand that something bad is happening. They just think that you shouldn‘t raise your head or open your mouth.” His mother told Ildar that she was getting rid of the phones because she was afraid that they would be tapped and that Ildar would talk too much on the phone and would be arrested.\n\nThe family had never talked much about their past, but Ildar remembers some conversations: a great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been dispossessed, possibly even killed. Whether someone in the family was imprisoned Ildar does not know either, but his mother was afraid this might happen, and afraid for Ildar. “I re-posted a lot in the early days [of the war] on my social media. I remember now that I was a little afraid then. I edit various podcasts, and there were audio diaries of people in Ukraine during the bombings. It was already forbidden to say the word “war,” but all these criminal articles about discrediting the army did not yet exist. Of course, my mother was also afraid for me. But we had a good good-bye. We went to the banya with Dad,” says Ildar.\n\nOn April 29, Ildar’s father-in-law came down to Moscow and loaded into the car one suitcase each for Ildar and Zhenya, two electric guitars, two cats and a dog, and a friend who was also going to Riga, and together they made their way to the Russian-Estonian border. He dropped them off at 8 a.m., and with their suitcases, guitars and pets, Ildar and Zhenya tried to cross the border.\n\nThey were turned back. “It turned out that a humanitarian visa was not enough for us. We needed an additional letter saying that we were entering by invitation, an entry permit.” It was Easter Sunday, but Ildar managed to get such a letter, print it out, and cross the border at 8 p.m.\n\nIn Latvia\n\nIldar and Zhenya have been living in Latvia for four months on a Lithuanian humanitarian visa. Ildar works for a podcast studio. Zhenya volunteers at the NGO Helping to Leave and helps Ukrainian families from Mariupol who ended up in Russia get to Europe.\n\nIldar and Zhenya had hoped they could stay in Riga, but recently Latvian officials have begun to say that they would neither provide documents to Russian citizens nor renew existing visas.\n\n“I don’t think about anything and I don’t plan anything. We have until April 2023. I know that Zhenya Googles at night about study visas, about Portugal. And there is even an option in Bulgaria,” says Ildar.\n\nThere is another option that Ildar does not want to think about right now. Zhenya can get a Ukrainian passport because her whole family is from Ukraine. And this means that Ildar can also get a Ukrainian passport. But then they would both have to give up their Russian passports, and they would no longer be able to visit their parents in Russia.\n\nBut with a Ukrainian passport it is easier to get European documents. It would also be possible for Zhenya alone to acquire a Ukrainian passport, and then either Zhenya's documents or Ildar’s could be used, but Ildar does not want this. Nor does Ildar want to return to Russia, or even visit.\n\n“I don't know, I don't understand. It seems to me that no one needs me, and no one is looking for me. But I don't want to check. And I don’t want to think about all this.”\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",
    "Reception center in Latvia is helping and welcoming Ukrainian refugees into the society": "Latvia has received more than 36,000 refugees from Ukraine since February. In March, a one-stop reception center was established in Riga – and on a daily basis, approximately 1,000 persons are visiting the center.\n\nThe purpose of the center is to provide Ukrainian refugees with all services that could be relevant for them, including for example registration for temporary protection, application for housing, enrolment of children in school, and psychosocial support – and all in the same place.\n\nMany NGOs and volunteers are engaged in the center, including Valeria, who herself is a refugee from Ukraine:\n\n“For me, the most important thing is that here people realize that they are not alone and that someone actually needs them. That someone is thinking about them,” says Valeria.\n\nLearn more in this video:\n\nAs of 5 September, the one-stop reception center will be moved to another location in Riga, as to the number of arriving refugees from Ukraine has slowed down, the Riga municipality has informed.\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter",
    "Latvian government to develop more support measures for residents during energy crisis": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima asked the government to develop additional measures to support residents during upcoming heating season and reduce the impact from growing energy prices.\n\nThe Saeima gave the Cabinet of Ministers a month to develop and present appropriate proposals for measures to take in order to overcome the crisis caused by growing energy resource prices.\n\nAdditional support is necessary due to the rapid increase of energy resource prices, especially for natural gas, and the negative effect this has on manufacturing costs across all segments, competitiveness of the national economy and household expenses, as reported by Saeima’s press-service.\n\nThe parliament’s decision also mentions that in order to secure at least partial energy resource price compensation it is necessary to immediately increase state support.\n\nUntil now the planned support to compensate rising heating costs was EUR 350 million, which is now considered insufficient. On top of that, it will reach a small portion of residents, as previously outlined by deputies during a meeting of the government and municipal committees. Representatives of multiple municipal councils also expressed concerns about the upcoming heating season.\n\nThe government has allocated funding from the budget programme for emergencies in order to provide residents of pension age, disabled residents and survivors between 1 November and 31 December.\n\nBenefits will be paid in the following amounts:\n\nEUR 30 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total does not exceed EUR 300 a month;\n\nEUR 20 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 301 to EUR 509 a month;\n\nEUR 10 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 510 to EUR 603.\n\nIf a person receives too much than what is allowed, digits after the comma are left out.\n\nFor example, if the old age pension amount is EUR 300.94, the cents after the comma us left out and the person is paid a benefit of EUR 30 a month.\n\nThe total state benefit payment period is set between 1 November 2022 and 31 May 2023. The funding necessary to afford the payment of state benefits will be clarified in the State Budget Project for 2023 and the Medium-term Budget for 2023, 2024 and 2025 legislative drafts.\n\nThis state benefit will be paid to people living in Latvia who are paid old age, disability or survivor pension, as well as early and advance pension.\n\nThe benefit will be paid to recipients of loss of capacity for work or survivors’ compensation and recipients of state social security benefits.\n\nThe state benefit of EUR 30 will be paid to persons who are recipients of the supplement to the state family allowance for a child with disabilities; persons of legal age who are granted refugee or alternative status in the Republic of Latvia and who are legally residing in the Republic of Latvia with a valid residence permit or temporary residence permit issued by the Republic of Latvia, and who have reached the age specified in the Law on State Pensions.\n\nPayment of state benefits will start in November, as reported by Ministry of Welfare.",
    "OF CLEARCUTS and BIRDS #4": "If left to nature, Latvia would be almost entirely covered by forests. Most Latvian forests are classified as ‘modified natural’ or ‘semi-natural’ forests. These are made up of native tree species, though they may have been thinned or even planted, and have some of the characteristics of undisturbed natural forests.\n\nWhile the total area classified as “forest” has remained stable or has even slightly increased (depending on the data source), the actual tree cover has declined. 86.4% of Latvian forests are primarily managed for timber production, with clearcuts as the main practice in the final “harvest”. This has dire impacts on forests, birds,and biodiversity. Let’s hear the stories of our local colleagues.\n\nA LITTLE BACKGROUND IN LATVIAN FORESTRY\n\nAccording to Global Forest Watch, Latvia is the second European country and the 20th in the world with the highest loss of relative tree cover from 2001 to 2021. Carbon sequestration in forests has been declining due to increasing harvesting levels. Since the 90s, the national forest carbon sinks have been reduced by two-thirds. This has a direct consequence on climate, as carbon sinks from Land Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF) swing to a net carbon source.\n\nThe Baltic region is known as one of the world’s largest outputs of wood pellets. Latvia remains one of the largest producers in the region with an output of around 1.6 million tonnes in 2018 and 2019. The country supplies by itself at least 23% of the Dutch consumption of wood pellets.\n\nSHARE OF PROTECTED FORESTS IN Latvia 2019 (Source):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING VOLUME/YEAR (Source: Source: www.vmd.gov.lv (and for the data before 1996 : Saliņš, Z. 1999. Meža izmantošana Latvijā: vēsture, stāvoklis, perspektīvas. Jelgava: LLU Meža izmantošanas katedra.):\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the harvested forest areas increased by 32% in Latvia in comparison to the period between 2004 and 2015. Viesturs Kerus, CEO at Latvian Ornithological Society (LOB – BirdLife Latvia), analyses: “Some data sources give the impression that the forest cover in Latvia has increased, but one should beware of what is considered as forest. Knowing that clearcut areas are officially counted as forests, we understand why the total forest area seems to continue to increase… In reality, the area of forest that is older than 20 years is steadily declining since at least 2008.”\n\nOnly 7% of forests are strictly protected in Latvia and partial felling restrictions apply to only 6.6%. Viesturs comments: “With only 11.5%, Latvia has the second lowest coverage of Natura 2000 sites in the EU after Denmark. But even within Natura 2000 sites you will be able to find a lot of clearcuts, as is the case for the Nīcgales meži or Forests of Nīcgale. While one of the conservation goals of this area is the protection of forests, it has been heavily logged during the past 20 years. And this is just one example. However, it is worth designating Natura 2000 areas for forest protection because, though not perfect, they still ensure better protection than outside these territories. “Nīcgales meži” is a bad example but there are also good ones.”\n\nWhat’s more, over 80% of the total final felling – logging oriented to harvest mature trees – takes the form of clearcuts in Latvia, rather than selective logging. Viesturs concludes, “despite all the proof that the state of our forests is worrying, the government of Latvia recently decided to lower the limits for the final felling of pine, spruce and birch forests, which are most of the forests in Latvia. They claim that this will ensure there is enough forest biomass for heating during the war of Russia in Ukraine. Allowing to harvest thinner trees means that younger forests will be cut, as there is a strong relation between forests age and trees size. We expect that this decision will increase logging rates and consequently have dire impacts on forest biodiversity.”\n\nTHE PROTECTION OF FOREST BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn 2019, Latvia and Estonia together exported three million tonnes of wood pellet, made from six million m³ of wood. This is equivalent to 200 km² of clearcut or twice the size of Paris. High demand for wood has affected the last remaining old growth forests in Latvia. But these forests play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation.\n\nViesturs explains: “Old-growth forests are unique biodiversity hotspots. Deadwood, large old trees, trees with cavities and other micro-habitats host a variety of species that cannot survive in actively managed forest landscapes, such as the Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) and hundreds of species of moss, fungi, and lichen.”\n\n“In Latvia, habitats listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive (see table) have recently been mapped out. But large parts of them are still not designated as Natura 2000 sites, putting the decision of whether or not to log a site in the hand of forest managers. This results in the destruction of valuable habitats all over Latvia.”\n\nThe EU Habitats Directive:\n\nThe Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora aims to promote the maintenance of biodiversity targeting a list of habitats and species. Annex I includes the natural habitat types of community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation.\n\nSince 2015, LOB maintains a breeding bird monitoring scheme, covering about half of all bird species breeding in Latvia. Viesturs explains: “The Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia) population has decreased by 93% between 2005 and 2018. The Hazel Grouse is a resident forest bird species and is listed in the Annex I of Birds Directive. While this bird has suffered from the most dramatic decline, several other forest bird species, like the Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dryobates minor) or the Willow Tit (Poecile montanus), are also declining.”\n\n“For a set list of species (e.g. Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) and Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus)) the law in Latvia allows the designation of small protected areas (micro reserves) in breeding sites. We actively make use of this option and thanks to our work many micro reserves have already been successfully designated.”\n\n“But there is still a lot of work to be done,” Viesturs concludes. “Besides working on specific sites, we actively advocate for more sustainable forestry across Latvia. To achieve this, we closely collaborate with other environmental NGOs, in particular with the Latvian Fund for Nature and Pasaules Dabas Fonds. Sadly, preserving the status quo is most often the only result of heavy fights with forestry sector, whose only objective is to have even more intensive forestry in Latvia.”\n\nTHE LESSER SPOTTED EAGLE NESTS DESTROYED BY LOGGING\n\nIt is estimated that around a third of the Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) population in Europe, and almost a fifth of its world population, breeds in Latvia.. However, the Lesser Spotted Eagle population decreased by about 15% in Latvia since the end of the 90s, followed by some recovery later. The LIFE Project ‘Conservation arrangements for Lesser Spotted Eagle in Latvia’ was led by the Latvian Fund for Nature (LFN), with the partnership of Latvian Ornithological Society. The conclusions were released in 2021.\n\nOver the course of four years, 543 new Lesser Spotted Eagle nests have been found, of which roughly 10 % have been adversely affected by forestry activities. This includes cases of destruction of nesting sites, including felling of nesting trees, or cases where logging is planned without considering the presence of a Lesser Spotted Eagle.\n\nJānis Ķuze, project manager for Latvian Fund for Nature, clarifies: “Currently only 6% of the Latvian Lesser Spotted Eagle population nests inside Natura 2000 territories. Thereby micro-reserves are the most suitable conservation tool to protect their breeding sites as well as other dispersedly nested bird species in Latvia. The essence of the problem is that there are no mandatory assessments in place to identify the nature values of forests before felling them. They should be put in place like the assessments that exists to identify the economic values of a forest.”\n\nForest stand was logged down during the breeding season of the Lesser Spotted Eagle, which resulted in unsuccessful breeding. By law, it is required to leave the trees with large nests and encircling group of trees in the clear-felled areas although it has a rather limited value. This is illustrated by the aforementioned case, where the nest was left overexposed and was abandoned. Picture taken at the end of the breeding season on 01.09.2018. (Pictures by project LIFE AQPOM, Latvian Fund for Nature)\n\nWhen nests are discovered, protecting them is not easy. “The process of establishing micro-reserves for the protection of nests provoked a sharp reaction from forest owners’ organizations”, details Jānis, “The main objections were that private forest owners do not receive adequate compensation for restrictions on economic activities in micro-reserve territories and they don’t feel sufficiently involved in the establishment process of the reserves.”\n\nWhile the birds are protected on paper, nest trees are still cut every year. Jānis Ķuze concludes, “the data collected during the project on the destroyed nests have been transferred by the Latvian Fund for Nature and the Latvian Ornithological Society to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development and the Ministry of Agriculture. Since no action was taken by the state institutions, the Latvian Fund for Nature has prepared and submitted a complaint to the European Commission regarding the violation of the Birds Directive.”\n\nOF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #1 Intro Finland OF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #2 FINLAND Estonia OF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #3 ESTONIA Latvia\n\n\n\nSTOP\n\nBURNING\n\nFORESTS\n\nJoin the action & contact your MEPs\n\nFOLLOW KARL’S JOURNEY ON THE MAP",
    "Fur farming in Latvia to be banned starting with 2028. Parliament prepares legislative framework": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima passed in the final reading amendments to the Animal Protection Law in order to bank animal farming if the main purpose is collecting their fur. This ban is planned to come into force on 1 January 2028.\n\nThe objective of these amendments is completely banning fur farming in Latvia. Amendments do not apply to acquisition of furs during hunts or trade of furs.\n\nAt first it was planned to impose the ban starting with 2026, but then it was decided to postpone it until 2028.\n\nThe Food and Veterinary Service reports there are four fur farms in Latvia that breed animals specifically for their fur. All three fur farms specialise in mink fur.\n\nThe annotation to the law mentions that animal keeping and killing for fur is unethical, cruel and an outdated form of business that has no justification to exist in modern day. According to authors of amendments, this business pollutes the environment and does not contribute to the national economy.\n\nIt is planned for amendments to prevent the deaths and suffering of those animals, authors of legislative draft say. The preamble to the Animal Protection Law states that\n\n«without a substantiated reason no one is permitted to kill an animal, to cause it pain, create suffering or to otherwise harm it,» which is breached by the practice of breeding and killing of foxes, mink and chinchillas for fur.\n\nAuthors of amendments say that results of sociological surveys indicate that the majority of residents in Latvia are against breeding and killing animals without a justified reason. Many countries have already banned fur farming within their respectable territories.\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by SKDS in 2021, 63% of respondents in Latvia do not approve of breeding and keeping animals for their fur coats. More than 40 000 people signed the online petition addressed to the Saeima in hopes of banning fur farming. More than 50 non-government organisations have also requested this industry to be banned in the country on multiple occasions, politicians say.\n\nAt the same time, authors of amendments stress that the opinion in Latvia reflects the trend in Europe, where many countries have different restrictions in place.\n\nSaeima deputies stress there is reason to believe animal suffering is an unavoidable part of fur farming. Without it, this business would not be profitable. Animal Protection Law states that animal owners have the obligation to ensure the compliance of animal keeping conditions, equipment, food and water with its physiological and ethological needs taking into account the species of the relevant animal, degree of development, adaptation and domestication.\n\nCages, however, do not, for example, allow mink to swim, foxes to dig and socialize, chinchillas – to frolic and leap, Saeima deputies stress.\n\nAnimals kept in cages are subjected to constant suffering even if fur farming is carried out in accordance with Cabinet of Ministers requirements for fur animals’ welfare, authors of amendments stress.\n\nAccording to information from Agricultural Data Centre for 1 July 2020, there were 579 945 animals kept in fur farms in Latvia. This includes 579 320 mink, 443 foxes and 182 chinchillas. This means mink account for 99% of animals kept in fur farms. In the wild, mink cover a distance between 1 and 3 m2. They are solitary, territorial animals that partially live in water.\n\nHowever, Cabinet of Ministers requirements on animal welfare state that mink are permitted to be kept in 30x70x45 cm large cages in close proximity to other mink. Needless to say there is no way for them to frolic, swim or hunt in those cages.\n\nAccording to information provided by Saeima deputies, scientific research indicates that the lack of swimming causes high stress levels and a shortage of food for mink.\n\nThe conditions these animals are kept in are far from their natural habitat, which causes psychological stress and behaviour typical for mink kept in fur farms – pointless repetition of the same actions over and over.\n\nFur farm employees kill mink by putting them in gas cameras and flood them with carbon monoxide or dioxide. For years it’s been known that this method is slow and painful, since mink can hold their breath for long periods of time and have been known to survive even after 10 to 20 minuts of gassing, as mentioned in the annotation to the passed amendments.\n\nIn June 2021 there were eight fur farms registered in Latvia. The tax revenue from PIT, corporate income tax and VAT in 2019 and 2020 was negative. VAT returns exceeded revenue from other taxes, politicians say.",
    "RWE and Latvenergo team up on offshore wind in the Latvian Baltic Sea": "RWE, a global leading renewables player, and Latvenergo, one of the largest power suppliers in the Baltic States, have joined forces to develop, construct and operate offshore wind projects off the Latvian coast. Today, a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the two companies. The equal partnership represents a strong combination of experience and expertise in offshore wind development, efficient project delivery, safe operation and extensive knowledge of the Latvian energy market and power supply in the Baltic States.\n\n\n\nThe powerful partnership has been forged to support the build-out of offshore wind in order to strengthen Latvia’s energy independence. According to the National Energy and Climate Plan, Latvia aims to increase its wind capacity from currently approximately 70 megawatts (MW) to 800 MW by 2030. In addition, the country plans to open the “ELWIND” tender, a 1-gigawatt (GW) cross-border offshore project in collaboration with Estonia.\n\n\n\nLatvian Minister of Economics, Ilze Indriksone, states: “The sea has a special meaning for us, previously we have generally seen it as an environmental resource, a recreational resource and an opportunity to enjoy nature. Today, the meaning has changed, but it is not gone. That is why the involvement of state-owned companies is more than welcome in research, development and in cooperation with international partners. Concluding agreements in research accelerates our goal of reaching energy security and energy independence.”\n\n\n\nMārtiņšČakste, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO of Latvenergo, says: “The Baltic Sea wind off Latvia’s shores is a national treasure with untapped potential. Going forward, this will undoubtedly increase the energy independence of Latvia and neighbouring countries, and will enable the export of electricity to the growing European electricity market. Latvenergo has 80 years of expertise in renewable energy, as demonstrated by our generation portfolio of hydropower plants and onshore wind and solar farm projects. By effectively harnessing the power of both the Daugava River and the sun, as well as Latvia’s onshore and offshore wind, the country will have its own independent electricity in all types of weather conditions and at lower prices.”\n\n\n\nSven Utermöhlen, CEO Offshore Wind of RWE Renewables, says: “Offshore wind is key to meeting the increasing demand for renewable power in Europe, supporting local industries and creating new, future-proof jobs. Together with our partner Latvenergo we are committed to contributing towards delivering Latvia’s offshore wind ambitions – hand in hand with the local communities and supply chain. We bring more than 20 years of experience and technical expertise in the offshore industry to this partnership.”\n\n\n\nPartners have strong expertise along the entire value chain\n\nRWE is a leading global player in renewables and No. 2 worldwide in offshore wind. RWE operates 18 offshore wind farms in five countries – including Kårehamn (48 MW) off the Swedish coast, the Danish offshore wind farm Rødsand 2 (207 MW, RWE share: 20%) and Arkona, with 385 MW one of the largest offshore wind farms in the German Baltic Sea (RWE share: 50%). In addition RWE is well advanced in the development of its 350-MW F.E.W. Baltic II wind farm off the Polish coast and is progressing with the development of the 1.6-GW Södra Victoria project off the Swedish coast. By 2030, RWE intends to grow its offshore wind capacity from currently 3 GW to 8 GW (this capacity represents RWE’s share only). Globally, RWE is driving an offshore wind development pipeline of 10 GW with secured offshore rights. The focus for further growth is on North America, the Asia Pacific region and attractive markets in Europe in particular – including the Baltic States.\n\nFounded in 1939, Latvenergo is engaged in the generation and trade of electricity and thermal energy, and distribution of electricity. The state-owned company is one of the greenest electricity generators in Europe – approximately half of the electricity is generated in three large-scale hydropower plants. They are complemented by modernised combined heat and power plants, where electricity is obtained from natural gas. Latvenergo develops new green wind and solar energy generation capacities and is also a leader in the field of electromobility services.\n\nImages of RWE’s offshore wind farms for media purposes are available in the\n\nRWE media library",

    "GB battle brilliantly but Latvia leave Newcastle with narrow win": "On a raucous night in the north-east, Great Britain pushed an NBA-star-studded Latvia side all the way in another classic encounter at the Vertu Motors Arena, with the visitors heading home with a slender 80-87 win.\n\nWith an incredibly vociferous contingent of Latvian fans making the 1500-mile trip to Newcastle, the atmosphere at the Vertu Motors Arena more closely resembled an away game than it did a home tie, but the hostile atmosphere rallied GB spirits as Nate Reinking’s side came storming out of the blocks to take an 11-6 lead after three minutes.\n\nA burst of points from the field and the free-throw line by Kristaps Porzingis – who ended up with 29 points and 14 rebounds on the night – sparked the Latvians into life and they ended up taking an eight-point lead into the second quarter (16-24).\n\nGreat Britain responded perfectly to the Latvian charge to start the second quarter as they shut the visitors down completely for the first three minutes of the second period to draw themselves back level at 28-28 with four minutes of the half remaining.\n\nMyles Hesson led the way in scoring once again, with a strong all-round performance of 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, but it was an excellent team performance that saw GB take the Latvians to task as Gabe Olaseni, Teddy Okereafor and Luke Nelson all joined Hesson in contributing double-digit scoring numbers, with each player who got on the court contributing multiple buckets.\n\n'A thunderous putback by Porzingis'\n\nThe two sides traded big blows for the remainder of the quarter, but nothing could separate them as both teams returned to the locker room tied at 38.\n\nLeading for much of the third quarter, Great Britain’s much improved performance from the Thursday night outing in Belgium was characterised by a sharp upturn in assist numbers, with the team racking up two dozen dimes in the north-east compared to just nine against Belgium, and it was that dizzying ball movement that saw them keep Latvia honest for much of the third.\n\nA thunderous putback by Porzingis with two minutes to play in the third quarter gave Latvia a four-point lead and GB chased to regain their lead right until the final three minutes of the game, where they were just one point behind the European heavyweights.\n\nBack-to-back buckets from the visitors saw them build up enough of a lead to see out a slender seven-point win and condemn GB to defeat, but this was a top tier outfit that came to Newcastle and Nate Reinking’s side can take a lot from the fact that they pushed Latvia all the way as they look ahead to the next challenge in Milan, where they’ll compete at EuroBasket 2022.\n\nBasketball has the power to change lives.

    "Land of the Giants: Hearts' possession plan to counter Riga FS in Latvia": "Hearts step into Land of the Giants on Wednesday, 24 hours ahead of the Europa Conference League Group A second matchday. Opponents RFS – Rīgas Futbola Skola to use their full title – are a group of physical specimens whose brute strength and intimidating presence helped earn a draw at Fiorentina last week. Enough said.\n\nRFS stage European ties at Skonto’s home ground because their LNK Sporta Parks stadium is too small. It is comparable in standard to Riccarton’s public pitches with small stands and a capacity of just 2,300. Hence RFS moving across the Daugava River to host continental opposition.\n\nPlayers towering well above 6ft tall might struggle getting through the aforementioned tunnel, but thereafter they stride around purposefully in their adopted European arena. RFS are Latvian champions, regulars in UEFA competition and know the territory well. Hearts should be wary.\n\nSign up to our Hearts newsletter Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting...\n\n“They are a very well-organised team,” said the Edinburgh club’s manager, Robbie Neilson. “They switch between a back three and a back four but they have real physicality. Their back three, goalkeeper, centre midfielders and striker are all well over 6ft tall.\n\n“It’s real physical presence, they are good at set-plays and defend very deep. They have a threat in wide areas when they break, so it’s another test for us. It will be different to the Istanbul game because I don’t expect Riga to dominate possession as much as Istanbul do. It’s up to us to keep possession and break them down.”\n\nA 4-0 home defeat by Istanbul Basaksehir just last week provided Neilson and his squad with a rude awakening to the ruthless nature of European group-stage football. RFS won’t show any mercy.\n\nManaged by the former Latvian internationalist Viktors Morozs, they dropped from Champions League to Conference League over the summer. Morozs himself stands 6ft 1in tall and prioritises physicality in his teams, however they can also execute an incisive counter-attack on the ground.\n\nRiga FS carry a physical presence Hearts must be wary of.\n\nBrazilian forward Emerson Santana Deocleciano links well with 6ft 2in Serbian striker Andrej Ilic, a 22-year-old product of Partizan Belgrade’s youth academy, in a 3-4-3 formation. Behind them is where height and physique could overpower more diminutive Jambos like Cammy Devlin, James Forrest and Barrie McKay.\n\nRiga’s first-choice defence comprises Vitalijs Jagodinskis at 6ft 3in, a 30-year-old Latvian internationalist, plus 6ft 4in Elvis Stuglis, who is 29 and also a Latvian internationalist. Then there is the hulking 6ft 6in Slovenian Ziga Lipuscek, who is 25.\n\nBoth wing-backs are 6ft tall – the 25-year-old Latvian internationalist Vladislavs Sorokins and 31-year-old Czech internationalist Petr Maraes.\n\nIn case any of the above are unavailable, two sizeable Latvian caps will deputise. Kaspars Dubra is 31 and 6ft 3in, while Vitalijs Maksimenko is 31 and 6ft 1in. Maksimenko carries experience of British football after playing for Kilmarnock on loan from Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nIn midfield, RFS are anchored by 6ft 4in Serbian internationalist Stefan Panic and 6ft 1in Croatian Tomislav Saric. They are aged 29 and 32 respectively and have been around the European block a few times.\n\nFor appropriate good measure, both goalkeepers are also 6ft 3in – 33-year-old Lithuanian internationalist Vytautas Cerniauskas and 36-year-old Latvian internationalist Pavels Steinbors.\n\nThe two reserve centre-backs, Dubra and Maksimenko, both played on Monday as a much-changed RFS team beat Spartaks 3-0 in the Latvian Virsliga. Clearly Europe is a bigger priority.Riga are eager to prove they are more than sacrificial Pot 4 lambs in this section. Ilic’s goal in Florence was a decent start.\n\n“It was an amazing result,” said Neilson. “They were very disciplined, camped in and hit on the break with the front three. Getting a point was massive for them. There are areas where they look good but there are also areas we feel we can get at.\n\n“At this level, I don’t think there is such a thing as whipping boys. Those teams get whittled out in the qualifiers. Riga have a lot of international players with different countries, they have played about 25 European games since we last played in Europe in 2016.\n\n“They have that experience in their group so we need to be respectful of that. If we play well, we are confident we can take something.”\n\nMost of Riga’s starting line-up picks itself but injuries have prevented Hearts enjoying anything like the same consistency. Craig Halkett and Alan Forrest are injury doubts, Kye Rowles, Liam Boyce and Beni Baningime are out with longer-term issues.\n\n“We have missed consistency of selection at the back, that’s been the problem for us,” admitted Neilson. “I don’t think we’ve gone two games in a row with the same defensive line at any point this season.\n\n“That always makes it difficult but that’s just the way it is at the moment given the injuries we have picked up. Hopefully with guys getting back we will have a bit more consistency in that area.”\n\nThe Basaksehir result should help inexperienced Hearts learn quicker in the European environment. “Yes, massively,” agreed Neilson. “We have spoken about maintaining our discipline in these European games, especially in the middle of the park.\n\n“If you are a bit too open then these good teams just pop the ball round about you. There is a lot of stuff to learn from it.\n\n“It’s part and parcel of football and we have to take it on the chin. We need to keep fighting away. We played against a very good team, the scoreline at the end was disappointing, but we need to realise we are playing at a very high level. It’s one that we need to aspire to.",
    "We regained independence against Gorbachev’s will: Latvian President": "There are people in the West who regard Mikhail Gorbachev, the late last leader of the Soviet Union as a tragic figure of a liberal reformer, whose efforts to liberalise his country unravelled it at the seams.

    "How to spend a weekend in Riga": "In Ratslaukums, Riga’s central square, there is an ugly brutalist building which encapsulates the contested history of Latvia’s beautiful, battered capital. This modernist eyesore was erected in 1970, when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union. It was built as a museum dedicated to Lenin’s crack troops, the Red Latvian Riflemen, who helped him overthrow the Tsar and win the resultant civil war. Without them, the Russian Revolution might have been stillborn.\n\nToday the content of this museum is completely different. The only relic of the Latvian Riflemen is the Soviet statue in the street outside. Now this building houses the Occupation Museum, which tells the story of Latvia’s Nazi and Soviet subjugations: by the Soviets from 1940 to 1941, by the Nazis from 1941 to 1944, and by the Soviets (again) from 1944 to 1991.\n\nIt hardly sounds like a barrel of laughs, but in fact it’s surprisingly uplifting. You’re confronted by a catalogue of totalitarian brutality, but there are also numerous accounts of courage and resistance. And incredibly, against all odds, this is a story with a happy ending. Despite the Communists’ best efforts to subsume them into the Soviet Union, the Latvians retained their sense of nationhood, and then in 1991 something amazing happened: the USSR collapsed, and Latvia regained her independence.\n\nRiga feels like a young city, the capital of a country that’s barely 30 years old (at least in its current incarnation), yet its antique architecture confirms this is an ancient place. It was founded by the Teutonic Knights in the 12th century, and in the cobbled alleys of its medieval old town you get a strong sense of its Germanic roots. But that cluster of gingerbread houses is just a small part of this diverse city. The Art Nouveau district is one of the biggest and best preserved in all of Europe. There are countless architectural styles, and every building has its own backstory: Riga’s European Art Gallery used to be the stock exchange; Riga’s Grand Palace Hotel used to be a bank.\n\nRiga's Grand Palace Hotel was once a bank [iStock]\n\nThe reason Riga is such an exotic mishmash is because Latvia has been conquered and colonised so many times, by Russians, Germans, Swedes and Poles, and every invader has left their mark. The bustling central market is housed in five huge Zeppelin hangers, built by the Germans during the first world war; the Splendid Palace cinema is a flamboyant monument to Latvia’s first period of independence, between the wars; the colossal Academy of Sciences was a postwar ‘present’ from the Soviet Union; shiny new skyscrapers mark Latvia’s liberation at the end of the Cold War.\n\nI first came to Riga in 2011, to cover the 20th anniversary of that liberation. I was astonished by what I found. It was hard to believe this dynamic city had ever been part of the USSR. Barely 20 years before, private enterprise of any sort had been practically illegal. Now the streets were lined with shops and cafés. But the most impressive thing was the people. The Latvians I met were full of ideas, so open and optimistic. Like any city in the Eastern bloc, it had a few rough edges, but for somewhere that had been under the Soviet yoke for nearly 50 years, the rate of progress was remarkable. Riga had endured the worst of times. Now its luck had turned.\n\nThat can-do attitude runs in Riga’s blood. Throughout the Middle Ages it was a leading member of the Hanseatic League, that confederation of northern freeports which looked out towards the wider world. It enjoyed commercial and cultural links with other Hanseatic Ports all around the Baltic. It was a cosmopolitan city, built on maritime trade. Its key players were canny merchants rather than pampered aristocrats. Its busy bars and shopping malls attest to the restorative power of commerce. Even half a century of Russian Communism couldn’t snuff out its mercantile spirit.\n\nRiga used to have a reputation as a stag party destination, but since Latvia joined the euro prices have caught up with western Europe, and most of those revellers have moved on. The nightlife is still lively, but the city no longer feels quite so raucous. And the food is a lot better too. The first few times I came here, the kindest description of the local grub was ‘hearty’. Meat and two veg, meat and two veg… filling and nourishing, but terribly heavy. This time around, I ate the same traditional dishes, all delivered with a much lighter touch. The beer is uniformly excellent, and if you fancy a more unusual tipple, try a shot of Black Balsam, the local liqueur. Last time I sampled it, I thought it tasted like cough mixture, but what do I know?\n\nAnd if the city becomes too hectic, you can always escape to the seaside. The beach resort of Jurmala is less than half an hour away by train (Majori is the main station). Jurmala actually consists of half a dozen different resorts, strung out along a 12-mile strip of silver sand, but they’re all much of a muchness, and despite their different names they merge into each other. It’s easy to walk between them. The architecture is attractive – ornate wooden villas, many of them dating back to Tsarist times – and there are loads of good places to eat and drink.\n\nThe beach resort of Jurmala is less than half an hour from Riga by train [iStock]\n\nThe best thing about Jurmala is there’s no road along the coast. The seashore is flanked by thick forest which runs right up to the beach. Almost all the houses are hidden in the woods. I ate a delicious fish supper at 36 Line, a chic restaurant that looks out across the Baltic. There were children paddling in the shallows. It felt like a peaceful, contented place.\n\nI spent my last night at Villa Joma, a homely hotel a short walk from the seafront. Next morning, I left for Estonia, but that’s another story. The last I saw of Riga was the delicate spire of St Peter’s church, and the squat tower of its cathedral. It’s the same view those Hanseatic sailors would have seen as they sailed in and out of Riga all those years ago, bound for Stockholm, Bremen, Amsterdam, and on to London. For half a century, this extraordinary metropolis was shut away behind the Iron Curtain. It feels like one of the great blessings of my lifetime that it’s an international city once again.\n\nBaltic Holidays is a British travel company with a passion for the Baltic States, a deep knowledge of the region and close connections with the best local guides. Air Baltic fly direct from London Gatwick to Riga, from €49 each way, including taxes.\n\nThe delicate and distinctive spire of St Peter's church [iStock]",
    "Medics: Latvia needs 30 million euros to satisfy strike demands": "Preparations of Latvian Health and Social Care Workers’ Trade Union (LVSADA) for the full-scale strike on 27th and 28th September are almost complete. There are also plans to hold a protest outside the Cabinet of Ministers building together with the strike.\n\n«Despite the warning strike scheduled for 27 September, neither the government nor the Saeima have moved a finger to try to prevent the strike,» the trade union reports.\n\nLVSADA softened demands multiple times. The current demands require the government to provide for a partial completion of the government’s written promise of 7 August 2017 in relation to guaranteed pay for healthcare workers this year.\n\n«One of the main problems for Latvia’s healthcare sector is the shortage of workers, and the main cause of this problem is the abnormally low remuneration.\n\nThe European Commission pointed this out to the Latvian government the Saeima on multiple occasions, as did OECD and the World Bank. When they approved the National Development plan 2021-2027, the Saeima stressed the importance of significantly increasing wages of healthcare workers. However, the government led by Krišjānis Kariņš now pretend they know nothing about that or LVSADA’s strike demands. Completion of demands presented by the trade union will require funding of approximately EUR 30 million. When compared to the government’s emergency expenditures, this is a relatively small amount. This time there is no talk about the money. But what then?» the trade union noted in the statement to the press.\n\nLVSADA chairman Valdis Keris concluded: «Although every year Latvia loses thousands of lives that could have been saved if the country had proper funding of its healthcare sector if it had a sufficient number of workers, the government continues spitefully ignoring the issue. Like it or not, we have to conclude the government seems to want to make Latvia into a well-managed cemetery. The trade union does not share this vision. We will fight for Latvian residents’ right to live!»\n\nThe head of LVSADA strike committee, vice-chairperson Līga Bāriņa adds: «The demands of our strike are clear. The objective of our strike is protecting lives – yours and mine! Without doctors there won’t be a Latvia!»\n\nThe final decision regarding the strike will be made by LVSADA at a meeting of the council on 20 September.",

One person was in the 60-69 years age group, one in the 70-79 years age group, one in the 80-89 years age group, and one person was in the 90-99 years age group. All were either non-vaccinated or had not completed their vaccination course at the time of infection.\n\nSPKC reports that some than six months have passed since the majority of Latvia’s residents have had their initial jabs.

The reason is because this information is usually reported with a delay. SPKC mainly receives data from hospitals and nursing homes. There is also the issue of Covid-19 being reported as a side-factor in people’s deaths.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic Covid-19 has been confirmed in 913 371 cases.\n\nAccording to information from LETA, a total of 7 467 people were infected with Covid-19 in the last seven days.",
    "Who’s a Latvian and why? A complex question just got harder.": "“To have a strong society ... you should have a common history,” says pollster Arnis Kaktins. “We don’t have that.”\n\nOne focus of discord was the Victory Memorial in the capital, Riga, commemorating the Soviet soldiers who died freeing Latvia from the Nazis. But most Latvians remember better the Soviets’ own 50-year occupation of their land. Last week the authorities toppled the monument, calling it a catalyst for polarization.\n\nRussian Latvians may not be numerous, but they wield potential influence. Most of them are neutral on the Ukraine war, or support Kyiv, but others could cause trouble, officials fear.\n\nThe government is cracking down on the small minority of ethnic Russians who support President Vladimir Putin, and just when dialogue would seem more important than ever, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion of the identity issue, says Deniss Hanovs, a professor of cultural history.\n\nLatvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nAs they distanced themselves from memories of Soviet occupation, the puzzle seemed to be growing less fraught. But Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has brought old divisions to the surface.\n\nSince Latvia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, its citizens – a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians – have been wrestling to define their identities.\n\nThe nature of Alice Zvezda’s identity is as challenging to juggle as the infant she’s pushing around a Riga park.\n\n“My husband is Latvian and I am Russian. So I am like, both. I feel myself both,” says Ms. Zvezda as she rocks her baby stroller cradling a next-generation Russian Latvian.\n\nThat kind of dual identity had been growing easier to navigate as Latvians distanced themselves from memories of their country’s 50-year occupation by the Soviet Union that ended in the early 1990s.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Transformation Latvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nBut it suddenly got harder last February, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the Latvian government began arming itself with words and weapons: It is reinstituting the military draft, excising Russian language from public schools, banning Russian state media from the airwaves, and dismantling Soviet-era memorials.\n\nThe vast majority of Latvians — including a quarter of the country’s Russian speakers —are solidly against the war in Ukraine, but a small and significant segment of the Russian diaspora sympathizes with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Once tolerant of such citizens, the Latvian government is now trying to crack down on their way of thinking, just when Latvian society was making some progress toward inclusion of its multitude of ethnic identities.\n\nIt would seem that dialogue over Latvian identity, a complex construct of language, culture, and nationality, is needed more than ever. But since the war began, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion, says Deniss Hanovs, a Russian Latvian cultural history professor at Riga Stradiņš University.\n\n“The history of Latvia has been so very bloody and full of conflict and tragedy that most people stick to ethnic identity” when they define themselves, says Dr. Hanovs. “But we need to go beyond ethnic identity. One needs to be a citizen. The notion of [a] political nation is the only future for a multiethnic culture in Europe.”\n\nKaren Norris/Staff\n\nA complicated dance\n\nBut that’s a complicated dance today for a society that’s roughly a quarter ethnic Russian. “The younger generation [of ethnic Russians and Latvians] is making families together and we do not have conflict,” explains Ms. Zvezda. “We were hoping when the generations change and the politicians are our age, it will be totally fine – love and understanding. But no, now war came. And it’s splitting the community.”\n\nAbout 150,000 Russian-speaking Latvians sympathize with Russia on the war, polls have found. “That’s a lot for small Latvia,” says Ieva Bērziņa, a researcher on Russian strategy at the National Defense Academy of Latvia.\n\nAnd it leaves open the possibility that the Kremlin might destabilize Latvia using the Russian diaspora. Reaching out to this population through a common language, religion, and historical memory offers Russia an “unparalleled soft power influence to further foreign policies abroad,” in the words of a 2021 report by researchers at the London School of Economics.\n\nDr. Bērziņa found in a 2016 study that Russian influence in Latvia could be “quite huge ... when it comes to war and real-life situations that can catalyze differences within society,” she says. “When it goes out onto the street it’s a huge problem.”\n\nOne of those potential catalysts was the Victory Memorial in Riga, where ethnic Russians congregated every May 9 to celebrate the Soviet Army’s victory over Nazi Germany. (The Soviets liberated Latvia from the Germans but ushered in their own five-decade-long occupation of the country.)\n\nThe authorities last week toppled the main obelisk, saying it risked “polarizing society,” and removed other structures from the memorial complex, in line with the wishes of roughly 75% of Latvian speakers, but against those of the same proportion of Russian speakers, according to a poll by the Latvian polling firm SKDS. It’s a stark divide.\n\n“The monument means different things for Latvians and Russians,” explains Dr. Bērziņa. “For Latvians it’s a symbol of [Soviet] occupation and pain, and for Russian speakers it’s primarily a commemoration of their ancestors who fought against Nazi Germany.”\n\nThis lack of a shared understanding of history hinders progress toward a harmonious Latvian society, says pollster Arnis Kaktins, SKDS’s executive director.\n\n“To have a strong society, one of the pillars is that you should have a common history, and we don’t have that,” he says. “We have two different histories regarding the Second World War – with different beliefs around whether Russia occupied us, or whether they liberated us from the evil fascists.”\n\nLenora Chu Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks poses in his office building in Riga Aug. 2, 2022. Mr. Pabriks says that ethnic Russians who long for the Soviet era's glory days must \"change their way of thinking.\"\n\nUsing Pushkin as a weapon\n\nBut minds are changing, nonetheless. Half of Russian speakers tell pollsters they sympathize with neither Russia nor Ukraine in the war. This group appears to be in transition away from traditional loyalties, says Mr. Kaktins.\n\n“They are confused; they are shocked; they need more time to talk, to understand, and to process what’s actually happening,” he says. “If suddenly something happens which contradicts your worldview of Russia as beautiful and good, you don’t automatically change it in two hours. It is a very slow, gradual process. It takes a long time.”\n\nUntil the Ukraine war began, adds Dr. Hanovs, the Russian Latvian cultural history professor, ethnic Russians had seen their former homeland’s history in a heroic light, symbolized by musicians and poets such as Peter Tchaikovsky and Aleksandr Pushkin. They never associated their culture with evil.\n\n“Now, starting from February, this is part of my own [Russian] identity,” Dr. Hanovs says, explaining that President Putin invaded Ukraine in the name of Russia’s glorious past. “It’s not only Tchaikovsky and Pushkin, but also ‘Pushkin can be used to kill people in Ukraine,’” he says.\n\nLatvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, is losing patience. He is in charge of reinstituting military conscription by 2023, and he insists that Putin supporters must understand that the glory days of the Soviet Union are over.\n\n“How can you tolerate in your country people who are saying, ‘We’re against Parliament and against democracy and against freedom’?” asks Mr. Pabriks during an interview in Riga. “We cannot simply say, ‘Oh yes, you are against an independent Latvia but you’re welcome to walk around.’”\n\nThat hardening attitude indicates how difficult it could be to integrate Latvia without alienating those on the fringes, and without suppressing Russian culture and language.\n\nThe sizable group of Russian speakers who declare themselves patriotic citizens of Latvia might show the way, if the government takes a nuanced approach.\n\n“I hope the Latvian political elite will manage to differentiate between those who are part of Latvia and those who still exist in the past,” Dr. Hanovs says. And some observers believe that the war might actually speed up convergence on a national Latvian identity, as Russians are forced to confront hard facts about their former motherland.\n\nMs. Zvezda, the young Russian Latvian mother living in Riga, harbors more modest hopes – that the growing difficulties of everyday life will push larger questions of war and peace and ethnic identity aside.\n\nGet stories that\n\nempower and uplift daily.

We must step up our support to Ukraine until it wins!\" Karins said on Twitter.\n\nAs reported, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) has urged the international community to supply more weapons to Ukraine so it can liberate its territories occupied by Russia.\n\n\"Apparently #Russia is moving ahead with organising fake referenda in the occupied territories of #Ukraine, international community must reject this move, more sanctions must follow and Ukraine must get more weapons to liberate its territory, we must say no to Russian blackmail,\" the Latvian minister tweeted.\n\nMoscow-held regions of Ukraine will vote September 23-27 on annexation by Russia, separatist officials said Tuesday, as Kyiv's troops wrest back territory captured by Moscow's forces.\n\nSeparatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, said they would hold the vote over five days beginning Friday this week and ending on Tuesday.\n\nKyiv said the \"sham\" votes were meaningless and vowed to \"eliminate\" threats posed by Russia, saying its forces would keep retaking territory regardless of what Moscow or its proxies announced.",
    "Latvia and Denmark discuss diplomatic matters": "According to the account of the Latvian MFA: \"The officials discussed bilateral relations between Latvia and Denmark, regional cooperation, security situation in the region and other international developments. The Ministers condemned Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, which has irreversibly changed the security climate all across Europe. The Latvian Foreign Minister greatly appreciated Denmark’s significant contribution to NATO’s defence and deterrence efforts, which bolster security in the Baltic region and the Alliance as a whole. The Danish Foreign Minister confirmed that Denmark would continue providing its contribution to security in the region.\"\n\n\"The Ministers were in agreement that military, economic and political support for Ukraine should continue, especially with the winter period ahead. At the same time, it is essential to achieve that Russia is held accountable for its aggression and war crimes in Ukraine. Other matters discussed were related to issuing of Schengen visas to Russian citizens, and the Ministers recognised that there was a need for introducing stricter measures.\"\n\nWhile in Latvia, the Danish Foreign Minister and Members of Parliament met with members of the Saeima (Latvian Parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as visiting the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence and the Ādaži Military Base, where Danish soldiers are stationed and unveiled the Danish photographer Martin Thaulow’s outdoor exhibition, “Brothers and Sisters”, arranged by the Danish Culture Centre and featuring Ukrainian refugees in the Baltic States and Poland.",

    "Successful tourism season this year in Latvia": "In July, the number of foreign tourists in Latvia doubled, compared with a year earlier, according to the Central Statistical Bureau data. The most popular destination is Rīga, which has been visited by nearly 60% of foreign tourists entering Latvia. A total of 16% of tourists have visited Jūrmala, followed by Liepāja, Sigulda, and Ventspils. Most tourists arrived in Latvia from Lithuania and Estonia, followed by Finland and Poland, while the number of tourists coming from Russia is decreasing.\n\nRiga Investment and Tourism Agency representative Ieva Lasmane said that after the war began, a large proportion of tourist group bookings were canceled. Around 60 to 70% of the pre-pandemic number of tourists were served in the capital. Not all hotels resumed work in Rīga this summer.\n\n“Firstly, Mogotel, they have a lot of hotels. In order not to compete with their own hotels, they can choose not to open for a moment. This is not only influenced by the number of tourists, but also by the lack of staff. Tourists from Russia still show up in statistics, which certainly cannot be compared to 2018 or 2019, when the total number of Russian tourists was close to 200,000 per year. On the overall background, however, it has previously been around 10-13%. It is clear that it is very difficult to replace such a large mass at once, but we have invested more resources in the German market, which is a big market. We have a lot of direct flights to different German cities, so it is very easy to get to Rīga. The second of these larger markets is Britain, which has been growing steadily all these years, also with very good airlines and, of course, our close Nordic countries, Scandinavia,” said Lasmane.\n\nMost Russian tourists have been resting in the resort town of Jūrmala until now. In September this year, the Cabinet decided that the entry of citizens of the Russian Federation to Latvia for tourism and recreational purposes was limited. Madara Zahare, the senior expert in the tourism and business department of Jūrmala, said that the largest number of Russian tourists - a quarter of the total number of tourists - visited Jūrmala in 2019, but already last year their number decreased significantly - to 2%, and this year they represent 3% of the total number of tourists.\n\n“It should be noted that Russian citizens have purchased property in Jurmala, as well as when traveling, they tend to stay at relatives, friends, apartments or private apartments that do not provide data to the CSP. Consequently, we assume that, in fact, this number may be higher than that shown by the specific data. The first half of this year, in general, has been more vivid in terms of the number of foreign tourists than, for example, last year, and we have also received feedback from the major hotels in Jurmala for this summer season, that, compared to the previous 2 years, it has been all very good and pleasant, and there were no restrictions,” said Zahare.\n\nSanta Graikste, executive director of the Latvian Association of Hotels and Restaurants, said that there is uncertainty about how tourism will be affected by the high energy prices. Currently, last-minute hotel bookings are carried out by even tourists from Germany who usually did this for 3 or 4 months before the trip.\n\n“For the most successful time in the season, we can talk about July, August, when really the season was what it should be, and some even reported historically best results. Bookings are coming for October, but it is hard to say about November and December because these bookings are made very shortly before. Therefore, it would also be important that with support of the state institutions and industry, there would be the return of major international events, conferences, seminars in Latvia,” said Graikste.\n\nIn the 7 months of this year, 1.2 million foreign and local tourists were served in Latvian tourist accommodation, which is 85% more than during the corresponding period last year but is still nearly 30% less than in 2019.",
    "Universities in Latvia worried about rapidly growing payments for energy resources": "Over the course of next two years the payments for energy resources of many universities in Latvia will have tripled. This is why support from the state is needed, as mentioned in the letter sent by Latvian Association of Universities (LUA) to highest ranking officials and ministries in Latvia.\n\nAccording to principal of Riga Stradins University (RSU), LUA board chairman Aigars Pētersons, in 2023 his university’s costs for heating energy and electricity will be 346% higher when compared to 2021. For Riga Technical University the increase is estimated at 306%.\n\nFor the University of Latvia, excluding institutions under its subordination and supervision and capital associations, the increase of electricity and heating energy costs at the most optimistic scenario is expected to reach 299%, for Daugavpils University it will be 300%, for Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies and Liepaja University it will be 266%.\n\nIncreasing costs present a very serious influence on budgets of universities in Latvia, stressed Pētersons.\n\nUniversities turned to ministries for assistance, but the responses they received were with rejections.\n\nBecause of this they decided to send letters to the president and prime minister.\n\nEducation institutions report having plans to implement energy austerity measures. However, the volume of finances saved from these measures will not match the rise of energy resource prices. It is not expected to secure complete coverage of related costs. LUA also mentions the growing influence of inflation and the residual negative influence left on the quality of the education process by Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLUA requests adding state-founded universities on the list of recipients of state support to help compensate growing costs and overcome the crisis.",

    "Latvia ships more military and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians": "The assistance includes warm tactical clothing, shoes, and equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. Credit: Military journalist Taras Gren/Ministry of Defense of Ukraine/Flickr (Creative Commons).\n\nThe Latvian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced the delivery of additional military and humanitarian assistance to support Ukrainians.\n\nDefence Ministry parliamentary secretary Baiba Bļodniece and international military-religious cooperation senior expert Elmārs Pļaviņš handed over the aid package to the relevant authorities during their visit to Ukraine.\n\nThe package comprised donations from Latvian companies, citizens, and ‘Entrepreneurs for Peace’ movements, as well as the country’s armed forces.\n\nThe latest assistance includes warm tactical clothing, shoes, and equipment for soldiers, SUVs, and military equipment.\n\nPļaviņš said the vehicles delivered to Ukraine will support the Ukrainian Armed Forces and National Guard units.\n\nThe country also shipped cars to be used by state bodies to enable the transportation of foreign aid to necessary places.\n\nIn collaboration with the ‘Entrepreneurs for Peace’, the Latvian MoD is collecting donations worth over €7m.\n\nThe package will include military vehicles, body armours, armoured ambulances, binoculars, and night vision equipment, among others, for the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nSince 24 February, Latvia has delivered over €300m of military aid.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson also pledged additional military and civilian assistance worth $93.59m (Skr1bn) to Ukraine.\n\nThe military aid, valued at $46.75m (Skr500mn), will reportedly include anti-tank weapons, personal protective equipment, and mine clearance equipment.\n\nOn the war front, a US Department of Defense (DoD) senior official revealed that Russia is focusing on ‘increasing the size of its military by 137,000 to 1.15m’.\n\nThe official said: “This effort is unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel and strength targets.”\n\n“Any additional personnel that Russia actually can muster by the end of the year, in fact, may not increase overall Russian combat power.”",
    "Evjen Claims Maiden EuroRX Victory In Thrilling Final In Latvia": "Norway’s Sondre Evjen took his first every victory in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in a very exciting round 4 at the Ferratum World RX of Riga-Latvia, beating current championship leader Anton Marklund to the line by less than half a second.\n\nIn the final twist in a changeable weekend at the Biķernieki circuit in Riga, the final took place in wet conditions. Evjen – who had been in fourth place in the overnight standings, quietly getting on with his own race weekend and staying out of drama – managed to get the power down on the incredibly slippery asphalt, heading into turn one level pegging with Marklund. Both drivers leaned heavily on each other, trying to get their cars turned in, but it was the JC Raceteknik machine of Evjen who made it out of the first two turns in the lead.\n\nMarklund opted to dive into his joker lap to try and get clear air, allowing him to push hard and get an advantage on Evjen. Indeed, it looked like everything had gone swimmingly for the SET Promotion driver, who swung round Evjen at the next joker merge. However, Marklund drifted slightly too wide into a wet patch of track, span his wheels, desperate for traction, and Evjen pounced. His Audi S1 looked so poised and controlled as the Norwegian nailed his foot to the floor, and regained the lead. Evjen’s usual millimetric precision slipped a couple of times on the final lap, not helped my Marklund giving him a friendly nudge on the final run round the hairpin, but he managed to hold on to take his maiden and a very popular event win. Marklund came home second, and the overnight leader Enzo Ide brought home his Audi S1 less than a second behind the leader – a thrilling end to a fabulous weekend of motorsport.\n\nDespite doing everything right, Baumanis failed to make the final at his home even due to turbo issues. Credit: @World / Red Bull Content Pool\n\nMarklund probably won’t be too upset with second place, however, as his main rival, #YellowSquad driver Janis Baumanis continues his run as potentially the unluckiest man in rallycross. The Latvian favourite looked all set to challenge for the win. He was doing pretty much everything right, sitting third in the overnight standings. Indeed, Baumanis took charge of his semi-final, leading from eventual winner Evjen to the audible delight of the home fans. However, on lap three, disaster struck: turbo issues dropped him down the order, out of contention, and out of the running for the final.\n\nThis means that, despite his best efforts, Baumanis now lies 26 points adrift of Marklund with only two rounds to go. The season is now Marklund’s to lose. The question now becomes: can Baumanis hold on to second place? Evjen is only two points behind him, and Ide only 7. Both drivers are hungry for more and will be pushing at every available opportunity.\n\nMarklund could feasibly wrap up the championship with a round to spare when the EuroRX moves on to the next venue, the ever popular Montalegre in Portugal, in two weeks time."
