    "Chile: Improve productivity, social protection and boost revenues for a sustainable recovery, says OECD": "23/09/2022 - Chile has achieved an impressive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, but the pandemic has hampered past progress in reducing poverty and social disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile needs structural reforms to boost productivity, social protection and tax revenues, while tackling short-term challenges such as high inflation, according to a new OECD report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest OECD Economic Survey of Chile welcomes progress on significant reforms including a universal basic pension and plans for a fairer tax system which can generate higher revenues. Measures to drive higher productivity, improve competitiveness, get more Chileans into quality jobs and to improve social protection coverage should also be a priority, the Survey says.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Chile is taking important steps towards strengthening its tax base and is closing gaps in social protection,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said, presenting the Survey in Santiago alongside Minister of Finance Mario Marcel. “Complementary reforms to raise productivity and investment would help to generate stronger growth, more jobs and deliver additional income to enable Chile to invest further in economic and social progress.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s solid institutions and prudent management of public finances enabled a strong fiscal response to the pandemic and a vigorous recovery. The Chilean economy grew by 11.9% in 2021, far outpacing OECD and regional peers. The Survey projects growth slowing to 1.9% in 2022 as global growth slows and inflation, now at a 30-year high, curtails purchasing power. Thanks to a swift monetary policy response, inflation should return to target in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s tax revenues at just 21% of GDP are very low by international standards, with close to a third of the workforce in informal jobs with only a fifth of Chileans paying personal income tax. The Survey welcomes a planned reform which would bring the tax intake closer to the Latin American and OECD averages of 28% and 34% respectively. Greater tax revenues would help strengthen the resilience of public finances and importantly help finance rising social needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s longer-term growth outlook will depend on its ability to address structural growth bottlenecks including weak competition and low investment in research and development to promote innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many years of convergence, Chile’s income and productivity gap to advanced economies is again widening. The Survey recommends simplifying cumbersome regulations and licensing procedures which hold back new firm entry and investment, increasing investment in new technologies and expanding access to high-quality education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scope to diversify Chile’s exports, still dominated by the mining industry, and to improve trade facilitation and the efficiency of border procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile has one of Latin America’s most comprehensive social protection systems, but the pandemic highlighted gaps in coverage, particularly for informal workers. Enhancing social protection coverage for all, including via pensions, access to health services and basic income support, can help to reduce these gaps. The Survey recommends raising pension levels while applying progressive contribution rates and unifying social assistance programmes to achieve a wider coverage. Future social benefit reforms should also pay particular attention to how they affect the incentives for creating formal jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile is making significant progress on sustainable energy, with renewable sources now accounting for 47% of electricity generation as solar and wind energy have gained importance. Looking ahead, Chile has a much higher potential in renewable energy generation, far exceeding domestic needs.\n\nSee an overview of the Survey with key findings, charts and summaries in English and Spanish (this link can be included in media articles)\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 80 97).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.",
    "‘It’s a miracle’: Gran Abuelo in Chile could be world’s oldest living tree": "In a secluded valley in southern Chile, a lone alerce tree stands above the canopy of an ancient forest.\n\nGreen shoots sprout from the crevices in its thick, dark trunks, huddled like the pipes of a great cathedral organ, and water streams down its lichen-streaked bark on to the forest floor from bulbous knots in the wood.\n\n“It was like a waterfall of green, a great presence before me,” remembers the climate scientist Jonathan Barichivich, 41, of the first time he encountered the Gran Abuelo, or “great-grandfather”, tree as a child.\n\nBarichivich grew up in Alerce Costero national park, 500 miles (800km) south of the capital, Santiago. It is home to hundreds of alerces, Fitzroya cupressoides, slow-growing conifers native to the cold, wet valleys of the southern Andes.\n\n“I never thought about how old the Gran Abuelo could be,” he said. “Records don’t really interest me.” However, Barichivich’s groundbreaking study has shown the 100ft (30-metre) giant could be the world’s oldest living tree.\n\nIn January 2020, he visited the Gran Abuelo with his mentor and friend, the dendrochronologist Antonio Lara, to take a core sample from the trunk.\n\nThey were able to reach only 40% into the tree as its centre is likely to be rotten, making a complete core unattainable. Yet that sample yielded a finding of about 2,400 years.\n\nUndeterred, Barichivich set about devising a model that could estimate the Gran Abuelo’s age. Taking the known ages of other alerces in the forest and factoring in climate and natural variation, he calibrated a model that simulated a range of possible ages, producing an astounding estimate of 5,484 years old.\n\nThat would make it more than six centuries senior to Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in eastern California recognised as the world’s oldest non-clonal tree – a plant that does not share a common root system. Some clonal trees live longer, such as Sweden’s Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce thought to be 9,558 years old.\n\nBarichivich takes a core sample from a tree stump. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez\n\nBarichivich believes there is an 80% chance the tree has lived for more than 5,000 years – but some colleagues have poured scorn on the findings. They assert that complete, countable tree ring cores are the only true way of determining age.\n\nThe climate scientist hopes to publish his research early next year. He will continue to refine his model but waves away the “colonialism” present in the field.\n\nThe Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future Jonathan Barichivich\n\n“Some colleagues are sceptical and cannot understand why we have revealed the finding before formally publishing it,” he said. “But this is post-normal science. We have very little time to act – we cannot wait one or two years, it could already be too late.”\n\nBarichivich believes ancient trees may help experts understand how forests interact with the climate.\n\n“The Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future,” he said. “We have a 5,000-year record of life in this tree alone, and we can see the response of an ancient being to the changes we have made to the planet.”\n\nIn January, Barichivich, who works at the Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Environment in Paris, won a €1.5m European Research Council starting grant he describes as the “holy grail” for a scientist.\n\n\n\nHe has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon, hoping to add tree-ring data from thousands of sites around the world into climate simulations for the first time.\n\n\n\nMore than a third of the planet’s vegetated surface is covered by forests, capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but current models are only able to make estimates for 20 or 30 years into the future.\n\n\n\nBy adding data for xylogenesis, the formation of wood, Barichivich believes he could provide 100-year predictions for climate change – and revolutionise our ability to understand and mitigate its effects.\n\n“If tree rings are a book, then for 40 years everyone’s just been looking at the cover,” he said.\n\n‘Bit by bit, the tree is dying’\n\nBarichivich poses with Gran Abuelo. The climate scientist has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez/the Guardian\n\nIn an office surrounded by varnished samples, fragile cores and wood shavings, Barichivich’s mentor Antonio Lara, 66, has spent his career working to reconstruct temperature, precipitation and watershed levels throughout history.\n\n\n\nLara, a professor at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Natural Resources at Chile’s Austral University in the southern city of Valdivia, has been able to prove that alerces can absorb carbon from the atmosphere and trap it for between 1,500 and 2,000 years in standing dead trees. Buried alerce trunks can hold carbon for more than 4,000 years.\n\nHe has also pinpointed exact climatic events by translating tree rings into numbers, which can then be read like a barcode. “The great-grandfather tree is a miracle for three reasons – that it grew, that it survived, and then that it was found by Jonathan’s grandfather,” Lara said.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Barichivich’s grandfather, Aníbal Henríquez, arrived from the southern city of Lautaro to work for the forestry companies felling the lahuan, as the alerces are known in the Indigenous language Mapudungun, his native tongue.\n\nHe went on to become the park’s first warden, but many giant alerce trees had already fallen victim to loggers before Chile made it illegal to cut them down in 1976.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s and the wood was commonly used in construction. The famous Unesco-protected wooden churches on the island of Chiloé are built from alerce trunks.\n\n\n\nHenríquez happened upon Gran Abuelo while out on a patrol in the early 1970s. Although he was reluctant to disclose the find at first, word soon got out and people began to arrive: now, more than 10,000 tourists trek down to the small wooden viewing platform next to the tree each summer.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Photograph: Krystyna Szulecka Photography/Alamy\n\nOther alerces in the valley fell victim to loggers or forest fires, leaving the gnarled tree standing alone. “Bit by bit, the tree is dying,” said Marcelo Delgado, Barichivich’s cousin who works in the park as one of five full-time rangers. “People jump down from the platform to peel off bark to take as a souvenir.”\n\n\n\nFootfall around the base of the tree has also damaged the thin layer of bark on its roots, affecting nutrient uptake. After 29 other trees were vandalised by tourists, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which manages the country’s national parks, closed the trail indefinitely.\n\n\n\nBarichivich hopes that by showing that Gran Abuelo is the world’s oldest tree, he could raise the alarm about the urgency with which we must protect the natural world. While the scope of his research is far broader, Barichivich insists the national park in which he grew up is where he belongs.\n\n\n\nWhen he was eight years old, his grandfather disappeared on a routine patrol out in the snow. His body was found two days later. Another uncle, also a park ranger, later died in the park.\n\n\n\n“It seems like it’s a family tradition,” Barichivich said. “The same fate probably awaits me, dying with my boots on out in the forest. But first I want to unlock its secrets.”",

    "Lewis Hamilton’s X44 inherits Chile Extreme E victory": "The most remote X Prix so far\n\nFinally, following Covid-related event cancellations last year, Extreme E made its South American debut last week, as its ten teams tackled a short three-kilometre course in the Atacama desert, said to be the most remote and extreme setting used by the series so far.\n\nRXR began the weekend with a 31-point advantage at the top of the standings, which meant a second title was within range. Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinksy and four-time World Rallycross king Johan Kristoffersson got their Chile weekend off to a strong start by topping qualifying and, although they were second in the heat, they won their semi-final. Loeb and Gutiérréz won their semi too, seemingly ensuring the title protagonists would face off as usual in the final. But disaster struck for Rosberg, when a software glitch meant RXR missed the deadline to make the grid for the climax – the first time in two seasons that the inaugural champion team hadn’t raced in the final.\n\nThat meant Chip Ganassi Racing made a surprise last-minute appearance as first reserve, joining Acciona Sainz and Abt Cupra – plus McLaren which had qualified by winning the so-called (and as it turned out suitably-named) ‘Crazy Race’.",
    "‘My Imaginary Country’ Review: Chile in Revolt": "The most powerful images in “My Imaginary Country” are of the demonstrations in the streets of Santiago, Chile, that began in October 2019. Hundreds of thousands of Chileans took to the streets, at first to protest a subway fare increase, and eventually to demand sweeping changes to the nation’s economic and political order. They were met with tear gas, baton charges and plastic bullets aimed at their eyes. Some fought back with cobblestones chiseled from the street, which they hurled at the police.\n\nTo watch scenes like that in a documentary film — or, for that matter, on social media — is to experience a strong sense of déjà vu. What happened in Santiago in 2019 and 2020 feels like an echo of similar uprisings around the world; in Tehran in 2009 (and again this week); in Arab capitals like Tunis, Damascus and Cairo in 2011; in Kyiv in 2014; in Paris at the height of the Yellow Vest movement in 2018. Those episodes aren’t identical, but each represents the eruption of long-simmering dissatisfaction with a status quo that seems stubbornly indifferent to the grievances of the people.\n\nAccompanying the exhilaration that these pictures might bring is a sense of foreboding. In almost every case, these rebellions ended in defeat, disappointment, stalemate or worse. The buoyant democratic promise of Tahrir Square in Cairo has been smothered by a decade of military dictatorship. Ukrainian democracy, seemingly victorious after the Maidan “revolution of dignity,” has since faced internal and external threats, most recently from Vladimir Putin’s army.",
    "Blog: Chile's Boric wasted an opportunity for Palestine at the UN General Assembly": "Chilean President Gabriel Boric may currently be the most outspoken leader in Latin America on Palestinian rights and Israeli violations. However, his rhetoric leaves much to be desired. It, in turn, raises questions about how Chile – the country with the largest Palestinian community in the region – can differentiate itself from other countries to become a model to follow, rather than following international consensus over the two-state compromise and Israel's security narrative.\n\nIn his first address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Boric spoke about Palestine's right to freedom and sovereignty while mangling his message by including a false equivalence with Israel that eliminates the colonial context. \"[Palestinian people] should yield to their inalienable right to establish their own free and sovereign state. In the same way, [let's] guarantee Israel's legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognised borders,\" Boric asserted.\n\nBoric's speech was pronounced \"politically correct\", while noting that Chile's stance has always advocated for the recognition of Palestinian people's rights and Israel's rights while promoting the two-state compromise, like the rest of the international community. In which case, Boric's activist stances as president are unlikely to leave any impact on Chilean diplomacy. Under Boric, the Chilean government is advocating for the same stance that his predecessor Sebastian Pinera adhered to, which is a bonus for Israel, despite the grievances Israeli media aired upon Boric's electoral victory.\n\nREAD: The EU should stop exploiting Palestinian NGOs\n\nDays before his UNGA speech, Boric postponed accepting the credentials of the new Israeli ambassador to Chile, Gil Artzyeli, in response to the Israeli forces' killing of 17-year-old Palestinian Odai Trad Salah in Kufr Dan near Jenin. However, his stance, which made headline news in major media outlets worldwide, was diminished by the UNGA speech that attempted equivalence between the coloniser and the colonised while simplifying, to the point of obliteration, the reason why Palestinians are deprived of a state, possibly permanently.\n\nBoric is not unaware of the Palestinian plight as a result of Zionist colonisation. Neither is he oblivious to the fact that Palestinians and the indigenous people of Chile – the Mapuche – have suffered similar forms of aggression because of governments criminalising their struggle for land reclamation and political autonomy. Yet, it is possible that, as president, Boric's activist stances will be mellowed by diplomatic requirements, such as abiding by the two-state compromise, which has failed Palestinians and become defunct in all but international rhetoric.\n\nPrior to the presidency, Boric stood out as one of the most vocal activists in Chile. As president, Boric is navigating a complex reality that includes the legacy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and ties to Israel during that period, as well as the country's reliance on securing military and surveillance equipment from Palestine's oppressors.\n\nTo cast Israel and legitimacy together is an aberration, particularly when using such descriptions to balance advocating for Palestinian rights. Boric wasted an opportunity at his first UNGA speech to call out Israel's colonial violence and how it invalidates legitimacy. It is not up to the international community to guarantee Israel's existence, but Boric knows that Chile can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the international community gravitates towards the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's political demands.\n\nREAD: Chile President refuses Israeli ambassador's credentials over Israel's killing of Palestinians\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",
    "In Chile's desert lie vast reserves of lithium — key for electric car batteries": "ATACAMA DESERT, Chile — In the middle of the desert in northern Chile, massive pools of Caribbean blue water sit next to what appear to be snowdrifts.\n\nBut this is a lithium mine.\n\nThe pools are filled with salty groundwater that contains lithium. It's a key component in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, solar panels and other green technologies.\n\n\"It's really, really a beautiful place,\" says Marcelo Valdebenito, a public relations officer for Albemarle Corp., the Charlotte, N.C.-based chemical company that operates the mine. \"This is the lithium that powers the world.\"\n\nIndeed, the world is hungry for the silvery-white metal. The International Energy Agency is projecting a more than 40-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2040. Lithium prices have hit record highs this year.\n\nDespite growing concerns about the environmental impact of lithium extraction, skyrocketing demand is good news for mining companies in Chile. The South American country is the second-largest lithium producer after Australia. And Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are known as the \"lithium triangle,\" together holding more than half of the world's proven lithium reserves.\n\nAnnual production at the Albemarle mine has increased from 22,000 tons to 84,000 tons since 2016, says Ignacio Mehech, the company's country manager in Chile.\n\n\"We are growing as the demand is growing and today we are a much bigger company,\" Mehech told NPR, adding that the company now has 1,000 employees in Chile, up from 250 five years ago.\n\nSouth America could power up\n\nEven so, the region's lithium output is just a fraction of what it could be, leading to fears of an eventual bottleneck in world supplies.\n\nBolivian President Luis Arce has pledged to make his country \"the world capital of lithium\" and supply 40% of global demand for the metal by 2030. But due to technological challenges and community resistance, as well as heavy state intervention in the economy, the industry has been slow to develop. Production in Bolivia remains negligible.\n\nEconomic turmoil has kept Argentina from opening more mines.\n\nMeanwhile, Chile has high taxes and strict mining regulations, says Mehech. The red tape for production permits involves securing approval from the nation's nuclear energy commission since the metal can be used in nuclear power and weapons.\n\n\"It is very difficult and that's why you don't see more lithium companies in Chile,\" Mehech says of Albemarle, which he says is one of just two companies producing lithium in Chile.\n\nMining raises environmental concerns\n\nBut some Chileans prefer a go-slow approach.\n\nThey include microbiologist Cristina Dorador, who has spent years studying the salt flats of the Atacama Desert. She says lithium mines extract huge amounts of groundwater. Ten-times saltier than seawater, this brine is then placed in enormous evaporation pools. After 18 months, the resulting 6% lithium solution is then turned into a white lithium powder and exported for use in batteries.\n\nDorador says removing so much groundwater will inevitably make the Atacama Desert — home to Chile's lithium mines — hotter and drier. She recently co-authored an investigation linking lithium mining to an 11% reduction in the local flamingo population over the past decade.\n\n\"With so much pressure from the world to produce more lithium,\" she says, \"the price is going to be paid by Chile's environment.\"\n\nWhy not make the batteries, too?\n\nAnother critic is Andrés Díaz, who directs the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at Diego Portales University in Santiago, the Chilean capital. Instead of just lithium, he thinks Chile should produce and export higher-valued lithium-ion batteries that the country currently imports from Asia at a steep cost.\n\nTo move in that direction, Albemarle signed an agreement with the Chilean government to spend $300 million on research and development here by 2043.\n\n\"For us, it doesn't make any sense to export lithium and then buy from other countries batteries with a material that we produced at the very beginning,\" Díaz says.\n\nMehech acknowledges that lithium mining uses a lot of groundwater but claims the tradeoff is worth it. He points out that the amount of water required to produce enough lithium for an electric car battery is about the same amount needed to produce a half pound of beef or 11 avocados.\n\nThe avocados, he says, will last for just a few days, \"but a lithium battery lasts for 10 years and then you can recycle it.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Chile baloney": "What a lot of baloney Will Lilley writes in saying Allende ‘brought it upon himself’ when he was overthrown in a military coup by the brutal General Pinochet, backed by Henry Kissinger and the CIA in Chile, 1973.\n\nAllende was the first socialist president to be elected democratically through the ballot box in South America. That is, he and his colleagues played the game of the ruling class, the colonial powers of the US, France, the UK, and Australia. And won the election fair and square. Thisy represented the expressed ardent desire of the majority of the Chilean people to distribute the wealth of their country much more fairly amongst the people. That did not sit well with the wealthy elite and American corporations used to ripping off Chile. So they backed Pinochet and the CIA’s coup against Allende. The ‘communistas’ had to be destroyed, rooted out like they were vermin, for fear Allende’s example, like the Sandinista revolution and ‘Poder Popular’ (People Power) in Nicaragua a decade later, would spread to other impoverished nations of South and Central America, and other poor nations of the world.\n\nI was in Chile making a film in 1985 and I had firsthand experience of the murderous nature of Pinochet’s secret police who detained and tortured; they even used Alsatian dogs trained to rape women political prisoners. After the coup in ’73, Pinochet and his feared secret police rounded up ‘leftists’ like me (and many others in our Byron community) and tortured and ‘disappeared’ them. These were artists, writers, journalists, Montessori school teachers, architects, actors, and musicians who dared to want a better world for themselves and their kids. The murdered ‘leftists’ children, like the Stolen Generation here, were adopted out to childless Chilean army officers and the wealthy elite, never told who their real parents were.\n\nWill Lilley, in the ‘democracy’ (!) we live with here in Australia, you are free to peddle your sympathies for murderous fascists like Pinochet, Kissinger, Soeharto in Murdoch’s rags – he’ll believe you. He’s part of the mega-rich and ruling elite of the world. But please, don’t defile The Echo’s pages with your re-writing of history and denigrating the struggle and sacrifice of their lives by the Chilean people – a process they are still actively engaged in today with re-writing Pinochet’s Constitution.\n\nDavid Bradbury, Wilsons Creek\n\n♦ Read Damian Kassabgi’s response here.",
    "Chile rallies for and against new constitution – in pictures": "Mass demonstrations in the Chilean capital, Santiago, have marked the final day of campaigning for, and against, a new constitution to replace the document drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. The vote on Sunday will take place amid a climate of uncertainty driven by a storm of falsehoods and divisive campaigns",
    "Misinformation abounds as Chile prepares to vote on new constitution": "Chile is heading towards a historic plebiscite on a new constitution to replace the document drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, but the vote will take place amid a climate of uncertainty driven by a storm of falsehoods and divisive campaigns.\n\nFor weeks, television advertising spots, street canvassers and social media campaigns have attempted to sway opinion towards the two options which will appear on the ballot this Sunday: “approve” or “reject”.\n\n“We’re inundated with a tsunami of information,” said former advertising executive Eugenio García, 69, “Nowadays, it’s hard to tell what’s true, false, biased or malicious.”\n\nGarcía helped craft the campaign calling on Chileans to say no to eight more years of Pinochet’s rule in a previous plebiscite in the spring of 1988. They did so by a narrow margin.\n\n“There are similarities between then and now in that they want to change the moral fabric of the country,” said García, “But what is at stake this time is actually far greater – it is part of a global change.”\n\nOver 12 months, a democratically elected gender-equal convention, representing a vast range of agendas and political stances, worked to draft the new constitution.\n\nThe result of the process, presented in July, is a remarkably progressive document enshrining gender equality and Indigenous rights, expanding social protections and guaranteeing environmental protection.\n\nHowever, criticism has been levelled at its shake-up of the political system, which detractors argue was not the cause of the country’s discontent. Others have labelled the proposed constitution a “wishlist” of rights that will be hard to put into practice.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Chileans will reject the proposal in the referendum, in which everybody aged 18 or over must vote.\n\nBut if the constitution is approved, it will replace the 1980 document which, despite significant reforms, retains the ideological fingerprints of the Pinochet dictatorship under which it was drafted without democratic input.\n\nMapuche Indigenous people hold flags of approval of the new constitution in Temuco, Chile, this month. Photograph: Mario Quilodran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn insidious trend of misinformation has weighed heavily on the process since October 2020, when Chileans voted overwhelmingly in favour of drafting a new constitution.\n\n“With the first plebiscite there was a boom of misinformation,” said Valentina Matus, the editor of Contexto Factual.\n\n“Even though there wasn’t anything written yet, they were already saying that you could have your house taken away,” remembered Matus.\n\nDuring a televised campaign in 2021, a rightwing party falsely claimed that the new constitution would change Chile’s national anthem, flag – and even the name of the country.\n\nOnline, the daily swirl of false announcements and misleading interpretations of the text have made fact-checking difficult.\n\n“There are constant examples of statements that I don’t consider outright lies, but rather exaggerations,” said Eduardo Arriagada, an adjunct professor at the Pontifical Catholic University’s communications faculty in Santiago.\n\n“Constitutions don’t usually give details, they give broad definitions and allow for a range of scenarios for the law to sort out later, but that leaves them open to interpretation.”\n\nPredictably, the most emotive topics have been foregrounded.\n\nIn May, Senator Felipe Kast claimed that under the new constitution, abortion would be permitted up to the ninth month of a pregnancy. The text enshrines reproductive rights, but explicitly leaves the details up to the law.\n\nAnother recurring falsehood has been that private property could be confiscated under the new constitution.\n\nAmong the more outlandish claims, a website whose design mimicked that of the constitutional convention claimed that deprivatising the country’s water rights would outlaw the sale of bottled water and bags of ice for summer barbecues.\n\nIn response to a wave of false social media posts, one congressman even presented a bill in late July that would sanction sharing fake news about the constitution with a fine of around 33m pesos (£31,000).\n\n“From day one, the campaign against the new constitution manipulated what I said and sowed lies,” said Elisa Loncón, who represented the Indigenous Mapuche people in the convention and was elected its first president.\n\n“What they want is to silence and minimise us. All of the Mapuche women in the convention were subject to these attacks.”\n\nPeople demonstrate against the draft of the new constitution in Santiago at the weekend.

In its 2022 country report on Chile, the Freedom House NGO gave Chilean democracy a rating of 94 out of 100 – the second highest in Latin America – concluding that “Chile’s electoral framework is robust and generally well implemented”.\n\nBut efforts to allow Chileans to make an informed choice on Sunday have often met with resistance.\n\n“With misinformation getting there first, it’s hard to make sure the truth or fact-checking has the same reach,” said Matus.\n\n“Lies about emotional subjects will always outrun efforts to debunk them.”",

    "‘Only Way Out Is Emancipation’: Mapuche Ponder Future As Chile Rejects Constitution": "The Latin American Left is regrouping. On July 19, 2021, Peru’s National Elections Jury announced the official results of the 2021 presidential elections, declaring Pedro Castillo as President of Peru. An important voting survey in Brazil has revealed that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would outperform neo-fascist President Jair Bolsonaro in all scenarios for the 2022 elections in the country. Colombia is in socio-economic turmoil, creating a potential opening for the election of Gustavo Petro – a left-wing politician. In Chile, the result of elections held on May 15-16, 2021, for the 155-member new constituent assembly has thrust progressive candidates to the forefront of national politics. All these dynamics will regionally strengthen the leftist governments already in power in Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. An anti-neoliberal shift in Latin America’s political compass carries global significance.\n\nImperialism\n\n\n\nLarge swathes of humanity who live in the peripheries of the world system have been witnessing a deadly process of absolute immiseration. Imperialism has restricted the economic growth of the periphery to mineral and agricultural sectors in order to assure raw materials for advanced capitalist nations. Hence, most Third World economies are heavily dependent on the export of primary commodities. In Latin America, such primary commodities account for the majority of exports for nearly all countries. While Latin American countries export primary goods to the Global North, they tend to re-import manufactured products from these same countries. The value added to these manufactured commodities – typically constructed from the primary inputs imported earlier – generates profit for northern countries while maintaining Latin American countries in a perpetual trade deficit.\n\nWhile some countries in the periphery have facilitated a degree of industrialization through the surpluses accumulated from export-led growth, the disarticulated structures of these economies persists. The imperialist states’ monopolies – technological, financial, natural resources, communications, and military – has meant that there has been a lack of any significant indigenous technical development. Even to the extent that industrial growth has occurred, it has been based on the import of capital and technology, which has considerably reduced the dynamic effects on the economy that are usually associated with industrial growth. Moreover, a relocation of the locus of value creation from the core to the periphery means that the core relies less and less on the unprofitable exploitation of its own workers. Instead, the metropole increasingly divides the world into what has been labeled as Southern “production economies” and Northern “consumption economies.”\n\nThe main driver behind this process is undoubtedly the low wage level in the South. Entrenchment of extroverted economies like these has generated cut-throat competition amongst Southern firms for foreign capital. What we have now is a global race to the bottom, marked by a deathly spiral of exchange rate devaluations, hyper-low taxes and depressed wages. Multinational corporations based in the capitalist core have unendingly feasted on this wretchedness, fattening their profits from the extreme exploitation of the Third World’s large labor reserves. As such, the structure of today’s global economy has been profoundly shaped by the allocation of labor to industrial sectors according to differential rates of national exploitation. Thus, only the outward form of value transfers from the South to the North has changed, with the unequal exchange of products embodying different quantities of value steadily continuing. A large pool of precarized workers has been created, which consistently remains enmeshed in networks of informal economy, being forced by the productive configurations to enrich foreign capitalists and nourish the parasitic nature of the comprador bourgeoisie.\n\nInternational Finance Capital\n\n\n\nThe continuation of the international division of labor and the creation of dependent industrialization has been complemented by the hegemony of international finance capital. Prabhat Patnaik writes:\n\n“In the current phase of imperialism, finance capital has become international, while the State remains a nation-State. The nation-State therefore willy-nilly must bow before the wishes of finance, for otherwise finance (both originating in that country and brought in from outside) will leave that particular country and move elsewhere, reducing it to illiquidity and disrupting its economy. The process of globalization of finance therefore has the effect of undermining the autonomy of the nation-State. The State cannot do what it wishes to do, or what its elected government has been elected to do, since it must do what finance wishes it to do.”\n\nThe interests of the financial oligarchy lie in strongly opposing state expenditure financed either by taxes on capitalists or by borrowing – the only ways of financing through which the state can effect a net expansion in aggregate demand. Financial interests are against deficit-financed spending for a number of reasons. First, deficit financing is seen to increase the liquidity overhang in the system, and therefore as being potentially inflationary. Inflation is anathema to finance since it erodes the value of financial assets. Second, financial markets fear that the introduction of debt-financed spending – which is driven by goals other than profit-making – will render interest rate differentials that determine financial profits more unpredictable. Third, if deficit spending leads to a substantial build-up of the state’s debt, it may intervene in financial markets to lower interest rates with implications for financial returns.\n\nUnder these circumstances, even moderate welfarism has become a danger to the neoliberal order. Whereas the welfare state in the immediate post-War era served the ruling class by warding off the threat of communism, in the neoliberal era – where accumulation by dispossession has become the predominant mode of capitalist growth – even the most modest of demand management policies have had to face intense political opposition. Taking into account the internationally polarizing and nationally suffocating results of global capitalism, the slow resurgence of the Latin American Left will provide an avenue for the advancement of an alternative agenda.\n\nThe Experience of the Pink Tide\n\nFirstly, progressive governments in the continent have always tried to tackle relations of dependency, as is discernible from their experience in power during the Pink Tide. In opposition to metropolitan control over mineral resources and plantations, the Latin American Left consolidated the public sector which displaced the dominance of foreign capital. These arrangements ensured that the revenues coming from the primary commodity sector were no longer siphoned off by the rich but were diverted towards the poor. The assertion of control over financial resources and their redirection toward social developmentalism was coupled with the uneven promotion of sovereign forms of industrialization, trade and finance through various initiatives like the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Union of South American Nations and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America.\n\nBefore the public sector and regional groupings could be fully used for developing domestic heavy-industry base and technological capability, the commodity boom itself collapsed. This external event did not allow the Left’s redistributive strategy to transform into concerted attempts at changing the productive forces. However, the fact that a politico-ideological project of independence was advocated stands as a testimony to the fruitful possibilities contained in the Pink Tide. Industrialization, social welfare, and the nation came together in the notion of sovereignty; industrialization was not posed simply as a means by which Third World capitalists could accumulate capital more effectively, but as a means of improving the nation as a whole.\n\nMoreover, a programme of selective delinking was supported which allowed Latin American governments to self-determine which sector of the economy could be safely opened up. They could differentially open up a sector where foreign capital was needed to supplement local capital in whole or in part. As part of this blueprint of economic self-determination, clear-headed campaigns were initiated to resist pressures to liberalize the financial sector. In fact, Latin America’s leftist governments tended to increase the level of capital controls instead of merely adapting to the constraints imposed by financial globalization. The reregulation of cross-border financial flows was part of a coordinated effort to obtain further macroeconomic policy autonomy and attend to the interests of impoverished constituencies.\n\nThe existence of capital controls enabled the Latin American Left to temporarily soften the impact of the end of commodity boom. One of the visible ways that the collapse of primary commodity prices makes itself felt is through a shortage of foreign exchange to finance necessary imports. This gives rise to inflation, to currency depreciations which further aggravate inflation, and to shortages of essential goods. Further, the reduced incomes -a result of the slump in the primary commodity demand – cause recession, stagnation and unemployment. The conservation of foreign exchange for importing essential commodities, and the prevention of outflow of foreign exchange by wealth-holders hedging against exchange rate depreciation, become extremely important. Towards this end, the Latin American Left’s regulatory management of banks and foreign trade proved to be crucial in mitigating the effects of changing global conditions.\n\nSecondly, Latin American leftist governments extensively used planning and welfare policies, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), financed through the receipts of economic growth and the taxation of rising commodity exports. Under a new socio-economic structure of accumulation, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates increased and social conditions improved, reversing the adverse consequences of neoliberalism and cementing popular support for the Pink Tide administrations. The GDP per capita of Latin America and the Caribbean rose by 31% between 2003 and 2013, poverty rates fell from 32 to 17%, and the country-average of the Gini index of household per capita income in Latin America fell by 0.06. All this stood in complete contrast to the past implementations of harsh austerity programs and fiscal niggardliness which were intended to restore government’s “credibility” and return to the elusive cycle of growth led solely by private investment.\n\nThe implementation of welfare policies needs to be looked in the specific context of contemporary capitalism. In a global situation marked by the hegemony of international finance capital and calcified hierarchies, the unleashing of successful poverty alleviation schemes, increase in minimum wages, strengthening of labor regulations and the weakening of deficit targets were not acceptable to the elites who saw these policies as a precursor to more radical shifts. Thus, in an era of finance capital where even the most basic welfare spending runs contrary to the interests of an inflation-fearing financial oligarchy, the Latin American Left’s fiscal expansionism and consolidation of social policies constituted a sharp attack on neoliberal interests.\n\nPresent-day fluctuations in the balance of forces in Latin America hint towards a revival of the Left. We need to comprehend these fluid tectonic plates of popular power from an actively political perspective. Building a socialist society in a Third World country, in which – despite its wealth of natural resources – there remains immense poverty and hideous inequality is a hard task. Moving against the powerful tide of reactionary forces and helping the oppressed classes to overcome social humiliation requires a long gestation period. In short, the entrance of the Global South subaltern on the stage of history is a richly textured pathway of socialized autonomy which never follows a linear or perfect course of economic reconstruction. Most of the times, the width of populist culture and depth of working class power intersect to generate a multi-sided trajectory of revolution. As Vladimir Lenin himself said, “Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is.” Thus, in the current conjuncture, we need to show solidarity with Latin America’s renascent Pink Tide which promises to deal a blow to imperialist capitalism.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Orinoco Tribune.",

    "Proposed new rules regarding foreign tax credits in Chile": "Chile has a unilateral and a bilateral foreign tax mechanism.\n\nThe unilateral tax credit mechanism is applicable for countries that have not signed a double tax treaty with Chile.

It applies to all kinds of income included in the treaty and is also limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nSince the corporate income tax rate is 27%, if the foreign tax credit exceeds this amount, the difference up to 35% can be used against final taxes (surtax in the case of Chilean individuals and additional withholding tax in the case of foreigners earning Chilean-sourced income).\n\nAlso, if a foreign investment is held through different layers abroad, Chilean tax law allows the use of foreign tax credits, even if the corporate taxes are paid by entities indirectly held abroad, as long as the distributing entity is domiciled in the same country and it holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10%.\n\nUnder a tax change in 2020, if the corporate income tax is paid in a third country, different from the distributing country, corporate income taxes paid can also be used as a credit in Chile, as long as the distributing entity holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10% and the third country has an enforceable double tax treaty with Chile or an exchange of information agreement.\n\nThe bill\n\nIn March 2022, Gabriel Boric became the Chilean president.

    "The Fight for a New Chile Goes On": "Last Sunday, Chile voted to overwhelmingly reject the draft for a new Constitution that would have replaced the current document written in 1980 during Pinochet’s dictatorship. For weeks, polls were predicting a win for Rechazo (Reject), but it still came as a great surprise when Apruebo (Approve) obtained only 38.41 percent of the votes against 61.86 percent for reject. This was a difference of over 20 points, which contrasted strongly with the results of the 2020 referendum, in which 78.8 percent voted for the writing of a new Constitution and only 21.72 percent opposed it. Since the proposal voted on on Sunday contained a series of progressive ideas popularised during and after the uprising of 2019, there was some expectation that the results would be more or less aligned with Boric’s election results last December, in which he won with 55.87 percent of votes. So what went wrong?\n\nLast Sunday’s referendum was the first mandatory vote in a decade, meaning that turnout was among the highest in Chilean history. 86 percent of the electorate took to the polls, achieving a level of participation similar to that of the 1988 referendum that initiated the country’s transition to democracy. This high level of electoral participation left both campaigns uncertain about how the normally politically abstinent section of the population would vote. As the count began on Sunday, it was clear that the tendency among new voters was toward Rechazo, quickly raising the notion of a ‘silent majority’ who do not commonly express their political positions by way of voting.\n\nIt would be simplistic to homogenise those millions of people who decided to vote for the first time. The high turnout speaks more to the limitations of voluntary voting systems than the kind of politics hiding behind these non-voters: voluntary votes, especially with the first referendum and Boric’s election, gave the impression of the rise of a new progressive politics with mass support. This was accompanied by considerable expressions of ‘street politics’ that occupied front pages over the last three years. For the first time in decades, Chile was openly discussing the inequalities, injustices, and oppression felt by the people, and it felt like left-wing politics and progressive ideas were predominant in Chile’s population. The slogan ‘neoliberalism was born in Chile and will die in Chile’ became a rallying cry for many social and political organisations. And while the rise of progressive politics in Chile cannot be ignored, Sunday’s results show that the circumstances are much more complex.\n\nAccording to the recent data analysis published by Miguel Angel Fernandez and Eugenio Guzman from Universidad del Desarrollo, Rechazo won in each of the sixteen regions and 338 of the 346 communes, leaving Apruebo winning only in eight communes. This data also identifies that those in low and medium-low income preferred Rechazo by 87.4 percent and 87.6 percent respectively, with slightly larger support than found in medium-high and high-income areas. Similarly, Rechazo won in rural areas and places with a high density of indigenous people. The lean toward rejecting the constitutional draft across all social groups and demographics cannot simply be explained simply by way of the Rechazo campaign’s excessive use of disinformation, as some are already trying to do by referring to the referendum as the ‘Chilean Brexit’. Such forces played a role, but it is important to look more closely at the reasons that led to this result and the possible explanations for the defeat of the Apruebo campaign.\n\nA survey of 1135 people carried out by CADEM—one of Chile’s main market research companies—on found that 40 percent decided to reject the draft because the ‘process led by the Convention was poor’. 35 percent believed that the draft would ‘create instability and uncertainty’, 29 percent rejected the proposal of ‘plurinationality and indigenous autonomy’, and 24 percent said that ‘it was not necessary to write a new constitution, it [the current one] just needs reforming’. Only seven percent explained their rejection of the draft due to it permitting ‘free abortion’, seven percent because the new constitution would ‘eliminate the Senate and concentrate the power in the Deputies camera’, and just one percent because ‘it gives the state control of natural resources’.\n\nCIPER, a research centre, also published a report based on 120 testimonies from people who voted for Rechazo from across 12 working-class communes in Santiago. Although this study has clear methodological limitations, the report concludes that the main reasons people voted Rechazo was the possibility of ‘losing their houses’ and seeing their inheritance ‘expropriated by the state’. The second most offered reason was, again, the proposal for plurinationality, which would ‘divide the country’ and create ‘differentiated juridical systems’, while the third was that ‘pension funds would be expropriated by the state and not inherited by family members’. None of these presumptions are true, but this gives an impression of the difficulties faced by the Apruebo campaign both in messaging and in connecting people’s material concerns with the articles proposed in the draft.\n\nIn both studies, plurinationality was one of the main factors given for voting Rechazo. The constitutional draft proposed that Chile would be a plurinational state that would recognise the existence of different pueblos and indigenous nations inhabiting the country. The concept of plurinationality was contained in a series of articles that recognised indigenous territories, their autonomy, and—more controversially—allowed for the creation of an indigenous justice system and implementation of juridical pluralism. This juridical reform would allow indigenous people to have a justice system parallel to the national one where they could deal with communal issues by way of their own cultural and juridical customs, while being still subject to national law and the rule of the Supreme Court. Whilst the proposal for plurinationality was one of the most progressive points of the draft and represented significant reparations for indigenous groups in Chile, it became a hotly contested aspect because of both the misinterpretation of the proposal and the struggle of progressive forces to popularise the importance of such historical demands.\n\nThe Rechazo campaign and mainstream media focused doggedly on the issue of plurinationality, repeating without explanation that the country would be divided into many countries and a minority of indigenous people would be above the law that applies to everyone else. Often with a distinct racist tone, media and politicians from the Rechazo campaign used the contested element of plurinationality to pursue the narrative that the Constitutional Convention only drafted the Constitution for some groups—primarily ‘the left’ and ‘the minorities’—at the expense of the ‘large majorities’ who would be subject to a justice system that would not benefit them. The focus on this point made a deep impression among working-class communities, who themselves have little or no access to forms of justice and have instead been demanding improved access to justice itself rather than wholesale reform to its structure.\n\nPlurinationality, then, became an inaccessible idea or an empty signifier that only ‘the left’ was demanding, one not even supported by ‘all indigenous groups’, as the Rechazo campaign was keen to emphasise. The alienation of plurinationality from other, more popular social demands, such as the national health system, free education, and a new pension system, was essential for the Rechazo campaign to win. For this reason, we must not suggest that the 62 percent who voted for Rechazo are ignorant nationalists or racists. Instead, the rejection of plurinationality reflects the inability of progressive forces to convey the important relationship between broader inequalities and the oppression of indigenous groups and the failure to connect the demands of October 2019 with the proposals contained in the idea of plurinationality.\n\nThere are those, of course, who say that the Apruebo campaign had lost before it even started in July. The Rechazo campaign unofficially began with the confirmation of the Constitutional Convention in June 2021, allowing right-wing parties and the media to contest every proposal and discussion it held, as well as allowing them to publicly delegitimise the behaviour of its members, most of whom were never before part of public institutions and were not used to such intense public scrutiny. Isolated events, such as the resignation of one of the Convention’s members after it was revealed that they were faking cancer, became predominant in the public narrative, creating a sense that the Convention was just as untrustworthy and corrupt as other political institutions. This is shown by the CADEM study, in which 40 percent of respondents indicated that they voted to reject the draft because of the poor procedures led by the Convention.\n\nIf we look at it in this way, the inequalities between the campaigns were not only financial, but also existed in terms of time dedicated to them and the predominance of their respective narratives in the mind of the public. Rechazo had a year head-start in which to organise themselves and prepare a systematic campaign against the proposal, while the Apruebo campaign could only communicate the draft when it was finished and the Convention had closed at the end of June. This is, perhaps, something progressive forces could not have avoided nor prevented, but does suggest that that the result on Sunday was a vote of discontent based on similar principles to those that triggered the social uprising of 2019—namely, the perceived incapacity of political institutions to respond to the demands of the people.\n\nSo, what is left after this defeat for Apruebo? It is uncertain what the process for a new Constitution will now look like. President Boric has already met the presidents of both legislative chambers and with the main political parties to begin to define the terms for writing a new draft. Right-wing parties will try to prevent the creation of a new Convention and even the writing of a new Constitution altogether. Political forces on the right and centre will block attempts to repeat the incorporation of an indigenous quota and gender parity in any future Convention, and some will try to prevent the possibility of another referendum to vote on the new draft.\n\nThe defeat of Apruebo not only has a significant impact on how progressive ideas will get through to a new Constitution, but represents a challenge for democratic forces in a new process. The victory of Rechazo will be mobilised to transfer power back to political elites, disenfranchising the same mass of people who voted to reject the draft last Sunday. Nevertheless, polls show that a new Constitution is still highly popular, and it will be the role of progressive forces to continue to ensure some elements such as the right to water, a national health system, reproductive rights, and free education can still be included in any future draft. These remain basic things Chileans do not have and desperately need. Some groups on the left will return to the streets to revive the spirit and action of October 2019, while others will take this defeat as a terminal point in their efforts. Whatever comes next, it is still the responsibility of progressive forces to continue building toward the end of neoliberalism in Chile, and to speak to that ‘silent majority’ that loudly expressed itself last Sunday.",

    "How viable are Portuguese grape varieties in Chile?": "News\n\nBy Sarah Neish\n\nOne Chilean producer is waving a flag for planting Portuguese varieties in Chile, but how likely are these grapes to flourish in the South American climate? db investigates.\n\nLos Boldos, in the Cachapoal Andes Valley, is not only one of Chile’s foremost premium wine producers, it is also owned by Portuguese wine group Sogrape, which gives it a secret weapon of sorts.\n\nDespite having traditionally focused on Cabernet Sauvignon, Los Boldos’ winemaker is now eyeing up indigenous grape varieties from its parent group’s native Portugal, and is experimenting with plantings to see how these might fare in Chile’s varied terroir.\n\nOne of these varieties is Touriga Nacional, which winemaker Meinard Bloem says “behaves very differently in Chile”.\n\nDespite having similar granitic soils to Dão, Cachapoal in Chile is surprisingly seeing far more generous growth from the variety. “Touriga Nacional offers five times the volume in Cachapoal as it does in its native Portugal,” Bloem tells db.\n\nHe attributes the abundant yields to the use of carefully selected vines, which are free of viruses. “I guess that most of the vines grown in Portugal are relatively old, and unirrigated,” he says. “At Los Boldos we currently have 2.8ha planted, of which 0.22 is ungrafted and the rest grafted on top of Cabernet Sauvignon.”\n\nBloem would like to introduce more Portuguese varieties to Los Boldos’ vineyards, including Touriga Franca, which he says people are “sceptical about ripening in Chile.”\n\n“It’s basically the Portuguese who think that Touriga Franca would be difficult to ripen. Seeing that Touriga Nacional doesn’t score very high when it comes to Brix levels, it’s not hard to believe that Touriga Franca would fare a bit worse. I’d love to prove them wrong!” says Bloem, who reveals he would like to grow “at least 10ha of the variety”, up from its existing 2.8ha.\n\nThere is a further Portuguese variety in his sights in terms of its potential for use in Chilean wines.\n\n“One that taunts me a lot is Souzão (Vinhão): a high-acid, high-colour northern variety that is making some very ‘wild’ reds in the Minho (red Vinho Verde) and used to add colour and acidity in Port wines,” says Bloem, who joined Los Boldos in 20201 just before the harvest.\n\n“Alfrocheiro is another good candidate, for opposite reasons. Tinto Cão is another good option. And for white wines: Arinto and Alvarinho (Albariño in Spanish). The latter is already in Chile; Fernando Almeda makes a very good one.”\n\nHe also pinpoints Trincadeira (Tinta Amarela), which was rediscovered growing in the South of Chile as being another Portuguese grape to watch. ” If the plants are healthy, this could well add another variety to our list”.\n\nBut what of the wines being made from these Portuguese varieties? Los Boldos produces a single variety Touriga Nacional, which has floral characteristics, “almost Bergamot, which is not usually on my red wine descriptor list,” says Bloem.\n\nA Touriga Nacional rosé is also available from the brand, which is “less floral and more citrus driven”. According to Bloem, on the nose it is “almost a white wine, with apricot, lemon peel and tangerine notes. The alcohol is normally low, as we struggle to ripen it much beyond 12%, and the acidity is gentle. Both wines are exported, mainly to Brazil and Portugal”.",

The first plant to be operational, by November of this year, is expected to be the Santa María plant, in Valparaíso.\n\nThis progress has been achieved as a result of an agreement with Gasco Luz, Four Trees Capital and, more recently, Levering Energy Solutions SpA, through ten-year lease contracts of these plants, which would involve an annual payment of around $360,000 by Banco Santander.\n\nThanks to this, Santander Chile will become the first bank in the country to have this type of energy compensation, as all of the electricity injected into the grid will be recognized as energy consumption from Non-Conventional Renewable Energy sources (NCRE) by the bank. This action will reduce the institution’s carbon footprint by 1,500 tonnes CO 2 per year.\n\n“We are excited to see how the construction of the solar plants that will offset the bank’s energy consumption is progressing steadily. This will be a major milestone for the industry, as it will be able to set the tone regarding what comes next in terms of the contribution to and concern for the environment by large Chilean companies”, says Rafael Barbudo, head of Services at Banco Santander.\n\nWith the construction of these solar plants, the bank is in line with one of the Group’s global commitments to contribute to the UN-led Sustainable Development Goals. Santander resolved that 100% of the energy it consumes should come from renewable sources in 2025.",

    "Chile rejects its new constitution": "Chile rejects its new constitution\n\nChile has voted a resounding NO to a proposed constitution that would have put a focus on social issues and gender parity, enshrine rights for the indigenous population, and address climate change.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Chile, a special assembly has spent the past two years writing a new constitution, and it was supposed to replace the current one that dates back to the country's military dictatorship. But yesterday, voters soundly rejected the new constitution in a referendum and then celebrated in the streets of Santiago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING, CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: NPR's John Otis is just back from a reporting trip to Chile, and he joins us now. Good morning, John.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Good morning. It's good to be here.\n\nMARTIN: So people clearly excited. Tell us what this rejection means.\n\nOTIS: Well, the rejection means a huge blow for Chile's president, Gabriel Boric. He was a really big supporter of this new constitution. But nearly 62% of Chileans voted against it, compared to just 38% in favor. In fact, the outcome became so clear so quickly that the campaign for approval conceded defeat less than two hours after the polls closed.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. I mean, they clearly didn't have the right political temperature on how this was going to go over with voters. Why was it so controversial, this new constitution?\n\nOTIS: You know, some have called it the world's most progressive constitution. For example, it would have vastly expanded rights for Indigenous groups and created more protections for the environment. It would have made - it would have mandated universal health care, as well as the right to decent housing, education and pensions, and it calls for gender parity in government and legalized abortion. But Chile is actually quite a conservative place. Married couples couldn't even get divorced in Chile until 2004.\n\nSome of this new constitution might have hurt the economy because, for example, stricter environmental rules might have put the brakes on the copper and lithium mining industries. It would have meant higher taxes to pay for a lot of these new government benefits included in the constitution. There was also a disinformation campaign that spread lies about it. And finally, you know, the best constitutions are usually short and to the point, but this one was really long. It had 388 articles, and it was - just ended up being too much for voters to digest.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah. So if you could just step back for a moment, explain what was behind this movement to draft a new constitution in the first place?\n\nOTIS: Well, there were two reasons. First, anti-government protests back in 2019 nearly brought down Chile's government. To calm the waters and to address protesters' concerns about poverty and inequality, a special assembly began writing a new constitution. The other reason is that the current one was written back in 1980. That's when dictator Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile. Democracy was restored in 1990. And when most countries go through such momentous political changes, they write new rules of the game, new governing guidelines, but Chile never really got around to that until now.\n\nMARTIN: So, I mean, what happens? Is the effort to change the constitution dead at this point?\n\nOTIS: It's not dead. President Boric went on Chilean TV last night and claimed that the effort to forge a new constitution isn't over. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: So Boric is saying here that he plans to meet with Congress and civil society in the coming days to try to start this process all over again. This was expected because in spite of last night's rejection, polls show that Chileans don't like their Pinochet-era constitution either. But Boric has said whoever drafts the next version of the constitution, they're going to have to come up with something that unites Chileans rather than divides them, like this one did.\n\nMARTIN: John Otis reporting for NPR.

    "6 best wine tourism experiences in Chile": "News\n\nBy Sarah Neish\n\nFrom rodeo horses and pampered barrels to haunted houses, we’ve rounded up the best Chilean wineries to visit in 2022 and beyond.\n\nFollowing a recent visit by the drinks business to Chile, it seems clear that wineries in the country are split between those that fiercely assert they are “not Napa” and “never will be”, and those who believe Chile has the potential to become the next wine-tourism hotspot.\n\nAccording to Guillermo Calderon, export director, Casas de Bosque, some Chilean producers see the likes of Napa Valley as “a Disneyland for wine”, and are not rushing to pursue such a commercial approach when it comes to tourism.\n\nWith the country’s winemakers wanting to override the ‘high volume, low value’ perception that formed when Chilean wine flooded export markets in the 1980s and 1990s, some are worried that an overtly tourist offering could underline the very reputation they are trying to squash.\n\nThe challenge, therefore, is to take the learnings of successful wine tourism regions around the globe, and give these a distinctly Chilean flavour, tapping into what makes this beautiful country so unique. Here’s our pick of the best wine tourism experiences in Chile:\n\nBEST FOR…. horse lovers\n\nCasa Silva: Based in Colchagua, known as “the heartland of the cowboys” for its equestrian prowess, this estate pairs wine with horses for an unforgettable experience. Guests can watch Chile’s elite polo teams practise the sport on its full-sized playing field from the comfort of the winery’s chic Clubhouse restaurant, glass of Carmenère in hand. The winery’s stables include around 60 polo horses and 20 shorter, stockier Chilean horses which compete in rodeo tournaments. Casa Silva’s historic boutique guesthouse boasts seven comfortable rooms (US$150-US$300 per night), kitted out with four-poster beds and walls lined with equestrian artwork.\n\nBEST FOR… dining\n\nViu Manent: This one-stop shop, also in Colchagua, has two restaurants and a café, offering one of the most relaxed and welcoming dining experiences we found in Chile. “We had record numbers of diners in our restaurants as soon as the Covid ban lifted,” says owner José Miguel Viu, whose obsession with oysters led to him building an on-site saltwater pool to keep the molluscs fresh ahead of service. The Rayuela Wine & Grill restaurant serves exsquisite seafood and steaks alongside freshly made empanadas, while the Food & Wine Studio is helmed by renowned Cordon-Bleu-trained chef Pilar Rodriguez, who also offers cooking classes. Construction is under way at the winery for a handful of guest lodges (US$200 per night) set among the vineyard, with outdoor baths, hot tubs, and a swimming pool. A stable with 30 horses offers horseback tours, and guests can book in for riding lessons. Don’t miss the well-stocked shop, selling excellent handicrafts from local artisans.\n\nBEST FOR… families\n\nCasas de Bosque: With two restaurants, an outdoor lounge area with recliners for post-lunch siestas, alongside picnics, bike tours, and an organic vegetable garden where guests can pick their own produce, export director Guillermo Calderon says of this Casablanca estate: “We want families to come and spend the day, so we aim for a relaxed approach. We are much more about the experience than the wine score.” Bike tours are unguided so guests have free rein to explore the property. A private-dining spot with panoramic views of the vineyard is the ideal place to drink in the scenery with a chilled Sauvignon Blanc, in which the producer specialises, and a cheese and charcuterie board.\n\nBEST FOR…. culture\n\nMontes: Visitors to this Acolchagua Valley winery can experience the surreal sounds of its impressive barrel room, where Gregorian chants are played to the wine around-the-clock. The owner believes in the energy from the vibrations of the music and has previously welcomed Berlin’s Philharmonic Orchestra to play to the barrels. The winery buildings have also been designed according to feng shui, with flowing water features throughout to keep a zen feel. More of an outdoors type? Join a three-hour guided trek, learning about native trees and wildlife surrounding the vineyards as you go. Steakhouse, Fuegos de Apalta, is ideal for wiling away an afternoon by the roaring fire, watching the resident llamas go about their business through floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nBEST FOR… a blast from the past\n\nSanta Rita: Based in Maipo, the 19th century Casa Real hotel and its surrounding Centenario Park are like a history lesson brought to life. Horsedrawn carriage rides through the grounds are a treat, trotting past orange trees, stone statuettes and a lake occupied by black-faced Chilean swans. The fresco-adorned chapel is the perfect place to take a quiet moment, while a museum dedicated to Andino culture and a restaurant serving stellar local fare add to the magical experience. Those staying at the hotel might like to keep an eye out for the resident ghost, discovered when a visitor took a mirror selfie, in which a woman in Victorian dress can be spotted in the background. One can understand the house’s former residents not wanting to move on, given its grand decor, with original period furniture, oil paintings and textiles. Though the pool table may prove more of a challenge for spectred sorts.\n\nBEST FOR… design geeks\n\nVik: The ultra-modern design hotel at this winery is breathtaking for its striking art, Instagram-worthy infinity pool and astonishing views out over the Millahue Valley, which appears almost prehistoric with its mist-shrouded hills. The winery itself looks like the Starship Enterprise’s younger sibling; a surreal water feature leads into the sleek, silver enclave, where automatic sliding doors reveal a hidden tasting room. Listen out for the sound of crackling fire, as the winery team toasts its own bespoke barrels over fires built using Chilean oak. The wine bottles themselves at Vik add to the design aesthetic with its quirky Piu Belle range featuring some of the most gallery-calibre labels in the world.",
    "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution": "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Antonia Laborde, a reporter for El País in Santiago de Chile after voters in the country rejected a new constitution. Now the country must consider a new path forward.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow that voters in Chile have rejected a new constitution, where does the country go from here? The proposal was full of progressive ideals - universal health care, Indigenous rights, abortion protections. And voters shot it down on Sunday by a margin of more than 20 points. Antonia Laborde is a correspondent in Santiago for El Pais, and she's here to talk about the path forward. Welcome.\n\nANTONIA LABORDE: Hello. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nSHAPIRO: President Gabriel Boric is already talking about a process that would lead to another constitutional proposal. And today he announced a new cabinet. How does he believe a second attempt to pass a new constitution would go differently from the first?\n\nLABORDE: Well, President Boric has called the leaders of the political parties and Congress to define how they will continue the constitutional process that he obviously supports. But it will be the Congress that defines the rules of this new game. Now, Boric may stand out a bit and focus more on governing. Surely we will see the president more focused on security and economic issues now.\n\nSHAPIRO: I'm curious what voters are telling you. When you talk to Chileans, what do they tell you about their reasons for rejecting the new constitution?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I heard the most enlightening thing in a town called San Pedro de Melipilla. This was the municipality of the metropolitan region that had participated the least in the entry referendum in October 2020. On that occasion, the vote was voluntary. And the people had to answer whether or not they want any constitution. On Sunday, the vote was mandatory. I can say two things here. There was a huge lack of information. They knew little, and what they knew was often not true. And second, for many, it was a referendum on the management of Boric, not the constitutional proposal.\n\nSHAPIRO: Two years ago, four out of five Chilean voters wanted to scrap the old constitution. So do you see a contradiction between that vote and this one? Is there a way to move forward and bridge those two realities?\n\nLABORDE: Well, in my point of view, since the riot of 2019, the political class is much more polarized than the citizens. People took the streets massively to protest against the inequalities in this country. Later, they may simply choose to change the Constitution. For me, the division is in the elite and not in the streets. The people want changes, but they simply felt that the constitutional proposal didn't suit them.\n\nSHAPIRO: How big of a factor was misinformation?\n\nLABORDE: Well, it was undoubtedly an election marred by fake news. The people against the proposal say that the new constitution will eliminate the flag, that it will be possible to abort up to nine months of pregnancy. Another recurring falsehood was been the private property will be confiscated under the new constitution. You know that we're living in times when social media campaigns are full of fake news, and it's very difficult to stop them. But save that, I think that it's important to clarify that the 3 million-plus voters who reject the proposal can't be attributed to fake news alone only.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. This was a major blow to President Boric. Is he the man to lead the country into its next chapter? Do you think he can recover from this?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I think that this is an opportunity for Gabriel Boric. He can become the president who leaves behind a new constitution. So we may see decisions that are not very popular for the hardest left but more helpful for agreements. So we will see.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's Antonia Laborde, a journalist based in Santiago reporting for El Pais. Thank you very much.\n\nLABORDE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLUM VILLAGE SONG, \"FALL IN LOVE\")\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote": "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote\n\nChile is debating a new constitution, to replace the one written during the country's 17-year-military dictatorship. Now it'll be ratified - or rejected - by voters in a September 4th referendum.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThree years ago, anti-government demonstrations swept across Chile. They have now led to big change for the country on the Pacific coast of South America. A special assembly has written an entirely new constitution which must be ratified or rejected. NPR's John Otis is there.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in non-English language).\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Folk musicians fire up the crowd here in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Hundreds have gathered to show their support for a new constitution. It would replace the old one that was written during the country's military dictatorship that lasted for 17 years.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nOTIS: It was a brutal period. In fact, this event is taking place just outside the national soccer stadium. It was turned into a concentration camp in 1973 when General Augusto Pinochet seized power and began arresting his opponents.\n\nANDRES SOLIMANO: Many people was killed here. They used torture, disappearance. It has a very sad history.\n\nOTIS: That's Andres Solimano, who at the time of the coup was in high school and saw several of his classmates arrested. Even though Chile is now a democracy, he points out that Chile's constitution was written during the dictatorship.\n\nSOLIMANO: Thirty-two years after the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990, we still have that constitution. So it's very much a due constitutional change.\n\nOTIS: There are other reasons why Chileans want to reset the rules for their nation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: Despite years of economic growth, there's a large gap between rich and poor. That, plus low wages and rising costs for transportation, health care and education, led to violent protests in 2019.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nOTIS: About 30 protesters were killed, and hundreds were injured. To calm the waters, the government agreed to a constitutional rewrite. Last year, Chileans elected a special assembly that spent 12 months drafting the new Magna Carta.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOTIS: I pick up a copy at a kiosk in front of the presidential palace. It's long, with nearly 400 articles. Some strengthen women's rights, including the right to abortion. Others call for more protection for the environment and Indigenous groups and for better access to housing, education and pensions. But to guarantee more rights, Chile's left-wing government, which has been in power since March, will have to spend more, says political analyst Claudio Fuentes.\n\nSo all this is going to cost a lot of money.\n\nCLAUDIO FUENTES: For sure. And then the question will be taxes.\n\nOTIS: Indeed, the specter of higher taxes and more state intervention in the economy has turned off many Chileans, including retired police officer Hector Yanez.\n\nHECTOR YANEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: He says the current constitution opened the door for the best period of economic growth in Chile's history. There's also been a major TV campaign to convince Chileans to vote against ratification on September 4.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: This TV spot claims, falsely, that the new constitution will provide more rights to criminals than to their victims. The negative messaging seems to be working. Recent polls show more Chileans plan to reject the new constitution than ratify it. If so, it would be a blow to President Gabriel Boric.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: In a recent interview on Chilean TV, Boric said he found it hard to imagine that the no-vote would prevail.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: But if it does, Boric said, this isn't the end. Instead, he said, Chileans would go back to square one and start the constitutional rewrite process all over again.\n\nJohn Otis, NPR News, Santiago, Chile.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "Chile’s environmental watchdog opens new overproduction case against Australis": "Chile’s environmental watchdog opens new overproduction case against Australis\n\nChile’s Superintendency of the Environment (SMA) has opened a new sanctioning process against Australis Mar for exceeding the authorized production limits at one of its grow-out centers – the seventh such action taken by the environmental watchdog against the salmon-farming firm.\n\nAustralis Mar is a division of Puerto Varas, Chile-based Australis Seafoods, which was acquired in 2018 by Chinese foodservice giant Joyvio, a subsidiary of Legend Holdings.\n\nSMA's latest investigation pertains to Australis’ Punta Lobos center, located in the Kawésqar National Reserve, in Chile’s southernmost region of Magallanes – an area that has been at the center of national attention, including a documentary produced by National Geographic that called for the reserve to be declared a national park, a move that would effectively ban salmon production there. According to the latest documents filed on SMA’s national information system for environmental control, SNIFA, Sernapesca – the country’s fisheries and aquaculture service – found that during the November 2017 through August 2019 production cycle the Punta Lobos center produced a total of 7,777 metric tons (MT) of Atlantic salmon, surpassing its environmentally permitted limit of 4,320 MT by 80 percent, or 3,457 MT.\n\nSMA has six other sanctioning processes currently ongoing against Australis Mar: one for alleged violations at a salmon farm in the Biobío region, two for violations at grow-out centers in the Aysén region (Salas 5 and Costa), and three for alleged violations in the Magallanes region (Córdova 3, Estero Retroceso and Morgan). All three of Australis’ Magallanes farms involved in the sanctioning process are located within the Kawésqar National Reserve. The new case in Punta Lobos joins cases of alleged overproduction at Australis’ Córdova 3, Morgan, Estero Retroceso, and Costa farms.\n\n“Regarding the SMA notification on alleged faults at the Punta Lobos farming center, located in the Magallanes region, related to a production cycle begun in 2017, the company is reviewing the background information that the authority has provided us to-date in order to collaborate and provide all the information that is necessary, thus building a correct and timely proposal for the compliance program if the observed deviations are confirmed,” Australis said in a statement sent to SeafoodSource.\n\nAccording to current Chilean salmon-farming regulations, companies facing sanctions can agree to join an improvement program, which must include measures aimed at promoting satisfactory compliance with all environmental regulations. If Chilean authorities approve the proposal and the company adheres to the plan for a set period of time, the administrative sanction can be waived.\n\nHowever, in the same accusatory document, SMA said it had also detected overproduction in the current cycle underway at Punta Lobos, which began in October 2021 and which is expected to end in January 2023. In August 2022, SMA found the Punta Lobos center had reached 4,443 MT of biomass, exceeding its limit by 123 MT, or 3 percent over the allowed maximum in its permitting documents.\n\n“It should be noted that the previous cycle (2017-2019) reached overproduction at 14 months, out of a total period of 18 months, obtaining an average harvest weight of 7.3 kilograms. In the case of the current cycle (2021-2023), overproduction was reached in the eleventh month, obtaining an average weight of 3.7 kilograms for each specimen, so it is highly likely that upon reaching the end of the current cycle, the Punta Lobos grow-out center will register even higher levels than the overproduction registered in the 2017-2019 cycle,” the document, which was signed by Jaime Jeldres García, the investigating prosecutor in SMA’s Department of Sanctions and Compliance, said.\n\nThe two infractions attributed to Australis at the Punta Lobos center are categorized by SMA as serious, meaning the company faces a punishment that could include the revocation of the farm’s environmental permit, immediate closure of the farm, and a fine of up to the equivalent of CLP 3.62 billion (USD 3.9 million, EUR 3.9 million).\n\nAccording to the SMA document, yet another breach detected by Sernapesca at Punta Lobos in March 2022 is related to the non-authorized use of physical mechanisms for the application of nanobubbles to modify oxygen levels in the farming center’s seabed. This, however, is considered a lesser infraction compared to overproduction.\n\nAmid growing questions in Chile around the environmental sustainability of the country’s USD 5.2 billion (EUR 5.2 billion) salmon-farming industry, including by Chile President Gabriel Boric, regulatory authorities have stepped up their scrutiny of the industry’s operations. In July 2022, SMA filed a complaint against salmon farmer Marine Farm for overproduction and alteration of the seabed at operations of the salmon grow-out center Isla Partida, located in the Aysén region.\n\nIn a separate case, Punta Arenas, Chile-based salmon farmer Nova Austral faces sanctions that may cost it up to 20 percent of its total production capacity. After determining the farmer had overproduced at three of its centers – Cockburn 14, Cockburn 23, and Aracena 10 – SMA moved to revoke the environmental licenses for the three farms, all located in the Alberto de Agostini National Park. Nova Austral has said it may be forced to shut down its Chilean operations if the sanctions are implemented.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Chile’s Superintendency of the Environment",
    "Urfa Chile Makes Everything Better, Including This Chocolate Bar": "This is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to what people in the food industry are obsessed with eating, drinking, and buying right now.\n\nDried chiles were a staple in my household, and my mother always kept three kinds in our pantry: pul biber (flaked chile), kırmızı toz biber (powdered chile), and Urfa biber. The latter, also known as Urfa chile, is my absolute favorite of the three. It’s a souvenir I bring back in bulk whenever I visit my family in Turkey, and I use it on almost everything: Turkish-style poached eggs, fresh salads and mezze, and even leftover pizza. Grown in the hills surrounding Urfa in southeastern Turkey, it’s a purplish-black spice that packs a smoky kick and subtle sweetness, adding serious depth and nuance to any dish or snack—including my favorite Spring & Mulberry chocolate bar.\n\nThere are a lot of fancy chocolates on the market, but Spring & Mulberry is the one I always keep stocked in my snack cabinet. Made with 72% cacao and sweetened only with dates, Spring & Mulberry’s chocolate bars comes in five flavors: Pure Dark Chocolate; Mixed Berry; Medjool Date, Pecan, and Himalayan Salt; Lavender, Bee Pollen, and Rose Petal; and—my go-to—Mango, Urfa Chili, Black Lime.\n\nEach chocolate bar is visually striking, with flecks of smoky Urfa chili flakes from Spicewalla and succulent mango slices pressed into the bar like mosaic tiles. The first time I picked one up at dinner party shop Big Night in Brooklyn, I thought, “Maybe it’ll taste like chocolate-covered dried mangoes.” But when I snapped a piece off and popped it into my mouth, it summoned a bewitching savory sweetness followed by a delightful kick, unlocking a core memory. That one bite transported me right back to my mother's kitchen, where I could always smell the spice in the air.\n\nThanks to the generous amount of dried fruit, the chocolate bar itself is pretty hefty. While I have eaten a whole bar in a single sitting, two squares are usually more than enough to satisfy if I’m in need of a chocolate pick-me-up. The combination of the chocolate and mango tastes heavenly, but it’s the Urfa chili flakes that seal the deal for me. With each bite, I’m reminded of my summers in Turkey—even if I’m just sitting on the couch with my partner in Newark.",
    "Why we failed to approve the new Chilean constitution": "On 4 September, Chile voted to reject a new constitution to replace the current one, which was written under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Although 78% of voters approved changing the constitution in a referendum in 2020, the plebiscite in 2022 faced a significant rejection. After that turmoil, the country needs to address the need for cultural transformation, María Carrasco (Atlantic Fellow for Social and Economic Equity, LSE) argues.\n\nThe people that voted to approve the new constitution on the plebiscite on 4 September, including myself, feel disappointed, hopeless, and incredibly shocked. The result was astonishing, as in the previous decade, it seemed like the tide was changing in Chile and that people wanted change.\n\nWe have witnessed social movements leading to a paradigm shift in education, environmental movements stopping the approval of a controversial hydroelectric megaproject, and feminist movements leading to the passing of a bill on the legalisation of abortion. Even the original referendum on whether a new constitution should be written was approved by almost 80% of the electorate in October 2020. So, why did Chileans reject the new constitution despite all of this?\n\nThe plausible reasons\n\nHow can a country that approved writing a new constitution with a 78.27% majority now reject it with a 61.86% majority? Some possible reasons why Chileans rejected the constitution are the progressive aspect of the text, where plurinationality was particularly controversial; the national convention’s lack of capacity to include the right-wing in the negotiation and definition of the rights; lack of legitimacy due to problematic behaviour of some convention member, including lying about having cancer to get elected; the ambiguity of the text and its complexity; and a division among the centre-left on whether to approve or reject the new constitution (Molina P. , 2020).\n\nIn addition, several obstacles made it harder for voters to understand and learn about the constitutional content. For example, fake news and disinformation were shared on social media ahead of the vote. So much so that even a member of the U.S Congress called attention to the problem on his social media channels. Another obstacle was the uneven access to resources between the two campaigns, where 89% of all private donations were given to the rejection campaign and only 11% to the approval campaign.\n\nThe emergence of new voters\n\nEven considering all the plausible reasons, the difference between the two votes was still astonishing. So, what explains the shift?\n\nThe data below shows that a new group of voters emerged in the second voting. For the first time in the history of Chile, all citizens were automatically registered to vote, as voting was compulsory. This resulted in the highest voter turnout in recent history, reaching 85.82%. The same analysis shows a substantial increase in voter turnout in all regions, especially in the north and the south of the country. In fact, following the analysis of NGO Decide Chile, more than 4.8 million people voted this time that hadn’t voted in the previous elections.\n\nData also shows that almost the same number of people voted for the current progressive left-wing president in 2021 as for approving the new constitution. Even more, the conventional member’s election turnout was only 43.35%, while the last referendum turnout was 85.3%, representing an over 100% increase. These numbers show the huge impact that the group of new voters had on the voting. In the end, the 55.6% increase in voter turnout determined the referendum result.",
