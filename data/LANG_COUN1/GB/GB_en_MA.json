    "A Look At PauknAir Flight 4101's Crash In Morocco": "The story of how a Spanish BAE 146 crashed in North Africa, killing all passengers and crew.\n\nExactly 24 years ago yesterday, a PauknAir British Aerospace 146 with the registration EC-GEO crashed short of Melilla Airport (MLN) in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on the Moroccan coast. With an area of just 4.7 square miles and a population of 87,000, Melilla is one of two autonomous Spanish cities in Morocco, the other being Ceuta.\n\nThe plane involved in the crash was the seventh BAe 146 ever built, making its first flight in 1983 before being delivered new to British Airways. A year later, the plane went to Dan-Air London. It later went into storage for several years before being acquired by Spanish regional airline PauknAir in 1995.\n\nThe plane departed Malaga for North Africa early in the morning\n\nOn September 25, 1998, the plane took off from what is now Malaga Costa del Sol Airport (AGP) for the short 129-mile hop over the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the coast of Morocco.\n\nIt takes around 55 minutes to fly from Malaga to Melilla. Image GCmaps\n\nIn charge of the flight was 39-year-old Captain Diego Clavero Muñoz, assisted by 28-year-old First Officer Bartolomé Jiménez.\n\nFlight 4101 departed Malaga at 07:25 local time and climbed to a cruising altitude of 14,000 feet. The co-pilot then contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Seville, asking for clearance to descend to 7,000 feet which was approved. Two minutes later, the now inbound aircraft was cleared to descend a further 2,000 to flight level FL 50 and contact Melilla tower for instructions. During the conversation, the co-pilot informed Melilla Tower that they were 30 nautical miles out, descending to 5,000 feet.\n\nThe BAE 146 that crashed was the 7th of its type built. Photo: Uli Elch via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nMelilla Tower reported that Runway 33 was in use with visibility of five miles and a few clouds at 1,000 feet with five knots of wind. At 06:45 Moroccan time, the co-pilot told Melilla Tower that they were now at 3,000 feet, 22 nautical miles from the runway. As the descent continued, the aircraft crossed the Moroccan coast at an altitude of 1,100 feet.\n\nThe area is impacted by low clouds\n\nBecause of Melilla Airport's location on Cape Tres Forcas, visibility is often a problem as clouds accumulate in the steep valleys formed by the mountains of the cape. As the descent into Melilla continued flying under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the pilot complained of fog and could be heard saying, \"I see nothing.\" At 06:49, the GPWS alarm warned the pilots that they were dangerously close to the ground. At about 890 feet, the GPWS alarm sounded again, \"Whoop, whoop, Pull Up, Whoop, whoop, Pull Up.\" At 06:50, the aircraft impacted the ground at 886 feet, killing all 38 passengers and crew.\n\nEl 25-09-1998, hace 23 años hoy, un avión #BAE146 (EC-GEO) de la compañía española #PauknAir, se estrelló contra una montaña 8 millas al Norte del Aeropuerto de #Melilla.

Hoy, descansan en Paz y para siempre ➡ pic.twitter.com/zMXkjYo58Y — Iván Castro Palacios (@ivancp25) September 25, 2021\n\nThe investigation into the crash of PauknAir Flight 4101\n\nIn its final report into the incident, the accident investigation concluded that the crash was due to impact with terrain while flying under IMC conditions. The crash was put down as being a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), listing several contributing factors, which were:\n\nThe non-application of arrival procedures, including descending below a safe altitude.\n\nPoor working communication between the captain and first officer.\n\nA non-application of guidelines regarding the ground proximity warning system (GPWS).",

    "Morocco combats the needs by importing more than 5 million tonnes of cereals": "In a context where Ukraine, one of the main wheat producers, is at war, and in a situation of climatic emergency, the Moroccan government has also seen an increase in cereal shortages. For this reason, Morocco has implemented a series of measures to avoid shortages and the impact on the local market. In this sense, the Kingdom has increased the number of grain suppliers.\n\nCountries such as Argentina and France will be new suppliers to the country. Both nations will join the list of more than 25 countries to which the Alawi kingdom opened up in 2021 to guarantee the supply of domestic needs. The state of grain stocks in Europe and Argentina for the 2022/2023 season would be assured, according to projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forestry. In addition, they add that the harvest data for these countries for this new year are encouraging and remain stable.\n\nTo this we must add the cereal produced within the country. According to data from the balance of the previous season, more than 34 million quintals were produced. This includes 18.9 million quintals of soft wheat, 8.1 million quintals of durum wheat and 7 million quintals of barley. The government also granted a premium for imported grain from November 2021.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - Grain\n\nThese volumes of grain can be imported thanks to the large number of global grain shippers with whom the Moroccan government cooperates. According to Intercereales (a group of French cereal exporters), \"imports of common wheat would be 4.5 to 5 million tonnes next year due to the drought. France has already delivered nearly one million quintals of wheat during the summer months, according to Yann Lebeau, head of the group of professionals in the Maghreb region at Intercereales in a press release. By the end of this year, the country is expected to receive a total of 2.5 million quintals of wheat from France. Thanks to this strategy of diversification of cereal sources, Morocco has been shielded from external fluctuations, due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which are, respectively, the second and third largest supplier of soft wheat to the Kingdom, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the collaboration of the agencies concerned and the country's government is working to meet the country's five-month consumption needs. Tensions in certain parts of the country complicate the situation. The objective of the measures imposed by the Executive is to mitigate the impact on the purchasing power of citizens due to the rise in prices and the inflation rate. The significant increase in Morocco's import bill is linked to products such as barley and soybean oil. The increase in prices rose compared to the previous year by 47.4%, in the case of barley by as much as 820 %. Foods such as sugar, tea and edible oils, which are considered staples, would be the first to be affected by the measures, according to the Royal High Guidelines. Possible scenarios for stockpiling of staple food stocks, such as those mentioned above, were also set out and an inventory of existing storage facilities for both raw materials and finished products was discussed.\n\nPHOTO/AFP - Terminal I of the port of Tangier Med\n\nIn his speech to Parliament on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the first legislative year, King Mohammed VI called for the implementation of a policy of stockpiling strategic commodities, \"we will first of all stress the necessary consolidation of Morocco's position and the imperative defence of its superior interests, particularly in the current situation which brings with it challenges, risks and threats. Indeed, the pandemic crisis has revealed the strong return of the sovereignty issue. Whether it be health, energy, industrial, food or other, the preservation of sovereignty has become the subject of a real competition, which is causing some people to react feverishly\".",
    "Morocco: Free activist Rida Benotmane immediately and drop all charges against him": "Ahead of tomorrow’s hearing by a court in Rabat on the case of human rights defender Rida Benotmane, who is being prosecuted for criticising the authorities on YouTube and Facebook, Amna Guellali, Deputy director for Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International said:\n\n\n\n“The only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos. His case is just the latest attempt by the authorities to use absurd prosecutions to silence critical voices and highlights the worrying crackdown in Morocco on freedom of expression.\n\nThe only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos Amna Guellali, Amnesty International\n\n\n\n“Rida Benotmane should be freed immediately and these bogus charges against him dropped. The Moroccan authorities must ensure that people are able to exercise their freedom of expression without fear of reprisals.”\n\n\n\nAmnesty International has reviewed court files showing that the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) in Casablanca interrogated Rida Benotmane over a Facebook post he published on 13 September 2021, which called for a public march against abuses by security forces. Police also questioned him over two YouTube videos published in August 2021, in which he denounced the authorities for ignoring people’s demands for social justice and warned against the potential use of COVID vaccine passes as a tool of repression.\n\nBenotmane was arrested on 9 September and charged the next day with “insulting a body regulated by law”, “insulting public officials while carrying out their duties”, and “broadcasting and distributing false allegations without consent” under articles 265, 263, and 447-2 of the Penal Code respectively. He was also charged with breaching the decree law on the state of health emergency. He will appear before the Rabat first instance court on 22 September.\n\nBenotmane, a member of the Moroccan Association for the defense of human rights (AMDH) and a political activist who has already spent four years in jail, is currently on hunger strike in protest at his detention.\n\nBackground\n\nMoroccan authorities have increasingly targeted dissenting voices in recent months.\n\nIn April 2022, Saida el Alami, a human rights defender and member of the “Femmes Marocaines Contre la Detention Politique” collective, was sentenced to two years in prison for posting about her ill-treatment by the police and for criticizing the repression of journalists and activists. Blogger Rabie al-Ablaq was also sentenced in the same month to four years in prison for offending the king in two videos posted on social media.",

She was 81.\n\nBorn in Casablanca in 1941, Aïcha Chenna is an emblematic figure of activism for single mothers' rights in the North African country.\n\nAmid a societal context that shames, neglects and casts out single mothers and children born out of wedlock in Morocco, Chenna has decided to embrace and empower them, breaking a long-standing taboo.\n\nIn 1985, Chenna founded the Association Solidarité Féminine (ASF), the first Moroccan association to help single mothers.\n\nMorocco 🇲🇦 lost a great lady today.

    "The Farce of Normalization: A Taste of Morocco and a Sip of \"Israel\"": "Normalizing ties with \"Israel\" is the official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions.\n\nCanada’s leading Zionist lobby group held its annual parliamentary reception on September 20, 2022, and dedicated it to the \"Abraham Accords\" and in particular, the growing ties between Morocco and \"Israel\". The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) picked up where they left off before Covid shut down such in-person events; and their Twitter feed was full of photos of various parliamentarians, including Canadian cabinet ministers, who attended the reception.\n\n“A taste of Morocco and a sip of Israel” was the theme for the night and highlighted the shameful normalization between the two. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada was there, and the Moroccan embassy itself was a cosponsor of the event along with the Israeli embassy. Interestingly, on its official Facebook account, the Moroccan embassy downplayed the other cosponsors and made no explicit mention of the involvement of \"Israel\" and its lobby group in organizing the reception, simply saying “Morocco guest of honor of the 2022 annual successful parliamentary reception, held this evening in Ottawa..”.\n\nHistorically, Morocco always had strong ties with successive Israeli governments, especially under the late King Hassan II. Ties that included information and intelligence exchange and as early as 1963, Mossad was reported to have opened an office in Morocco. Israeli intelligence officials later stated that King Hassan had passed them secret recordings of Arab leaders’ discussions at the 1965 Casablanca summit, which gave them a strategic advantage and helped \"Israel\" win the 1967 war.\n\nAnd in March 2013, Morocco acquired three Heron drones equipped with Israeli systems that had been routed through France and then transferred to the Moroccan Air Force after being painted in the appropriate colors.\n\nBut the new accord, signed in December 2020, can and will build on those ties and is hoping to cultivate $250 million worth of Israeli exports and business opportunities. Additionally, Israeli media speculated that “Morocco entered into a free trade agreement with Africa in early 2021, meaning it could also serve as a gateway to increasing trade with African countries in general.”\n\nNone of this treachery, however, seems to have disqualified Morocco as the chair of the Jerusalem Committee for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nAnd now to the “sip of Israel”, which was of course Israeli wines. Most Israeli wines sold in Canada are linked to the illegal settlement enterprise; additionally, Canada still does not require any specific labeling of which wines are settlement products. According to CIJA, attendees to the reception came from “all parties”, and included the New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh, despite his recent affirmation to “end all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements...”.\n\nDid these parliamentarians and other guests in attendance know they were legitimizing the theft and plunder of Palestinian resources? Did any bother to question the wine that was being served? Did the Moroccan representatives and other foreign dignitaries know or care?\n\nHerein lies the real reasons that the Israeli government and its US sponsor are pushing the so-called Abraham Accords. They present the lie of “friendship” between certain Arab countries and \"Israel\" to the rest of the world and use it to further legitimize Israeli apartheid and everything it stands for. Arab regimes like Morocco get added international recognition and, in this case, support for their own occupation of Western Sahara and its huge mineral reserves. And Western politicians then join in the chorus and become the cheerleaders for such policies.\n\nAnd this is why activists across the world are adamant in denouncing this new “normalization” and are clear that it is a betrayal of the long-held aspirations of the people of the region. The so-called Abraham Accords are not the “brave success story for peace” that \"Israel\" and the Zionist lobby like to portray; rather they are an official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions. We must say NO to such normalization!",

    "Palestinian cause remains at forefront of Morocco’s political, diplomatic and humanitarian action – The North Africa Post": "The Palestinian issue and the status of Al-Quds city remain at the center of Moroccan’s concerns, and hold and will continue to hold an important place in the political, diplomatic and humanitarian action of the Kingdom under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee.\n\nThe remarks were made by Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita during the Annual Coordination Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), held on the sidelines of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe position of Morocco was and will remain clear and constant vis-à-vis the Palestinian issue which enjoys a special interest among all Moroccans, the minister said, recalling that this position was behind the call of the late king Hassan II to the leaders of Islamic countries, in 1969, to hold the historic first Islamic Summit in Rabat, which led to the creation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\n\nLike all brotherly Islamic countries, the Kingdom has emphasized that the Palestinian cause remains at the heart of the organization’s concerns, Bourita said.\n\nComprehensive peace in the region cannot be achieved unless the Palestinian people benefit from its legitimate rights, including the establishment of an independent state, with Al-Quds as its capital, within the framework of the two-state solution and under the relevant international resolutions, the FM stated.\n\nIn this context, Bourita insisted that Morocco will continue its efforts, using its capabilities and its distinguished relations with all the parties and all the international powers endeavoring to ensure the right conditions for the resumption of negotiations, which are the only way to end the conflict and ensure peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\nThe FM also recalled that the Bayt Mal Al Quds agency has carried out, under the personal supervision of King Mohammed VI, many projects in the areas of housing, education and social action to help improve the living conditions of the Holy City’s inhabitants, support their resistance and preserve the civilizational and spiritual aspects of Al-Quds, given its place as a crossroads of the three monotheistic religions, common heritage of humanity and land of cohabitation.\n\nBourita stressed that the Organization is called upon to meet the challenges posed by an international situation marked by several upheavals, which affect the lives of all peoples of the Islamic Ummah.\n\nIn this connection, he said the political issues facing the organization should not overshadow the social and developmental issues that are the basis for consolidating cooperation and promoting trade among member countries to raise them to the expected level, meet the challenges posed and overcome the economic crises.\n\nThe Minister welcomed, in this regard, the accession of the Organization’s countries to the Trade Preferential System among the OIC Member States as well as the action taken by the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (COMCEC).\n\nThis system is likely to strengthen the capacities of the member countries to establish fruitful partnerships and consolidate joint Islamic action.\n\nRegarding the reform of the Joint Islamic Action System, Bourita emphasized the imperative of pursuing this momentum within the framework of a partnership vision based on the convergence of views among the member countries, to promote Islamic action and develop its methods and mechanisms.",

    "Morocco remains firm in its commitment to curb illegal immigration to Europe": "Morocco has managed to frustrate more than 40,000 irregular migration attempts to Europe so far this year, a situation that reaffirms the Kingdom's commitment to managing migration. To this end, the Moroccan authorities made more than 7,000 arrests of immigrants trying to cross the border into European territory.\n\nFor Khalid Zerouali, Director of Immigration and Border Surveillance at the Moroccan Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), this action is a declaration of intent on the part of the Kingdom with respect to its fight against this type of migration, pointing out that these figures \"show conclusive results\" on which to base this commitment.\n\nREUTERS/JON NAZCA - Migrants run towards the fence separating Morocco from Spain\n\nAlthough he added that \"the fact that there is a decrease in arrivals on the Spanish coast does not mean that the pressure here in Morocco has decreased\".\n\nIt was he himself who provided these figures in a recent interview with Agencia EFE.

    "MOROCCO: Abengoa, intends to sell its shares in the Agadir desalination plant": "Nothing is certain for the moment. But according to the Spanish daily El Economista, Abengoa intends to sell its shares in the Agadir seawater desalination plant that it built. This information comes barely four months after the end of the contractual tests on the new plant. This decision would be justified by the financial difficulties that Abengoa has been facing since 2016. This led to the company being placed in receivership in February 2020, according to the Spanish newspaper.\n\nA 30-year PPP at stake\n\nSeveral groups and investment funds have already shown their interest in the Spanish giant Abengoa. This is the case of its colleague Acciona or the French group Engie which is implementing a desalination project in the Casablanca-Settat region. When contacted by AFRIK 21, Abengoa officials did not confirm this share sale project. But they do not deny the existence of a transaction in progress for Abengoa’s factory in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nIn addition to the construction of the desalination plant, Abengoa was to operate the Agadir desalination plant over a period of 30 years under the terms of a public-private partnership (PPP) signed with the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (Onee) and the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fishing, Rural Development and Water and Forests.\n\nAbengoa financed the desalination project for 41 billion Moroccan dirhams (nearly €3.9 billion) with its local partner InfraMaroc, an investment fund launched by CDG Capital and backed by Morocco’s Caisse de dépôt et de gestion (CDG). The new facility is capable of supplying 275,000 m3 of water per day, divided between the needs of the population of Greater Agadir (150,000 m3 per day) and the irrigation (125,000 m3 per day) of agricultural land. These plantations are located in the Chtouka plain, a large market gardening area. This capacity is expandable to 400,000 m3 per day. The project has also enabled the construction of an irrigation network for an area of 15,000 hectares.\n\nInès Magoum",

    "British growers consider moving production to Morocco": "British producers of fruits and vegetables are considering shifting their operations to warmer countries, including Morocco. Chief Executive of the British Growers Association Jack Ward suspects that the European production of fruit and vegetables will move south: \"We will move production further and further south, down through Spain and into Morocco and bits of Africa.\"\n\nThe ongoing surge in energy prices has prompted farmers in northern and western Europe to suspend or cut their activities. Ward argues that the rising production costs are set to impact the growth of crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers that require heated greenhouses during winter. The production of apples, onions, and endives which necessitate cold storage of crops, will also be impacted. Excessive energy bills and fertilizer prices have heavily impacted growers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain.\n\nAs European agricultural producers turn to Morocco to increase their profit margin amid a serious economic crisis, some French and Spanish farmers continue to protest the importation of Moroccan fruits and vegetables, questioning the quality of the goods.\n\nSource: moroccoworldnews.com",

The all-new Caravan Agafay will open in October as a stunning new escape in Morocco.\n\nInspired by Burning Man's imagination and spiritually connected experience, Caravan Agafay will support nomad Bedouin culture while embracing the local traditions of communal living. With a focus on an immersive glamping experience, the property will span 12 acres and feature 20 beautifully designed Moroccan canvas wall tents, all with views of the Atlas Mountains. Travelers will enjoy a gourmet restaurant using locally sourced ingredients, two swimming pools, a horse & camel stable, outdoor cinema, and a yoga/wellness center.\n\nSwimming pool at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI spoke with Oliver Ripley, the CEO of Habitas, about what inspired him to open a new property in Morocco. \"Morocco has always been a destination we wanted to bring Habitas to,\" he said. \"As a country rich in diverse culture, nature, history and with very warm and welcoming people, we felt it aligned perfectly with our vision: human connection, authentic experiences, learning, and discovery.\"\n\n\"As with all our 'homes,' the sense of discovery and exploration for our guests is crucial. Morocco embraces this with a high sense of adventure, from the cities of Marrakech and Casablanca to the Atlas Mountains, the Saharan desert to the rich coastline. While Marrakech is well known globally, Agafay is an unknown secret a short distance away.\"\n\nNomadic glamping at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\n\"Our new desert retreat is close to Marrakech and within close proximity to Europe and allows guests to immerse fully with the desert and experience local tribes, culture, and programming. The desert holds very special energy and the respect we have for her. Our guests can enjoy rich adventure programming, magical sunrises and sunsets, communal dining experiences, traditional wellness including horse therapy, and authentic connections with the local community.\"\n\n\"Caravan Agafay is just the beginning for us in this enchanting country. We are already working on several more locations in Morocco that will create connections between locals and visitors, sharing Moroccan hospitality (who are kind, welcoming people with big smiles!).\"\n\nExterior view of Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\nThe Agafay Desert is a barren, rocky landscape and one of the country’s last remaining expanses of natural desert. Visitors come for horse-riding, dune-gazing, canoeing on Takerkoust Dam, visiting local mud-built Berber villages, and marvel at the sight of nomads and sheepherders in the distance. This is the perfect escape from the bustle of Marrakech, where you can truly experience life as a nomad.\n\nA typical day of adventure in this remote area could include visiting the valleys of Imlil, Ait Mizan, Ait Souka, and Asni and trekking to the Toubkal waterfall. Visit Tahnaout town market, where they make Argan Oil from the local nuts, and take a traditional camel voyage to Moulay Brahim Valley.\n\nCaravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI am a huge fan of Habitas and its focus on creating a diverse community of people, all seeking human connection and authentic experiences while creating a better future together. With the concept of creating unique luxury resorts, they have minimal impact on the surroundings while focusing on the people to make deeper human connections. They also directly impact local communities through education, employment, and the creation of sustainable micro-economies. Habitas currently has unique properties in Mexico, Namibia, and Saudi Arabia and is expanding with more destinations across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nPoolside at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\n\n\n",
    "Is Tunisia Abandoning Morocco for Algeria?": "For decades, Tunisia has looked on, maintaining its neutral stance as both sides jockeyed for dominance. However, by appearing to have unilaterally invited Brahim Ghali, the Polisario leader and president of the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, to a conference it was holding in tandem with Japan, that neutrality has come into question. Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe Polisario Front, with Algerian support, has been fighting to secure independence for the disputed territory of the Western Sahara since 1973, a move fiercely contested by Morocco since it claimed the territory in dramatic fashion two years later, when some 350,000 flag-carrying Moroccans crossed the desert in Rabat’s “Green March” and essentially forced Spain to hand it over. Fleeing the Moroccan advance, the local population, the Sahrawis, headed for Algeria, eventually settling in a cluster of refugee camps near Tindouf, where they have remained since.\n\nPower balances in North Africa are shifting. The latest indication that Algeria’s star is rising—along with European demand for its natural gas—as Moroccan influence wanes was all but confirmed by Tunisia’s decision to include the leader of the Western Sahara independence movement the Polisario Front in an investment conference, a move seemingly designed to ruffle feathers in Morocco.\n\nPower balances in North Africa are shifting.

Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe details of the invitation are opaque at best. The conference, the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development, was staged in Tunisia, where Ghali flew in to be met, as with other leaders, off the plane by Tunisian President Kais Saied.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview.\n\nHis presence appeared to take many by surprise, not least Morocco, which swiftly issued furious missives of the “hurt” caused to the Moroccan people by Tunis’s action. Ambassadors were withdrawn by both countries while Morocco’s newspapers denounced Tunisia’s shortcomings.\n\nSaied and his foreign ministry claimed surprise at the reaction, citing a circular from the African Union, which extended the invitation to all leaders, including Ghali. A statement was issued by the foreign ministry, reaffirming the country’s total neutrality in line with international law, stating, “This position will not change until the concerned parties find a peaceful solution acceptable to all.”\n\nSaied’s ultimate goal remains a matter for speculation. However, with Algeria proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s seemingly endless economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algiers’ rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughts.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview. Criticism of Rabat’s deal over the territory with the former Trump administration as well as allowing access to the country’s medical facilities have led to diplomatic breakdowns with Germany and Spain, with the latter also getting dragged into a spying scandal.\n\nSpeaking just before the conference, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI used a televised address to send what he said was a clear message to the world, telling viewers, “The Sahara issue is the prism through which Morocco views its international environment.”\n\nAs recently as December 2020, Morocco’s position appeared assured. Washington had agreed to formally recognize Rabat’s claim to the Western Sahara in return for a corresponding nod to Israel. Spain and Germany, both former critics of the kingdom’s relations with the Sahrawis, had reconciled with the kingdom, supporting Rabat’s plan to establish some form of semi-autonomous government within the region, a move resisted by the Sahrawi people, who insisted on a referendum to determine the area’s fate.\n\nHowever, with European gas prices soaring, Algeria—Europe’s third-largest gas supplier (after Russia and Norway) and the Polisario Front’s chief backer—is also enjoying a diplomatic renaissance. European politicians and regional power brokers are all enjoying a renewed interest in Algiers, with Tunisia’s Saied among them. His July visit secured the reopening of land borders, closed two years earlier to contain the spread of COVID-19, allowing Algerian families to travel into Tunisia and support Tunisia’s ill-fated tourism industry. Tunis also relies on Algeria for its own gas, buying it at a discounted price, as well as receiving revenue for the transport of Algerian gas across its territory, bound for Sicily and then the rest of Europe.\n\n“The war in Ukraine and its impacts on Europe in terms of gas supplies reposition Algeria as an important player in the western Mediterranean,” Raouf Farrah, a senior analyst with Global Initiative told Foreign Policy. “Rabat is more worried about this than its ability to obtain gas supplies at competitive prices following the closure of the [Gazoduc Maghreb Europe] pipeline, which used to supply Spain via Morocco.”\n\nThe plight of the Sahrawis is one of the world’s longest-standing refugee crises. Since 1975, thousands of Sahrawis have been sheltering in the Algerian desert, waiting for the opportunity to return home. The violent campaign fought by Polisario against Rabat was brought to an approximate end in 1991 with a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, providing for a fractious peace. However, even that appears uncertain, with clashes between the Polisario Front and Morocco increasing over the last two years.\n\nWith Algiers proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algeria’s rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughtsMeanwhile, the U.N. estimates that around 90,000 “vulnerable refugees” are sheltering in the desert, relying on international aid just for their daily food and shelter. Relocating the refugees has proven a fraught problem for all concerned, with political and economic problems all serving as a break on progress.\n\nAlthough some infrastructure exists, with the refugees operating a state in exile, Bahia Awah, a Sahrawi writer and poet, told Foreign Policy—from what he described as his exile in Spain—that life remained difficult. “Weather conditions are especially adverse in this part of southern Algeria, where temperatures in summer can reach up to more than of 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), which causes casualties among the elderly, children, and pregnant women.”\n\nWhile Algeria’s clout may have been boosted for now, how much difference that will make to a dispute the U.S. government weighed in on in dramatic fashion at the end of the Trump administration remains unclear. For Jonathan Hill, a historian from King’s College London, the fate of the Western Sahara and the Sahrawis has, over the decades, morphed from a pragmatic problem to an unswerving policy position and, as such, risks becoming intractable.\n\n“The problem really is one of leadership,” he said. “In 1976, at the time of the Green March, there was a practical problem that everyone recognized needed a solution.

However, the fact that Tunis made that pivot at all speaks directly to the new order now taking shape within the region—whether the Sahrawis benefit from that or not.",

    "A youth between Morocco and Spain": "Young Moroccans talk to us about how they carry their sense of dual identity and their relationship with Morocco\n\nCarrying a piece of Morocco with them is one of the major defining features of the Moroccan diaspora living in the European Union. A diaspora that, as well as within Morocco, has youth as its protagonist, not only in the present but also in its future.\n\n\n\nThe recent survey commissioned by the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME) from the polling institute IPSOS, published in mid-September, once again focused the media spotlight on 18-35 year-olds. A group known in Morocco as the 'invisible electoral force'. Generally uninterested in Moroccan democratic processes, imprisoned in a sense of dual identity, which some cope with better than others, but also optimistic and hopeful of a future in Europe with opportunities they believe are out of reach in Morocco.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Moroccan youths walking in a street in the capital Rabat on September 12, 2018\n\nIf Morocco's own youth is a challenge for Aziz Akhannouch's current government, as is often raised in the Maghreb country, it is rarely seen in the same light in Spain. \"Once you finish your studies in Spain as a non-EU foreigner, it's as if for the institutions the road is over\", sums up Sohaib N., a young Tangier-born 28-year-old resident in Madrid who came here 10 years ago to study journalism in Madrid. \"Coming here for fun or for a while is easy. But to work is not so easy. Nothing is made easier by the administration\", adds the young man, who is trying to maintain his situation in Spain in a regular way, without having the slightest intention for the moment of applying for Spanish nationality.\n\n\n\n\"I've never considered asking for nationality, it's not that important to me. Having residency is enough for me\", explains Sohaib, for whom his identity is not defined by a document or a piece of paper. As he says, his upbringing has made him someone with an ambiguous identity. A childhood in Tangiers, fully immersed in Spanish culture through television, internet, school, did not make him feel like a foreigner when he arrived in Spain. And when he returns to Morocco, he feels as Moroccan as the rest. \"I feel in the middle of the two identities\", says the young journalist, a feeling he shares with 70% of those surveyed in Spain by the CCME study. A feeling that rises to 80% in France and 84% in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nThis is also the case of Meriem F., from Agadir, who moved to Spain 8 years ago for love and who says she feels more and more like a foreigner in Morocco. It is no longer just a question of how she feels she is perceived by others, but almost a question of comfort in her own country. \"Sometimes it even pisses me off\", explains Meriem, for whom the administration's services are a clear example of what bothers her most in Morocco. She is one of the 71% of the community that feels like a foreigner back in Morocco after a long period in Spain. Meriem wants to apply for Spanish nationality in two years' time. With the nationality, she wants to be able to participate in the Spanish electoral processes, in which she shows great interest, according to 51% of those surveyed by the CCME. \"Moroccans in Spain are a collective. We pay our taxes, we pay contributions. Of course I would like to be able to vote\", says Meriem, who also feels more than integrated in Logroño, where she lives. \"There are many cases of discrimination that do nothing to help Moroccans integrate. I understand that there are people who can't, but in my case I have overcome them. I no longer feel like a foreigner here\", adds the young businesswoman, who is working to make a small brand of handmade and natural cosmetic products prosper in collaboration with her mother from Agadir.\n\nHanan El. and Riyan H are the two youngest interviewees and both have Spanish nationality. Both are studying and, in the case of Hanan, also working. For Hanan, who had to ask for it, the essential thing is the freedom it gives. \"It's not just for travelling, it's for everything,\" explains the young woman, who specialises in fashion design. \"To work and to study everything is much easier if it is with the nationality\". Hanan defines that rather than having a \"double identity\", she feels that she is neither on one side nor the other. \"Most of the Moroccans I know were born here in Spain, but they don't feel Spanish. But neither do they feel Moroccan\".\n\nAP/MOSA’AB ELSHAMY - Informal school run by Moroccan fashion designer Fadila El Gadi, in Sale, near Rabat\n\nSomething that these four young people of Moroccan origin agree on is one of the most striking features of the CCME's report on the interest shown by the diaspora in Moroccan electoral processes. If they all claim to be regularly informed about what is happening in Morocco, they also assume that they have no interest in wanting to vote in Morocco or in learning more about its politics. According to the CCME study, only 9% of those surveyed in Spain indicated a desire to participate in Moroccan elections, the second highest figure of the six countries surveyed.\n\nThe gap between politics and young people crosses borders. In Morocco, the low turnout of 18-29 year olds in the elections is one of the headlines that make the front pages every time. Around 30% of the Moroccan population is in the 18-29 age group and a further 27 % is under 14 years of age. The 18-24 turnout in the September 2021 elections was only a meagre 3%. It rose to 19% for 25-34, according to figures available in the Moroccan press.\n\nIf neither residents in Morocco nor residents in Spain are interested in these processes, it is mainly due to the lack of accessibility to them. \"I have never voted in my life,\" Sohaib confesses. \"I think that I and the other young people don't feel involved\", adds the Tangier journalist. In his opinion, the political parties make no effort to present their electoral programmes. \"I don't think it doesn't do much good. That's my conviction. I have always seen it as an archaic system,\" Sohaib concludes.\n\nRiyan, 20, a student of an intermediate degree in administration, has a very similar feeling to Sohaib. \"It's not something I find accessible. That's why I'm not interested in elections in Morocco or politics in general. I would still like to see a lot of changes, especially for young people,\" says the young student.\n\nIn addition to the low interest in politics and elections, this age group also gave the government a clear failing grade. In measuring the degree of satisfaction with the reforms undertaken by the Moroccan government, Akhannouch's government received only 18% approval in Spain, the lowest next to Germany (12%) and a far cry from Belgium's 57%.\n\n\"Young people expect nothing from the government. They just want to be able to work once they finish their studies,\" says Meriem. She agrees with Sohaib, who at least somewhat optimistically believes that young people want the country to prosper as much as possible. This is also the view of Riyan, who at least has a positive idea of Morocco because of what it means to him and his family. \"The culture, our roots. Of course we like Morocco,\" says Riyan, who believes that young people only have a problem with the institutions and the economic situation, which offers fewer opportunities compared to Europe.\n\nAs for the future, the youngest of these interviewees is very optimistic, and even the hopefulness is evident in his voice. \"I am sure that soon something similar to what is happening in France or Belgium will happen in Spain,\" says Riyan. \"I really believe that in the next few years we will see ministers or senior officials in Spain bearing a Moroccan name\".",
    "Morocco, China share ambition to promote a ‘triple win’ cooperation in support of Africa – The North Africa Post": "Morocco and China share the ambition to establish a “triple win” South-South cooperation in support of Africa’s all-out development, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said in New York.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at a High-Level Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Bourita stressed that under the leadership and vision of King Mohammed VI, Morocco established solid and multidimensional cooperation with African countries through initiatives and partnerships.\n\nThe FM cited, in this sense, the Triple S initiative to promote sustainability, stability and security in Africa, the AAA Initiative to adapt African agriculture to climate change, the provision of drugs and medical equipment to African countries during the pandemic of Covid-19, in addition to cooperation in the areas of food security, fertilizers and climate change.\n\nBourita congratulated China on the launch of the GDI, praising Beijing’s efforts to promote sustainable development. The launch of this initiative comes at an appropriate time and in an unprecedented context marked by the triple crisis of health, food and energy, besides the quest for appropriate solutions to international challenges, he said.\n\n“The initiative also comes seven years before the deadline for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While significant progress has been achieved in several regions of the world, several countries, severely affected by the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, are lagging behind in reaching these goals,” the minister explained.\n\nBourita called the initiative an example of dynamic partnership to strengthen and promote international cooperation, including South-South cooperation to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\n“The initiative will certainly contribute to strengthening global solidarity and support the efforts of developing countries to meet their development commitments, especially in the current global context,” the minister said at the meeting held on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly.\n\nBourita also noted that Morocco’s support for the GDI initiative stems from the friendly ties that Morocco and China have maintained for decades.\n\nThese relations have gained new momentum since the visit of King Mohammed VI to China in 2016, a visit that culminated in the launch of a strategic partnership between the two countries, he recalled, adding that bilateral trade jumped by 50% between 2016 and 2021.\n\nChina’s investments in Morocco have increased significantly with more than 80 projects in various fields, he said.\n\nBourita also noted that in the Covid-19 context, cooperation between Morocco and China has resulted in a partnership in the field of health and vaccination. This partnership resulted in the establishment of an industrial unit to manufacture anti-Covid vaccines. This infrastructure will contribute to the self-sufficiency of Morocco and its health sovereignty.\n\nCooperation ties between the two countries have been strengthened with the signing, earlier this year, of an agreement on the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative. Morocco is among the first African countries that joined this initiative, he recalled.\n\nThe FM reiterated Morocco’s support for the Global Development Initiative, which will undoubtedly contribute to accelerating progress towards achieving SDGs, particularly in Africa.\n\nThe Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) reviewed the positive progress made since the GDI was proposed, particularly after the High-level Dialogue on Global Development held on 24 June 2022.\n\nThe participants had an in-depth exchange of views on deepening practical cooperation in various priority areas of the GDI, accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting institutional arrangements of the Group, and strengthening cooperation with the UN development system aligned with national priorities and needs. They discussed the way forward for GDI cooperation and reached broad consensus.",

This was demonstrated by King Mohammed VI's invitation to President Pedro Sánchez to meet in Rabat in April 2022.

Subsequently, other nations such as Germany and Spain followed suit and recognised the Moroccan initiative as the most \"realistic, serious and credible\" way to solve the Western Sahara problem.\n\nOpposing this trend is the opposing position of the Polisario Front, which advocates holding a referendum on independence for the Saharawis, a proposal that has less significant international support, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great political rival in the Maghreb, which has even broken off diplomatic relations with the Alawi kingdom due to the political differences between the two countries, including the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.\n\nAmericas Coordinator: José Antonio Sierra",

    "Why is the City of Chefchaouen in Morocco Blue?": "The town of Chefchaouen, with its blue streets and tightly-packed houses, stacked beneath the mountains of northwest Morocco, is quite unlike any other on Earth. Wander the maze of the medina in Chaouen, as the city is called by locals, and you’ll find yourself following steep, narrow streets up and down, often passing souks (bazaar-style marketplaces) selling local rugs or leather, beneath the white roofs and many minarets which form the skyline.\n\nChefchaouen sits in the foothills of the Rif Mountains at 600 metres, with the mountain of Jebel el-Kelaa (1,616m) behind it and Jebel Tisouka (2,118m) also nearby. Despite the mountainous surroundings, these are not dry and arid lands.\n\nThere are almost 300,000 acres of forest within a couple hours drive of Chefchaouen, and the region is considered one of the richest in Morocco for biological diversity - something particularly evident in the Talassemtane National Park, home to otters, macaque monkeys and hundreds of birds living amongst the gorges, rugged cliffs and lush greenery of cedar and pine trees.\n\nThe now-sprawling city of Chefchaouen, with the medina at the foot of the Rif Mountains behind. Photo: Getty\n\nIt wasn’t the fertile land but an attack by Portuguese forces under the command of King Afonso V that led to the founding of Chefchaouen in 1471, though. There was human habitation in the area before this, of course, but it was only after that the fortress of Chefchaouen began to thrive as a wider city, with Ghomaras (a group of northern Moroccan tribes), Moriscos (a group of Muslim descent) and Jewish people who had fled Spain and Portugal all settling in the area.\n\nThe panoramic view from the mountain top reaches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea and across to Spain and the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nAs the threat of the Portuguese slowly diminished, a medina began to appear around the old fortress, and the city prospered on the Fez-Tetouan trade route, growing in population as even more Muslim and Jewish refugees arrived, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. Owing to that threat from the Portuguese, the city was a closed town to Christians and most Europeans until the early 1900s.\n\nRugs line the streets of one ascending staircase, left, and the beautiful arches of Chefchaouen, right. Photo: Getty\n\nIndeed, there are only three European travellers on record as sneaking into the city before that time. The first was the French explorer Charles Foucauld in 1883, who gained access while pretending to be a rabbi. Another was the English journalist, Walter Harris, who in 1889 disguised himself as a Moorish merchant from Fez, and rode in on a donkey from Tangier, later writing that it was “an utter impossibility for a Christian” to visit the city. The third was a missionary, called William Summer who proved Harris’ point - by being poisoned to death.\n\nIt’s unlikely that any of these travellers saw the blue streets of Chefchaouen as they are today. That's because the streets weren't blue at that point - at least not universally. It wasn’t until Chefchaouen was taken by the Spanish in 1920 that the doors to the city opened to anyone and everyone - and the blue followed.\n\nA blue passageway through the old town of Chefchaouen, brightened up with flower pots. Photo: Getty\n\nThe most popular theory is that after WWII, when the Jewish community in the area grew as people fled Nazi persecution, blue was painted on the walls, floors and steps as a religious practise, to represent the colour of the sky and connect the city to heaven and God. Other parts of the medina were still white until around 40 years ago - when the rest of the city followed suit, likely for aesthetic or tourism purposes.\n\nOther theories say that the walls were painted to keep mosquitos away or reduce heat in the summer. Regardless of the reason it started, it’s likely that it’s now tourism that keeps the practice of painting the walls - which is still done once or twice a year - active today. Whatever the case, it makes Chefchaouen a photographer’s dream, and remarkable to walk around (if hard to navigate).\n\nPlace Outa el Hammam, the main open square in Chefchaouen, with the backdrop of the mountains behind. Photo: Getty\n\nThe city is easily reached by bus from Tangier, Casablanca or Fez (though the trip takes a good few hours), and hikers will be glad to know the craggy landscape of the Rif mountains are easily reached from there. Walk directly out of town and into the mountains above and you can follow a trail to the top of Jebel el-Kelaa, reached by a six-to-eight hour round-hike. The summit is reached by a short scramble, and the panoramic view from the mountain top reaches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea and across to Spain and the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nThe navigational aspect of this hike is perhaps the most challenging part, so be sure to take care - and note that you may pass some marijuana plantations on the way. The plant, known as kif here, is widely smoked and produced in the area, and along with tourism, it fuels the Chefchaouen economy. Drug use in Morocco is strictly illegal, but you wouldn’t know it in Chefchaouen - a fact which drove many backpackers to the area in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nThe Akchour falls, left, and the unique rock formation of God's Bridge, right.

The small town is just a little collection of houses on a creek, but from there you can walk to the Akchour waterfalls, a series of dreamy pools surrounded by lush vegetation, or hike up the nearby jungle rapids of the Oued Farda River to the God’s Bridge rock formation - where an enormous, clay-coloured archway joins two rugged mountain plateaus.\n\nThe colourful character of Chefchaouen makes it an enchanting spot to return to at the end of the day. And how better to rest up post-hike than by eating a lamb kebab and drinking mint tea on the blue streets of Morocco’s most beautiful city?\n\nInspired?

    "Israel recalls Morocco envoy over sexual abuse allegations": "Israeli foreign ministry said it recalled its ambassador to Morocco over sexual abuse allegations and corruption.\n\nIsrael has summoned its ambassador to Morocco, David Govrin, over allegations of sexual harassment and corruption, Israeli media outlets have reported.\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry confirmed Govrin’s recall to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Tuesday, saying “the ambassador to Morocco [has been recalled] due to allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and corruption”.\n\nGovrin, 58, is a fluent Arabic speaker and had previously served as the ambassador to Egypt from 2016 to August 2020.\n\nHe will remain in Israel pending the ministry’s investigation into the allegations against him, the newspaper said.\n\nPublic broadcaster KAN said Israeli authorities were “investigating complaints over alleged actions carried out at the Israeli representation in Morocco”.\n\nThe broadcaster also referred to “another strange story concerning businessman Sami Cohen who officially hosted activities for senior Israeli officials” in Morocco.\n\nAccording to media reports, the businessman allegedly arranged meetings for senior Israeli officials with Moroccan official representatives, despite not holding any official position.\n\nAccording to The Times of Israel, the foreign ministry is also investigating the theft of a “precious gift” from the Moroccan Royal Court during Israel’s celebration of its foundation anniversary.\n\nSuch gifts have to be registered and turned over to the government, but the item appears to have disappeared with no record.\n\nThe most serious complaint was that “a senior Israeli official” at the mission had sexually exploited several local women, something that could lead to a severe diplomatic incident with Morocco. There were also complaints of sexual harassment within the mission.\n\nIf the allegations prove to be true, a serious diplomatic incident in relations between Israel and Morocco could be sparked.\n\nMorocco became the third Arab state to normalise ties with Israel under United States-brokered deals in 2020, joining the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. In return, the US – under former President Donald Trump – recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara.",
