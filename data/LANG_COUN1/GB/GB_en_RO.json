Following months of collaboration and hard work from CNN and Antena 3, the new-look Antena 3 will build on the success of News Hour with CNN and bring a different, high quality news product to the Romanian market”.\n\nGadea added: “The eleven years during which we been affiliated to CNN have been full of events and times of change important not only to Romania but also in the history of the whole world.\n\n“The strengthening of our companies’ partnership to enhance Antena 3’s output and become CNN’s Exclusive News Partner in Romania comes at an important time. This development is not just a key milestone for Antena 3 but also for Romania and our country’s media industry as we prepare to deliver news that upholds the very highest standards of journalism”.",
    "Romania prompts diplomatic row by denying entry to Russia Today journalists": "The spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zaharova, accuses Romania of violating the Charter and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) after the country withdrew the visas of 14 members of the delegation supposed to take part in an event scheduled on September 26.\n\nThe Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE), in its turn, said that the 14 people, journalists of Russia Today, were improperly notified as Russian officials.\n\nRussia claims that Romania's decision is intended to affect the chances of the Russian candidate for the post of general secretary of the ITU, News.ro reported.

    "Health minister: 3 mln expired COVID vaccine doses destroyed in Romania so far": "Romania has so far destroyed about 3 million expired COVID-19 vaccine doses, health minister Alexandru Rafila said. Another 3 million doses will most likely have the same fate, as they will expire by the end of the year.\n\nAsked how much money Romania put into the vaccines it did not use, Rafila spoke of EUR 100-200 million.\n\n\"Of course, it's complicated to calculate because you also have to add the doses that are still in stock and that we haven't used and are unlikely to use. I think we have about 7-8 million in stock at the moment, and with the others I told you about, we will probably reach a consistent figure.

This is the contractual provision. […] I had discussions with the Commission and the producers.

    "Rain on the range – Getting muddy with NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania": "Earlier this year, Allies agreed to enhance NATO’s presence in the east of the Alliance by establishing four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia (in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which have been in place since 2017). Now, Allied troops are training together in these new battlegroups, demonstrating their ability and commitment to working together – come rain or come shine.\n\nFrench soldiers observe a live-fire exercise at the new NATO multinational battlegroup in Romania, where they are working alongside their Polish and Romanian counterparts.\n\nFor a soldier, rain is a fact of life.\n\nIt streams from the brim of your Kevlar helmet. It plasters your cold, wet combat uniform to your skin. And it turns the Romanian soil of Cincu Training Area into cake-batter mud that gloms onto your boots and adds a kilogram to every step.\n\nBut for these French soldiers assembled for a live-fire exercise, the rain seemed like an afterthought. They stood outside their armoured personnel carriers, which were parked in a line beside Polish and Romanian infantry fighting vehicles, waiting for the order to move out. Perhaps they’d simply grown used to the weather after several months of being deployed to Romania as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\nThe call came down the line: “Allons-y.” Let’s go. The French, Polish and Romanian soldiers grabbed their rifles and ducked into the cramped confines of their vehicles for the short ride to the gunnery range.\n\nFrench soldiers get into position under cloudy grey skies during a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nThe French Army – which in 2022 is serving as the lead nation of the highest-readiness element of the NATO Response Force – deployed troops to Romania following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, alongside a contingent of Belgian soldiers. In May, the French and Belgians formally stood up NATO’s first multinational battlegroup in Romania, with a contingent of Dutch soldiers due to arrive in the coming months.\n\nThe battlegroup is backed up by rotational deployments of US and Polish mechanised infantry elements – including troops from the US Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, forward deployed from Vilseck, Germany, and the Polish Army’s 17th Mechanised Brigade. While not under direct NATO command, these units greatly enhance the Alliance’s defensive posture while giving their troops invaluable time to cross-train with their Allies.\n\nPolish soldiers hold positions following a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nAs the French, Polish and Romanian armoured vehicles raced towards the firing line underneath dark, woolly clouds, it was hard to shake the sense that this felt different from your standard exercise – the gloomy sky matched the mood of the continent, where Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered peace and created the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nThe vehicles came to a halt and opened fire at simulated targets downrange, the .50-calibre machine gun mounted on the French armoured personnel carrier chattering against the deeper chug-chug-chug of the 30-millimeter autocannons mounted on the Polish and Romanian vehicles. After laying down a blanket of suppressing fire, the hatches opened and the soldiers spilled out, sprinting towards their firing positions.\n\nFor a few minutes, every rifle on the firing line was sending rounds downrange, soldiers pausing only to change magazines. Combined with sustained cannon fire from the infantry fighting vehicles, the volume of firepower was deafening. When it was over, the only sound was the voices of French, Polish and Romanian platoon leaders confirming over the radios that they’d spent all their ammunition. The soldiers mounted up and headed back to camp on the groan of diesel engines.\n\nA soldier with the French Army’s 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment crawls under a barbed wire obstacle in Cincu, Romania. Troops go through a wide variety of physical tests and training in NATO multinational battlegroups, in addition to live-fire exercises.\n\nAlong with the other new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania is a tangible manifestation of how European security has changed since February. While Allied soldiers routinely deployed to Romania in the past for training exercises, their permanent presence comes with a palpable sense of gravity.\n\n“In the first week of the deployment, we felt that it was a very important historical moment,” said Lieutenant Colonel Adrien, deputy commander of the battlegroup. He had deployed with the first French forces activated as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\n“We also felt the responsibility that we had as leaders of this spearhead battalion,” he explained, “the responsibility that we have to demonstrate our capabilities to be ready, totally, with our Allies to fulfil the mission that we have been given.”\n\nNATO troops from across the Alliance have continued to arrive at all four new battlegroups over the past several months, as they carry out the process of being set up and integrated into NATO’s military command structure. No matter where they’re from or where they’re deployed, these soldiers will stand side-by-side with their Allies and live, work and train in the toughest conditions – whether there are blue skies or grey skies ahead.",

    "DP World links new location in Romania with Ukrainian grain lifeline": "Port of Constanta\n\nDP World in Romania is working to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine via Romania while keeping a low profile. That being said, the global logistics player will utilise a recently authorised terminal in Dornesti, near the Romania-Ukraine border, to bring more grain flows towards the port of Constanta by rail.\n\nThe new rail link that could commence anytime soon will connect Vadul-Siret in Ukraine with the company’s hub terminal in the Port of Constanta via Dornesti. The latter was developed into a functioning terminal by DP World swiftly to alleviate congestion in Constanta and serve the company’s multimodal expansion in Romania.\n\nCosmin Carstea, CEO of DP World Romania, commented on the news website The Loadstar that the new rail service could run with up to five roundtrips per week, and trains could carry up to 50 containers per time.\n\nInvestment with future\n\nUnderstandably, a global player like DP World also sees a long-term benefit in such commitments. Apart from helping Ukrainian grain to find new rail routes toward Romania, the Dornesti terminal will also boost the company’s presence in the country. Apart from its hub terminal in the port of Constanta and Dornesti, DP World is also working in another location.\n\nSpecifically, in early May, the company kicked off the construction of a new multimodal logistics terminal in Aiud, in the region of Transylvania. As the company commented, “with over 50 per cent of Romania’s industrial GDP coming from the wider Transylvania region, the Aiud terminal will perform a key role in expanding the country’s global trade while providing robust infrastructure in a region that traditionally lacked it”. Additionally, DP World stressed that the terminal will “sit directly on the train line linking Europe to China via Central Asia”.\n\nAlso read:",
    "Romania is second-largest digital commerce market in CEE, McKinsey says": "Romania’s digital commerce market stood at EUR 9.8 bln in 2021, making it the second largest market in CEE, after Poland (EUR 26.7 bln) but before Czechia (EUR 9.1 bln). The achievement takes place in a wider context of digital development in Europe and within Romania itself, according to a new McKinsey & Company report titled “Digital Challengers on the Next Frontier.”\n\nThe report analyzes the opportunities presented by the digital economy in ten economies of Central and Eastern Europe, small and medium-sized countries with strong potential for fast digitization. The three main components of the digital economy considered in the report are: digital commerce (online retail spending on goods & services), ICT (the value of spending of governments and companies across all sectors on hardware, software, infrastructure, and related services) and offline spend on digital equipment (PC, smartphones, IT infrastructure, Cloud, etc.).\n\nThe region’s digital economy totaled an estimated EUR 124 bln in 2021, with digital commerce representing around EUR 68 bln of the sum. The ten CEE countries, Romania among them, could reach a digital economy worth EUR 330 bln by 2030, with digital commerce being the main driver of growth.\n\nRomania’s own digital economy was estimated at EUR 14.8 bln in 2021, or 6% of GDP, in the same report. The value is shared between digital commerce (EUR 9.8 bln), expenditures on ICT (EUR 3.5 bln), and offline spending on digital products like PCs or smartphones (EUR 1.6 bln). McKinsey analysts reckon that the sector could be worth EUR 52 bln (9.6% of GDP) by 2030.\n\nICT showed promise in Romania, growing at around 8% annually between 2017 and 2021. However, investments in this sector are still low when compared to countries such as Poland or Czechia. As Romania’s ICT infrastructure develops, it may become an important driver of growth.\n\nDigital commerce, however, is the clear driver of Romania’s digital economy, representing 66% of it. The segment grew by 17% annually, almost doubling in value between 2017 and 2021. The share of SMEs selling online more than doubled as well, from 7% to 17% in the same period. The spectacular growth transformed Romania into the second largest digital commerce market in the CEE, not to mention the third-largest digital economy.\n\nThere is, however, still room to grow. The average expenditure on digital commerce per capita and the digital commerce penetration rate in Romania are some of the lowest in the region. Romania’s digital commerce per capita was around EUR 506 in 2021, lower than the ones in Czechia (EUR 849), Slovenia (EUR 866), or Lithuania (EUR 1,064). Digital represents just 14% of the total retail segment in Romania, the rest being offline commerce. With 14% penetration, Romania has one of the lowest rates of digital commerce relative to total retail in the CEE.\n\nThe use of innovations delivering ultra-convenience (payments, omnichannel, fast delivery and returns, and data-driven individualization) could help Romania double its digital commerce market size.\n\nThe report shows that the most significant categories for digital commerce in Romania are home goods and electronics (39% share of digital commerce), transportation services (31%), and apparel (14%). However, during the pandemic years, the fastest category growth was seen in groceries, which grew from EUR 123 mln (2% share of digital commerce) in 2019 to EUR 389 mln in 2021 (4% share of digital commerce).\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Nitsuki | Dreamstime.com)",

    "Romania moves to put dispute over the EU-funded gamma beam facility to bed": "Romania made mistakes over the management of the contract for the construction of a gamma beam at the state-of-the-art EU research infrastructure, ELI-Nuclear Physics, and must now move things forward, the country’s recently appointed science minister, Sebastian Burduja has said.\n\nBurduja, who took up the post in May this year, told Science|Business it would be “a shame not to finish a project that has huge potential” to advance science in Romania and Europe.\n\nThe construction of the gamma beam, a secondary piece of equipment to the main high intensity laser system at the Extreme Light Infrastructure – Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) facility, has been bogged down in complications since 2015.\n\nEuroGammaS, a consortium of European research institutions and companies, was awarded the contract to build the gamma beam, but a dispute about the specifications of the building to house it led to the contract being cancelled by Romania’s institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH).\n\nFollowing this, EuroGammaS and IFIN-HH have been involved in court cases over the cancellation since 2018. Now government officials say it is time to put the past to bed and move on with the project.\n\n“We're really trying to be very constructive and not ask whose fault it is. We've certainly made mistakes – that's the reality of it,” said Burduja.\n\nThe shift in attitude is driven by the recognition it is in the government’s interest to complete the installation of the beam. “We see it as an essential part of Romanian infrastructure, but also an essential part of European knowledge and access to knowledge,” Burduja said. “It's a project that's never been done in the world, it has huge potential, it would be a huge shame not to finish it according to the parameters that were set in the beginning.”\n\nThe complications, though, do not end here because after the contract with EuroGammaS was cancelled, a US company Lyncean Technologies was handed a €42 million deal to take over and complete construction on the gamma beam. But in March this year the journal Science reported rumours that the company was facing bankruptcy.\n\nBurduja said the Romanian government has not received any definitive communication from the company on this matter. “We're evaluating to see their capacity to carry the project all the way to the end and essentially finalise the gamma source,” he said.\n\nAccording to Burduja, Lyncean had some financial trouble in the past couple of years, but he is not yet aware of the company declaring bankruptcy. “I think it's public information that they've had some challenges during the pandemic but to my knowledge they have made no formal notification [about the bankruptcy issue] at this point,” he said.\n\nScience|Business did not receive any response from Lyncean to emails asking about its capacity to complete the project.\n\nBurduja said that if the company is unable to complete the project they would look at alternative options, including going back to the EuroGammaS consortium.\n\nDeadlines, penalties and litigation\n\nThe ELI-NP project has already gone through two phases of EU funding, and cannot be “phased” again. It means that the facility needs to be completed by the end of 2023 to maintain its EU funding. There is a two-year buffer in which, if the project is not fully completed, the Romanian government can step in and fund it with its own resources.\n\nIf it is not completed after that buffer, which means by the end of 2025, then Romania risks a heavy penalty from the European Commission, something Burduja says it wants to avoid. The facility is being built at a total cost of €300 million, most of which is from EU structural funds, with only a small portion being covered by the Romanian government.\n\nThe project remains in limbo and cannot move forward because of the ongoing court cases over the cancellation of the first contract with EuroGammaS. This is eating into the time left to complete it, but Burduja said there is the possibility of an amicable settlement.\n\nOne possibility is that an agreement is reached about the terms of the first contract. For example, the completion of stage one of the construction of the gamma beam – there were three planned stages – could be deemed satisfactory in terms of meeting the contract requirements.\n\nThe equipment delivered to the facility as part of that first stage could also eventually be used to build a radioactive beam infrastructure that could be a tool for nuclear research.\n\nPierluigi Campana, a member of the executive board of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN), one of the main partners in the EuroGammaS consortium, has been following the events at ELI-NP for several years and says the situation is “very complex”.\n\nAccording to Campana, things are now better, although INFN still needs some political action from the Romanian government. “We cannot hope to build the full [gamma beam] machine by 2025 because we have wasted so much time,” he said, admitting that the terms of the EuroGammaS contract could be amended so only phase one needs to be completed.\n\nCampana said he feels the situation is moving forward positively and that recently steps have been taken by the Romanian government to resolve the issues. He spoke to Burduja at the end of July to lay out the situation and said the conclusion was that “the best path is to conclude the legal issues.”\n\nBurduja has also held talks with the Italian and French ambassadors to Romania, both of whose countries had stakes in EuroGammaS, to try to smooth out relations, as the contract dispute has had an impact on Romania’s international reputation.\n\n“The very horrible way of treating international partners was not without consequences. The whole scientific community of Romania is suffering,” Campana said. “On the other hand, our institutions have suffered because they put a lot of resources into a project that was blocked for years and this was devastating.”\n\nScience|Business also contacted another EuroGammaS partner, France’s national research centre CNRS, but it declined to comment on the situation.\n\nCampana said that despite the history, EuroGammaS would still work with Romania.\n\nAt the end of September there will be a technical meeting in Rome with representatives of Romania and the consortium to discuss how best to use the ELI-NP facility, an indication the research and science element is moving forward in spite of the politics. The general opinion of those directly or indirectly involved with ELI-NP is that science, research and the pursuit of knowledge is more important than what is going on in Bucharest courts.\n\nAnother indicator of this is ELI-NP’s growing involvement in the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). ELI-NP was built as part of a triumvirate of laser research facilities in central and eastern Europe.\n\nIn Hungary there is the ELI Alps institute and in Czech Republic there is ELI Beamlines. These two other facilities have come together to form the ELI European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), which ELI-NP was left out of, due in part to the bad relations that came about after the cancellation of the EuroGammaS contract.\n\nELI-ERIC recently put out a call for users at the three laser institutions, with the deadline on September 9. The first projects are due to start in October and last until March. A second call for users will be put out in January 2023.\n\nAllen Weeks, director general of ELI ERIC, said he is very pleased that the call went out with the involvement of IFIN-HH and ELI-NP. “This demonstrates that all the facilities are working closely together, on a scientific level, to deliver the best and most advanced portfolio of laser sources in the world to the global science community,” he said.\n\nWeeks said he could not put a timeframe on ELI-NP fully joining ERIC, but is optimistic it will happen as the facility nears completion.\n\nELI-NP director Călin Ur agreed with this assessment, saying, “Even if we are not part of ERIC, we are participating in the process of defining the rules that will govern the consortium in such a way that when we join, we will be prepared to do so immediately and to be effective.” ELI-NP has received a high number of requests as part of ELI ERIC’s call for users.\n\nNicolae Marginean, director general of the IFIN-HH, stressed the need to talk about the potential of the ELI-NP facility rather than the contract disputes over the gamma beam.\n\nThe facility has huge potential, particularly the high intensity laser system which is equipped with two 10-petawatt lasers. This unique capability will allow scientists to carry out research on improving X-ray imaging, fine tuning the use of radiotherapy in cancer treatment, investigating how materials will react to radiation in space and more.\n\nTesting on the laser system is ongoing but successful trials of it at 100 terawatts and one petawatt have already been conducted. Ur said that the team of international experts brought in to run the trials described the facility as “one of the best in the world” in terms of the characteristics and quality of the beam.\n\nIf the issues with the gamma beam can be resolved and ELI-NP gets fully up and running, then there is little doubt that Romania will have a world-class facility capable of attracting the best and brightest talent from around the world. Marginean said it will be, “A cluster of excellence in nuclear science.”\n\nFor Ur, it is vital that the project is a success. “We have to demonstrate that we are capable of handling large research projects,” he said.\n\nThe Bucharest facility will help Romania stop the brain drain and attract research talent from around the world. “Most are going abroad to do research because the offer here in terms of research equipment is limited […] was limited,” he said. “Now, by having these possibilities, we can bring back people who left Romania and we can bring researchers from around the world to work here.”\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated 16 September 2022.

    "EC wants energy reduction measures, Romania’s already lowest in Europe": "The average Romanian consumed 2.7 MWh in 2020, placing the country last in a ranking measuring energy consumption per capita in Europe.\n\nBy comparison, Ukraine’s average per capita energy consumption in the same year stood at 2.8 MWh, while Germans consumed 6.4 MWh per inhabitant in the same period. These values pale in comparison with the champions of per capita energy use in Europe, namely Norway (23.3 MWh) and Iceland (51 MWh), both outside the EU.\n\nOther figures serve to further contextualize Romania’s energy climate. The country’s energy consumption dropped by 19.48% since 1990, and its CO2 emissions by 58.33% in the same period, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n“95% of Romania’s energy consumption in the ‘90s was industrial, households accounting for the rest,” energy and infrastructure analyst Otilia Nuţu told ZF. Energy consumption is especially low in the countryside, the least developed areas in Romania, she says.\n\nLast week, the European Commission unveiled a series of “exceptional electricity demand reduction measures” meant to reduce the cost of electricity throughout the winter. The Commission hopes to tackle high energy prices brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\n\nOne of the measures will have states reduce electricity consumption by at least 5% during selected peak price hours. Member states will also have to reduce overall electricity demand by at least 10% until March 31, 2023.\n\n“Our problem is that we don’t even have the data. We don’t know how energy is consumed in Romania. We have the same production method, with very large units, close to the old former industrial units, while our consumption has moved to the urban area,” Nuţu says.\n\nDespite massive deindustrialization, households only take up around 25% of the energy consumed in Romania, while the European average stands at 27%.

The high second-quarter growth took analysts by surprise, as previous statistics data were gloomy.\n\nHowever, Caciu said the positive evolution was due to the companies’ response to the challenges they faced, although he admitted that the state’s support was limited by a lack of resources.\n\nIn the first half, the economy grew by 5.8% compared to the same period last year. The figure is considerably above the Romanian government’s summer forecast of 3.5% for the whole of 2022.\n\n“We have not lost touch with reality. We are very cautious, Everyday we try to maintain stability. When one maintains stability, one starts to create prospects,” Caciu said.",
    "France-Romania deal to export more grain from Ukraine to be signed Monday": "The French and Romanian governments on Monday will sign an agreement allowing more grain exports from Ukraine to reach Europe and beyond, said France's Transport Minister Clément Beaune Sunday.\n\n\"Tomorrow I will sign an agreement with Romania to allow Ukraine to send even more grain, because it is an essential resource for the country and for many other countries that benefit from it,\" Beaune told French radio FranceInter, adding that the cereals will be shipped \"to Europe and to developing countries, especially in the Mediterranean, which need it for food and for their survival almost.\"\n\nThe agreement aims to solve some of the bottlenecks of the EU solidarity lanes with Ukraine.\n\nIt comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin last week threatened to limit grain exports through the Black Sea and claimed that most of the cereals leaving Ukraine were feeding the EU market instead of going to developing countries.\n\nA British defense intelligence bulletin on Sunday stated that \"Putin's claim is not true. According to UN figures, around 30 percent has been supplied to low and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\"\n\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry added that \"Russia is pursuing a deliberate misinformation strategy as it seeks to deflect blame for food insecurity issues, discredit Ukraine and minimize opposition to its invasion.\"\n\nBeaune said the deal with Romania will cover exports \"by river, sea and land.\"\n\n\"I am proud that, through a European action, by finding land routes, we have been able to almost come back to the same level of grain exports that Ukraine had before the war,\" Beaune said.",

From stunning landscapes and popular tourist destinations and landmarks to people, traditions, and food, this series helps you discover Romania one photo at a time. This week, we put the focus on Romanian mountain lakes.\n\nThe small glacial Lake Vinderel is located on the ridge connecting Farcău Peak and Mihăilecu Peak, at an altitude of 1615m on the territory of Repedea and Poienile de Sub Munte, in the Maramureș Mountains. (Photo source - click on the number to get to the photo 172655297 © Volodymyr Martyniuk | Dreamstime.com)\n\nThe geological, faunal, and landscape reserve covers an area of 150 hectares, which is part of the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, and aims to preserve the local biological diversity, says infopensiuni.ro. The reserve includes the Farcău and Mihăilecu peaks, Julii Cave, Bologhii Cave, Wolves’ Cave, and Vinderel Lake.\n\nThe lake is fed by snowmelt and rainwater, and by the small basins of swamp-like water located on its southern shore. The banks are grassy and slope gently down to the lake, says Bogatiile Muntilor Maramures, with some juniper thickets to the east. Other species of plants found on the edge of the lake are Edelweiss, Peat Mosses, Cottongrass, and Hawkweed.\n\nVinderel Lake has given rise to many legends, some of which describe it as a bottomless lake, others saying it is inhabited by a dragon that feeds on whoever might enter its water. One such tale, told by Stirileprotv.ro, says the dragon once ate all the guests at a wedding that was held by the lake’s side. It is also said that it is not good to throw a stone into this lake because you will start a storm.\n\nMaramureș Mountains Natural Park's website tells us of two different hiking trails that can be followed, if you want to visit Vinderel Lake:\n\nRepedea - Chicerea – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 10 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, difficult in winter.\n\nFrom the center of Repedea the marker follows the lane leading to the school. From the corner of the school, the marked path changes direction to the east, winding its way up through the small farms in the Poposală area. Enter the forest, leaving the ridge and Chicera Peak to the left. One then reaches the stable in Laba. From here the path climbs steeply, passing the Runea hut and leaving the Rugașul ridge on the right. Then you reach an area from where you can see the Farcău massif. The trail continues, crossing several torrential streams, and after approximately 1 hour, you reach Vinderel Lake.\n\nRepedea - Pietriceaua – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 12 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, winter difficult.\n\nFrom the center of the village, the marker follows the road along the Repedea valley, and after approx. 4 km you reach the Repedea Forest Canton. Continue on the road until the confluence with the Tomnatecu valley. From here you cross the Repedea valley, going up to the mountain hollow below Pietriceaua. You keep going north until you reach the lake.\n\nmaia@romania-insider.com",
    "IAEA Team in Romania Concludes First Ever Site and External Events Design (SEED) Review for a Small Modular Reactor": "An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts has concluded a safety review of Romania’s process for selecting the site of the country’s planned Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which could become the first SMR built in Europe.\n\nIn May, the Romanian Government, through state company Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN), announced that it had chosen Doicești, approximately 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest, as the preferred site for the SMR, following an in-depth study conducted with a United States Trade and Development Agency grant. Romania requested the IAEA to conduct a Site and External Events Design (SEED) review mission to assess the process that was followed in choosing the preferred site. The SEED mission — which took place from 22 to 24 August — was the first ever IAEA SEED mission to look into site selection for an SMR.\n\nSEED missions assist IAEA Member States at different stages in the development of a nuclear power programme, including by reviewing site selection, site assessment and design of structures, systems and components, taking into consideration site specific external and internal hazards.\n\nThe three-day mission was conducted at the request of SNN. Romania currently has one operating nuclear power plant (NPP) in Cernavodă, which generates around 18% of the country’s electricity. The country is considering expanding and modernizing its nuclear power programme through the deployment of SMRs at suitable sites, in addition to other actions on the existing large plant site.\n\nSMRs have the potential to contribute to global access to reliable nuclear power. They are a fraction of the size of large reactors — about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors — and have lower upfront capital costs, shorter construction times (owing to prefabrication) and pose fewer risks to the population in case of an accident.\n\nThe IAEA’s review assessed how Romania conducted the process for the site selection of the SMR against IAEA safety standards, taking into account potential impacts to a site from external events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods, and potential impacts to the population from low probability accidents at the site.\n\n“This comprehensive review will provide assurances to the Romanian public and beyond about the SMR site selection,” said Paolo Contri, Team Leader for the review and Head of the External Events Safety Section in the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. “The recommendations made will help Romania to prepare for the construction of the SMR, by making sure that potential issues associated with site safety are carefully considered early in the process and that alternative sites are available in the event that the selected site does not meet the requirements on the basis of the detailed site characterization. It is important that potential external hazards are identified early to allow for adequate consideration and assessment of protective measures that may be necessary for the defence in depth approach.”\n\nThe mission team comprised three experts from Germany, Türkiye and the United Kingdom. They met with senior staff from SNN at its premises in Bucharest.\n\nThe team welcomed the effort spent by SNN to conduct an objective, feasible and safety oriented site selection process in Romania. Romania documented the site selection process in a preliminary SNN report, which will be followed by a preliminary Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The SEED mission said a limited amount of additional work is needed on sensitivity analysis and collection of confirmatory data for the FEED study, together with detailed recommendations on the minimization of project risks.\n\nThe team provided some recommendations to support the optimization of the site selection process and to minimize the risk that the following phases will identify important safety issues that may affect project implementation. In particular, the IAEA team recommended that:\n\nAll data be collected in a site selection summary report, according to the recommendations issued in IAEA Safety Guide SSG-35, to provide traceable support for later decisions and site evaluation phases.\n\nA suitable graded approach be applied for the specific technology selected for the SMR to be deployed, and in accordance with the potential radiological consequences of accidents, to meet overall safety objectives. Guidelines on the IAEA approach to grading were provided.\n\nA possible additional data collection phase for the selection process — through light investigation and monitoring — be implemented for the preferred site, as back-up solutions, focused on the most discriminating selection criteria.\n\nRomania informed the IAEA that further in-depth assessments of the Doicești site are to be conducted in the upcoming period and it is actively addressing the recommendations of the IAEA SEED mission to support this work.\n\n“We invited the IAEA SEED mission because it is a priority for us to build in Romania a state-of-the-art SMR project, in full compliance with the highest safety standards, as we have done in the 25 years we have operated the Cernavodă NPP,” said Cosmin Ghita, SNN CEO. “With the continued support of the IAEA, our experience in siting and building our first SMR can be used by other countries considering building SMRs. SNN is ready to share our experience on strategic and technical aspects of SMR deployment projects.”\n\nThe final mission report will be delivered to the Government of Romania within three months.",
    "The sludge king: how one man turned an industrial wasteland into his own El Dorado": "The first time I heard the name Daniel Boldor, I was in Bucharest in a room full of police officers. A discussion about wealthy countries shipping their waste to poorer countries had turned to what Romania – one of the major recipients of Europe’s trash – was doing to fight back. Strict surveillance was being conducted at ports, the officers affirmed, and cargo trucks were undergoing checks. And then one of the policemen asked if I had ever heard the story of Daniel Boldor. For a moment, his colleagues awkwardly scanned the floor with their eyes, as if the officer had made some kind of gaffe. Yes, they seemed to eventually nod in agreement, a sense of enthusiasm overtaking the table. It was an extraordinary story.\n\nIt sounded like a fairytale. Some years earlier, hundreds of miles north of Bucharest, deep in the mountains of Transylvania, a Roma man claimed to have discovered a great lost treasure: thousands of tonnes of gold and copper that had been dug up decades earlier, then forgotten. His name was Daniel Boldor, and he had a plan. He found investors across the world. He paid his fellow Roma to gather the metal for him. Then he began selling his treasure. Buyers from South Africa to South Korea proved willing to pay tremendous sums of money for it.\n\nSoon enough Boldor was a very rich man. He also turned out to be more than just an entrepreneur. Over the course of a hard economic decade, in a country that had been pillaged of its natural resources by multinational companies, he became a renegade, Robin Hood in a tracksuit. He took from Romania’s reviled communist past and gave hope to its present. He employed hundreds of Roma who were ferociously loyal to him. He built an empire out of lost gold, and drove the sports cars to prove it.\n\nIt sounded like a fairytale because, continued the police officers, it was. They proceeded to tell a second story, one as stupefying as the first. The true story, they claimed, was that Boldor had got rich by selling treasure that never really existed. It was all an intricate con. They pulled out their phones and scrolled through photos of people with shovels standing next to ragged piles of what resembled construction rubble. This is what Boldor was sending, said the officers, jostling their phones in front of me so I could get a better look. According to the officers, Boldor had swindled companies all over the world by taking their money, then shipping them dirt.\n\nDaniel Boldor in Fersig, Romania. Photograph: Alex Clapp\n\nAnd for years, they said, he had somehow got away with it – until 2015, when Boldor’s biggest-ever shipment was busted by Chinese customs officials, who crowbarred open one of the cargo containers of metal he had dispatched, and discovered 20 tonnes of rocky soil inside. Now Boldor was in Romania’s legal crosshairs. On the other side of the country, in the Black Sea port of Constanța, one of the country’s most dogged prosecutors was attempting to have Boldor convicted and sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison on charges ranging from tax evasion to customs fraud.\n\nSo where is Boldor now, I replied at long last to the room of police officers. They shrugged. No one could really say.\n\nA few days later I boarded a 12-hour night train from Bucharest to Transylvania to try to find him.\n\nTucked close to the borders with Ukraine and Hungary, the city of Baia Mare sits at the northern edge of Transylvania, amid a billowed carpet of tawny farmland that gives way to snow-splotched mountains. On my first morning in the city last year, the head of its environmental police informed me that Daniel Boldor was not in Baia Mare, and probably not even in Romania, for that matter. But only a few hours later, the owner of a local scrapyard told me that he knew Boldor and proceeded to call him up. After telling Boldor I was a journalist, he handed me the phone. Sure, Boldor said, he was in Baia Mare and free to meet. He could also get me an interview with the city’s mayor, if I was interested.\n\nA short, swaggering man with intense brown eyes and a gravelly voice, Boldor met me at The Buffet, a cafe located – as Boldor pointed out on our first day together – on the same street as the city’s police headquarters and the county courthouse. Over my next few weeks in Baia Mare, Boldor spent much of his time at The Buffet. Along with nine companies, and real estate across Romania, plus an apartment in Dubai and stakes in a Swiss ski resort, he claimed to own it. Most days he would strut into the cafe in the early afternoon, usually dressed in dark sweatpants and a hooded parka, and head for a corner booth, where he’d spend the next few hours talking into his phone with practised weariness, occasionally entertaining my questions about who he was and why he was in trouble with the police.\n\nNicolae Ceaușescu with a worker at a metallurgic plant at Resita, 1970. Photograph: Interfoto/Alamy\n\nHis story began unremarkably enough. In 2001, age 24, Boldor left Baia Mare for west London and took up work in the building trade. His first job involved demolishing bathrooms and kitchens around Harrow and Notting Hill. He spoke little English at the time and shared a dingy flat with a handful of other Romanians. Once he had saved £15,000, he set up a construction firm of his own. By 2007, he had called in his four younger brothers from Romania and appointed them to his building sites across the UK, which he began filling with electricians from eastern Europe and bricklayers from Ireland.\n\nBoldor climbed quickly. Only a few years after he was dismantling kitchens in Notting Hill he was overseeing the refurbishment of a 100-room hotel, the Enterprise in Earls Court. “There was no messing about with Daniel,” Ben Rejeb, a Tunisian marble salesman who provided Boldor with material for his construction work on the Harrow Central Mosque in 2010, told me. Boldor gave away little about himself. “In the construction industry you don’t discuss where you get your materials or what you pay for them,” Octavian Babici, another former construction partner, told me. “But with Danny this was even more the case. No one knew what he was thinking.”\n\nIn person, Boldor carries himself like a man with better places to be and better people to meet. The names of Arab oil princelings, Nigerian construction moguls and Indian hospitality tycoons bob in and out of his stories. At The Buffet, when he wasn’t working his way through a carton of thin white Sobranie cigarettes, he would be tapping away frantically on his phone, occasionally stopping to snatch a toothpick off the table and rake the inside of his ear. When he detected impatience on my end, he would pause to dispense morsels of knowhow. Of Europe’s environmental authorities: “They play tricks with words. ‘Hazardous waste’! But there’s no hazardous waste here in Baia Mare. Go test it.” Of Romania’s political class: “They can all be corrupted. But you just need to know how to corrupt them.”\n\nGet the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n\nAfter 10 years in London, Boldor decided to return home to take care of his ageing parents. There was no grand plan, he told me. But he wasn’t the kind of man who would wait for something to fall into his lap.\n\nBoldor’s native Transylvania may be a poor place, but it’s also one blessed with staggering riches. The fertility of its soil is legendary. Some of Europe’s last primeval forests quilt its hills. But the region’s most coveted treasure lies out of sight. Beneath the Carpathian Mountains, which coil down through Transylvania like a serpent, sit some of the world’s largest deposits of gold and copper. Romania’s history could be written in the waves of outsiders – invaders and colonisers from the Slavs to the Saxons – who have launched claims to this wealth.\n\nIn 1947, 30 years before Boldor was born, Romania’s communist dictatorship turned the mining of those mountains into a huge, communal undertaking. Every morning for almost half a century, 10,000 residents of Baia Mare boarded cable cars that lofted them into the mountains. There, they pick-axed valuable earth, which was transported to a vast metallurgical complex on the swampy eastern edges of Baia Mare, a little more than two miles from the pastel storefronts of its old Habsburg centre. Originally known as Phoenix, and later as Cuprom, its workers were tasked with grinding and smelting troughs of excavated material into ingots of copper and gold. By 1970, Cuprom had become one of cold war Europe’s most productive industrial complexes, churning out tonnes of precious metals every month.\n\nThen, in December 1989, the world that had built Cuprom came crashing down. A popular uprising culminated in the execution by firing squad of Romania’s communist dictator, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Virtually overnight, the cult of productivity that had aspired to provide the nation with full employment and industrial self-reliance vanished. Thousands of miners from Baia Mare left, many heading for Chile to work its copper pits.\n\nWorse was to follow. If Baia Mare is known anywhere outside Romania today, it is as the site of one of Europe’s greatest environmental disasters. In January 2000, heavy snow melt caused 26m gallons of stagnant cyanide – used to extract gold from ore at Cuprom and sitting in a huge basin two miles west of the city – to overflow its plastic lining and pour into a nearby river. The poison then worked its way across the waterways of south-eastern Europe, killing fish, birds and even horses as it progressed. Within four days, the cyanide had coursed into the Danube, poisoning the drinking supply of more than 2 million people across four countries, before finally flushing out into the Black Sea.\n\nBaia Mare became a byword for catastrophe. And yet the mountains around the city still possessed vast mineral wealth, and over the 2000s, international investors flew to the city in the hopes of reigniting its old industrial fires. None succeeded. Removing tonnes of soil saturated with cyanide, modernising the ageing equipment, training a new generation of Romanian miners and metallurgists: it was just too expensive. Besides, one condition of Romania’s 2007 entry into the EU was cleaning up its communist-era industrial infrastructure. In Baia Mare, tens of millions of euros were put into mines and factories – not to revive them, but to shutter them for good.\n\nThe gold-mining complex in Baia Mare at the centre of the 2000 cyanide spill. Photograph: Robert Ghement/EPA\n\nBy the time Boldor returned to the city in 2011, its industrial zones resembled one of his old demolition sites. The Cuprom facility had been all but abandoned for 20 years. Across a wasteland the size of more than 100 football fields, crumbling smelters, gutted flotation systems and decrepit laboratories jutted forth like gravestones. Mangy dogs crisscrossed the railway tracks that had once shuttled ore down from the mountains. In 1995, in a sorry attempt to attract foreign investment, a 351-metre-high smelting chimney had been raised above the collapsing complex. Designed to discharge dangerous metallurgical toxins high into the air, it merely rained filth over wider stretches of Baia Mare. By 2011, the chimney – still Romania’s tallest structure – was no longer in use. It just towered over the city, a scarecrow over a blighted field.\n\nOut of such wreckage a former construction worker with no metallurgical experience not only built an empire, but charted his way into taking over one of the legendary mining complexes of communist Europe. For Boldor has not only made millions from Cuprom. Today, he owns much of it.\n\nOn a grey February morning Boldor drove me 30 miles south of Baia Mare to Fersig, the village where he grew up. “We were asleep here in the 1990s,” Boldor told me, as he chewed through a packaged croissant. In the decade after Ceaușescu’s execution, he said, Romania was robbed blind. The resources needed to rebuild the state – steel, timber, oil – were snapped up by giant western European companies. Then the EU, citing environmental reasons, shut down many of the few great industries Romania had left. To Boldor, there was no better symbol of Romania’s fate than Baia Mare itself. The city was encircled by mountains that, owing to bureaucratic machinations, it could no longer mine. It was outfitted with flotation systems and smelter chimneys that could no longer float or smelt. And it was full of workers who could no longer conduct their proudest and most profitable work.\n\n“Half this place left after 1989,” Boldor told me as we exited the highway for Fersig, an unprepossessing village of squat concrete homes. Boldor nosed his Audi through muddy lanes before pulling into his parents’ yard, which played host to a caged dog, a chicken coop and a trio of BMWs. The house was tall for Fersig, rising three storeys, the top two having been built with remittances Boldor and his younger brothers had sent their parents from London. “Do many other Roma live in town?” I asked as we got out of the car. “No,” Boldor answered.\n\nThe area around Baia Mare is not only notorious for its environmental despoliation. It’s also known for the grim fate of its Romany minority. In 2012, Baia Mare’s mayor declared their shanties, located along a creek outside the city, a “bag of poverty and dirt”. He proceeded to force hundreds of Roma out of their homes and into an abandoned factory of the squalid Cuprom complex, where they attempted to rebuild their lives.\n\nThe episode was just the latest chapter in the long tragedy of the Roma in the lands now comprising Romania. For hundreds of years, they were effectively made into serfs. Many were tied to feudal estates, banned from moving freely from one place to another. Among the few ways they could earn an independent living was by collecting metal. Nineteenth-century visitors to Transylvania noted how Roma could often be spotted at riverbanks, sifting gold from sand; others specialised in gathering old scraps of copper and iron. After communism was established in 1947, the state attempted, often by force, to lift the Roma out of their destitution. Many were given state apartments and enlisted into unglamorous jobs, such as sweeping streets or gathering trash. When communism ended, many Roma found themselves as abandoned as anyone else. They could not afford the shift to privatised housing and few state jobs still existed to employ them. There was, however, an abundance of metal to collect. Thousands of Roma reverted back to their traditional work, selling scrap from abandoned factories to local junkyards. Even today, the metal trade is how many of Romania’s 2 million Roma make their living. Meanwhile, the group continues to be treated as second-class citizens, routinely discriminated against and stigmatised as thieves who give their country a bad reputation abroad.\n\nPart of the Cuprom complex at Baia Mare. Photograph: Alex Clapp\n\nAll this makes Boldor even more confounding to many of his countrymen. For he bears little similarity to the stereotypes they associate with Roma. He does not live in a shanty. He does not speak Romani. He has a bank account and a car – a handful of both, in fact. He is closer to their type of “Romanian”. And, listening to Boldor speaking about the Roma, he can sound as contemptuous as any of his countrymen. Of course they had to be pushed into the old Cuprom building, he told me. Otherwise they would continue to toss their trash all over Baia Mare and their kids would keep roaming out into its streets and getting run over by cars.\n\nOne of Boldor’s irritations was the do-gooding European NGOs, which, he said, show up in Baia Mare to help the Roma, spend some cash, collect some praise and then move on to the next project. Nothing ever seemed to change for the Roma themselves. In Boldor’s view, the only way to pull the Roma out of poverty was one that no one was ever going to be honest enough to discuss: someone would have to be willing to go in, pull them away from their traditions, and show them how to become “Romanians”. It was an intervention, he thought, that would first require showing the Roma what success for one of their own looked like. And, for Boldor, that required making money.\n\nOver a lunch of pork belly prepared by his mother, Boldor told me of how his plan to restore Baia Mare’s former industrial grandeur all began with a conversation in late 2011, not long after he returned from London. He was talking to a grizzled old local who had helped manage Baia Mare’s mines under Ceaușescu. Yes, Cuprom was decaying, the miner said to Boldor, but there were still riches here. Even in its heyday, Cuprom’s refining technology had been rudimentary. For every tonne of gold or copper successfully furnished at the complex, another tonne of valuable earth had been tossed, its gold or copper minerals too fine-grained to extract from the surrounding dirt. And because Cuprom had been built on a swamp, the only way to expand the complex over the decades of its prosperity had been to fill in marshland with hectares of this backfill. So, at least, the old miner told Boldor.\n\nThe wreck of Cuprom, in other words, was teetering atop an entire landscape of buried treasure. Crazier still, no one had ever bothered to go collect it. Flecked with tiny pieces of copper and gold, Cuprom’s industrial residue was not just valuable. It was everywhere. Communism had already done all the heavy lifting. The metal had been dug out, transported, floated, smelted, crushed, milled and concentrated; all that remained was to gather, process, and sell the leftovers, then pocket the profit.\n\nEveryone else looked at Cuprom and saw a ruin. Daniel Boldor saw an El Dorado. For as long as anyone in Transylvania could remember, the local Roma had made their living selling scrap metal. Now Boldor pointed them to the real prize: sludge.\n\nOn the international market, it was known as “metal concentrate” – and, while it resembled dirt, it was highly coveted in countries such as China and South Korea, which needed vast quantities of copper and gold for their burgeoning electronics and construction industries. In 2013, Boldor began hiring the Roma who had been shunted into the old Cuprom factory to dig the metal concentrate out for him. He acquired a huge warehouse to store it. He bought industrial scales to weigh it. He brought in trucks to move it. And he oversaw the creation of a new company, Exiteco SRL, that could export it to secondhand metal traders around the world.\n\nThe secondhand metal trade is well organised and profitable, but the corner that specialises in metal concentrate is murkier – “a weird, bizarre world,” as one Canadian mining executive told me. In essence, the business is a massive scavenger hunt. Traders scour the globe for metals that are potentially too valuable to throw away, but require considerable expense and time to make actually valuable. Often, the obstacles are less logistical than bureaucratic. An African dictator was toppled half a century ago. Who is entitled to the concentrates of his defunct mining empire? A Soviet Republic ceased to exist in 1991. Who owns the mining residue of its state factories? A legendary communist mining complex lies in ruins. Who can ascertain that what is left behind possesses any actual value?\n\nTo help fund his operations, Boldor raised cash from a group of British cousins of Indian heritage based in Harrow, who he had met during his construction days. In late 2011, three of them flew to Baia Mare. They told me that Boldor walked them through the city’s mineralogy museum, which showcases its 1,000-year mining tradition. Later, they said, Boldor drove them to the mountains where they inspected piles of industrial residue, and he arranged meetings with local officials who pledged to ease Romania’s tangled bureaucracy for them. “Daniel was very nice, very polite,” one of the investors told me. “He told us this was going to change everything,” another told me. (The cousins asked not to be named in this article.)\n\nAfter they flew back to London, the cousins decided to invest in Boldor’s venture. They told me they also invited their extended family to take out loans in order to contribute additional sums. According to the cousins, they wired Boldor a total of £250,000 via Western Union and MoneyGram, which they say he asked for in increments of less than £5,000 and deposited into accounts belonging to him, his brothers and their wives. (Boldor denies this account, and claims all the money invested in his companies has come from his own funds and those of a business partner, an American lawyer named Richard Vasey. However, the cousins provided me with documents that show they made these deposits between 2011 and 2013.)\n\nThe smelting chimney looming over the Cuprom site in Baia Mare. Photograph: Alexander Clapp\n\nIn early 2013, the digging began in earnest. One day last year, Boldor’s youngest brother, Peter, drove me in his truck to Cuprom’s towering, defunct smelter chimney. Around it, the ground was scarred with trenches where teams of Roma had dug out thousands of tonnes of decades-old sludge. Once the material was weighed, bagged and sealed, it was then trucked 500 miles south-east to Constanța, the Black Sea’s biggest port, where it was subject to random chemical tests in preparation for export.\n\nThat summer, Boldor began selling to international clients. Over the next three years, a dozen container ships laden with copper- and zinc-flecked sludge left from Constanța for China. Many others – ships bearing sludge flecked with silver and sludge flecked with gold – went to South Korea, Singapore, Macau and South Africa. In the United Arab Emirates, a tonne of Boldor’s copper sludge touched down via cargo plane from Bucharest; still more material made it to Belgium, Vietnam and the US. All buyers received accredited lab results certifying the immense mineral value of what they were buying. By 2017, according to his own financial records, Boldor had shipped some 10m tonnes of concentrates out of Baia Mare – and received more than €6m in payment.\n\nAs in a fable, Boldor seemed to have miraculously wound the clock back. Romanians from Baia Mare were once again sending Transylvania’s legendary mineral wealth out across the world. Colectând pentru Boldor – “collecting for Boldor” – had restored Cuprom to a hive of human activity. In turn the Roma grew increasingly loyal to Boldor, a man who had elevated their ancestral work to corporate scale and global reach. When I tried to speak to some of the Roma at Cuprom, they were wary of talking without Boldor’s permission. “Daniel has made us very happy,” the wife of one of Boldor’s workmen told me, adding that her husband wasn’t available to talk, having recently relocated to Dubai. Many other Roma also grew relatively wealthy. “Danny Boldor is a respected businessman,” Loredana Mihaly, the head of a Romanian NGO that advocates for Roma rights in Baia Mare, told me. “The Roma believe in Daniel like a hero. To them, he’s a wise man with money,” said Eva Kim, his former secretary. “They were all making a ton of cash off this thing,” said Mircea Doncu, a secondhand metal trader based in Bucharest.\n\nBoldor himself put it like this: “You see a Gypsy in this town driving a BMW?” he said. “You can thank me.”\n\nIt wasn’t until November 2016 that authorities began to notice that something strange was going on in Baia Mare. That month, an anonymous email landed in the inbox of Florin Guran, a waste inspector for Romania’s National Environmental Guard. The message linked to a story in the South China Morning Post, which reported that more than 100 shipping containers sent from Romania almost a year earlier were now sitting unclaimed in China. The containers were supposed to contain copper concentrate. But when port authorities in Shanghai performed a customs check on one container, what they found seemed less like copper concentrate and more like construction rubble.\n\nNow the shipment sat on a quay in Hong Kong. It was colossal – more than 2,700 tonnes packed into 123 shipping containers – and, in addition to allegedly being worthless, Chinese authorities claimed that it contained toxic quantities of arsenic and cadmium, two chemicals often found in mining waste. As officers at the National Environmental Guard began to look into the case, combing through customs declarations and export documents, the same name kept coming up: Daniel Boldor. “The office gathered around their computers and dug deeper,” Guran told me. “The only thing I can say is that – when we realised that it was Gypsies who had pulled off such a shipment – we were speechless. And we were immediately aware that there was more to the story.”\n\nGuran sent the link to Teodor Niţă, a 46-year-old state prosecutor with a bullish reputation in Romania’s crime-fighting circles. Built like a bouncer, with black hair cropped at right angles, Niţă has made his name by investigating the darker corners of the waste trade, which has become increasingly big business in Romania over the past decade. “When you think of the garbage trade, think the drug trade,” Niţă told me last year in his office in Constanța. Waste, like drugs, is a shadowy, globalised, multi-billion dollar industry. But waste, unlike drugs, moves from the world’s richest countries to its poorest – and can often be legally trafficked when it is demonstrated to contain no hazardous materials.\n\nSince 2018, when China stopped accepting foreign garbage, rich European countries have scrambled to find other recipients for their millions of tonnes of plastic waste. Romania, one of the continent’s worst recyclers, now also bears the distinction of being one of its greatest importers of garbage. To dump a tonne of plastic in a landfill in the UK costs local authorities nearly £100; disposing of it in Romania, even after the price of transportation, costs around half that amount. This trade is by and large legal. But shipping medical or industrial trash – including old mining residue – is illegal.\n\nNiţă estimates that his network of informants and port police has, in the last decade, prevented at least 2,000 containers of illegal waste from being offloaded in Romania by private garbage brokers – companies that are contracted by governments to move and dispose of their citizens’ garbage – operating from Italy to the UK. Reflecting on how richer European nations have turned Romania into the continent’s trash can, Niţă can sound a lot like Boldor. “The rest of Europe thinks of us as a second-rate country,” he told me. (“We are the puppets of Europe with no balls to say no,” Boldor told me via email not long ago.)\n\nA Communist-era mosaic at the Cuprom complex in Baia Mare. Photograph: Alex Clapp\n\nAs Niţă dug into the case, he found that, on the face of it, Boldor appeared to be an entrepreneur of unimpeachable credibility. His clients – metal traders from Thailand to Tacoma – had trusted him enough to front him hundreds of thousands of euros. His operations were licensed in the US. His cash moved through respectable European banks. His websites boasted glossy photos of copper ore that could have been used to illustrate a geology textbook. He had hired impeccably qualified engineers from Panama and Turkey.\n\nBut none of this, Niţă believed, was the real story. In early 2018, he journeyed to Baia Mare with 10 environmental police officers to take a closer look at Boldor’s operation. According to Niţă, weeks spent scouring around Baia Mare revealed not a multimillion-dollar export business, but a skeletal, ad hoc operation. Boldor seemed to possess no machinery, no registered employees and no permits to run his businesses.\n\nNor, in Niţă’s view, did Boldor actually own most of the dirt he had shipped across the world. True, Boldor had told his investors that he had clinched the rights to Cuprom’s mining residue; but the material he was directing the Roma to collect – and which he was upselling for tens of thousands of euros – was, said Niţă, dirt owned by the Romanian state, unearthed from every conceivable corner of Baia Mare. Investigators told me that they spoke to Roma who said they had collected material indiscriminately: sludge from riverbanks, stones from railway lines, asphalt from parking lots. “They showed us rocks on the side of the road,” said Cosmin Tanase, one of the police officers who worked with Niţă.\n\nAnd this dirt – which Boldor was allegedly selling as “concentrate” – was worthless. What divides “industrial waste” from “metal concentrate” is the percentage of metal in any given sample. Two industry sources explained to me that while most industrial waste possesses about 4% metal, the percentage in metal concentrate is at least 30. If the mining residue at Cuprom was typical industrial waste, then in order to become true metal concentrate it would have been necessary to undertake a lengthy process of refining and crushing, then mixing this material within considerable quantities of pure gold or copper. Only then could the magic 30% threshold be crossed. Otherwise, Roy Pitchford, a Zimbabwean mining executive, told me, Boldor was “just sending waste”.\n\nLast year, a pair of Romanian policemen drove me south of Constanța along a stretch of coastal highway on the edge of the Black Sea. After 20 minutes we stopped at a windy promontory, where the officers pointed to a great pile of dirty white canvas bags. This, they told me, was the “copper concentrate” Boldor had shipped to China six years earlier. A year after it had arrived, Chinese authorities had ordered it shipped back to Romania. Some of the bags had been slashed open, releasing a stream of black rubble littered with chunks of pavement the size of dinner plates and the odd rusty beer cap.\n\nBy mid-2018, Niţă had reached a conclusion about Boldor’s operation: it was, in his view, an ingenious and epic achievement. It was also, he believed, wildly illegal. Boldor had flipped Romania’s trash conundrum on its head. Rather than a foreign waste broker flooding the country with garbage, here was a Romanian national who had made serious money by shipping thousands of tonnes of useless Transylvanian rubble to the other side of the planet.\n\n“I’m not amazed by anything any more,” Niţă told me in his office in Constanța. “But with Daniel Boldor even I had to stand in awe of the ingenuity. He’s a very, very smart person whose greatest skill is presenting himself as an honourable man.”\n\nBy the time Niţă had begun reaching his conclusions, Boldor had amassed a string of enemies. Among them were the British cousins, who had begun to wonder whatever became of such a promising investment. According to their account, Boldor told them that they would get their money back, but he needed another £250,000. With some reluctance, the cousins agreed. “We told ourselves that we had come too far to back out now,” one of the investors told me. “But the truth is that we didn’t want to accept the fact that we had walked straight into a trap.”\n\nUnbeknown to the British cousins, Boldor had also been raising capital from other investors. One, a seasoned American businessman, told me that he was introduced to Boldor in 2013 through a contact in London’s oil circles. After flying to Baia Mare in 2014, he says he decided to invest more than €500,000 in Boldor’s operations. “There was a huge demand for metal ore in China at the time,” the American told me. “Every good con has to have elements of truth to it. And this did have elements of truth to it.” (Boldor denies that this businessman invested any money in his projects. Both the British cousins and the American claim to have received no money back from their investments and say that Boldor hasn’t replied to them for years.)\n\nIt wasn’t just investors who grew suspicious. So did customers. Last year, I spoke to Roberto Santos, the commercial director of a Spanish metal-processing company that purchased 112 tonnes of copper concentrate from Boldor’s company in 2015 in exchange €120,597, of which more than €90,000 was paid upfront. When the shipment arrived in the port of Bilbao, Santos found what appeared to be rubble. The shipment had allegedly been tested in a Romanian lab, where it was certified as containing 39% copper; tests conducted by Santos in Spain detected less than 2%. When Santos demanded a refund, Boldor advised that he pay for new rounds of tests, then allegedly stopped responding altogether. After a year spent unsuccessfully attempting to pin Boldor down in a Spanish court, Santos gave up. (According to Boldor, Santos Bartolome is a “scam company”, which never paid him any money, though he provided no evidence for this claim.)\n\nThe shipment that may eventually prove to be Boldor’s downfall happens to be the biggest one he ever pulled off: the 2,700 tonnes of material he sent to China in late 2015. When some of it was repatriated to Romania in 2017, scientists from the country’s most prestigious universities were sent samples and asked to analyse their contents. The scientists reached the same conclusion as China’s inspectors: the material was worthless. No amount of smelting could ever wring any profitable amount of metal from it. “It wasn’t raw material,” Ioan Carcea, a chemistry professor at Gheorghe Asachi Technical University in Iași, told me.\n\nBags of rubble photographed by prosecutor Teodor Niţă on his 2018 visit to Baia Mare. Photograph: Teodor Niţă\n\nBut if Boldor’s operation was a scam, as prosecutors allege, it would not have been enough to simply ship dirt and call it gold. In order to export his product abroad, it had to be tested twice. The first test required Boldor to send a sample to a lab in Transylvania. The second was done at the port of Constanța, where customs officials would randomly open a quarter of the shipment and test its contents. Niţă told me he has never been able to figure out how both tests were faked. Boldor “must have brought legitimate samples to the laboratories” for testing, he told me. But the cousins in London and the American investor told me a different story. They claimed that Boldor bought the results he needed, exchanging cash for false documents. “If Boldor didn’t have the cooperation of powerful people in Romania, this would have never happened,” said the American investor.\n\nIn June 2018, Niţă filed suit against Boldor on behalf of the prosecutor’s office of the court of Constanța. Among other things, Boldor has been accused of money laundering, customs fraud, document forgery, the collection and transport of hazardous waste and various forms of tax evasion. The charges extend far beyond his 2015 shipment to China, encompassing more than five years of alleged wrongdoing in the metal remediation industry. A judge has been considering the case since 2020 and a verdict is expected in the coming year. If found guilty, Boldor could receive up to 10 years in jail. (For now, Boldor remains free to come and go from Romania as he chooses; when I met him, he had recently returned from a business trip to Dubai.)\n\nAccording to Boldor, the case amounts to an attempt to put him out of business, manufactured by corrupt investigators working on behalf of a state that does not like to see a smart Roma businessman get ahead. When you ask him about the controversy surrounding his China shipment, Boldor points to what happened to the other half. For if it really was waste, what happened next was truly strange. In 2016, after ordering half of Boldor’s dirt back to Constanța, Cosco Shipping, the Chinese state shipping company, seized the rest – more than 1,000 tonnes – and put it up for auction. Some was sold to companies in inland China; some went to Macau; some nearly arrived in Malaysia, before local inspectors intervened and prevented the ship carrying the material from docking on grounds that the shipment contained “hazardous waste”.\n\nWhy would a Chinese state shipping company, alleging Boldor’s material to be toxic, sell it across south-east Asia? Two metal traders I spoke to suggested the same theory. Boldor’s shipment hadn’t magically accrued value. But storing hundreds of cargo containers for a year had been expensive, and China was looking for a way to recoup some of its losses. Cosco Shipping did not respond to requests for comment, but if this theory is true, the irony is striking. A Chinese state shipping company had no compunction committing the same crime that the Chinese state had levelled against Boldor: knowingly selling falsified material.\n\nIn 2018, after Niţă’s investigation had been submitted to a judge, Boldor stopped sending the Roma around Cuprom to dig up dirt. Instead, he moved into real estate. Using the income he had accrued over the previous decade, he bought a large swath of the complex from a Romanian state-owned insolvency firm. Boldor now lords over nearly 20 hectares of dilapidated factories, flotation systems and chemical laboratories – and has become the uncontested owner of the millions of tonnes of dirt trapped beneath. As we drove back to Baia Mare from Fersig, Boldor beckoned grandly towards Cuprom. “Ceaușescu built it,” he said. “And now I own it.”\n\nI asked Boldor why he decided to invest in a project that had proved so costly and frustrating to so many others. He still holds to his original story. A vast treasure lay beneath Cuprom, he told me. In the coming years he was determined to fly in technicians from China and Saudi Arabia to demonstrate on site that Cuprom’s dirt really is valuable.\n\nThe story the prosecutors were telling about him was nonsense, he said. The truth, he claimed, was that he had revealed something the authorities in his country and the EU didn’t want to become common knowledge: tremendous wealth still existed here, amid the ruins of communism. “They don’t want to catch me. They want to take me out of the game,” Boldor concluded, narrowing his eyes.\n\nAs for the hundreds of Roma who now lived in Cuprom, Boldor was no longer just their informal employer. He had become the closest thing they had to a landlord. European NGOs would no longer be allowed to show up and pretend to help them. “We will send in our own social workers,” Boldor said. The Roma would be given IDs and a cut of Boldor’s eventual profits would be put into a kindergarten for their children.\n\nWhen I asked Boldor what Niţă might say about all this, he assured me that he wasn’t worried about it: for $10,000 he could have Niţă shot. “What?” he asked me blankly. “You don’t think I have $10,000?” As with so much of what Boldor says, it was difficult to tell what was real and what was bluster – and whether he himself even knew. He later told me via email that he had simply meant that he could pay Niţă off to make the case go away. “I’ve made some mistakes,” Boldor acknowledged at one point in our conversation, but when I pressed him he grew increasingly flustered, eventually asking if I wasn’t working for one of his competitors.\n\nVia email, Boldor denied having conducted any “illegal business” in his life. He reiterated that he had not forged any documents, that his companies had all the proper paperwork, that he had not evaded paying tax or shipped any hazardous material. He claimed that he was being unfairly targeted. “Fuck [the idea] that Daniel Boldor is a Gypsy criminal and he is not allow[ed] to make money or business in this sector,” he wrote. He claimed that he had paid for feasibility studies and that a team of 30 experts from Beijing had visited Baia Mare and determined that there is metal concentrate worth $860m on his land. “I am a fucking challenger and a player and I have nothing to hide,” he wrote.\n\nOn my last day in Baia Mare, one of Boldor’s associates – a grey-haired former miner in a yellow security vest – agreed to drive me out to Cuprom one final time. We passed through a battered gate flanked by people clustered around burning piles of trash. After a few hundred metres we came to a muddy stretch of land that Boldor had staked out for a new state-of-the-art laboratory. “It’s taken Danny a long time to get here,” the miner told me. “But now he’s ready to bring it all back.” In the distance, crumbling down the wall of a defunct factory, a communist-era mosaic depicted a man striking gold with his bare fist alongside a woman draped in a lab coat clutching a chemical beaker.\n\nFive months later, in September last year, a short story appeared on a local news website. “Investors want to give new life to Cuprom,” it announced, showing photos of Boldor posing in front of a blue helicopter, dressed in a dark blazer and blue shirt, with brown leather shoes and a fat watch. Next to him, a pair of smart-looking German investors in sunglasses smiled for the cameras, prepared to follow Boldor inside the helicopter.\n\nSupport for this article was provided by a grant from the Pulitzer Center"
