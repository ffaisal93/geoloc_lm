    "Lebanon parliament passes 2022 budget that falls short of IMF reform": "Sept 26 (Reuters) - Lebanon's parliament passed the 2022 budget on Monday using an exchange rate for customs tax revenues that lies far below the market value of the Lebanese pound, falling short of economic reform measures that would pave the way for an IMF deal.\n\nAn agreement with the lender of last resort is seen as a first crucial step for Lebanon to begin exiting a three-year financial implosion that has left most people poor and plunged the country into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 Civil War.\n\nAn April staff-level agreement between Lebanon's government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said authorities should increase revenues to fund the crippled public sector and allow for more social spending by calculating customs taxes at a \"unified exchange rate\".\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nBut parliament endorsed a rate of 15,000 pounds to the dollar, while the market rate sat at around 37,000.\n\nOfficials view the approval of a higher exchange rate for imports as a move that would be unpopular in the heavily import-dependent country.\n\nThe budget - adopted with just three months left in the year - calculated expenditures at 41 trillion Lebanese pounds, or just $1.1 billion at the market rate on Monday, and revenues at 30 trillion Lebanese pounds.\n\nIts hard-currency value marks a massive drop from the 2019 budget, the last before the crisis, which was worth more than $16 billion - a result of the depreciation of the Lebanese pound by more than 95% since that year.\n\nThe 2022 budget tripled salaries for all public sector workers, including the army and security forces, many of whom now earn less than the equivalent of $50 per month.\n\nIbrahim Kanaan, a lawmaker who heads parliament's budget committee, told Reuters the back and forth between officials over the customs rate had cost the country valuable time.\n\n\"We spent six months (on the budget)... and up until tonight, they were still dancing between different rates. This is not healthy,\" he said.\n\nThe IMF had no immediate comment.\n\nLast week it noted that progress towards reforms had been \"very slow\" and said delays in approving the 2022 budget meant that focus must now turn to the 2023 budget.\n\n\"This should be based on realistic macroeconomic assumptions, with the necessary revenue raising measures, including the use of a realistic exchange rate... for all tax purposes,\" it said.\n\nSibylle Rizk, director of public policies at advocacy group Kulluna Irada, said the 2022 budget did not put Lebanon on a path towards fiscal accountability, and would not afford the government the funds to invest in key social expenditure.\n\n\"It's an extremely regressive budget in one of the most dire periods for Lebanese society,\" she said.\n\n\"It shows that... Lebanon now has a zombie state. Authorities show no willingness to start key reforms to put the country back on the track of fiscal and debt sustainability and provide basic services to the population,\" she said.\n\nThe government has said the 2022 budget was supposed to be corrective but that the 2023 budget would include deeper reforms.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Timour Azhar; Writing by Timour Azhari and Nayera Abdallah; Editing by Grant McCool and Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Lebanon: Syrian Refugee Apparently Tortured to Death": "Click to expand Image Bashar Abed Al Saud © 2022 Private\n\n(Beirut) – Lebanese authorities should transfer the prosecution of security force members charged in the torture and murder of a Syrian refugee from inherently unfair military courts to the ordinary criminal courts, Human Rights Watch, Legal Agenda, Amnesty International, and MENA Rights Group said today.\n\nMembers of State Security, one of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, allegedly tortured Bashar Abed Al Saud, 30, after his arrest on August 30, 2022. He died from his injuries on August 31. On September 2, after news of Al Saud’s death and photographs of his bruised body circulated in the media, the Military Prosecutor Judge Fadi Akiki, arrested and charged a State Security officer and three other members with torture and referred them to the Military Investigative Judge Najat Abu Shaqra. They are being investigated in the military justice system, which lacks independence and includes judges appointed by the defense minister.\n\n“Al Saud’s death during his detention at State Security requires a fair and comprehensive investigation in front of the ordinary judiciary, as the military justice system cannot bring justice for his family,” said Ghida Frangieh, head of litigation at Legal Agenda.\n\nOn September 8, Al Saud’s family submitted a torture complaint to the Cassation Public Prosecution through their lawyer Mohammad Sablouh. The prosecutor, Judge Ghassan Oueidat, referred the case as a violation of Lebanon’s anti-torture law to the military prosecutor. On September 15, Al Saud’s relatives resubmitted a request to refer the file to the ordinary criminal courts, but Judge Oueidat also referred that request to the military prosecutor.\n\nReferring the investigation to the military court is contrary to international law, as interpreted by treaty bodies, and article 15 of Lebanon’s Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that crimes that members of the judicial police commit while carrying out their duties as assistants to the public prosecution fall solely under the jurisdiction of the ordinary judiciary.\n\nFurther, Lebanon’s 2017 anti-torture law also states in its preamble that the regular judiciary alone “has the power to prosecute, investigate, and try” crimes of torture, “excluding any other exceptional criminal courts.” When debating the anti-torture bill in September 2017, Parliament members agreed that there was no need to include this explicitly in the proposed law in light of article 15 of the criminal procedure code.\n\nThe jurisdiction of ordinary criminal courts over torture complaints is fundamental to ensuring that victims of crimes under international law, like torture, or human rights violations have the right to an effective remedy, the organizations said. The structure of the military judicial system in Lebanon and its legal procedures mean that security force personnel will not be prosecuted before a competent, independent, and impartial court.\n\nMost military court judges are military and security services officers, appointed by the defense minister, and are not required to have a law degree or legal training. Human rights organizations and the media cannot monitor military trials without prior permission from the presiding judge. In addition, the Military Justice Law does not allow victims to participate in the trial, and at most considers them potential witnesses.\n\nA member of Al Saud’s family told the organizations that at around 8 p.m. on August 30, about six or seven security agents wearing military clothing arrested Al Saud at his home in the Shatila camp in Beirut, without identifying their agency or saying why he was being arrested. They did not present a judicial arrest order, the relative said.\n\nAl Saud’s relative and Sablouh, his lawyer, said that Al Saud was not allowed to call his family or have a lawyer present during his interrogation, in violation of his due process rights under international law and Lebanon’s Code of Criminal Procedure. His relative said that they did not know Al Saud’s whereabouts until they received a call on September 3 telling them to collect his body from the Tebneen Public Hospital in south Lebanon.\n\nThe authorities had transferred Al Saud to the Nabatieh hospital in south Lebanon at around 7 a.m. on August 31, where a forensic report that the organizations reviewed found that Al Saud died as a result of “the stoppage of the central nervous system due intense pain and suffering from violence and severe beatings, which ultimately led to the stopping of his heart and blood circulation.” The forensic report also stated that the doctor found:\n\nblueness and redness in the head near the left ear, a bleeding wound on the right side of the lower lip, remnants of blood in the nostrils, signs of several burns all over the body, many signs indicating the use of a whip or an electric wire in the upper extremities, back, chest, abdomen and lower extremities up to the feet, and swelling in the testicles.\n\nPhotographs and a video of Al Saud’s body, which the organizations reviewed, corroborate the forensic report, and show large parts of his body covered in bruises, whip marks, cuts, and burns.\n\nOn September 2, a Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar publicized the news of Al Saud’s alleged torture and death, prompting State Security to issue a statement claiming that its forces had arrested Al Saud after members of an Islamic State (ISIS) cell identified him as an accomplice, and that Al Saud had confessed to fighting with ISIS. The statement conceded that Al Saud had died, but it did not address the torture allegations and stated that the agency had referred the case to the “competent judiciary.”\n\nOn September 5, State Security released another statement accusing some media outlets of “slandering” the agency and stating that the file had been transferred to the military judiciary and that maximum penalties would be imposed against anyone found to have violated orders.\n\nHuman Rights Watch wrote to State Security and the Cassation Public Prosecutor, copying the military prosecutor, on September 6, asking for clarification around the scope of State Security’s mandate in policing suspected terrorism cases and its detention authority; the circumstances and legality of Al Saud’s arrest and detention; and any action that State Security or the prosecution had taken to investigate, suspend, or discipline any State Security member involved in the arrest, interrogation, or alleged torture and ill-treatment of Al Saud. As of September 26, Human Rights Watch has not received a response.\n\nMENA Rights Group submitted Al Saud’s case to several United Nations human rights experts, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.\n\nThe Cassation Public Prosecution has previously referred torture complaints to the military judiciary in apparent violation of the law. This includes a torture complaint that the actor Ziad Itani submitted in October 2018 against members of State Security, as well as torture complaints from 17 protesters against the security forces in December 2019 in the context of Lebanon’s nationwide protests. The military prosecutor and cassation public prosecutor agreed in April 2019 to transfer Itani’s complaint to the ordinary courts. No one has been charged in these cases.\n\n“Impunity for torture remains commonplace, with dozens of complaints regarding torture and other ill-treatment filed under the 2017 Anti-Torture Law rarely reaching court and most closed without an effective investigation,” said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International’s Acting Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. “It is about time that the Lebanese authorities begin to implement the anti-torture law, investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, and hold the perpetrators accountable.”\n\nThe Lebanese authorities should seriously investigate complaints related to crimes of torture and respect the jurisdiction of regular courts over these crimes, the organizations said. The public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, the government commissioner at the military court, and the military investigative judge should immediately transfer the file about the investigation into Al Saud’s death to the competent and ordinary criminal judge, the investigative judge in the south, to ensure compliance with Lebanese law and the right of his relatives to an effective remedy.\n\nFurther, Lebanon should allocate funds to allow the five members of the National Preventative Mechanism against Torture, who were appointed in July 2019, to fulfill their mandate.\n\n“The shocking images of Al Saud’s bruised and gashed body should send a strong message to the Lebanese authorities that they need to be doing much more to combat torture in detention,” said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Those responsible for Al Saud’s torture and death should be brought to justice in fair and transparent judicial proceedings.”",
    "Lebanon retirees scuffle with police; banks partially reopen": "Lebanese army retirees scuffled with police as they briefly broke through a cordon leading to Parliament in downtown Beirut during a rally Monday over their decimated monthly pay amid the country's economic meltdown.\n\nRiot police managed to push the crowd back and fired teargas, forcing the elderly retirees to turn away from the street. After a short while, they gathered nearby to continue their protest and demand higher pay.\n\nThe rally came as banks in this crisis-hit Lebanon partially reopened Monday following a weeklong closure amid a wave of heists in which assailants stormed at least seven bank branches earlier this month, demanding to withdraw their trapped savings.\n\n\"We are in the country of mafias.

That year, the banks imposed strict limits on cash withdrawals, tying up the savings of millions of people.\n\nThe country’s economy has since spiraled, with about three-quarters of the population plunged into poverty. The Lebanese pound has lost over 90% of its value against the dollar.\n\nThe frustrations boiled over this month, with angry and desperate depositors — including one armed with a hunting rifle — started holding up the banks. One of them, Sali Hafez, broke into a Beirut bank branch with a fake pistol and retrieved some $13,000 in her savings to cover her sister’s cancer treatment.\n\nExplainer: Will Lebanon’s ‘bank heroes’ face any jail time? https://t.co/58kA43kBD3 — The New Arab (@The_NewArab) September 26, 2022\n\nHowever, only a handful of bank branches opened Monday — accepting only customers with prior appointments for corporate transactions. The partial reopening was to continue indefinitely, until banks can secure the safety of their employees.\n\nCrowds of anxious Lebanese gathered around ATM machines.\n\n“I've been here for three hours, and they won't let me in or schedule an appoint,” Fadi Al-Osta told The Associated Press outside a bank branch in Beirut. “The security guards can let us in one at a time and check for weapons. Isn't that their job?”\n\nGeorge al-Hajj, president of Lebanon's Federation of Bank Employees Syndicates, said branches have downsized, to have a larger number of security guards per branch.\n\n“Our goal isn't to harm anyone, but we want to go to work feeling safe and secure,” al-Hajj said. “We're also human beings.\"\n\nTensions were simmering in the southern city of Sidon, where State Security forces armed with assault rifles stood outside some bank branches. Some police officers and army soldiers, whose salaries have lost over 90% of their value, unsuccessfully tried to break into a bank branch to collect small cash bonus recently granted by the government.\n\nRELATED Lebanon expects US mediator offer for maritime border with Israel within days MENA\n\nDepositors' Outcry, a protest group that has supported bank heists to retrieve savings, said Monday it was committed to a “war on the banks” but that it had also called for a meeting with the bankers to find solutions so that “depositors can live with dignity.\"\n\n“We will continue organizing actions, including strong actions that will target and shock the banks,” said the group’s media coordinator, Moussa Agassi.\n\nLebanon's talks with the International Monetary Fund on a bailout have progressed sluggishly, with authorities failing to implement critical reforms, including restructuring the banking sector and lifting banking secrecy laws. Last week, a visiting IMF delegation criticized the government’s slowness to implement desperately-needed financial reforms.",
    "Death toll from sinking of Lebanon boat rises to 94": "The death toll from a boat that sank off the Syrian coast after sailing from Lebanon earlier this week has risen to 94, Syrian state TV said on Saturday.\n\nThe country’s transport ministry has quoted survivors as saying the boat left Lebanon’s northern Minyeh region on Tuesday bound for Europe with between 120 and 150 people onboard.\n\nFilippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, described the incident as a “heart-wrenching tragedy”.\n\nAt least 14 people rescued were recovering in hospitals in Syria, while six others were discharged and two remained in intensive care, Syria’s official Sana news agency reported. As search efforts continued, several people were still missing since the boat sank on Thursday.\n\n\n\n“The death toll … has risen to 94,” state television said.\n\nThe Lebanese army said it had arrested a Lebanese national who “admitted to organising the recent [people] smuggling operation from Lebanon to Italy by sea”.\n\nAs many as 150 people were onboard the small boat, which sank off the Syrian port of Tartus, 30 miles (about 50km) north of Tripoli in Lebanon, from where it set sail.\n\nThose onboard were mostly Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians and included children and the elderly, the UN said. Unicef said 10 children appeared to be among the dead.\n\nFamilies in Lebanon held a second day of funerals on Saturday after they were handed bodies of relatives on Friday night through the Arida border crossing with Syria. Others still await the bodies of their relatives.\n\nIn Tripoli, anger mixed with grief as relatives received news of the death of loved ones. Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday in the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp, north of Tripoli, for the funeral procession of one of the victims, pumping their fists in the air.\n\nThe number of people who left or tried to leave Lebanon by sea nearly doubled between 2020 and 2021, the UN refugee agency told Reuters earlier this month.

    "Debunking the dangerous myth that refugees are an economic burden in Lebanon": "BEIRUT\n\nIn July, Lebanon’s Minister of the Displaced announced a plan to force 15,000 Syrian refugees a month to return to their home country, against their wishes if need be.\n\nWhile the plan hasn’t gone anywhere – and it’s not clear if it ever will – it’s emblematic of an increasingly hostile environment for refugees in Lebanon, one that has seen rising reports of violence and discrimination against them.\n\nIt has become common for Lebanese politicians and civilians alike to argue that the country’s 1-1.5 million Syrian refugees are an economic burden. But our recent research, supported by the World Refugee and Migration Council, shows that the arrival of Syrian refugees did not have an impact on Lebanon’s economy.\n\nThat does not mean the economy is not in a grim state: More Syrians – as well as Lebanese and Palestinians – are taking dangerous boat trips in a last-ditch attempt to get to Europe. Just this weekend, it emerged that at least 97 people who had been trying to get to Europe died when their boat sank in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Syria.\n\nAs academics who have closely examined, and debunked, the myth that refugees are contributing to this collapse, we are calling on international donors, aid groups, and the government of Lebanon – all of whom have contributed to this understanding – to look more closely at the facts, for the benefit of everyone in a deeply troubled country.\n\nA downward trend\n\nThe July announcement of the repatriation plan was the culmination of years of negative pressure on (and discourse about) Syrian refugees in Lebanon.\n\nWe often hear that Lebanon – the country hosting the most refugees per capita in the world – is at a breaking point: It cannot take more refugees.\n\nLebanon has unquestionably taken in a large number of refugees: 1.5 million by the government’s count, in a country of nearly 7 million total people. And it is at a breaking point: In 2021, the World Bank ranked it in the top 10, possibly top three, most severe crises globally since the mid-nineteenth century. But it is not because of Syrian refugees.\n\n“If the arrival of refugees had any impact on Lebanon’s economy at all, our research shows it may have been positive, through increased international aid.”\n\nWhen Syrians began to arrive in Lebanon in 2011 at the beginning of their country’s war, they came to a country already on a downward economic trend. Indeed, the World Bank has called the financial crisis in Lebanon a “deliberate crisis”, one born out of political mismanagement and corruption.\n\nOur research measured the impact of Syrian refugees between 2011 and 2020 on key indicators of how an economy is doing: labour force participation rate, unemployment, imports, exports, electricity generation, inflation, and international aid. Our results show no relationship between the number of refugees and the growth of the Lebanese economy, contrary to the pervasive belief and current debate on refugees in the country and internationally.\n\nIf the arrival of refugees had any impact on Lebanon’s economy at all, our research shows it may have been positive, through increased international aid.\n\nLocal impact and the curse of mismanagement\n\nThat does not mean all has been smooth sailing in Lebanon, which did see major changes with the arrival of so many new people.\n\nWhile the refugees did not have a negative effect on the national-level economy, in some local areas residents have endured increased pressure on infrastructure like healthcare and schools, not to mention competition for limited jobs. In some places, as the new arrivals were often willing to work for less, wages did go down.\n\nMany Lebanese felt refugees were receiving more assistance than they were, despite the fact the country was clearly in an economic crisis and more and more locals needed help. This also contributed to tension between some Lebanese and Syrian communities, even though some aid groups do actually help host communities.\n\nThese local experiences are directly linked to the national mismanagement of the economy by successive Lebanese governments. Our research shows that the overall negative economic trend of the country since 1990 (the end of Lebanon’s 15-year civil war) has been accompanied by increasing social and economic inequality.\n\nPoverty spread throughout the country, but there were also profound regional differences. It was Lebanon’s poorest regions that ended up taking in the vast majority of Syrian refugees, likely because they were places with affordable housing, seasonal work in agriculture, or where Syrians already had ties to people or jobs in the community. This may have contributed to local distrust, but the fact remains that on a national level, the refugee influx was not to blame for the downturn.\n\nEurope’s buy-out\n\nThe international community has a role to play here, too. Like the Lebanese government, despite evidence to the contrary, some donor countries in the Global North continue to argue that refugees are an economic burden with their own anti-refugee and migrant policies, placing severe limits on how many refugees they will take in.\n\nEurope in particular has attempted to buy itself out of responsibility for hosting these refugees, with pledges of aid meant to reduce the number of Syrians that make it to its shores. But that has not eased life enough that people are not willing to risk their lives to get to Europe, or anywhere other than Lebanon.\n\nFurthermore, neither foreign funding nor the presence of international NGOs has managed to change the Lebanese government’s position on refugees. President Michel Aoun has made it clear that opposition by the international community or rights groups will not stop the country from sending Syrians back home.\n\nAnd, despite occasional promises in exchange for aid commitments, Lebanon has not made it easier for Syrians to gain legal residency or to work legally. Today, more than 80 percent of Syrian refugees over the age of 15 lack legal residency in Lebanon, exposing them to the constant threat of deportation.\n\nA shift towards inclusive development\n\nThe international community has done almost nothing – aside from issuing the occasional statement – to change the poor treatment and dire economic state of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. It seems to have simply accepted what the American scholar Jeffrey Pugh has termed “the invisibility bargain”, in which refugees are present and somewhat tolerated in a country as long as they are economic producers, do not contribute to economic loss, and remain politically and socially invisible.\n\nBut the truth is that refugees are not invisible. Their presence in Lebanon over the past 11 years has economically embedded them into local communities, albeit on the margins, due to their lack of residency and exclusion from large parts of the labour market.\n\nWith more than 90 percent of Syrian refugees (and 77 percent of Lebanese) living below the poverty line, refugees in Lebanon will not magically become self-reliant (a stated goal of the UN’s 2018 Global Compact on Refugees).\n\n“The international community has done almost nothing – aside from issuing the occasional statement – to change the poor treatment and dire economic state of Syrian refugees in Lebanon.”\n\nThey will remain a presence for years to come. Even if the government of Lebanon was to succeed in returning 15,000 Syrian refugees every month – in doing so, risking human rights abuses and persecution for those sent back – it would take more than eight years for what the government estimates to be 1.5 million Syrian refugees in the country to return.\n\nDespite this fact, aid to refugees in Lebanon and their host communities is “emergency” assistance; intended to meet short-term needs. It is a crucial lifeline, but it is not enough, and we still need a more nuanced understanding about their role in Lebanon’s economy to move forward.\n\nOnly with this understanding and renewed energy can donor countries, aid groups, and the government move on from the “refugee as burden” discourse, towards an economic policy that includes – and hopefully benefits – all groups trying to get by in a country in crisis.",
    "Daily blackouts put Lebanon’s ancient artefacts at risk": "Electricity – in short supply in Lebanon – is needed to preserve many of the National Museum of Beirut’s priceless archaeological treasures.\n\nBeirut, Lebanon – The severe power shortages plaguing Lebanon are not only hitting homes and private institutions, but are also affecting major cultural centres and putting priceless exhibits at risk.\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut experienced even worse blackouts than usual over two weeks in August, receiving only one or two hours a day of state-provided electricity, with no funds for generator fuel.\n\nFootage shot by tourist Mariella Rubio that showed visitors viewing the museum’s archaeological wonders by phone flashlight made waves on social media.\n\n“The experience was paradoxical, because of course seeing the museum completely blacked out was sad – it was the perfect metaphor for the whole country – but at the same time, I have to admit that the feeling of being in the museum in that situation was somehow magical in a twisted way,” Rubio told Al Jazeera.\n\n“They didn’t charge us or any of the visitors because of the absence of light,” she said. “It gave me the opportunity not only to enjoy the museum in a different way, but to also have a perfect comprehension of what the real situation of the country, economy and energy system is like.”\n\nEl Museo Nacional de Beirut completamente a oscuras por la enorme crisis energética que asola el país. Los visitantes tienen que hacer la visita con linternas. Piezas de incalculable valor arqueológico en absoluta oscuridad (Hilo) pic.twitter.com/buG5IrMVlt — Mariela Rubio (@marielarubio) August 9, 2022\n\nThe Culture Ministry says it has resolved the situation for now by providing the museum with funds to buy generator fuel, which is essential for protecting the exhibits requiring climate control.\n\nBut while the situation may be stable for now, when the funds run out, a new plan will be needed to secure the museum’s survival.\n\nOpening hours have been restricted to cut down on fuel consumption.\n\nLike most businesses and institutions in Lebanon, the museum faces challenges because of the economic meltdown that began in 2019. Blackouts are a daily occurrence in Lebanon now, with state power providing only one hour a day in most areas.\n\n“You have to fight and to continue – especially because, despite the lack of electricity, we had between 150 and 250 people visiting daily,” museum director Anne-Marie Afeiche told Al Jazeera.\n\n“We are dealing with problems like everyone – with the [salaries of the] guards, the employees, issues paying for the maintenance or cleaning – but we are still standing,” she added.\n\n“Like the country, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”\n\n‘This is our treasure, our heritage’\n\nOpened in 1942, Lebanon’s principal archaeology museum currently displays about 1,300 artefacts from a collection of 100,000 pieces ranging from prehistoric times to the Roman, Phoenician, Byzantine, and Mamluk periods.\n\nFor the museum’s stone objects, climate control is not an issue.\n\nBut for items such as frescoes, mummies and textile, metal or organic artefacts like Bronze Age weaponry and Roman leather armour, temperature and humidity control – and therefore power – is essential.\n\nAfeiche said the museum is closely monitoring sensitive objects for damage or changes.\n\n“These collections cannot be replaced. This is our treasure, our heritage, and we have to take care of it in the best way.”\n\nShe said it is often the fluctuations between hot and cold and wet and dry caused by blackouts that pose the biggest dangers.\n\n“So really, we dodged the bullet, as it was only two weeks with very bad power situation and now things are better.”\n\nThe International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH) has been working with the museum since the 2020 Beirut port blast, pledging $5m to aid cultural institutions and monuments damaged in the explosion or threatened by the country’s challenges.\n\nThe museum’s generators were damaged in the blast and are still not fully repaired. The power situation in Lebanon has only worsened since the port blast, amid a plummeting currency and skyrocketing fuel prices.\n\nIn November 2021, ALIPH provided $15,000 for fuel purchases, to ease the pressing power issues.\n\nWhen those funds ran out and the museum was once again without regular power, ALIPH reassessed the situation and approved a grant of $130,000 in February 2022 to be used for solar power installation, to be implemented by Paris’s Louvre Museum in coordination with Lebanon’s General Directorate of Antiquities (DGA).\n\n“It’s a necessity and we know how much the DGA is struggling with preserving the objects and keeping the museum at certain levels, in terms of temperature and humidity,” ALIPH project manager David Sassine told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The most favourable [scenario] is to keep any object in very stable conditions, [otherwise] ageing of these elements will be catalysed in a big way.\n\n“Instead of restoring the generators when it’s unsure that there will be enough fuel supply, we chose a more sustainable approach focusing on renewable energy to make sure the museum is autonomous in terms of the power supply.”\n\nDespite the urgency of the project, the solar panels cannot be installed until the council of ministers officially approves the grant and all the technical aspects are mapped out.\n\nSassine believes that the approval will be signed soon and the panels may be installed by December, but ultimately the timeline rests on the expediency of the Lebanese government.\n\nALIPH has now approved another grant of $15,000 for fuel, to help keep generators on until the solar system can be installed.\n\nIn the meantime, the DGA and the Ministry of Finance decided in September to raise entry prices for all museums and archaeological sites managed by the government to generate more income for maintenance and other expenses.\n\nThe museum will have to rely on locals with access to dollars or tourists and expats to keep afloat, especially with the influx of visitors into Lebanon in recent months.\n\nAfeiche says the museum relies primarily on income from the museum’s shop and other facilities for most maintenance and cleaning expenses.\n\n“The National Heritage Foundation built an extension to the museum [in 2020], which will eventually be inaugurated with a cafeteria,” she added.\n\n“It’s always the [shop], the restaurants and the cafeteria that helps the museum sustain [itself].

    "The race for Lebanon's next president": "Analysis: Plagued by political fragmentation and an economic crisis, Lebanon's upcoming presidential election has yet to produce a consensus candidate that can unite the country.\n\n\n\nThe new parliament formed in May is preparing to elect the next president of the Lebanese Republic, who will be in charge for the next six years.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun is expected to leave office by 31st October, and the election of a new president represents a crucial test bed for political parties to gauge alliances and outline the political direction of the country.\n\nBy convention, the president of Lebanon is a Christian Maronite, and the main responsibility is to serve as a symbol of the nation's unity. The presidency plays an active role in the country's political life as it can exercise several prerogatives before, during, and after the formation of the government.\n\nIn parliament, a president is elected by way of a secret ballot and a two-thirds majority in the first session, with an absolute majority in subsequent rounds. This election of the incoming Lebanese president comes amid the most critical moment of Lebanon's post-civil war history.\n\n\"No political bloc gained a substantial majority in the general elections held in May, and the parliamentary fragmentation hasn't helped in the search for a consensus candidate\"\n\nPolitical instability, corruption, and an ongoing multidimensional economic crisis that erupted in late 2019 have torn apart the country's social fabric, making a recovery for any government tough.\n\nPrime Minister-designate Najib Mikati has yet to form a government, and his lineup of ministries presented to President Aoun didn't convince the latter to give the green light for establishing the new cabinet, although Mikati has made assurances in recent days that the new government is set to be formed before President Aoun's term ends.\n\nNo political bloc gained a substantial majority in the general elections held in May, and the parliamentary fragmentation hasn’t helped in the search for a consensus candidate.\n\nIn the last few weeks, several names started to circulate that could be potential candidates at Baabda Palace, the official residence of the President of Lebanon, although no political party has yet endorsed an official candidate. The goal of major political parties is to find a common candidate able to receive consensus.\n\nThe two major Christian Maronite parties, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), founded by incumbent President Aoun and led by his son-in-law Gebran Bassil, and the Lebanese Forces (LF), led by Samir Geagea, are likely to be confrontational over the competition for the next president.\n\nSeveral local newspapers named both Bassil and Geagea as potential candidates, although some experts argue that they have little chance of assuming the role. Nevertheless, it is necessary for any candidate who wants to run for the presidency to receive political endorsements from one or both Christian Maronite parties.\n\nThe endorsement of the presidential candidate from one or both major Christian Maronite parties is necessary to have political legitimacy and may be decisive in understanding the strength of foreign political influence in the country.\n\nThe FPM is allied with Iran-backed Hezbollah, while Geagea's LF takes an anti-Hezbollah position and is widely seen as Saudi Arabia's main Lebanese ally.\n\nSami Nader, political analyst and Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA), explained to The New Arab that Lebanese presidents elected since the end of the civil war had allied with different regional powers.\n\nLebanese President Michel Aoun sits between Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of Lebanon's Independence Day in Beirut on 22 November 2021. [Getty]\n\n\"What will be the share of the Iranian and the anti-Iranian camp? I don't think Geagea or Bassil can be elected because the degree of opposition of other camps is thick. Geagea has an excessive anti-Iranian stance, while Bassil is under US sanctions,\" he said.\n\nBut beyond unofficial candidates Geagea and Bassil, other names are popping up.\n\nSuleman Antoine Frangieh, current President of the Christian Maronite party the Marada Movement, and grandson of the former Lebanese President Suleiman Kalaman Frangieh, is seen as a suitable solution to find common ground between parties, although he is considered affiliated with the 8th of March alliance, which is allied with Hezbollah.\n\nImad Salamey, associate professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the Lebanese American University (LAU), told The New Arab that Frangieh has a high chance of being endorsed.\n\n\"Frangieh has a kind of international consensus [...] however, he should ensure sufficient support, particularly from the FPM, securing the party at least one-third of the future government. But in this scenario, he may face opposition from other parties. He could also be elected without the support of the FPM and by being supported by the LF. This would be a better choice because the international community will support such a choice, but this is hard to achieve,\" he said.\n\n\"Possible scenarios for the presidential election also include President Aoun remaining in office if a government is not formed before the end of his term\"\n\nHowever, Hezbollah is the party that still has the upper hand in the Presidential election.\n\nEven though in May's elections it obtained fewer seats than in previous general elections, it still retains most of the parliamentary seats with its ally, the Amal Movement. The Iran-backed Shia party said it is open to a consensus president and seems to be playing for time in officially endorsing any candidate.\n\nMichael Young, a senior editor at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Centre, told The New Arab that both Hezbollah and Amal are waiting for a candidate that can bring consensus.\n\n\"They are avoiding endorsing someone because they want to find a candidate upon whom everyone can agree,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) 's leader Walid Jumblatt met in August with Hezbollah officials to discuss several domestic issues, signalling a possible political rapprochement between the two parties that could have an impact on the presidential election.\n\nSalamey explained that Jumblatt is playing matchmaker, trying to forge an alliance between the LF and Hezbollah and Amal's political bloc.\n\n\"Despite the rhetoric, both opponents have been working together in previous governments and are in the same parliament today, working together in parliamentary committees,\" he said.\n\nNader said that Jumblatt could be the kingmaker in consultations to nominate a presidential candidate as his party can vote for both anti- or pro-Iranian candidates, while other political camps are vertically divided.\n\nYoung highlighted that although Frangieh considers himself a compromising candidate, not every party shares the same view.\n\n\"Both the FPM and LF don't consider him a consensus candidate. However, their position could be tactical because what they want to do is grasp if they can influence him to impose their conditions on him. For instance, Bassil may ask him to name a new commander of the Army, a new governor of the central bank, and obtain control over certain ministries,\" he said.\n\nA man holding a photo of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah at the Hezbollah Political Party Rally on 13 May 2022 ahead of the parliamentary elections. [Getty]\n\nIn August, Ziad Hayek, former secretary general of the High Council for Privatisation and Partnerships (HCPP) and current resident of the World Association of PP Units and Professionals, and Tracy Chamoun, Lebanon's former Ambassador to Jordan and granddaughter of former President Camille Chamoun, officially presented their presidential candidacy.\n\nAccording to Young, other personalities, such as Neemat Frem, a politician and businessman, Jihad Azour, the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund, and General Joseph Aoun, commander of the Lebanese Army, may emerge as consensus candidates, although they don't have a political base inside the parliament.\n\n\"I consider General Aoun one of the most realistic options, but several conditions need to be implemented. To be elected, it would be necessary to change part of the constitution because a civil servant can be a candidate only if they have retired two years before the candidacy. However, that part of the constitution is open to more interpretations as that wasn't applied when Michel Suleiman became President in 2008,\" he said.\n\nHowever, possible scenarios for the presidential election also include President Aoun remaining in office if a government is not formed before his term ends.\n\n\"He hasn't been a national unifier and divided the nation. Everyone looks at Aoun's presidency as a big failure\"\n\nIn 2016, Lebanon experienced an extended power vacuum when the parliament took more than two years and 46 rounds to elect Aoun as president, during which time the government assumed presidential duties.\n\nNader explained that Aoun could manoeuvre the presidential election, saying that if there is no official government he will not leave office because a caretaker government cannot assume presidential duties.\n\n\"However, I don't think this is a likely scenario because international stakeholders will oppose it,\" he said, adding that there is disagreement over the constitutional interpretation on this matter.\n\n\"A caretaker government with presidential powers may not be considered legitimate by Aounist ministers, who may decide not to participate in it,\" he said.\n\nFor now, a potential candidate still needs to secure the endorsement of the FPM or the LF, which are currently trying to block each other's initiatives.\n\n\"How can you convince the two largest Christian Maronite blocs to support a third candidate, and at what condition? FPM and LF would support a third candidate if this would be committed to strengthening the political positions of those parties,\" Young said.\n\nAsked about Aoun's legacy during his presidency, Young told The New Arab it had been a disaster.\n\n\"What Aoun did in the last three years has been trying to secure the election of his son-in-law to power, but he failed. This shows he wasn't looking for a legacy but behaved like any member of the political class by putting in power someone from his family. He hasn't been a national unifier and divided the nation. Everyone looks at Aoun's presidency as a big failure,\" he said.\n\nDario Sabaghi is a freelance journalist interested in human rights.\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @DarioSabaghi",

    "Maritime gas dispute risks conflict between Lebanon and Israel": "Beirut, Lebanon – Karish is a relatively small untapped gasfield in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, but its location between Israel and Lebanon means that it could lead to a new conflict between the two neighbours.\n\nWhile Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun said on Monday that United States-brokered negotiations over the exploration of Karish had reached the “final stages”, Israel is expected to begin preliminary work on Tuesday to start extracting gas, a move that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called a “red line” on Saturday.\n\nFor its part, Israel’s Defence Minister Benny Gantz has said if Hezbollah harmed an offshore rig in Karish, “the price will be Lebanon”.\n\nThe two countries have a history of conflict, most notably when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 during the latter’s civil war, as well as the 2006 Lebanon War.\n\nMany fear that the dispute over where exactly the maritime border crosses Karish could unintentionally ignite a new fight.\n\nHowever, it appears as though the current tension may be more about appearances than actual preparations for war.\n\n“It’s pure politics, to be able to say that any deal that comes in, Hezbollah had a role in it, and they defended the rights of Lebanon,” said Laury Haytayan, MENA director of Natural Resources Governance Institute.\n\n“They want to bring back the idea that their power and weapons are used in the national interest and not in the Iranian agenda, reshaping the narrative that they protect Lebanon’s wealth,” Haytayan told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to Haytayan, the two countries also view the maritime border dispute differently; while Lebanon sees it as an energy and economic issue, Israel sees it as a security issue.\n\n“For Israel, it’s very important to deal with this to take away one element of tension and possible escalation with Hezbollah,” Haytayan said. “If Lebanon starts exploration and has its own oil and gas, Hezbollah won’t be able to threaten Israel’s platforms any more because it would be: you threaten my platform, I threaten your platform.”\n\nLine in the sea\n\nWhile both sides agree that the rich gasfields in the Eastern Mediterranean should be divided, the question is over where the line should be.\n\nIn 2020, Lebanon attempted to submit a new interpretation of the border that would have given it the northern part of Karish, which is estimated to have $1.3bn worth of gas.\n\nThat was rejected by Israel and the US, and negotiations stalled for nearly two years.\n\nThis year, Lebanon dropped the 2020 border proposal, and the two countries are expected to compromise on a border position similar to the Hof line – originally proposed in 2012 by then-mediator Frederic Hof – which gives all of Karish to Israel and most of the South Saida Prospect, or Qana field, to Lebanon.\n\nHowever, negotiations have hit a sensitive point pertaining to where, on land, the maritime border starts, which could have implications on territorial delineation and sovereignty.\n\nA senior government official close to the negotiations told Al Jazeera that Beirut has asked Israel to “clarify” what the latter has labelled “security issues” regarding the land border.\n\n“If it’s a security issue there won’t be a problem and we will reach an agreement because there will be an arrangement, [but] we cannot agree on any modification on the land or any consequence that would lead to any modification of the land [border],” the source said.\n\nAfter his last visit to Beirut on September 9, US mediator Amos Hochstein said progress was made, but that “more work needs to be done” in the coming weeks to reach an agreement.\n\nHowever, as the negotiations drag on, there is more potential for their collapse.\n\nHezbollah has threatened to attack a ship sent to Karish by Israel, and on July 2 Israel said it shot down three drones headed towards the gasfield launched by Hezbollah.\n\nMeanwhile, Energean, the company licensed by Israel to extract gas from Karish, has announced it will start imminently, with Israel under added pressure to increase its energy output after it signed a deal with the European Union to export gas for the first time, as the bloc seeks alternatives to Russian energy.\n\n“Until now the negotiations are going in the right way, it’s normal to go back and forward in negotiations,” the Lebanese official added.\n\n“There is progress, but I don’t know if the progress means we will reach an agreement.”\n\nSolution for Lebanon’s economic crisis?\n\nAt home, the Lebanese government has sold the promise of the Qana field as the light at the end of a financially-collapsing tunnel, despite experts warning that no deal can be a substitute for the urgent reforms needed to stabilise Lebanon’s economy.\n\nInternal oil production would ease the country’s deep energy crisis, which has seen residents coping with little, if any, state-run electricity. Politicians have also sold it as a leveraging tool to negotiate an International Monetary Fund loan from a stronger position.\n\nHowever, if negotiations with Israel fail, Lebanon will be left to convince the French energy company Total, which owns the contractual rights to exploit the area, to operate in a disputed area, something the company has said is not willing to do.\n\nIn addition, if oil and gas are found in Qana, it may still fall within Israel’s Exclusive Economic Zone, meaning that further negotiations would be needed.\n\nFunding would also be needed to restore decrepit power infrastructure, and the use of the Arab Gas Pipeline to export to other Arab countries.\n\nAnd, according to Diana Kaissy, an advisory board member at the Lebanese Oil and Gas Initiative, the existence of oil and gas in Qana is still uncertain.\n\n“We cannot say a field exists unless you drill and you find that reservoir,” Kaissy told Al Jazeera. “So far no drilling has happened and no reservoir was found, and so the existence of Qana is just a name given to an idea to what we might find when we drill.”",
    "Lebanese bank holdups continue as savers try to claim their cash": "It is a crime spree without precedent in Lebanon.

She fled to Istanbul before she could be arrested.\n\nLebanon’s banking association urged authorities on Thursday to holdthose engaging in “verbal and physical attacks” on banks accountable and said lenders would not be lenient.\n\nLast month, a man was detained after he held up a Beirut bank to withdraw funds to treat his sick father.

    "Sectarian Political Settlements in Lebanon": "Throughout its history, Lebanon has survived on political and social settlements and compromises. A familiar pattern has emerged: tussles, negotiations, and sporadic quarrels erupt and last for a while, followed by a compromise which produces relative stability for a short period of time until the premise upon which the settlement was achieved collapses, and chaos ensues once again. The factors influencing these settlements are usually internal ones; nevertheless, external powers and regional conflicts have also played a significant role in shaping the Lebanese state and ensuring its survival.\n\nAs Lebanon faces the worst economic crisis in its modern history, a central question that has always preoccupied the Lebanese people is coming to the forefront of the national debate: Is Lebanon at a crossroads that will lead to a radical change in the system of governance? Will the country ever be able to rid itself of the disintegrating and corrupt regime that has led the country astray for far too long? Answering these questions requires an examination of the establishment of the Lebanese state, as well as the internal and external factors that laid its foundations. Such an examination also provides clarity about the nature of the settlements the regime tends to make and the factors that might produce them.\n\nFirst, the Lebanese regime is an edifice built on a delicate sectarian balance that, if shaken, can cause conflict and dangerous polarization that may easily lead to bloodshed. A case in point is the speech delivered by Michel Aoun, Lebanese president and former military general, upon his return to the country following the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005. In this speech, Aoun attacked the corruption of the then-ruling government and announced that any reform should begin by restoring the representation of Christians in all decision-making processes and in all state institutions. His announcement immediately led to a conflict within the ruling regime, resulting in government paralysis and producing the infamous presidential vacuum that lasted from 2014 to 2016.\n\nBased on popular opinion, the entry into power of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), a Lebanese Christian political party founded by Michel Aoun, led to a change in the balance of the sectarian quota system that the state follows religiously. When Aoun demanded the restoration of the Christian share in the Lebanese state—a share that was overtaken by the political forces of the Future Movement, the Amal Movement, and the Progressive Socialist Party—it led to the outbreak of a fierce political conflict between these forces that persists today.\n\nSecond, there are several factors that determine the balance of power between the conflicting sects. These include the demographic size of a sect, its financial and military capabilities, its external alliances, and the ability of a sect’s political leadership to mobilize a united front. These dynamics affect the balance of power when a compromise or a settlement is being negotiated, and they also determine the distribution of political quotas among the sects. For example, the unity of a sect behind a single political leadership gives it the power to veto any political or economic decision. However, if the sect is divided into several poles, the approval of one of its poles for a government decision is enough to confer sectarian and national support. Similarly, if a party enjoys external financial support that enables it to improve the social and economic conditions of its community, its popularity increases as the community unites behind it. This strengthens the party’s negotiating position and allows it to impose its conditions when political settlements occur.\n\nThird, experience has shown that changes in the balance of power lead to compromises in quota distribution, as illustrated by the Taif Agreement, the Syrian presence, and the Doha Agreement. The Lebanese would not have reached the Taif Agreement had there not been a shift in the balance of power at a regional level. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait prompted influential countries like Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United States to accelerate a settlement to end the Lebanese Civil War and to focus their efforts on the war in the Gulf.\n\nThe Syrian military and political presence in Lebanon—a direct result of an agreement between Syria and the United States which saw Syria support Washington's war on Iraq, with Washington handing over the Lebanese file to Syria in return—continued until 2005 and played a pivotal role in establishing the settlement produced by the Taif Accord. When the US declared its second war on Iraq, however, a rift in the relations of the two allies culminated in the expulsion of the Syrian forces from Lebanon after the assassination of Rafik Hariri in February 2005.\n\nFurthermore, when in May 2008, Hezbollah Armed members raided Beirut and large swathes of Mount Lebanon in an attempt to dominate the decision-making of the Lebanese state, a new shift in the balance of power occurred, putting pressure on the regional parties to reach a settlement that deterred what they perceived to be “Hezbollah’s domination of the state,” especially after they failed to dismantle the resistance communications network. To avert the imminent danger of civil war and to end the crisis as soon as possible, the disputing parties were brought to the negotiation table in Qatar, and the Doha Agreement for Lebanon was reached. Thus, once more, it is clear that the desperation of a situation forces the involved parties to find an appropriate solution that allows the country to enjoy relative—albeit fragile—political stability that could last a decade or more.\n\nA review of Lebanon's political and sectarian conflicts demonstrates that no matter the severity of the crisis, tensions between various religious sects remain the greatest obstacle hampering reform efforts. For example, the sectarian conflicts that erupted between the Druze and Christians in the nineteenth century led to the establishment of a sectarian custom by which political positions, public offices, and public funding were distributed among sects according to a specific quota system. Later, when the Lebanese civil war ended, no reform process was adopted to address the sectarian causes of the war. Ironically, Lebanon’s political system institutionalized sectarianism and enshrined it in constitutional texts, allowing the ruling regimes to persevere and become more powerful through sectarian conflicts. This strange phenomenon is even more evident when Lebanon is hit by a crisis, such as the current financial one, that forces the Lebanese people to turn to their sectarian leaders for protection, including social and economic services.\n\nThe effect of this long history of sectarian complexity was reflected in the failure of the cross- sectarian demonstrations of October 2019 to exploit a historic moment in which a wide swath of Lebanese were united in their demand for reform and political change. The leaders of these demonstrations were not attentive to the fact that the sectarian issue was lurking in the darkness, waiting to ignite like embers under ashes, and that the process of extinguishing it would require great effort, organization, and a clear vision. A few days into the demonstrations, the sectarian discourse returned, and the demonstrators began to retreat into their sectarian cocoons once more. In addition, bickering political parties and civil society associations tried to exploit these demonstrations to achieve political victory over their opponents, leading to their discreditation in the public eye.\n\nAs demonstrated by the results of the first parliamentary elections since 2019, there is no doubt that the economic and financial crisis that has assailed Lebanon in recent years will have a significant impact on the Lebanese political scene. The election results have yielded major political change as traditional political parties either lost their sizable representation or were forced out of parliament entirely. However, despite the severe economic crisis and continuing political turmoil, average Lebanese voters have remained loyal to the traditional sectarian forces—the same forces they have accused of enshrining corruption and of causing the crisis!\n\nThis paradoxical behavior is the direct result of the weakness of the Lebanese state and its inability to provide even the most basic services to its citizens who were left to survive a collapsing economy, decaying infrastructure, and a financial crisis on their own. In the absence of a strong centralized government, sectarian forces rushed to fill the vacuum left by the state by providing social, financial, and health services, while also restoring and dominating the sectarian discourse they revived after the demonstrations.\n\nMichel Foucault argues that the success of political forces in subjugating the masses is rooted not in their ability to use military force or the force of law, but in what is termed “power/knowledge,” or the use of knowledge to convince people of their orientations and policies. Through this, the masses are dominated by an emotional mobilization discourse that mimics the collective consciousness of the sect and perpetuates a culture of fear of “the other” that enables politicians to pose as the saviors and protectors of the sect. Lebanese politicians usually benefit from the collective memory of their community by constantly invoking the heroism they claim to have exhibited in defending their sect during the civil war.\n\nIn conclusion, the intensification of the financial and economic crises does not mean that the sectarian Lebanese regime is dissolving or that it is on the verge of falling. Despite the demonstrations of October 2019, and the failure of the political class to develop a recovery plan in the three years since, the sectarian system remains steadfast, feeding on crises that, in turn, further entrench sectarianism. In fact, the system derives its strength and continuity from these very crises.\n\nAbbas Assi holds a PhD in International Relations from the University of Leeds in Britain, an MA in International Studies, and an MA in Political Economy from the University of Sydney in Australia.

    "Lebanon’s Grand Mufti appeals for unity in meeting with Sunni MPs ahead of presidential election": "BEIRUT: Lebanon’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdel Latif Derian warned on Saturday that Lebanon has become a failed state.\n\n“We are rapidly moving toward no state at all, and the Arabs and the world will soon start ignoring Lebanon’s existence because of political mismanagement at all levels,” he said.\n\n“We need to elect a new president and the MPs are responsible for electing him or creating a presidential vacuum.”\n\nDerian had invited Sunni MPs for a meeting at Dar Al-Fatwa to discuss possible candidates.\n\nAll but three of 27 Sunni MPs from different political currents attended the meeting, including one MP affiliated with Hezbollah, in addition to reformist and independent MPs.\n\nTwo reformist MPs, Ibrahim Mneimneh and Halima Al-Qaaqour, and independent MP Osama Saad did not attend.\n\nA source in Dar Al-Fatwa said that the meeting was aimed at uniting the Sunni bloc in parliament to allow it to have a meaningful say in the presidential elections.\n\nThe bloc also aims stop any attempts to tamper with the Taif Agreement and undermine its provisions regarding Lebanon’s constitution, the source said.\n\nThe meeting focused on efforts to preserve national unity, and respect constitutional deadlines on the election of a new president and the formation of a government capable of implementing financial, monetary and legislative reforms, including an economic recovery plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, Derian said that the survival of nations and states depends on the effectiveness of their constitutional institutions.\n\nThe president is the protector of the constitution, and the Christian president in Lebanon is a symbol of coexistence on which the Lebanese system is based, he said.\n\nArabs “recognize and appreciate the Lebanese experience” because the Lebanese president is the only Christian president in the Arab world, Derian added.\n\nHe urged MPs to encourage respect for the president’s position, and help him assume his role at home and abroad.\n\nDerian also said the new president must preserve the principles of the Taif Agreement, the constitution, coexistence, and Lebanon’s national, Arab and international legitimacy.\n\nIf these matters are neglected, Lebanon will be unable to maintain order, stability and its national entity, he added.\n\nDerian highlighted the need to put an end to made-up sectarian, divisive clashes over powers and return to the constitutional principle of separating powers but maintaining cooperation between them.\n\nHe called for the election of a president characterized by the personal and political qualities of a public businessman who would be ethically responsible for the mission with which he is tasked.\n\nThe new president must have wisdom, national responsibility and integrity, as well as the ability to be inclusive of all Lebanese, and to use his powers to help the country out of this crisis and prevent it from reaching total collapse, he said.\n\nDerian reiterated: “Either we elect a president with these qualities, or we see the regime and the state fall before our eyes.”\n\nHe also appealed for respect for the prime minister and help for the PM-designate with his mission.\n\n“This is a joint responsibility that rests with everyone. We are looking forward to forming a government as soon as possible, perhaps in the next few days,” said Derain, adding that Lebanon needed a government with full powers — and not a caretaker government — in these harsh and difficult circumstances.\n\nDerian said Lebanon can survive only if consensus is reached. There is no salvation without unity, away from tension, sectarian strife and incitement, he added.\n\nLebanon needed a president “who is not part of the problem or the cause of it.”\n\nIn a statement issued after the meeting, those present stressed the principles advocated by Dar Al-Fatwa, especially in terms of committing to the Taif Agreement, Lebanon’s Arab identity and national unity.\n\nThey also condemned the abuses that had harmed and were still harming the foundations of national reconciliation and coexistence.\n\nThe Sunni MPs stressed the need to end Lebanon’s suffering under mismanagement and rampant corruption.\n\n“Saving Lebanon requires recognizing the mistakes that were made, holding the perpetrators accountable, whoever they are, and sincerely cooperating with the different Lebanese and Arab parties and the international community to restore Lebanon’s identity and stature,” they said.\n\nThe Sunni MPs said that they will work with fellow MPs to elect a new president on the specified constitutional date.\n\nThey said that the new president “needs to abide by the constitution and be loyal to the people of Lebanon and their interests.”\n\nThe statement added that Lebanon’s enemy was and still is the Israeli army, which continued to occupy parts of the Lebanese territories.\n\nIt called for the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions that stipulate the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories and the recognition of Jerusalem as an occupied city.",

    "‘No evidence’ of navy ramming in April Lebanon boat disaster": "An investigation conducted by an Australian NGO says the boat is largely intact, but families dispute the findings.\n\nA report examining the deadly sinking of a boat carrying migrants and refugees off Lebanon in April has found that the wreck of the boat was intact, appearing to contradict claims from victims’ family members that the boat was deliberately rammed by the Lebanese navy, and placing an Australian NGO at the centre of a continuing controversy over who was to blame.\n\nApproximately 40 people are believed to have died in the incident on April 23, which occurred off the coast of Tripoli, in Lebanon’s north, where the country’s economic crisis has hit particularly hard.\n\nThe Australian NGO AusRelief, which contracted a Pisces VI submarine to attempt to retrieve the wreck and the bodies, has come under heavy criticism, with families saying that the team left Lebanon without completing their mission, and also accusing the Lebanese Armed Forces of obstructing justice for not sharing high-resolution images of the wreck with them.\n\nHowever, photos taken by the submarine, which were included in a report finalised a week after the mission ended its work on September 2, and which Al Jazeera has seen, appear to show an intact vessel, supporting the report’s findings.\n\nThe report states there was no damage to the bow, stern, port side or starboard side, but that there was some damage to the anchor bow roller so that the anchor chain splice had become dislodged.\n\n“It’s black and white to us,” the mission director of AusRelief, which has a number of Australian-Lebanese members, Tom Zreika told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The damage to the anchor line shows in my opinion, that boat was involved in a collision, but it wasn’t a bigger boat causing the damage,” he said.\n\n“My observations are that boat rammed the navy vessel [because] the [damage] is consistent … with the height of the marks on the [navy’s] SS Beirut where there are two white marks on the latter third of the boat.”\n\nThat would be consistent with the Lebanese navy’s version of events: that the boat crashed into one of three navy vessels that had gone out to attempt to turn it back.\n\nThe report also states that the bodies found – which include a woman who appears to have been attempting to break out of a window with her baby – were in danger of disintegration if the mission attempted to move them.\n\nIn response to the report, a lawyer representing some of the victims’ families, Mohamad Fadi Sablouh, told Al Jazeera that it did not contain anything new, and had the same “bad quality photos” that had been taken by the submarine and that they had been shown before.\n\n“They said they would give the families a video and we did not see any video and the photos are not in focus except the women and the baby,” Sablouh said, insisting that the submarine could take 4k resolution images, which should have been provided.\n\n“They said there was damage on the front [of the boat] but the photos didn’t focus on the front.”\n\nA source at the Lebanese Armed Forces, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the navy had not tampered with the photographs and videos taken by the AusRelief mission.\n\n“It’s not us, we didn’t take anything from AusRelief, we didn’t keep any copies for the navy of anything, any document, any picture, we just took two or three pictures from the screen of the laptop when the Pisces VI team was showing us just to say we found the boat, that’s why we took those picture, and those pictures were on the army website.”\n\nCover-up allegations\n\nSablouh had previously told Al Jazeera that the victims’ families had become even more certain the boat was hit by the Lebanese navy, causing it to sink, due to how the armed forces had handled the photos emerging from the submarine dives.\n\nThe lawyer, who has become an unofficial spokesman for the victims’ families, claims that families were restricted from attending a press conference at the end of August in Tripoli.\n\n“I felt something was being concealed and they want to close up everything … I wanted to see the photos, so they took me into the control room to view them, but most of them were not in high resolution,” Sablouh said.\n\nThe source at the Lebanese Armed Forces said that the families had not been invited in order to not “make it a [media] circus”.\n\nSablouh says he tried to push a local Tripoli politician, General Ashraf Rifi, to obtain higher-quality images and videos from the armed forces, but was told that they were still being edited together.\n\n“It’s now been 10 days and still we didn’t get the videos,” Sablouh said. “Why would the military montage the videos instead of us receiving the raw videos from the submarine?\n\n“Why are the people in question, which is the military, supervising everything that is happening in this investigation?”\n\nThe Lebanese Armed Forces has not yet replied to an official request for comment.\n\n‘Stuck in the middle’\n\n“We’re advocates for refugees, we never envisaged that we would be put in the middle of two opposing parties, and to make a determination, that wasn’t our role,” Zreika said, lamenting where the AusRelief team finds itself, and stressing that it had not taken sides.\n\n“Our role was to purely come in and locate the bodies and if we couldn’t recover them, give them a service, it wasn’t for the sake of making a legal determination on who was at fault.\n\n“The bottom line for us was to do this purely humanitarian task of giving honour and respect to the refugees,” Zreika added. “Refugees are not garbage, they’re not the refuse of a country, the Lebanese people are suffering and this is the net effect of it.”\n\nDue to the continuing investigation to determine why the boat sank, the AusRelief and Pisces VI team were required to hand over all images of the wreck and bodies – 10 of which were visible including women, children and infants – to the Lebanese Armed Forces and the attorney general immediately after arriving back to shore.\n\nAusRelief also says that its contract with the submarine owner and operator was only for seven days – which had been completed.\n\nAusRelief explained that, due to the way the boat was sitting flat on the sea bed “acting like a suction cup”, the only way to float it to the surface with airbags would be by using an unmanned robotic vehicle to dig a trench around the boat, empty the silt under the hull, and then thread the balloons through it, requiring a professional deep sea salvage team using floating sheerleg cranes, and costing an estimated $9m.\n\nThe mission has already cost $650,000.\n\nLawyer Sablouh said he had been informed the boat was stuck in the seabed “like cement”, and that a body had disintegrated when the mission attempted to retrieve it. Still, he emphasised that clear videos, proving what had been described, had not been shown.\n\n“Why isn’t there just a video of that attempt so they can clear everything, so everything becomes clear, so there’s progress in this investigation,” he asked.\n\nAusRelief said that the information gathered from survivors and authorities, prior to sending out the submarine, suggested that the boat would be broken into two pieces due to a collision, or floating stern up or bow up, meaning that the equipment and team they had contracted would have been able to lift the boat.\n\nThreats\n\nThe Australian-Lebanese team had planned to spend a further week in the country, though as the tension between the armed forces and the families increased, Zreika says he was told by navy officials that their safety could not be guaranteed. The armed forces source told Al Jazeera that the group had been threatened by three brothers from Tripoli who owned the boat, and who also had family members on board who died.\n\n“These are real and perceivable threats, what we went through are not made up and if the army is impotent to protect us, then we had to make our own decisions to protect ourselves,” Zreika explained, while stating that other AusRelief staff remained in Lebanon and were continuing the organisation’s work.\n\nSablouh said he has not heard of any threats being made to the team but confirmed that the sunken boat was owned by the three brothers – who he does not represent.\n\nThe source in the Lebanese Armed Forces claimed that the family was involved in smuggling, and may have been forcing the other families to blame the navy for ramming the boat in order to get compensation for those killed, as well as to avoid manslaughter charges themselves.\n\nSablouh denied that the family wanted compensation, saying that the military general had already offered money to the family who owned the boat, but that it had been rejected.\n\nThe lawyer said that the family in question were “just like anyone in Lebanon wanting to flee” and questioned why the navy did not intercept the boat before it left the shore, considering that intelligence services had images of when the boat was boarded and set sail.\n\n“Why did they let it reach where it did before stopping it, and why is this the only boat stopped from the many that try to do the same thing?” Sablouh said.\n\nHe further added that if the family – whose names Al Jazeera has withheld for security reasons – had issued threats, the Lebanese security forces should have organised a conference at the end of the mission to explain the findings to the families.\n\nAs for the families, Sablouh said, they believe this is just another example of the lack of justice in Lebanon for victims.\n\n“Just like the Beirut Port explosion, they’re letting the people who did what they did get away with it and bring no justice to the victims and the families,” Sablouh said. “The case should have been investigated without the military, who are seen as the perpetrator.”",

    "Hundreds of migrants originating from Lebanon dock in Italy": "The ship was made to wait 12 days at sea before being accepted at a port, as humanitarian conditions degraded.\n\nA rescue vessel carrying 398 migrants — many of whom originated from Lebanon — was allowed to dock in Italy after almost two weeks at sea, as humanitarians warned that conditions on the boat reached a breaking point.\n\n\"The situation on board is quite tense. 398 people haven't showered in days, haven't been able to wash any clothes, and water and food have been rationed. About half of the 55 children on board are sick and infectious disease has continued to spread on board,\" Petra Krischok, the press officer for SOS Humanity, told The New Arab.\n\nThe rescue vessel Humanity 1 was allowed to dock in Taranto, Italy after issuing 18 requests for a safe harbour and waiting for twelve days. Disembarking will take up to two days, with those in need of medical treatment leaving the ship first. At least one person on board needs treatment for a gunshot wound and another for internal bleeding.\n\n\n\nThe migrants came from four different rescue operations and included individuals from Egypt, Gambia, Mali and Syria.

    "Lebanon central bank stops fuel subsidies, prices set to rise": "The central bank decision means black market exchange rates have to be used, as the country’s economic crisis continues.\n\nLebanon’s central bank says it has stopped providing dollars for gasoline imports, a move that will likely lead to higher and more volatile prices as well as increased pressure on the local currency, which continues to lose value as the country’s economic crisis shows few signs of abating.\n\nThe central bank said last year that it would stop providing dollars at heavily subsidised exchange rates due to a dwindling supply of foreign currency reserves, but it continued to do so at a sub-market rate on its Sayrafa exchange platform.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, the number of dollars provided via Sayrafa has been gradually reduced as part of a wider plan to end subsidies for most goods amid a financial collapse that has entered its fourth year.\n\nReuters reported that a central bank spokesperson said on Monday that importers would now have to source dollars from the black market, where the Lebanese pound is trading at approximately 35,000 pounds to the dollar. The Sayrafa rate last week was about 28,000 pounds.\n\n“If there is more volatility in the exchange rate there will be more volatility in the fuel price,” Maroun Chammas, a member of the Association of Petroleum Importing Companies, said.\n\nThe price for 20 litres of gasoline jumped by 20,000 pounds on Monday, a significant increase compared with regular daily fluctuations of a few thousand pounds in the weeks prior.\n\nBlack market prices\n\nGas Station Owners’ Syndicate spokesperson George Brax said gas station owners would now price fuel at the country’s “parallel market rate” – also known as the black market rate.\n\nChammas said importers had so far been able to source all the dollars they needed from the black market and that gasoline pumps would continue to accept payment in Lebanese pounds at the daily black market rate.\n\nLebanon’s crippling economic crisis has plunged three-quarters of its population into poverty and decimated the value of the Lebanese pound against the dollar by about 90 percent.

    "Lebanon: Transfer investigation into death in custody of Syrian refugee to the civilian justice system": "The heart-wrenching death in custody this week of Bashar Abdel-Saud, a Syrian refugee who was tortured, must serve as a wake-up call to the Lebanese authorities to address torture in their detention facilities, said Amnesty International today.\n\nLebanese judicial officials have announced an investigation by the military prosecution, however Amnesty International is calling for the investigation and trial to take place before the civilian justice system.\n\n“Bashar Abdel-Saud cruelly died while in the custody of Lebanon’s State Security agency – the images of his bruised, gashed body offer a distressing reminder of the need to urgently implement the 2017 anti-torture law. It is unacceptable for torture to be continuing to occur in Lebanese detention centres and with such brutality – the authorities must put a stop to it immediately,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n“While it is a positive measure that a group of security personnel have been remanded in custody for questioning, under human rights law standards, military courts should restrict their jurisdiction to that of military offences by military personnel. To ensure transparency and impartiality, Abdel-Saud’s case must urgently be referred to a civilian court. His family deserves justice and reparations for their tragic loss.”\n\nSecurity officers arrested Abdel-Saud from his home in Beirut on 30 August, without presenting an arrest warrant. According to Mohammed Sablouh, the lawyer assigned to Abdel-Saud’s case, the family received a call from a State Security official four days later on 3 September, asking them to collect his dead body from their headquarters in Tebneen, Southern Lebanon. Sablouh and the family refuse to collect the body before they receive an independent and comprehensive forensic report from the doctor who has examined the body.\n\n…the images of his [Bashar Abdel-Saud] bruised, gashed body offer a distressing reminder of the need to urgently implement the 2017 anti-torture law. Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\n\nFollowing the uproar caused by leaked pictures and videos revealing bruises and gashes covering Abdel-Saud’s body article, State Security issued a statement saying that he had been arrested for possession of a fake 50$ bill and that he had “confessed” to being a member of ISIS before he died. They also said that the case would be investigated internally.\n\nOn 2 September, the government commissioner of the Military Court examined the body and ordered the detention of five officers in the State Security branch in Tibneen, including the Lieutenant in charge and the officers suspected of committing torture.\n\nMohammed Sablouh told Amnesty International that the authorities had thus far accused Abdel-Saud of three things: “they said he had fake currency, they said he used and dealt with Captagon, and they said he was a member of ISIS. All these are lies. We need a transparent investigation in the civilian court to know what has happened and who is to be held accountable.”\n\nBashar Abdel-Saud was 30 years old when he died and had three children, including a one-month old child. He had defected from the Syrian army eight years ago and moved to Lebanon to work as a porter. He lived with his family in the Sabra and Shatila camp for Palestinian refugees in Beirut.\n\nHis experience of torture was not an isolated one. In March 2021, Amnesty International released a report documenting an array of violations against 26 Syrian refugees, including four children, held on terrorism-related charges between 2014 and early 2021. Among the violations were unfair trial and torture, which included beatings with metal sticks, electric cables and plastic pipes. Authorities failed to investigate the torture claims, even when detainees or their lawyers told a judge in court that they had been tortured.\n\nAbdel-Saud’s case echoes that of Ziad Itani, a Lebanese actor who was arrested by the State Security agency in December 2017 on trumped-up charges of spying for Israel before being tried before a military court. Itani said State Security officers subjected him to severe torture, including beating him with electric cables, tying him up in metal chains, kicking and punching him in the face, and threatening to rape him. He filed a complaint against them in November 2018 but no further steps have been taken to effectively investigate his torture.\n\n“During Lebanon’s last review by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021, the Lebanese government committed to implement the anti-torture law, investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, hold the perpetrators accountable, and nullify confessions under torture. Yet impunity for torture remains commonplace, with dozens of complaints regarding torture and other ill-treatment filed under the 2017 Anti-Torture Law rarely reaching court and most closed without an effective investigation. It is time for this to stop.” Said Heba Morayef.\n\nBackground\n\nLebanon ratified the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and its Optional Protocol in 2000 and 2008 respectively. In compliance with its obligations under the CAT, Lebanon passed an anti-torture law in 2017, which makes torture a criminal offence.\n\nUnder international human rights law, military personnel should be tried before military courts only for breaches of military discipline. Under the Lebanese anti-torture law, the power to prosecute, investigate and try is granted exclusively to ordinary civilian courts. Also, the prohibition of torture applies regardless of the nature of the alleged crime.\n\n**Correction** Security officers arrested Abdel-Saud from his home in Beirut on 30 August, not 31 August.",

    "In Lebanon, drinking water has become a luxury that few can afford": "An unlicensed water distributor working for a private company operates in the neighbourhood of Sin el Fil in Beirut. Lebanon the third most threatened nation in the world by drinking water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute.\n\nTeressa Walid is a mother of three who works as a nurse in the epidemiology department of Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Lebanon’s largest public hospital, located on the outskirts of Beirut. Like most Lebanese, she is struggling to survive in the midst of the worst financial crisis in the country’s history, which has seen a substantial deterioration in living conditions. Electricity, clean water, medicine and fuel are in short supply, the Lebanese currency has lost 90 per cent of its value and inflation has soared to triple digits. As a result, more than 80 per cent of the country’s population now find themselves living below the poverty line.\n\n“We shouldn’t have to pay to drink water, but our government has forced us into this situation. Bottled water is considered an essential commodity in Lebanon. There’s no alternative for drinking water,” says Walid, as she waits in line at a water treatment and distribution facility to fill her containers with the life-sustaining liquid.\n\nWalid has an afternoon shift at the hospital and her husband “works all day” to pay for the expenses, so she takes her car to collect the water containers. She could also have the company deliver them to her home but the bill would be 25 per cent more to cover the cost of petrol, so she prefers to pick them up herself and save money that will help her cover other basic needs.\n\nWalid’s family lives in the Choueifat neighbourhood in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where there has been no running water for weeks. Water cuts are common in the summer, she explains, but they have never been “this long and continuous”. According to a UNICEF report, amid frequent power outages, per capita water supplies have decreased dramatically since the beginning of the crisis, falling short of the 35 litres a day considered to be the minimum acceptable quantity.\n\nAs a nurse, Walid is particularly concerned by the lack of health controls for tap water: “It’s no good for taking a shower or washing food. It comes out dirty, smells bad and is causing our children to contract diseases. We don’t have any of our basic rights. The state should at least provide us with clean drinking water so we can live,” she says.\n\nHalf a salary, just for water\n\nWith this basic public service lacking, many Lebanese households have been forced to rely on private companies and water tankers for access to running water. The same is true for electricity: due to power cuts in the public grid, inhabitants have to rely on expensive private generators to provide at least 12 hours of electricity per day to their homes.\n\nIn addition to the financial instability shaking the country, Lebanon’s public institutions lack the liquidity to import fuel - on which almost all of the country’s electricity production depends, and which they purchase in dollars. This has led state-owned utility provider Électricité Du Liban, which controls 90 per cent of the country’s electricity production, transmission and distribution, to cut electricity supply to three hours a day.\n\nThis in turn affects drinking water supply networks, as electricity is needed for pumping water and operating water treatment plants. While the lack of fuel is one of the main factors accelerating the drinking water crisis, Hicham Richani, former president of the water companies’ union, explains that the root of the problem lies in “government mafias that wanted to monopolise water”.\n\nLebanon is a country with abundant water resources. It has snow-capped mountains that feed 16 perennial rivers – which flow uninterrupted all year round – with a combined annual river flow of between 2,151 and 3,900 million cubic metres.\n\nBut despite these natural resources, years of dysfunctional administrations and poor policies on the use and maintenance of water reserves had by 2019 made Lebanon the third most threatened nation in the world by drinking water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington-based NGO.\n\n“The Lebanese government chose to privatise the water by licensing several dozen bottling companies, the majority of which are operated by multinationals Nestlé and Pepsi, rather than invest in water infrastructure,” says Richani. Since Lebanese have no other choice but to buy drinking water, the current crisis has seen the emergence of a parallel market, with hundreds of local companies operating illegally and offering much cheaper but poorer quality water.\n\nA 2016 study by Blominvest Bank shows that the bottled water business in Lebanon has been a growing market for years. The licensed bottling companies alone account for an annual production of between 700 and 800 million litres of water. If illegal companies were counted, the figure would be much higher. The annual profit from this business is around US$300 million, and continues to grow with each year.\n\n“Since 2012, we’ve been fighting for more licences to be issued and for more competition in the market, but licensing has remained a personal dispute between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Industry, which has yet to be resolved,” explains Richani. The veteran trade unionist sums up the drinking water crisis in two words: “Simply inaccessible”.\n\nSpiralling inflation in the country has caused the price of bottled water to rise dramatically, with Lebanese consumers paying three to five times more than they did a year ago. According to UNICEF’s calculations, a family of five drinking about two litres of bottled water per person per day would need to spend 6.5 million Lebanese pounds (US$4,300) a year on water.\n\nIn other words, given that the average Lebanese salary now ranges from 900,000 to one million Lebanese pounds (between US$600 and US$660), a family in this situation would need to spend just over half their salary on drinking water.\n\nAs a result, many families who can no longer afford to pay nearly US$5 for a 12-litre container of water from licensed companies are now buying their bottled water from unlicensed sellers for US$1 or US$2, even when it means putting the health of their loved ones at risk.\n\nAccording to its most recent report on the water crisis in Lebanon: “One year ago, UNICEF warned that the water system was at breaking point. While a total collapse of public water supply networks has so far been averted, the crisis has not been resolved and millions of people are affected by the limited availability of clean and safe water.”\n\nMigration, the climate crisis and untreated wastewater\n\nIn addition to the collateral damage caused by the energy crisis and mismanagement of water supplies, other factors have contributed to water stress. Lebanon, it should be recalled, has been host to nearly 1.5 million Syrian refugees for more than a decade. As the refugee population has increased, so have water demand and consumption. However, while their arrival in the country coincided with a 20 per cent increase in domestic water consumption, the refugee population has only increased national water stress (an indicator that measures the need when demand for this essential commodity exceeds the available quantity) by 6 per cent.\n\nOther factors such as climate change and drought have also contributed to water scarcity. According to a study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), renewable water resources available in Lebanon have fallen below the water stress threshold of 1,000 cubic metres per capita per year. In fact, according to data from 2017, water availability then was already at around 704 cubic metres per capita per year, leaving Lebanon facing significant challenges in securing potable supplies.\n\nIn addition, due to the lack of wastewater monitoring, tons of rubbish and industrial waste are dumped into the sea and the country’s rivers in certain areas, polluting the available resources. One of the most dramatic examples is the Litani River in the Beqaa region, Lebanon longest river and an essential source of its socio-economic development since the construction of the Qaraoun dam in 1959.\n\nToday, however, “the levels of contamination are so high that the dammed water is not suitable for cultivation,” says Yousef Antoun, director of the Litani River Authority, a public institution that acts autonomously to implement irrigation, drinking water supply and electricity generation projects. Each year, the upper Litani basin receives about 45.5 million cubic metres of domestic wastewater and another 3.7 million cubic metres of industrial wastewater, which is discharged into the river without any treatment.\n\nAntoun warns that “better planning for the responsible use of water resources is urgently needed, as high levels of water pollution have put biodiversity, agricultural production and the health of the Lebanese population at risk”.\n\nDespite an ambitious US$800 million plan announced by the government in 2016 to clean up the Litani River and Lake Qaraoun, financed in part by loans from the World Bank and other donors such as USAID and the UN, there has been “very little progress in implementing these projects,” Antoun says.\n\n“If factory inspections aren’t being carried out there is little we can do,” complains Azhara Yousef, a laboratory technician at a treatment plant on the banks of the Litani. “The water from the river is very polluted. We lower the toxicity level here by 1,000 points, but if we don’t stop the waste discharges, it simply gets polluted again,” she says.\n\nWhile short-term solutions to the crisis remain elusive, its socio-economic consequences are catastrophic. For many of the families across the country who live below the poverty line, receiving their water ration has become a daily battle.",

    "Why Lebanon's capital controls law is causing unrest": "In-depth: Hoping to unlock an IMF recovery package, Lebanon's controversial capital controls draft law has sparked widespread protests for protecting banks at the expense of depositors and pushing people further into poverty.\n\nOn 30 August, a joint parliamentary committee in Lebanon postponed discussions over a controversial capital controls law that would limit the flow of foreign capital in and out of the country.\n\nThe proposed law is the latest of several versions passed by the parliament over the last year, but the body has now suspended its discussions until the government settles on a fully-fledged reform plan.\n\nIt aims to legalise and standardise banking restrictions put in place at the beginning of the economic crisis in 2019. A capital controls law is also one of the prerequisites to unlock the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recovery package to assist cash-strapped Lebanon financially.\n\nHowever, the latest draft of the law is widely considered the least desirable version as it could worsen the economic conditions of Lebanese depositors. Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the parliament building during the discussions on the draft capital control law, calling for fair legislation.\n\n\"'The most dangerous part [of the draft law] is that it legalises the robbery of the people by the banks and doesn't protect depositors that lost their money'\"\n\nSince late 2019, Lebanon's commercial banks have imposed their own capital controls by setting withdrawal and transfer limits. As a result, depositors can only withdraw their US dollars in the local currency at an inflated rate, losing money to the bank due to the devaluation of the Lebanese pound.\n\nSince then, a multidimensional financial and economic crisis has erupted across the country, trapping over 80% of the Lebanese population under the poverty line.\n\nProtesters who gathered in front of the Parliament to protest against the proposed law in late August argued that it is too late now, given the economic situation. They also added that the draft would favour commercial banks at the expense of depositors.\n\nKarim Asfahani, a history teacher present at the demonstration, told The New Arab that his father had lost all of the money he had saved in the bank after working for 40 years.\n\n\"It is too late for a capital controls law now, and the most dangerous part is that it legalises the robbery of the people by the banks and doesn't protect depositors that lost their money,\" he said.\n\nThe fight for a fair capital controls law has affected more than just bank depositors.\n\nYasmina Ballout, a lawyer attending the demonstration, explained that even if the current draft of the law doesn't affect her personally as she does not have a bank account, she opposed it because it breaks the law and will limit people’s ability to get back the money they lost.\n\n\"I am paid in cash at the parallel market rate, which opens the risk for money laundering,\" she said.\n\nCriticisms of the draft law also raise concerns about how the law would be implemented and who would be tasked with overseeing it.\n\nLebanese people protesting against dire economic conditions, political corruption, Central Bank officials, and depreciation in the value of the Lebanese pound against the dollar in Beirut, Lebanon on 2 July 2020. [Getty]\n\nDina Abou Zour, a lawyer and member of Lebanon's Depositors Union, explained to The New Arab that the draft would give power to a committee that has to be established, made up of the Minister of Finance, the governor of the central Banque du Liban (BDL), and two experts appointed by the prime minister.\n\nHowever, the minister of finance is widely seen to have failed to fulfil his duties over the past three years, while BDL's governor Riad Salameh has been sued both in Lebanon and Europe. The experts appointed by the government, meanwhile, may hamper a fair implementation of the law.\n\n\"We refuse such a draft law. It should be drafted and modified by the Parliament. Such power in the hands of the committee has implications on how to implement the law,\" Abou Zour said.\n\nOne reason the draft law is seen as unfair is because it differentiates between deposits in bank accounts opened before 17 October 2019 and new foreign currency deposits in bank accounts opened after the start of the economic collapse, also known as \"fresh money deposits”.\n\n\"People also argue that the draft law won't benefit people if it is issued without a comprehensive reform package, which should include a banking resolution law, unification of the exchange rate, and budget law\"\n\nAccording to Abou Zour, such a differentiation is not legal as depositors should be treated equally, and it would give the committee the power to increase or decrease the withdrawal amount.\n\nFurthermore, the exchange rate included in the draft bill is pegged on the Sayrafa exchange platform established by the BDL and considered by many as illegal as only the Parliament should have the power to set a new exchange rate and force banks and individuals to abide.\n\nAnother aspect of the draft law widely criticised is the de-facto \"amnesty\" granted to commercial banks. Several private depositors have recently filed lawsuits against Lebanese commercial banks to gain access to money locked in their deposits. But the draft law would block the prosecution of any pending cases against commercial banks, and the chances of accessing money would vanish.\n\n\"This move would remove power from the judiciary and give it to the committee and BDL, the only entities able to file lawsuits against those commercial banks that don't abide by the capital controls law,\" Abou Zour said.\n\nRELATED Lebanon and the IMF: Entrenching the ruling elite Analysis\n\nThe Lebanese public also argue that the draft law won't benefit people if it is issued without a comprehensive reform package, which should include a banking resolution law, unification of the exchange rate, and budget law.\n\nNajat Aoun Saliba, one of the 13 independent MPs elected in the 2022 elections, told The New Arab that the capital controls law is protecting the banks at the expense of the depositors, who have already lost money.\n\n\"The draft law has to be revised because the committee has too much power, and it needs to be coupled with the banking secrecy law. We really need to know the numbers that we are talking about. We have to know the budget of BDL before we think about a capital control law,\" she said.\n\nThe banking secrecy law is another piece of the intricate mosaic of efforts to revive the country's economy, as it is one of the preconditions issued by the IMF to unlock the $3 billion financial assistance package.\n\nThe law would allow certain authorised entities to trace the operations and transactions of banks and financial institutions to track the country's flow of money. While the draft law was passed by the parliament in July, the IMF stated that it did not meet the required international standards. Lebanon's President Michel Aoun sent the draft back to parliament in late August to modify the text.\n\nCommercial capital controls on withdrawing money from deposits have forced many to turn to the black market, where the Lebanese pound trades at around 35,000 pounds to the dollar. [Getty]\n\nAbou Zour believes that politicians are deliberately trying to issue laws that will meet the minimum standards of the IMF while protecting themselves.\n\n\"We need to know the numbers, the excel sheets of the commercial banks and the BDL. We cannot make a capital controls law without knowing this information,\" she said.\n\nA lack of regulations on capital controls since 2019 created a situation in which commercial banks ruled over the lives of many Lebanese citizens amid the government's inaction. This led to multiple exchange rates, inequality among Lebanese, and skyrocketing prices due to the rampant inflation that surged to 211% in May of this year.\n\nProtesting in front of parliament, Hanin Haidar explained that she withdrew all her money from the bank when the exchange rate was between 5,000 and 6,000 Lebanese pounds.\n\n\"A lack of regulations on capital controls since 2019 created a situation in which commercial banks ruled over the lives of many Lebanese citizens amid the government's inaction\"\n\n\"Now that the exchange rate in the parallel market is over 30,000 Lebanese pounds per US dollar, I have to look for jobs paid in US dollars and not use banks. In fact, I have two jobs now paid in both US dollars and Lebanese pounds,\" she said.\n\nAnother protestor, Marwan Rai, told The New Arab that the draft law on capital controls would affect small depositors, while it is unlikely to impact big depositors and bankers.\n\n\"This draft law doesn't respect our money. I am paid at the rate of 8,000 Lebanese pounds per US dollar. I work to be able to eat,\" he said.\n\nDario Sabaghi is a freelance journalist interested in human rights.\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @DarioSabaghi",
    "Hezbollah or the Bank: Who Will Rule Lebanon?": "Two figures are competing for the title of “the actual ruler of Lebanon.” One is Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, and the other is Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon’s central bank. The first has his own private army, an ethnic bloc of supporters, political partners in the government, protection and funding from Iran and the backing of Syria. The latter is “just” a central banker. Without any militias, weapons or a political base to rely on.\n\nSo where does Salameh, who has served continuously in his post since 1993, draw his power from? If Nasrallah is seen as the person who controls Lebanese politics, dictates the country’s internal and foreign policy, decides whether and when Lebanon will go to war – then Salameh controls the Lebanese economy. He decides what the dollar exchange rate will be, he builds – or more precisely, empties – the country’s foreign reserves, critically influences the state budget, and most of all, he knows very well the financial secrets of Lebanon’s political elite. He has in his hands the key to their downfall if he decides to expose their secrets. In the competition over the title of the most hated person in Lebanon, Salameh is the winner by far.\n\nSalameh, 72, worked for two decades at Merrill Lynch before being appointed governor of the central bank. He is seen as being responsible for the deep economic crisis in Lebanon, for the horrible poverty, the destruction of the health and education services, the loss of control over the value of the Lebanese pound and depth of the corruption – of which he is one of its primary creators.\n\nOpen gallery view Salameh in Beirut, last year. Credit: MOHAMED AZAKIR/רויטרס\n\nLast year, it seemed that this all powerful man was about to lose everything. The law enforcement authorities in Germany, France, Lichtenstein, Monaco – and Lebanon itself, opened an intensive investigation of Salameh on suspicions of money laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars, embezzling state funds and obtaining wealth illegally.\n\nLast week, the Lebanese media outlet Daraj posted the document the Principality of Lichtenstein submitted to Lebanese legal authorities in which it requested to receive information on money transfers from Salameh’s accounts to accounts belonging to Taha Mikati, the brother of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, in banks in Lichtenstein.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Switzerland are also investigating suspicions of embezzlement of about $330 million, which was paid by the central bank in Lebanon to Salameh’s brother Raja, the owner of a company named Forry Associates registered in the Virgin Islands, as fees for signing up investors for the purchase of Eurobonds. It is suspected that $258 million of this sum was moved to Raja’s accounts in Switzerland, and then $207 million of this money was transferred to five accounts in his name in Lebanon.\n\nProsecutors in France are conducting a separate investigation against Salameh for money laundering through the purchase of luxury properties in Paris, which his brother is involved in too. At the same time, authorities in Switzerland and other countries have frozen about $120 million of assets belonging to Salameh.\n\nRaja Salameh was arrested in in March in Lebanon and was released after a month on a record bail of 100 billion Lebanese pounds, or around $3.7 million at the market exchange rate. A month earlier, his brother the governor was summoned for questioning on his involvement in the affair - but he refused to appear three times. In June, the police raided his home and arrested him, but did not ring Salameh. When the security forces asked to conduct a search in the offices of the central bank, bank employees locked the doors and did not let enter the building – declaring a strike “in light of the actions of the security forces and prosecutors and the disrespect for the bank and its employees.”\n\nAt least for now, Salameh continues to run the bank and his legal defense at the same time, while Lebanon is hoping to obtain a loan from the International Monetary Fund of between $3 billion to $10 billion. But a central condition for approval of the loan is carrying out an in-depth investigation of the central bank’s actions and implementing economic and structural reforms of the Lebanese economy. The Lebanese government has twice invited outside investigations firms to examine the central bank’s operations – and twice these firms have withdrawn from the task because of a lack of cooperation on the part of the central bank and its governor. Lebanese President Michel Aoun may have asked the law enforcement authorities to do their jobs and arrest and bring Salameh to justice, but Aoun also knows that if Salameh were to fall, the information he might very well reveal could damage Aoun too.\n\nPresident Mikati has his own good reasons to prevent such an investigation and a trial for Salameh. Mikati is a billionaire, who along with his brother Taha owns the M1 Group holding company – and their net worth is estimated at more than $5.1 billion. Mikati made his money on large construction projects he developed in Abu Dhabi in the late 1970s, and along with his brother they founded one of the largest construction companies in the Middle East. In 1982, the brothers founded their flagship firm Investcom, which invested in Middle Eastern countries, South Africa and West Africa. When Bashar al-Assad came to power in Syria in 2000, he granted Mikati the right to operate his telephone company in Syria for 15 years in reutrn for a share of the profits. In 2006, this company was sold to the MTN Group, the largest cellular company in South Africa, for $5.5 billion and 10 percent of MTN’s profits.\n\nThe suspicions now are that Mikati’s brother, and maybe even the president himself, are connected to Salameh’s money laundering network. This week, Mikati completely denied all the suspicions and any link between Salameh’s businesses and himself. In contrast, in Lebanon people are convinced that Mikati could not have made such a great fortune without the help of Salameh’s services. It is also worth mentioning that Salameh was at one time the economic adviser of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, who was murdered in 2005 and who is the one that appointed Salameh to the position of central bank governor in 1993. Salameh’s friendship with the Hariri family did not end even after the suspicions against him came to light.\n\nThis fabric of corrupt connections explains at least some of the enormous difficulties in firing Salameh, and also in forming a stable government that can carry out major reforms that could put Lebanon back on the path to economic rehabilitation. Added to these difficulties now is the date of end of Aoun’s term, which falls on October 31 – without any candidate for replacing him anywhere in sight. Aoun may have already announced that he has begun sending his personal effects home from the presidential palace, but in the same breath he stated that the present government, even if the constitution authorizes it, is not entitled to carry out the president’s responsibilities if a replacement is not found for him by then and if a permanent new government is not yet established. Aoun will use every trick possible to remain in office – at last until a new and agreed upon government is formed – in other words, a government in which he can dictate at least a third of the appointments, which will not only guarantee that his legacy continues, but most important the appointment of his son-in-law, Gebran Bassil, as a senior cabinet minister.\n\nAoun, 88, has another important matter to finish before he retires. He hopes to “grant” Lebanon the maritime border agreement with Israel, and in doing so go down in history as the person who rescued the country from its economic crisis. An agreed upon draft version of the deal may not yet exist, and in Lebanon they are waiting for Israeli answers that the U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein is expected to bring with him to Lebanon this weekend following his visit to Israel. The deputy speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Elias Bou Saab, made it clear on Tuesday that it seems things are moving in a positive direction, but warned against excessive optimism.\n\nAt the same time, a senior source in Lebanon told the Naharnet news website that he expected that if the Lebanese government adopts the responses Hochstein brings from Israel, Hezbollah will not act to oppose the agreement and will not try to block it – especially after the Greek oil and gas exploration company Energean, which operates the gas drilling platform of the Karish offshore natural gas field, announced that for now it was stopping its drilling efforts – at least until the middle or end of September.\n\nOpen gallery view Lebanese President Michel Aoun, last year. Credit: DALATI NOHRA/רויטרס\n\nAoun has tossed another hazy card on the table by announcing that the French oil company TotalEnergies, which signed an agreement with the government of Lebanon to drill a well in its waters, could help find a solution to the dispute. Aoun did not explain what TotalEnergies’ role could be in the mediation, but it seems he means a financial arrangement with Israel were the company to discover natural gas in the disputed maritime region. If this really is what Aoun meant, then it is possible to conclude that drawing the maritime border has reached its final stage and all that is left to do is reach a deal on dividing profits.\n\nOpen gallery view Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Hezbollah, last year. Credit: AL-MANAR TV / AFP\n\nWhat is still not clear is whether Hezbollah will agree to fulfill Aoun’s wish and allow the Lebanese government to sign the agreement. The answer to this question depends on the concessions Hezbollah can obtain from Aoun over the formation of the new government. Nasrallah wants to preserve his veto power over cabinet decisions, and to do so he needs for at least a third of the cabinet members to be his supporters – as the constitution requires two-thirds plus one majority of the cabinet to approve key decisions such as the budget, declaring war or economic reforms. This is where Hezbollah’s political power lies, and it has systematically succeeded in holding on to the required number of cabinet ministers to approve – or block – cabinet decisions.\n\nBut, this power depends on the identity of the ministers the president appoints on his behalf. In other words, if Aoun aspires to reach an agreement on the maritime borders with Israel, start the flow of natural gas to Lebanon and receive loans from international financial institutions – then he must move quickly to approve the list of cabinet ministers that will grant Hezbollah political power. Aoun, who already has a list of candidates siting on his desk that Prime Minister Mikati has submitted to him, will now have to decide whether to expedite the process of forming the new government – in an attempt to save Lebanon – or whether to drag his feet so he can continue on in office even after the legal end of his term so he can force the parliament to appoint a successor according to his own wishes, even if this means further delay in signing the maritime border agreement with Israel.",

In the relative immediacy of the blast two years ago, it sounds hollow and without conviction.\n\nI can’t get the moment that it happened out of my mind: the clocks stopped at 6:08 pm. There was a massive explosion, which killed at least 218 people. The loud blast resounds in my bones and in my ears, even now. When I think about it, I relive all of the shock, the disbelief, the grief.\n\nI remember what I thought in the aftermath: “It's one more disaster. This country is cursed – both cursed and loved.”\n\nIt’s easy to think of Lebanon as “cursed”. Recent crises – economic, moral, political and social – are the bane of Lebanese people’s existence. What about our love for the country, too? Is that just a tragic fantasy? Wishful thinking?\n\nIn 2020, it was easy to feel Lebanon had hit rock bottom – all we could hope for was that the disaster would generate much-needed lasting change and reform. Yet, two years on, nothing has been done to change the status quo; in fact, the ruling elite have made it worse – much worse. And nobody is listening.\n\nWe are in the middle of economic meltdown, with a bankrupt state and the collapse of our currency. We have a ruined health system, an energy crisis, our industry has disappeared, people are struggling for money and our poor are starving. Nearly 80 per cent of Lebanese citizens now live below the poverty line.\n\nSince the Civil War, successive governments in Lebanon have implemented financial engineering policies that have led to a very real dystopia: the fiction of the Lebanese “economic miracle”.\n\nThe coffers of the nation – Lebanon was once known as the “Switzerland of the Middle East” – are empty; the dark underbelly of its banking system (offering illusory interest rates) has been exposed. The former vault of Middle Eastern banking is nothing but a piggy bank with a padlock for anyone who failed to stash their cash under their mattress in time.\n\nWith depositors and bankers engaged in a surreal, unethical and merciless free-for-all, we are being left to sink into collapse. It feels as though the ruling political clans have rejected and abandoned their people, abused their patience and goodwill, disavowed their trust, and enraged the younger generations – who are now marching through the streets in protest. They have also succeeded in killing hope.\n\nTo my mind, Lebanon’s politics is at the core of its malaise. The convoluted electoral laws preserve the politicians’ stranglehold over the people. Those in charge spend hours scrutinising and arguing about pointless tortuous details, while the structure, in effect, determines the outcome – regardless of the people’s preferences.\n\nWhat’s worse is that we seem to widely accept, without any evidence, excuses about the interplay of “external forces” being to blame for the state the country is in. Lebanon is dominated by political elites with multiform loyalties. It is difficult to faithfully argue that any member of the political elite has the best interests of Lebanon in mind.\n\nYet at every election, we vote for people of the same loose alliance. Lebanon is a pluralistic society. It’s not easy to design an electoral law that addresses the fraught sectarian issues of this country. It involves a tough balancing act: 18 religious sects are recognised in the constitution. But how can we pretend it’s democratic when it’s not one man, one vote; but one vote for a list that does not remotely represent the voter?\n\nPolitically and geologically, Lebanon is a country controlled by structural fault lines. We ignore them at our own risk. We are also on the brink of social catastrophe: Lebanon is no longer a country for young people. The educational system – once the pride of the Middle East, if not the world – has been gutted. It is collapsing right before our eyes.\n\nTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here\n\nLebanon is, in effect, becoming a retirement home without a future. Is it any wonder that young people from all over the country – from all regions and all religions – are revolting against corruption?\n\nIn the aftermath of the devastating port explosion, swathes of one of the world’s most beautiful cities now look like scenes from an apocalypse. As Tuéni wrote during the Lebanese civil war: “Those who live in the sunlight of the word, upon the runaway horse of slogans, those, shatter the windows of the universe.”\n\nHer words still apply today, echoed in Beirut's shattered port, hospitals, shops, restaurants, houses, windows – and the lives of its long-suffering population.\n\nDr Sam Mattar is based in Lebanon and runs an independent consultancy to promote the use of system dynamics in understanding projects",
    "How Lebanon deals with blackouts, from battery packs for the Wifi to buying food day by day": "Sat in a café in central Beirut, myself and a handful of others are crouched over laptops, tip-tapping away, as the blue light from our screens glows on our warmed sticky faces. A typical summer week day in a city, perhaps even London, considering recent sweltering temperatures.\n\nYet there is one distinction. For the past 45 minutes we have all been sitting in the dark, and for the next 45 minutes we will sit in the dark until the café ’s private generator kicks in. For the rest of the day there will be six more hours of power, split by a two-hour break to avoid overheating the generator.\n\nThese scheduled blackouts are now a typical routine in Lebanon, where residents have been suffering from severe power cuts, a ramification of a deep and multifaceted economic crisis which took hold at the end of 2019.\n\nYet Lebanon is no longer alone in its power problems. The UK has been flustered by predictions of winter electricity blackouts as pressures on global supplies mount as providers race to stock up for the coming colder months and prices reach record highs.\n\nAs a British citizen living in Lebanon, I never thought the two countries would share such a problem, though acknowledging the very different origins and levels of their respective electricity crisis.\n\nWith power cuts making home work difficult, many Lebanese find cafes where workarounds can be found for wifi (Photo: Getty)\n\nDespite the dark, most aspects of the café are still functioning. There is internet thanks to an USB battery pack connected to the router. Coffee is available, albeit a pot of American or iced, the latter welcome considering the 31°C temperature outside. No power means no water pumped through the pipes, so the toilets are temporarily out of order.\n\nYet patrons are still here working away. Hoping devices’ batteries last and admittedly, keen for the air conditioning to blow again as Beirut’s humid urban heat seeps inside.\n\nThe indifference towards the absence of a basic service is striking to outsiders. It is exemplary of how residents have been left with little choice but to adapt to an economic depression which has exacerbated an ailing electricity sector.\n\nWould such an attitude hold out in the UK?\n\nLebanon is well versed in blackouts. Since the 90s, Électricité du Liban (EDL), the country’s public electric utility, has failed to provide 24-hour electricity, forcing residents to resort to private generators to fill some of the gap, though with hefty bills of hundreds of dollars.\n\nDecades of corruption and mismanagement at EDL created huge operating losses and contributed to the government’s massive debt-to-GDP ratio, among the highest in the world and a key contributor to the economic collapse. Today, the Lebanese receive between two to four hours a day of electricity from the grid, grinding life to a halt for the many unable to afford generators.\n\nIt has made carrying out simple daily tasks a struggle. One lady tells me she wakes up in the night to put the washing machine on, when the state power appears in the early hours. Another friend says her family only buys food the day they plan to eat it, with the fridge now redundant. Water shortages, rotten food and consequent sickness have been unwelcome by-products.\n\nFor the UK, such concerns are no longer a world away – or 2,700 miles to be precise. A government energy report leaked to Bloomberg showed that under the British government’s latest “reasonable worst-case scenario” planning, scheduled blackouts for businesses and households could happen in January if cold temperatures and gas shortages clash.\n\nThe British government remains adamant that rolling power-cuts are not a risk, though it has not stopped the National Grid upping its annual emergency winter contingency planning from a usual two-day exercise to four days. On top of possible blackouts, consumers are also facing mammoth energy bill increases, set to be three times higher than last year.\n\nOne of the main triggers for the global oil instability has arisen from Western powers’ boycott of Russian energy, following the Ukrainian war. The UK does not rely hugely on Russian supplies; in 2021, Russia made up 24.1 per cent of the UK’s refined oil imports, according to ONS data.\n\nHowever, the UK is a net importer of energy and therefore subject to the destabilised global market. Gas mainly comes from Norway, France and Qatar, as well as offshore resources in the North Sea.\n\nAs the British government introduces support schemes for households opening eye-watering bills, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for Lebanon’s electricity woes.\n\nYet despite the bleak outlook, the Lebanese fall back on humour to relieve the daily disruptions. As one friend said to me after reading about the British energy crisis: “Considering the great experience of Lebanon and the Lebanese in such matters, we are ready to help Great Britain overcome all of that!”\n\nI should also add: electricity is not the first crisis Lebanon and the UK have shared. Last September, Lebanon was in the midst of months-long chaotic petrol shortages with long queues and closed stations.\n\nAnd then the UK was too, when supply problems plus panic buying caused turmoil across the country as stations shut. The irony did not escape locals here. Fadi, a Lebanese friend, sent me an image on WhatsApp, accompanied by a stream of laughing emojis. The photo was of a Sainsbury’s petrol station, closed and cordoned off by a sign reading “Sorry no fuel”.",
    "Beirut's beach economy booms as tourists flock to Lebanon": "Beirut's beach economy is booming this summer, with an estimated US$3 billion having flowed into Lebanon as a result of a thriving tourist scene which has thrown a lifeline to thousands of desperate workers and businesses.\n\nThe summer of 2022 has seen Lebanon transform into a \"land of tourists and dollar carriers alone\", a reference to the outrageously high prices that are almost exclusively in dollars – a move endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism - with most restaurants and bars now setting minimum bills at 500,000 Lebanese lira per customer.\n\nDespite this, the summer season has become a lifeline - especially for Lebanese youth – forming the major source of employment in the crisis-stricken country. The difference this year was that customers' tips ('baksheesh'), for many, effectively replaced a large part of their wages.\n\nLower wages, bigger tips\n\nUniversity student Roni says that he waits for the summer to work in restaurants and nightclubs in order to cover his university costs.\n\n\"The summer season has become a lifeline - especially for Lebanese youth – forming the major source of employment in the crisis-stricken country. The difference this year was that customers' tips ('baksheesh'), for many, effectively replaced a large part of their wages\"\n\nHe points out that his monthly wage for working as a waiter in one of Beirut’s restaurants doesn't exceed four million lira (which is equivalent to around US$137 according to the unofficial exchange rate which is around 30,000 lira per dollar).\n\nThe restaurant, however, charges its customers in dollars. Roni says he relies on the tips, which are far bigger than he used to get – on a busy night they could reach one million lira if the customers are Arabs or Lebanese expatriates.\n\nRalph works from 7am to 6pm as a lifeguard in a private swimming pool in Jounieh (north of Beirut), before going to work in a nightclub. He says that in his first job, he relies on the salary, which is US$200 per month. Before the crisis, he would earn US$1,000 for the same work.\n\nRalph's night shift is as a waiter at a nightclub which does parties on the beach through the summer. For this, he earns a monthly wage of five million lira, and also relies on tips, which, on Fridays and Saturdays, could be as much as three million lira. He says the drawback of seasonal work is the lack of social protection and insurance. He could be fired at any moment \"for any mistake\", he says, because the \"customer is more important than the worker\".\n\nA billboard showing the slogan 'Ahla bhal talleh' ('Welcome to Lebanon') which has been a campaign promoted by the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism this summer [Anwar Amro/AFP via Getty]\n\nAhla bhal talleh - Welcome to Lebanon\n\nThe holiday season has been enthusiastically promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism, which launched the \"Welcome to Lebanon\" ('Ahla bhal talleh') campaign early in the summer. Holidaymakers are also providing an essential lifeline to taxi drivers, including the newer \"Tuk-tuk\" taxis, as well as providing work to street stalls, beach vendors, and the organisers, entertainers and musicians who put on shows and festivals across the country through the summer months.\n\nVendors of various wares - flowers, candyfloss and balloons - have all been waiting for the summer to make a living, and have also been touched by \"customers' generosity\" this year. Abu George sells flowers on the cobbled streets of Jounieh, which are filled with outdoor bars and cafes, and he goes from table to table with his wares.\n\n\"This is the first time I've made this much money. I don't price the flowers, I leave it up to the customers. I used to get 5,000 lira or at most 10,000 lira, but today, there are people who pay me 50,000 lira, 100,000 and even 200,000 lira for one flower… they are Iraqis, Egyptians, and Lebanese who live abroad\".\n\n\"I used to get 5,000 lira or at most 10,000 lira, but today, there are people who pay me 50,000 lira, 100,000 and even 200,000 lira for one flower… they are Iraqis, Egyptians, and Lebanese\"\n\nIn Lebanon, summer jobs are plentiful, especially those at the beaches, private pools, nightclubs and \"roof-top\" venues. Guesthouses, hotels and chalets fill up with holidaymakers - currently many of these are fully booked until the end of September. This year, despite the crisis, has seen a flurry of new touristic enterprises launched, which have also contributed to widening the job market, especially for the youth and university students.\n\n1.2 million summer visitors\n\nJeanne Beiruti, general secretary of the Lebanese Federation of Touristic Establishments, describes the summer season of 2022 as \"fantastic\", and says around 1,200,000 tourists are expected to have visited the country by the end of August. He further says to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, The New Arab's Arabic-language sister publication, that tourism has brought in $3 billion revenue since May.\n\nBeiruti points out that the tourism sector lost over 40,000 employees in the wake of the economic crisis, many leaving to work abroad. However, he says that new workers have now been trained and entered into the sector, and there are currently around 200,000 employees making a living in tourism, including seasonal and non-seasonal workers.\n\nBeautiful launch of the official summer 2022 campaign “Ahla bhal talleh” (Welcome to Lebanon) to promote and encourage tourism in #Lebanon, anticipating a promising summer season. 🇱🇧 @motlebofficial pic.twitter.com/517UBS9uqi — Ann Dismorr (@Ann_Dismorr) July 20, 2022\n\nHe admits that wages are now as much as 50 percent less than before 2019, because of the collapse. What is different, he says, are the tips, which have come to form a major part of employees' salaries, sometimes exceeding their income. This has been noticeably the case with generous tips from expatriate Lebanese and those carrying dollars.\n\nKhaled Nozha, vice president of the Syndicate of Owners of Restaurants, confirmed that \"before the economic crisis, the tourism sector employed around 160,000 Lebanese who were registered for social security, and between 40,000 – 45,000 who were classified as seasonal workers.\n\nReviving a devastated sector\n\n\"Due to events in the country, politically, economically and health-wise, with the pandemic and the Beirut Port explosion, many workers from the tourism sector have left. This is especially the case with restaurants that have branches abroad which need Lebanese expertise, that can offer them work with lower salaries than they would usually take - or would be given to workers abroad – because of Lebanon's crisis, which has seen Lebanese workers forced to accept any kind of work. Then there are those who lost their jobs due to the damage to restaurants across Beirut\".\n\n\"Around 1,200,000 tourists are expected to have visited the country by the end of August\"\n\nNozha points out that the passion for Lebanon in Arab countries, especially Iraq, Jordan and Egypt and from Lebanese living abroad, has galvanised the job market. Some have returned to benefit from the work as restaurants that had been damaged have been reopened. On the other hand, despite the increase in job opportunities, the tourism sector has also witnessed a shortage of manpower, leading many restaurants to hire non-Lebanese staff to fill the gap and cater for the crowds of customers.\n\nBut overall, Nozha says the season has been excellent, considering the high operational costs, up to 35 percent of which is spent on buying diesel for electricity, in addition to other costs which are all priced in dollars, because Lebanon has, unfortunately, become \"dollarised\". However, he believes that many venues have shown resilience in defying the difficulties they face and have preserved a high-quality service and Lebanon's status on the tourist map.\n\nFuture fears\n\nHowever, he doesn't hide his fears over what will happen to restaurants after the tourist season finishes at the end of September, as only 5-7 percent of Lebanese receive salaries in dollars, whereas those who receive their wages in Lebanese lira struggle to make ends meet and their priorities are to secure medicine, food and basic necessities.\n\nRELATED Incompetence over Beirut silos fire leaves Lebanon shattered Society\n\nA restaurant owner in Beirut says: \"For two months I was looking for a chef, but either people would be asking for a higher wage [than I could afford], over 10 million lira per month, or they would demand their wages in dollars, or they would ask for a higher daily transport allowance because petrol costs more than wages. These were the main problems I faced when trying to find workers, and I'm still suffering from a lack of staff\".\n\nHe says he cannot raise the employees' salaries even though he has increased his prices because the electricity crisis has led to him spending increasing amounts paying for a subscription with a private electricity generator (paid for in dollars).\n\nOn 12 May 2022, the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) in Lebanon and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) published results from a new survey of the labour force in Lebanon which indicated that unemployment rates rose from 11.4 percent during 2018-2019 to 29.6 percent in January 2022.\n\nAccording to the survey, informal employment (employment not adequately covered by formal arrangements and social protection schemes), now counts for more than 60 percent of total employment in Lebanon.\n\nThis is an edited translation from our Arabic edition.

    "Analysis: Lebanon's bid for IMF deal hits snags": "People shop at a market in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, Lebanon September 6, 2022. REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nBEIRUT, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Five months after Lebanon's draft IMF deal raised hopes it could finally pull together an economic reform plan to address its financial meltdown, political and financial elites are obstructing prospects of securing any rescue package.\n\nEfforts to enact eight reforms sought by the IMF are going nowhere or falling short, hitting resistance from politicians who are shielding vested interests and dodging accountability.\n\nIt means Lebanon will likely have little to present to the Fund's annual board meeting in October to back its quest to unlock $3 billion in aid, and adds to doubts over whether the government will ever come up with a plan to address the crisis.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nLast week, the IMF told the government that its only attempt so far at legislative reform to tackle the three-year economic crisis - amendments to the banking secrecy law - still retained \"key deficiencies\", after MPs watered down the original text, according an IMF legal brief seen by Reuters.\n\nAdding to the dim outlook, a plan for plugging a hole in the national finances - some $72 billion and growing - faces objections, including banks that say it puts too much of the burden on them.\n\nThe latest pushback came on Thursday from a group of business leaders and former officials who launched their own version of the recovery plan reflecting some of the banks' concerns.\n\nWithout such a plan, an early version of which was torpedoed by politicians and bankers in 2020, ordinary savers are paying the price, locked out of deposits in a frozen banking system where the value of their cash has plunged since 2019.\n\n\"It's clear that there’s no political will to reform,\" said law-maker Ibrahim Mneimeh. \"You can’t separate the politics from the economics – especially not in Lebanon.\"\n\nThe inaction adds to concerns the ruling elite - accused by the World Bank of deliberately orchestrating the crisis - will let it fester indefinitely.\n\nThe crisis is fuelling poverty, a brain drain and a risk of instability in a country with a history of civil war.\n\nDespite the lack of progress, there is no suggestion the IMF will walk away. While the draft deal urges timely implementation of reforms, it sets no deadline.\n\nThe government says it remains committed to the IMF track, seen as the only way out of a crisis rooted in years of corruption, waste and unsustainable financial policies.\n\n\"MAGICAL\" SOLUTIONS\n\nSome are pinning their hopes elsewhere, anticipating that unproven offshore gas fields may one day provide salvation, though these could take years to develop. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has said this is the only solution.\n\nLebanese banks have also backed a proposal to use part of future oil and gas reserves to plug the financial gap, an idea experts on IMF thinking say would not be acceptable to the fund.\n\n\"There is a belief in a magical solution - oil and gas,\" said Camille Abousleiman, a finance lawyer and former minister.\n\n\"This is no substitute for fundamental reform.\"\n\nHe cited vested interests and a lack of \"ethical leadership\" as causes of inaction by politicians, who managed to cling to power after the election despite the crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, dollar reserves representing what's left of depositors' funds are being depleted. The central bank said in June they had dropped $2.2 billion in 2022 to about $11 billion.\n\nThe watered-down amendments to the banking secrecy law show the resistance to reform.\n\nAn early draft allowed the lifting of banking secrecy to investigate \"all financial crimes\" but the version approved by parliament in July weakened it, allowing only some government bodies to lift it in cases of specific crimes.\n\nThe IMF brief seen by Reuters suggested parliament reinstate the nixed clauses.\n\nDIVIDING LOSSES\n\nThe dispute over how to distribute the financial sector losses remains a complication.\n\nThe government plan, drawn up Deputy Prime Minister Saade Chami, aims to do this in a way that protects depositors and the state, writing off a chunk of central bank debt to commercial banks, which would shoulder big losses, echoing IMF principles.\n\nUnder the alternative plan launched on Thursday by the Lebanese Economic Organizations, banks would bear responsibility but without pushing the sector towards bankruptcy, its chair, ex-minister Mohamed Choucair, said, local media reported.\n\nFour sources familiar with the plan said it would flip the hierarchy of claims.\n\nLebanon has made almost no progress on the rest of the to-do list, which Chami had hoped would be completed by September so that the IMF board could be approached by October.\n\nThe political calendar does not bode well. President Michel Aoun leaves office on Oct. 31 with no sign yet of agreement on who should replace him, while the government has been operating in a caretaker capacity since the May election due to divisions over a new cabinet.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEditing by Tom Perry and Samia Nakhoul\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
