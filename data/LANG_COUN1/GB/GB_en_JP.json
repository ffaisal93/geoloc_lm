    "Japan warns against speculative yen moves amid sharp declines": "Finance minister says government and Bank of Japan are on same page in sharing concerns about the currency’s fall.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki has said that authorities stand ready to respond to speculative currency moves, a new warning that comes days after Tokyo intervened in the foreign exchange market to stem yen falls for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nSuzuki also told a news conference on Monday the government and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) were on the same page in sharing concerns about the currency’s sharp declines.\n\n“We are deeply concerned about recent rapid and one-sided market moves driven in part by speculative trading,” Suzuki told a news conference. “There’s no change to our stance of being ready to respond as needed” to such moves, he added.\n\nThe remark came after the government’s decision on Thursday to intervene in the currency market to stem yen weakness by selling dollars and buying yen for the first time since 1998.\n\nThe yen’s recent sharp declines, which have pushed up households’ living costs by boosting imported fuel and food prices, have been driven in part by widening divergence between the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening and the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will deliver a speech to business leaders in Osaka, western Japan, later on Monday where he may comment on the yen and the government’s intervention.\n\nThe dollar added 0.29 percent to reach 143.78 yen on Monday, continuing its climb back toward Thursday’s 24-year peak of 145.90. It tumbled to 140.31 that same day after Japanese authorities stepped into the market.\n\nWhile government officials’ jawboning may keep markets nervous about the prospects of further intervention, stepping in repeatedly in the currency market and selling huge sums of dollars could be difficult due to the criticism Japan may face from its G7 counterparts.\n\n“It’s unlikely Japan will continue intervening to defend a certain line, such as 145 yen to the dollar,” former top Japanese currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe yen is not alone in its downward spiral. Several other currencies, including the British pound, the euro and the Chinese yuan have taken a hammering partly driven by the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate increases in recent months.",
    "Shinzo Abe funeral: world figures fly in to political storm over state service for Japan former PM": "The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will be among foreign dignitaries arriving in Japan to attend a state funeral for the assassinated former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, despite strong public opposition to the ceremony.\n\nThey will be among about 700 people from overseas, including 50 former and current leaders, who are expected to attend the funeral in Tokyo on Tuesday, almost three months after Abe was shot dead while making a campaign speech.\n\nPublic opinion was split when, six days after Abe’s death, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said his predecessor would be afforded a state funeral.\n\nBut opposition has intensified in recent weeks, amid a torrent of revelations about ties between Abe’s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) – now led by Kishida – and the Unification church.\n\nThe suspect in Abe’s shooting on 8 July, Tetsuya Yamagami, has told investigators he targeted the politician because of his ties to the church, whose members are commonly known as Moonies.\n\nYamagami reportedly said he harboured a two-decade grudge against the church after his mother, a member, donated a huge sum of money to the organisation and bankrupted his family.\n\nAbe was not a member of the church, but sent a congratulatory video message to a church-affiliated event last autumn.\n\nFounded in South Korea in 1954 by the self-proclaimed messiah Sun Myung Moon, the church was encouraged to establish a presence in Japan by Abe’s grandfather and postwar prime minister, Nobusuke Kishi, as a counter to communism and trade unionism. The organisation, known for its mass weddings, has been accused of pressuring believers into making donations they can’t afford – claims it has denied.\n\nAfter Abe’s shooting exposed serious errors by officers responsible for protecting him, organisers have planned strict security measures near the funeral venue.\n\nRoads around the Budokan will be closed and airspace will be restricted from Monday until Wednesday. Tens of thousands of police officers, including about 2,500 from outside the capital, have been deployed and sniffer dogs have been patrolling major railway stations and Haneda airport in recent days.\n\nJapanese media revelations that other members of the LDP – and a much smaller number from other parties – had attended church events or sought help from their members has dominated the domestic news for weeks. A survey conducted by the party found that 179 of its 379 lawmakers had interacted with the church.\n\nBut a call by Kishida for party MPs to cut their ties to the church has done little to quell growing anger at plans to spend an estimated ¥1.65bn ($12m) on the funeral, most of which will be go on security and hosting foreign delegations.\n\nKishida has seen his approval ratings plummet, while opinion polls show a majority of people oppose Tuesday’s ceremony. According to a recent poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, 62% of respondents said they objected to the ceremony. Some said Abe was not worthy of the honour, while others cited the cost.\n\nHolding a state funeral was a “big miscalculation” by Kishida, according to Tomoaki Iwai, professor emeritus at Nihon University.\n\n“When he originally decided on the funeral there were a lot of people in favour, but then there were the reports of Abe’s involvement with the Unification church, and so opposition grew.”\n\nWhile Abe’s economic and security policies received largely positive reviews abroad, he continues to be a divisive figure at home.\n\nCritics say he dragged the country to the right, treated the constitution with contempt and presided over an administration mired in cronyism and sleaze. Abe was implicated in major scandals but went on to become Japan’s longest-serving leader shortly before he resigned, citing poor health, in 2020.\n\nThe 4,300 funeral guests will include the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese as well as three of his predecessors, Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, and the European Council president, Charles Michel.",

    "As world gathers to honor Abe, Japan grapples with church’s influence": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nTOKYO — For nearly two decades, public discussion of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s ties with the Unification Church was taboo in Japan. Now, the organization’s decades-long influence in Japanese politics is at the forefront of a political outcry. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The turning point: The July 8 assassination of Shinzo Abe.\n\nDignitaries are gathering in Tokyo this week to commemorate Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. But the event has put a spotlight on the scandal ensnaring the ruling party over its links with the church and use of taxpayer money for the state funeral of a leader who was popular abroad but divisive at home.\n\nThe church has faced scrutiny after Tetsuya Yamagami, the suspected gunman, told police he wanted to carry out the assassination because his life and family had been ruined as a result of his mother’s large donations to a religious group to which Abe had apparent close ties. The Unification Church confirmed that Yamagami’s mother is a longtime member and that it had received donations from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther families emerged to say that their lives were similarly upended because of donations made by their relatives, some of whom have ongoing legal battles with the Unification Church. The accounts highlighted a controversial practice known as “spiritual sales,” in which goods or services that supposedly possess supernatural powers were sold to members at often exorbitant prices.\n\n“When I first heard that Abe’s death was related to a certain religious organization, I knew right away, that … something huge was going to unfold,” said Eito Suzuki, a journalist who has been tracking the church’s activities since 2002. “There is no other cult aside from the Unification Church which extends so deeply and widely within Japanese politics, reaching the ruling party, opposition parties, and beyond.”\n\nChurch officials said in a news conference last week that they are unaware of spiritual sales made after 2009, when the group signed a legal agreement after facing criminal charges over the practice. The church has addressed anger over its links with the ruling party by saying that on various issues its stance tends to align with the LDP membership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has apologized for his party’s cozy relationship with the church and vowed to sever relations. He reshuffled his cabinet, removing leaders with the strongest links to the group, and surveyed members to identify their relationships with the organization.\n\nBut Kishida’s approval ratings have plummeted, especially after it emerged that several members of his new cabinet had ties to the church. Last week, Kishida said he would not call for an investigation into Abe’s ties with the church.\n\nThe public — and even some members of the LDP — are increasingly skeptical of the party’s ability to divorce itself. Even after the party released the names of officials who reported links to the church and its affiliates, another top LDP official acknowledged ties. The internal review has drawn further criticism from those demanding an independent investigation.\n\nIn light of the controversy, there has been a backlash against the government’s decision to host a state funeral for Abe — the first in 55 years and only the second in the postwar era. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to oppose the move, and thousands have protested in front of the Diet, Japan’s national assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan is not a particularly religious country, but the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the official name of the Unification Church, controls dozens of ministries in Japan.\n\nThe church’s roots in Japan date to 1968, when it founded a political organization, the International Federation for Victory over Communism, with the support of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s grandfather, who had befriended the group’s founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.\n\nThe group became a reliable partner for the LDP in rallying against communism and left-wing protests through the 1960s. In the 1980s, conservative politicians began receiving endorsements, donations and grass roots support from the group, Suzuki said.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the group aligned with right-wing politicians over social issues, opposing the introduction of gender equality policies and sex education, according to its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Abe rose to power in the LDP and eventually became prime minister, the church’s members became a conservative voting bloc and mobilizing force, Suzuki said — an important source of support in a country that prohibits individual donations to political candidates.\n\n“We do not have a stance of asking members to support any specific party or one particular party,” Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the Japanese office of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, said at an August news conference. “Our fundamental stance is a stance in opposition to communism, so from that perspective there may be more points of encounter with members of the LDP.”\n\nOver those decades, Japan became the key profit center for the Unification Church and its offshoots, largely through door-to-door “spiritual sales” that often targeted grieving elderly people, according to several academic studies, government investigators and historians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese items included jars and miniature stone pagodas, which believers were told would absolve the sins of their ancestors for their occupation of South Korea, according to academic research. The group’s membership in Japan surpasses that of South Korea, where the organization was founded.\n\nThe Japanese government has set up a consumer affairs agency to investigate the proliferation of spiritual sales. It received more than 1,000 calls in the first five days.\n\nMainstream media at times covered church members’ political support for the LDP but in the mid-2000s, it gradually became a social taboo to discuss the topic openly, Suzuki said. In earlier times, media outlets had faced a torrent of calls after critical coverage of the issue, he said.\n\n“After Abe’s death, hearing the words ‘cult’ and ‘Unification Church’ so prevalently now in major media outlets for the past two months still feels unreal and shocking even for me, especially because those words had been taboo for so many years,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2021, Abe made his most public appearance at an event hosted by the church through a video message, alongside other prominent politicians who recorded messages.\n\nThat video message may have provoked the suspected gunman, according to police sources quoted in Japanese media. Yamagami’s uncle told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper that Yamagami had attempted suicide because of his family’s financial difficulties, and that the suspect’s mother was traumatized after her husband killed himself.\n\nYamagami is now detained and undergoing psychiatric evaluations until November, when prosecutors will decide whether to press formal murder charges.\n\nNobuya Fukumoto, a lawyer for the Unification Church, said in a news conference last week that the donations from Yamagami’s mother exceeded $704,000, including funds from a life insurance policy and real estate sales. The lawyer said he believed she made an “excessive donation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYamagami’s story of grief and financial turmoil has drawn some sympathizers. Thousands have signed a petition advocating for a reduced sentence, and people have donated over $7,000 in cash, clothing, books and other items to Yamagami, according to Japanese news outlet Jiji Press.\n\nHis story is not unique, said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, a lawyer with the National Network of Lawyers Against Spiritual Sales, a Tokyo-based advocacy group. From 1987 to 2021, there were nearly 35,000 cases brought by defendants claiming about $863 million in damages from the Unification Church, according to the advocacy group’s website.\n\n“His mother was mentally in a very difficult situation … and it is typical for people in a situation like her to become victims to the Unification Church,” Yamaguchi said.\n\nYamaguchi wants to see greater regulation of spiritual sales or excessive donations, and proper care of children of parents who are members of “new religion” groups who may be donating heavily to such organizations.\n\n“I really felt that it was a matter of time before something like this happened,” Yamaguchi said. “I have seen countless tragedies and difficulties faced by children of parents who are part of the Unification Church … I can easily imagine that Yamagami must have suffered in a similar manner.”\n\nMarc Fisher in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "The changing of the guard in corporate Japan": "26 September 2022\n\nHow younger executives are addressing corporate Japan’s failures.\n\nJapan’s reputation among international investors is still mixed. The late prime minister Shinzo Abe did a lot to make Japan attractive to foreign investors but one man could only do so much. Fears about corporate governance practices, a slow adoption of digital technologies compared to other Western nations and sluggish conglomerates remain.\n\nReally addressing these issues will take more than a dynamic prime minister; it needs a generational-shift. We need to see a change in corporate culture and in the mind-set of senior executives. Here there are promising signs. What we’re seeing currently is a changing of the guard in corporate Japan, which could pave the way for a transformation of Japanese companies.\n\nThe ‘baby boomer’ generation contributed to Japan’s high economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s. Their fairly consistent success meant that they were ‘married’ to their principles, making them ill-prepared to deal with the economic slowdown in the 1990s and beyond, as well as the drastic changes initiated by IT in the 2000s. Many of these ‘boomers’ are rapidly approaching (or have already surpassed) the retirement age of 65; their younger counterparts are acceding to corporate dominance, bringing with them a willingness to change.\n\nThe new generation are more aggressive in terms of investment, and more willing to accept that failures are hard to avoid on the path to ultimate success. This, combined with a population that is now ready for digital innovation because of the pandemic, during which many companies were forced to find innovative, tech-led solutions to survive, means the transformation of Japanese companies can finally happen.\n\nOne change is the increasing number of companies incorporating digital platforms into their business models. This has made it possible for SMEs with innovative services and products to develop their business. For example, M3 Inc., a medical-technology company, has pioneered the shift from face-to-face meetings between doctors and medical representatives to virtual consultations, a service now used by 90% of doctors in Japan.\n\nDigitisation is likely to reshape the manufacturing market too, where companies such as MISUMI GROUP Inc. are abandoning analogue processes to bring their operations online. A willingness to invest in these processes typifies the attitude needed for sustained growth. These changes are, of course, driven in part by Covid-19, but they would not exist without the increased IT literacy of the new generation of executives and their willingness to take risks.\n\nFurther change is being led by the globalisation of non-manufacturing companies in Japan. Historically, the Japanese export market has been dominated by manufacturers, who capitalised on the cheap labour available to them on the Asian mainland to offer competitive prices in the global market. However, retail and luxury companies are increasingly taking more risks to expand their operations overseas as they are being led by younger, bolder executives.\n\nLeading the charge here are companies such as the retail conglomerate Ryohin Keikaku, who made the unorthodox decision to hire a CEO from outside the company, Nobuo Domae, in 2021. This is not common practice in Japan yet it epitomises the new way of thinking led by executives from generation ‘X’, in contrast to the intransigent ‘boomers’ of yesteryear.\n\nTypically, Japanese companies appointed a CEO from within. This executive was usually in their sixties; during their tenure, they were expected to steer the course but not to rock the boat, and for only a short number of years before retirement. Because of this, there was little to incentivise expansionary strategies that carry risk. Younger CEOs are tasked with growth, rather than consistency. Coupled with increased IT literacy and a less parochial attitude towards change, the new generation are ready to alter the course of Japanese businesses.\n\nWhile there are numerous bold and positive steps being taken, the picture in corporate Japan is not all positive. Corporations remain largely resistant to adopting new IT protocols for fear of system failures; this caution dampens the drive towards digitisation. Many retail companies have not yet embraced the change. Often,they still rely too heavily on Japan’s ageing population for demand, which is inherently unsustainable. Short of a reversal in the ageing population, these companies need to be aggressive internationally if they are to see growth rather than contraction. The current slide of the Yen to historic lows ought to be seen as an opportunity by Japanese retailers with aspirations of increasing global market share.Japan also lags behind its Asian neighbours with its proclivity to keep processes in-house. While this is a good thing for operational resilience, the refusal to outsource damages efficiency, as firms are not taking advantage of the numerous innovations made by other companies. As the next generation takes the reigns, will this unwillingness to outsource will be forgotten in favour of flexibility?\n\nJapan finds itself at a crossroads. As the old generation moves aside and the new arrives, Japan can only hope this change is not too little or too late in the face of global economic crises, an ageing population and continued resistance to change in many Japanese businesses.\n\nTatsuya Suzuki, chief portfolio manager of the Japan Quality Growth strategy.

    "What Did Japan’s Kishida Do at the UN General Assembly?": "Advertisement\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s departure to New York for this year’s U.N. General Assembly was delayed because of Typhoon 14, but once he arrived on Tuesday, September 20, he had a packed schedule.\n\nOn Tuesday, he met with British Prime Minister Liz Truss for the first time. During their meeting, they discussed their shared concerns about China’s potential use of force to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, the situation in Ukraine, and the joint development of a next-generation fighter jet. Kishida also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and discussed Ukraine and U.N. reform.\n\nKishida’s first day in New York concluded with a speech to the General Assembly in which he called for reforms of the U.N. Security Council and the abolition of nuclear weapons, criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and raised the issue of Japanese abductees in North Korea.\n\nJapan has been aiming for U.N. reform for almost two decades now. However, in this year’s speech, Kishida tied Russia’s war in Ukraine directly to the need for reform: “We must face the fact that the credibility of the United Nations is at stake due to the aggression against Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. We, the Member States of the UN, must act to restore this Organization’s credibility.” He continued, “Frequently, debates about the dysfunctionality of the Security Council have been pointed out. We have debated about this issue for almost over 30 years. But what is truly needed now is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but actions toward reform… The time has come to start text-based negotiations to reform the Security Council.”\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

They also discussed improving relations, the situation in Yemen and other parts of the Middle East, and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Also on Wednesday, Kishida met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and they agreed to cooperate in security, energy, and infrastructure, and discussed shared concerns about China’s growing maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas and China’s “economic coercion.”\n\nEnjoying this article?

Security Council in his General Assembly speech. The two leaders agreed to work together on Security Council reform and to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance.\n\nThroughout his time in New York, Kishida’s commitment to abolishing nuclear weapons has been consistent. He attended the first meeting of leaders of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Friends: six like-minded nations that want to pass the CTBT as soon as possible – Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Finland, and Germany. Although the Foreign Ministers of the CTBT Friends had met before, this was the first time that a meeting of the leaders of the six nations was held.\n\nDuring his speech the night before, Kishida had used the platform to criticize Russia again, for “threatening the use of nuclear weapons,” and “[blocking] the unity and concerted efforts of the international community to reach consensus on an outcome document that would maintain and strengthen the NPT regime.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other persistent, tricky issue Kishida tried to deal with while in New York was Japan-South Korea relations. During a meeting on the sidelines of the CTBT meeting, Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol affirmed that Japan and South Korea are “important neighbors under the current strategic environment.” They agreed to improve trilateral cooperation with the United States, and deal with North Korea. Yoon also reiterated support for Japan’s efforts to resolve the abductees issue.\n\nThe Japanese government characterized the talks as “informal,” given that the issue of wartime forced labor is not resolved yet. Both Japan and South Korea are watching the outcome of the lawsuit against Japanese companies filed by wartime Korean laborers very closely.\n\nThe meeting, according to reporting by The Asahi Shimbun, was “awkward.” South Korea had unilaterally announced a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly before Kishida confirmed, which made Kishida disinclined to attend. However, Kishida attended the meeting after all, believing that the South Koreans were sincere in trying to mend relations. He did not have much to say at the meeting, and Yoon had to do most of the talking so a semblance of a meeting could be maintained.",
    "Japan is open for tourism again – here are 20 reasons to visit now": "Before 2020, Japan evoked a flood of clear-cut images: Mount Fuji hovering on the horizon, under cartoon blue skies; the white nose of a shinkansen (bullet train) gliding into a station platform; stillness punctuated by the whisk of bamboo on ceramic as forest-green matcha is prepared.\n\nFast-forward to today, and although all of these iconic elements for which Japan has long been famed are still here, the nation is perhaps now viewed through an additional prism: as one of the least accessible countries in the world, thanks to its strict border closures.\n\nFor more than two years, tightly closed to inbound tourists as part of its rigorous anti-Covid strategy – something of a modern echo of the country’s famous 265-year period of self-isolation which ended in the 19th century.\n\nThis week, after tentative opening steps, the government finally scrapped the country’s pre-arrival Covid-19 test requirement, and removed the need for visitors to be part of an organised tour. It may be limited, but it’s a step in the right direction – and makes this magnificent destination once again worthy of the number one spot on any wish list.\n\nJapan’s closure to tourists has not stopped a rush of chic new hotel openings across the country – from sub-tropical island resorts and sparkling city skyscrapers to intimate rural escapes. Plus, visitors will find that Japan’s famed reputation for cleanliness serves them well in a pandemic, with stringent anti-Covid measures still in place at most hotels, restaurants and public facilities (hand washing, temperature testing and mask wearing are still required ahead of entering many spaces).\n\nAnd for those still in any doubt about whether to jump on a plane to Japan as soon as it’s possible, here are 20 reasons to start planning a dream trip (just don’t forget to pack your mask).",

    "Kyoto Wants You Back, but It Has Some Polite Suggestions": "At the beginning of the pandemic, “people in the city were saying, ‘We’ve returned to the old Kyoto, isn’t that great?’” said Toshinori Tsuchihashi, the director of the city’s tourism department.\n\nBut, as the economic damage mounted, residents “have come to recognize tourism’s importance.”\n\nMany businesses have yet to recover. Before the pandemic, it was nearly impossible to get a reservation at one of the many restaurants lining Pontocho, an atmospheric alleyway running parallel to the Kamo River in Kyoto’s city center. But on a recent weekend night, “for lease” signs hung in darkened shop windows, and many of the terraces looking out on the water sat unused.\n\nHotel The Mitsui Kyoto, a luxury Western-style hotel, opened in late 2020 and has operated well below capacity for most of the pandemic, according to Manabu Kusui, the general manager.\n\nAs tourists begin returning to Kyoto, the hotel hopes to differentiate itself by providing guests with exclusive experiences it has negotiated with some of Kyoto’s beautiful but less trafficked destinations. One of the first is a private tour of Nijo Castle, the residence of Japan’s first shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, conveniently located next to the hotel.\n\nIt’s a style of tourism the city is trying to promote as part of its new strategic plan to address prepandemic crowding.\n\nBut Mr. Kusui knows that people come to Kyoto with a certain itinerary in mind, and “we can’t tell them not to go to some place like Kiyomizu Temple,” he said, referring to the famous Buddhist temple perched on a mountain face on Kyoto’s east side.",

The ambitious challenger had the champ on the deck in the first and fourth, but Saka retaliated with a beautifully well-timed right to floor Nara in the fifth.

    "Learning lessons from Japan for Scotland’s islands": "An international collaborative study comparing approaches to island depopulation in Scotland and Japan has identified several important lessons which could shape future policy and funding initiatives in this country.\n\nThe research, led by Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), aimed to address the issues of population decline, accompanied by an ageing population structure, faced by many of the country’s island communities.\n\nJapan is made up of five main islands and almost 7,000 smaller islands, 90 per cent of which are uninhabited, while Scotland has 790 offshore islands, of which only 93 are inhabited.\n\nJapan has a long history of developing national policies and related funding packages focused on tackling demographic decline in both rural and island communities.\n\nDespite the diversity of island communities in both countries, the report found many of these Japanese strategies could provide useful learning for future island depopulation policies in Scotland.\n\nThese include programmes to:\n\nprovide support for people settling in island communities\n\nencourage those who regularly visit islands to contribute more to their sustainability and vibrancy, and to settle permanently\n\nmake empty buildings available for re-use\n\ndevelop teleworking and ‘parallel work’ opportunities\n\nlaunch education-focused programmes to encourage more young people to remain on islands for their education\n\nThe researchers proposed 15 areas of learning for future island depopulation policies in Scotland, including engaging with island communities in co-designing policy interventions; providing a flexible policy framework to enable locally tailored interventions; exploring the ‘positives’ of demographic ageing as well as retaining/re-attracting young people; and building on the changes in lifestyles associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLead author Dr Jane Atterton, from SRUC’s Rural Policy Centre, said: “The two countries and their islands are so different but there is a lot that can be learned here from the approaches taken in Japan at both national and local levels, including their concept of ‘relationship population’ and the ‘Community Cooperative Support’ initiative. “Having researchers located in both countries meant the team was well placed to understand and appreciate the differences in language, culture and context that underpin these interventions.”\n\nThe exploratory study was conducted in partnership with Newcastle University, Akita International University and Tokyo University for Agriculture and Technology on behalf of the Scottish Government.\n\nTo read the report, visit: Approaches to island depopulation in Japan and lessons for Scotland – gov.scot (www.gov.scot)",

(Chevron), and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd (MOECO) have announced the signing of a Joint Collaboration Agreement to explore the technical and commercial feasibility of advanced geothermal power generation in Japan.\n\nBuilding on Chevron and MOECO’s long-standing relationship, the new collaboration will study geothermal resource potential across Japan and will evaluate the effectiveness of Advanced Closed Loop (ACL) technology for a future joint pilot project in Japan. Both companies may also assess potential collaboration for advanced geothermal technology opportunities using ACL globally.\n\nUnlike conventional geothermal projects, which use traditional steam turbines requiring high temperatures often found in concentrated locations limited by geological characteristics, ACL can potentially enable access to geothermal resources at a wider range of temperatures and geologies through the application of alternative technology above and below the surface.\n\n“Chevron and MOECO share a goal of delivering lower carbon energy solutions, while meeting the need for reliable, affordable energy,” said Barbara Harrison, vice president of Offsets & Emerging, Chevron New Energies. “This collaboration provides an opportunity for Chevron to combine its subsurface capabilities and technologies with MOECO’s intimate knowledge of Japan’s geothermal potential resource geology and its long history of responsible resource development. The joint team will have the opportunity to test emerging geothermal technology in a real world setting with significant scaling up potential.”\n\n“MOECO entered the geothermal business in 2012 and has been expanding its geothermal portfolio since then. In parallel with conventional geothermal, we have been studying ACL technology for many years and we believe this collaboration with Chevron utilizing ACL technology could unlock tremendous geothermal resources in Japan,” said Hirotaka Hamamoto, CEO of MOECO. “This joint collaboration with Chevron, who has been a valued partner of MOECO for several decades in the energy industry, is intended to open a new chapter in the geothermal industry as MOECO aims to continue contributing to an environmentally sustainable world as a member of the Mitsui & CO’s group companies.”\n\nEarlier this year, MOECO also entered a partnership with TEPCO Renewable Power Inc.

    "Not Just Japan! Three Stellar Asian Destinations Are Opening Up": "After two years of speculation, a few false starts and countless cancelled, speculative trips — Japan is reopening. This time, for real. Visitors from visa-waiver countries will be able to enter without hassle, and the days of booking a ticket and jetting off are pretty much back.\n\nThat’s the big headline, but there’s more.\n\nIn almost synchronized fashion, two other major destinations in the region followed suit, with plans to drop quarantine or open completely. Taiwan is reopening, and Hong Kong will finally diverge from the insane bureaucratic policies of China.\n\nAsia Heads Toward A Full Reopening\n\nYou simply can’t say that Asia has full reopened until China welcomes visitors, or ends its zero tolerance health strategy, but still — virtually all the rest of Asia has.\n\nWith news that Taiwan will open almost fully from October 13th and Japan will open restriction free travel from October 11th, there’s new excitement in the region. More flights are set to resume on top carriers including EVA, China Airlines (a Taipei based airline), ANA and Japan Airlines.\n\nMore tourism focused destinations in Asia, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore opened many months ago, but these final holdouts remained a mystery. Here’s what’s changing in the weeks to come, and how it will have a huge impact on destinations all over the region.\n\nTaiwan Is Dropping Most Restrictions\n\nFrom October 13th, Taiwan plans to relax entry restrictions, including dropping any quarantine period or arrival testing. The country was blossoming as a destination of diverse tourism opportunity in 2019, and looks to pick up where it left off.\n\nIf you venture that way, the Alishan forest is stunning and Chiayi is a foodie heaven. Further details on reopening plans and what’s needed to enter can be found here and here.\n\nJapan Readies For Tourism\n\nAfter initial plans left us with disappointing restrictions, such as packaged guided tours only, Japan is finally reopening in full.\n\nPeople who could enter with a visa on arrival, or visa program before can once again do so from October 11th. Proof of vaccination is still required to avoid any restrictions, but that’s about it!\n\nIt’s time to branch out beyond Tokyo and explore the delights of Osaka, and other fascinating cities which remain far too overlooked by most visitors.\n\nHong Kong Enters The Tourism Chat\n\nHong Kong is ending its mandatory quarantine period. That’s the good news. The bad news, is that post arrival testing and three days of “medical supervision” will still follow.\n\nThose and other factors mean GSTP will be giving this once beloved destination a pass for a while, until things change. After seeing countless horror stories from Penny Bay, the changes seem like an extremely positive development for residents and regional visitors, but perhaps still a long cry from “open” for international tourism.\n\nGreat News For Travel Savings\n\nWhether you’re flying to to Taiwan or Japan as your final destination, or not, this is big news. With few airlines operating regular schedules, great itineraries, or prices were very hard to come by. Seats using points were virtually non-existent.\n\nAs leading airlines based in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan seek to reboot international routes, there should be a significant dip in pricing followed by a significant opening of points seats. Plus, hotels should remain reasonable, with currencies such as the yen nearing all time lows.",

    "Japan’s $2-billion initiative to prep pandemic vaccines in 100 days": "A new centre will invest in shots for a range of infectious diseases so the country is ready for future outbreaks.\n\nA new Japanese research effort will work on vaccines for infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, monkeypox and dengue virus.Credit: Eugene Hoshiko/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAfter recognizing that Japan was slow to develop vaccines for COVID-19, the government has pledged to invest US$2 billion in a vaccine-research initiative to ensure that the country is ready to respond promptly to future epidemics.\n\nThe Strategic Center of Biomedical Advanced Vaccine Research and Development for Preparedness and Response (SCARDA) will initially invest in vaccine research for eight pathogens, including coronaviruses, monkeypox, dengue virus and Zika virus, using a range of technologies for vaccine delivery, such as mRNA technology, viral vectors and recombinant proteins.\n\nJapan has been “too slow to catch up” with the rest of the world in making COVID-19 vaccines, says Ken Ishii, a University of Tokyo vaccinologist who is also part of the central research centre selected by SCARDA. The country’s three most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates are still in late-stage clinical trials and none is approved for use.\n\nIn recognition of this delay, the Japanese government established SCARDA in March; the centre will launch formally in November, says Ishii. The government has realized that developing vaccines is complicated and takes resources, and has given the field a boost, says Toshihiro Horii, a vaccinologist at Osaka University. “That is a tremendously huge amount of money,” he says.\n\nThe initiative will bring together researchers from across Japan, says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Tokyo, and head of the SCARDA central research centre. “That is unique, at least for Japan.”\n\nHundred-day goal\n\nSCARDA’s aim will be to produce diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines ready for large-scale production within the first 100 days of a pathogen with pandemic potential being identified. This 100-day mission was first proposed by the United Kingdom in 2021, and backed by the other countries in the G7 group of wealthy nations. Similar initiatives include the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA); this coordinates the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics in response to public-health emergencies, including pandemics, and invested in several COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“Since SCARDA is a new organization, it has much to learn from BARDA” and other initiatives funding vaccines, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, says Michinari Hamaguchi, director-general of SCARDA.\n\nTwo of SCARDA’s first approved projects aim to develop universal coronavirus vaccines and vaccines against a group of coronaviruses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), such as SARS-CoV-2. Another project will create a fast-track system for evaluating vaccine candidates.\n\nJapan’s centre will operate with around 30 members of staff and funding to last 5 years. Of the allotted $2 billion, $1.2 billion will go to vaccine research and development projects, and $400 million will be used to support start-ups in drug development. Another $400 million will be spent on setting up a virtual network of centres of excellence for basic research in vaccine science, and testing vaccine candidates in early-stage trials. The goal is “to find seeds for future vaccines”, says Kawaoka.\n\nIn addition to the central research centre based in Tokyo, there will be four core institutes — Osaka University, Nagasaki University, Hokkaido University and Chiba University. Another five institutions will provide support services such as animal models.\n\nHorii, who leads several clinical trials for malaria and is not involved with SCARDA, says that the current bottleneck in vaccine development in Japan is the translation of research into clinical practice. SCARDA will have to move beyond basic science to develop expertise in taking vaccine candidates through clinical trials, he says. “We have many vaccinologists in Japan, but the majority of them are basic researchers.”",
    "Japan steps up yen ‘psychological warfare’ with calls to traders": "A fresh collapse in the Japanese yen halted on Wednesday after authorities cranked up their warnings over a drop in the currency and called traders to quiz them on market conditions.\n\nThe yen has plunged through a series of multi-decade lows against the surging dollar in recent months, but a surprisingly strong set of US inflation data on Tuesday prompted a fresh 2 per cent drop in the Japanese currency overnight, pushing the exchange rate as high as ¥144.95.\n\nIn response, officials at the Bank of Japan phoned currency traders to inquire about market conditions — a so-called “rate check” that represents a high level of alarm, pulling the rate back down to ¥143. In the past, such checks have come ahead of instructions from the Ministry of Finance to intervene directly in the market to control the exchange rate.\n\nShunichi Suzuki, Japan’s top currency official and former finance minister, said he was “very concerned” at apparently speculative moves in the yen, Japanese media reported, adding that authorities would not rule out any options in their response, including direct intervention.\n\nTraders still warned that without direct action from the finance ministry, a more aggressive test of the yen’s recent lows was still likely.\n\n“The psychological warfare [between Japanese authorities and market participants] is expected to continue for a while,” said Masamichi Adachi, chief economist at UBS. “There is a view that Japan is buying time” until the US central bank backs away from its interest rate rises, he added.\n\nThe BoJ declined to comment, while the finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn contrast to the US, where the Federal Reserve has this year been raising interest rates aggressively in an effort to pull down inflation, the Bank of Japan is resolute in its ultra-loose monetary stance. That gap has crushed the yen against a range of other major currencies.\n\nSome currency weakness is helpful to Japan, as it helps the country’s exporters. But it also bumps up the cost of commodity imports, and the speed of the decline is unsettling to businesses and investors. The yen has dropped by a fifth against the dollar this year.\n\nThe last time Japan intervened was in concert with other big economies in 2011, when the yen shot higher after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. But it has been more than two decades since authorities intervened to strengthen the currency following the Asian financial crisis and a collapse in Japan’s banking system.\n\nNext week the Fed, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are all expected to raise rates. Investors think the Fed’s rise could be as large as a full percentage point. This will keep up the pressure on the yen.\n\n“The Ministry of Finance is very concerned about next week so that could be when the actual intervention occurs,” said one market participant. “For now, today’s rate check is a form of verbal intervention,” he added.\n\nIt is not certain that even an official round of dollar selling by the BoJ would force the yen to change course; interventions tend to be most successful when they are joint efforts from a range of heavy-hitting monetary authorities around the world rather than unilateral moves. For now, the Fed and ECB are highly unlikely to pull back on their interest rate rising plans while they tackle a historic surge in inflation.\n\nNicholas Smith, CLSA Japan strategist, was among several prominent analysts who believe direct, unilateral intervention will serve little purpose.\n\n“I had assumed the Japanese authorities wouldn’t be stupid enough to let the world know its cannon’s loaded with cotton wool, but that’s politics,” Smith said.",
    "Japan’s Big Tourism Reopening": "Good morning from Skift. It’s Friday, September 23. Here’s what you need to know about the business of travel today.\n\nListen Now\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Overcast | Google Podcasts\n\nEpisode Notes\n\nTravel industry leaders gathered this week at Skift Global Forum in New York City to discuss significant topics and major trends in travel, and amid all the notable soundbites, Corporate Travel Editor Matthew Parsons reports on three big takeaways from this year’s event.\n\nOne of the takeaways Parsons cites came from Frederic Lalonde, the CEO of online travel agency Hopper. Lalonde said the key to building new products is being bold and experimenting, even if that means generating a loss. He said all of Hopper’s new products lose money but added the company is constantly trying to figure out what might work. Lalonde admitted he was stunned by Hopper’s success in selling loot boxes — treasure chests with a mystery gift — as part of a Puerto Rico promotion.\n\nAnother major takeaway from the forum was the call for tourism marketers to sell true images of destinations. Kenyan author and conservationist Dr. Mordecai Ogada blasted the travel industry for selling images of Africa from hundreds of years ago — themes he said are mostly based on Tarzan. Parsons also listed the importance of executives being approachable for all staff members as a major takeaway. Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said interacting with employees as much as possible is crucial in building trust with staff.\n\nWe turn next to major news from Japan. The country announced on Thursday it’s restoring visa-free entry for independent travelers from October 11, reports Asia Editor Peden Doma Bhutia.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida also said that Japan would lift the daily cap on arrivals on the same date. Those moves put an end to the two-and-a-half years of strict travel restrictions that severely limited the number of international travelers to Japan. However, foreign tourists would need to be fully vaccinated or test negative for Covid prior to arrival.\n\nAt the same time as the restrictions lift, the Japanese government will bring back its nationwide travel discount program to boost domestic tourism. The program was paused after a surge in Covid cases.\n\nFinally, hospitality company Ennismore is planning to expand its co-working spaces it calls “Working From” to all of its 14 hotel brands, reports Corporate Travel Editor Parsons in this Week’s Future of Work briefing.\n\nThe group’s Hoxton properties in London and Chicago are currently its only hotels to operate the co-working spaces. But founder and co-CEO Sharan Pasricha said at Skift Global Forum this week that Ennismore would expand Working From to other Ennismore hotels, which include Hyde and Mama Shelter. Pasricha described Working From, which he founded in 2019, as a “boomerang success,” citing the waiting list of 400 people wanting to join its London co-working space.",
    "Spain & Japan Sign a Memorandum of Cooperation for Tourism": "Spain has signed a new memorandum of understanding with Japan that will contribute to strengthening ties between the two countries and increasing bilateral tourism.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThrough a statement issued yesterday, September 22, the Ministry of Tourism of Spain emphasized that this agreement will allow the governments of both countries to share experiences and develop actions of common interest, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nCommenting on the move, the Secretary of State for Tourism, Fernando Valdés, said that Japan is a preferential market for Spain. In addition, Japanese tourists seek quality travel that has an impact on the entire value of the sector, which helps to deseasonalize and diversify the source of Japan’s markets.\n\n“He is a traveller who greatly appreciates our culture, heritage, and gastronomy, thus contributing to a rapprochement and better understanding between our two societies. On the road to normality after the COVID initiated by Japan, Spain wants to be on the front line to once again welcome Japanese tourists with open arms,” he pointed out in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the agreement was signed in the Japanese capital, Valdés, with the Commissioner of the Japan Tourism Agency (JTA), Koichi Wada.\n\nIn addition, the new agreement identifies as priority areas of mutual interest the cooperation in promotion and marketing strategies, as well as sustainable development, technology, and innovation.\n\nAt the same time, the agreement aims to identify smart tourist destinations, tourism development programs, air connectivity, and the promotion of public and private sector investments in tourism.\n\n“During the meeting, Valdés invited Commissioner Wada to the next edition of FITUR, in January 2023. The visit of the Secretary of State for Tourism to Tokyo, accompanied by the general director of Turespaña, Miguel Sanz, coincides with the celebration of Expo Japan, the largest tourism fair in the Far East and Japan, in which Turespaña participates with a 90a 90-meter pavilion squares structure emulates that of a cathedral and reproduces, with full-colour images, some of the main tourist attractions of our country,” the statement reads.\n\nThe Ministry has revealed that Japanese tourism represents a modest 0.8 per cent of the total quota of visitors that Spain received in 2019. Meanwhile, in 2021, it was the issuing country for Spain with the largest spending capacity, with an average spend of €3,000.\n\nIn addition, more than 680,000 Japanese women traveled to Spain in 2019, while the number of Spaniards who visited Japan reached 130,000.\n\nA recent Turespaña survey conducted between 2021 and 2022 has also shown that Spain ranks as the second European country that leaves Japanese tourists most satisfied after their trip, with a percentage reaching 67 per cent of respondents.",

    "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’": "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’\n\nScientists who drilled deeper into an undersea earthquake fault than ever before have found that the tectonic stress in Japan’s Nankai subduction zone is less than expected.\n\nThe results of the study led by the University of Washington and the University of Texas at Austin, published Sept. 5 in Geology, are a puzzle, since the fault produces a great earthquake almost every century and was thought to be building for another big one.\n\nAlthough the Nankai fault has been stuck for decades, the findings reveal that it is not yet showing major signs of pent-up tectonic stress. Authors say the result doesn’t alter the long-term outlook for the fault, which last ruptured in 1946, when it caused a tsunami that killed thousands, and is expected to do so again during the next 50 years.\n\nThe findings will help scientists home in on the link between tectonic forces and the earthquake cycle. This could potentially lead to better earthquake forecasts, both at Nankai and other megathrust faults, like the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Washington and Oregon.\n\n“Right now, we have no way of knowing if the big one for Cascadia — a magnitude-9 scale earthquake and tsunami — will happen this afternoon or 200 years from now,” said lead author Harold Tobin, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences and co-chief scientist on the drilling expedition. “But I have some optimism that with more and more direct observations like this one from Japan we can start to recognize when something anomalous is occurring and that the risk of an earthquake is heightened in a way that could help people prepare.\n\n“We learn how these faults work by studying them all over the world, and that knowledge will directly translate into insight into the Cascadia hazard as well.”\n\nMegathrust faults such as Nankai and Cascadia, and the tsunamis they generate, are among the most powerful and damaging on the globe. Scientists say they currently have no reliable way of knowing when and where the next big one will hit.\n\nThe hope is that by directly measuring the force felt between tectonic plates pushing on each other — tectonic stress — scientists can learn when a great earthquake is ready to happen.\n\n“This is the heart of the subduction zone, right above where the fault is locked, where the expectation was that the system should be storing energy between earthquakes,” said co-author Demian Saffer at University of Texas at Austin, who also co-led the scientific drilling expedition. “It changes the way we’re thinking about stress in these systems.”\n\nThe nature of tectonics means that the great earthquake faults are found in deep ocean, miles under the seafloor, making them incredibly challenging to measure directly. Tobin and Saffer’s drilling expedition is the closest scientists have come.\n\nTheir record-breaking feat took place in 2018 aboard a Japanese scientific drilling ship, the Chikyu, which drilled almost 2 miles, or just over 3 kilometers, into the tectonic plate before the borehole got too unstable to continue — 1 mile short of the fault.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers gathered invaluable data about subsurface conditions near the fault, including stress. To do that, they measured how much the borehole changed shape as the Earth squeezed it from the sides, then pumped water to see what it took to force its walls back out. That told them the direction and strength of horizontal stress felt by the plate pushing on the fault.\n\nContrary to predictions, the horizontal stress expected to have built up since the most recent great earthquake was close to zero, as if the system had already released its pent-up energy.\n\nThe researchers suggested several explanations: It could be that the fault simply needs less pent-up energy than thought to slip in a big earthquake, or that the stresses are lurking nearer to the fault than the drilling reached. Or it could be that the tectonic push will come suddenly in the coming years. Either way, the researchers said the drilling showed the need for further investigation and long-term monitoring of the fault.\n\n“Findings like this can seem like they muddy the picture, because things aren’t as simple as our theory or models predicted they were,” Tobin said. “But that just means we’re gaining more understanding of how the real world works, and the real world is messy and complicated.”\n\nThe research was funded by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, or JAMSTEC. Other co-authors are Takehiro Hirose at JAMSTEC and David Castillo at Insight GeoMechanics in Australia.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Tobin at htobin@uw.edu or Saffer at demian@ig.utexas.edu.\n\nAdapted from an article by the University of Texas at Austin.",

    "Mama, just killed a samurai! How Japan used Queen to liven up Romeo and Juliet": "In April 1975, Queen toured Japan for the first time. It was six months before the release of the band’s album A Night at the Opera and they were met by rapturous fans, reportedly in their thousands, at Haneda airport in Tokyo. Their arrival is still celebrated with an annual “Queen Day” in Japan.\n\nMore than four decades later, the band – and that album, including their signature tune Bohemian Rhapsody – have inspired an eccentric and ambitious theatrical production, A Night at the Kabuki, which sets their rock sounds against Japanese history and Shakespearean tragedy. First staged in Japan in 2019, the show arrives at Sadler’s Wells in London this month.\n\nThe second act jumps to the 20th century when Japanese troops in the Soviet Union were interned in Siberian labour camps\n\nIt is directed by Hideki Noda, who has written more than 50 plays and is also an actor and artistic director of Tokyo Metropolitan theatre, where we meet in a back office. A Night at the Kabuki boldly sets the old against the new; there are lavish period kimonos and samurai swords alongside selfie sticks, fashion magazines and a sea of balloons in a show with plenty of kitsch and comedy. There is glamour too from four actors who are national megastars: Takako Matsu is a pop singer who voiced Elsa in the Japanese version of Frozen; Takaya Kamikawa is a lead in CSI: Crime Scene Talks; Suzu Hirose is a young, award-winning film and TV actor classed as the most promising of her generation; while Jun Shison is a global brand ambassador for Gucci.\n\nQueen’s guitarist Brian May has spoken about the inherent theatricality of the album’s songs but Noda wasn’t so sure about the project when he was approached with the proposition. He was already working on another idea, exploring the aftermath of Romeo and Juliet, particularly on the play’s call for an end to war and enmity. After the dead lovers are found, “of course I think [the families] stop fighting”, says Noda, “but what happens in a week, a month, a year? If the issues between the two clans remain, they are not necessarily going to go away because these two lovers have died.”\n\nWildly imaginative … A Night at the Kabuki. Photograph: Kishin Shinoyama\n\nHe couldn’t at first find a way to combine this idea with Queen’s songs – until he went back and listened to the lyrics, thinking: “Maybe, by some miracle, I can use the album as part of this production.” He soon found echoes of love and war, not least in Bohemian Rhapsody: “I killed a man” is used in relation to Romeo’s fight with Tybalt. Queen’s song ’39 covers the idea of homecoming, which he took out of its science fiction context and applied to men’s return from war, and there was a bank of romantic songs too, such as Love of My Life, that were a good fit for the story.\n\nThe production uses every song from Queen’s album. The show’s sound designer, Marihiko Hara, speaks of how the score uses elements from that recording never heard before now, such as an instrumental version of Love of My Life. Hara has isolated certain aspects such as the synthesiser from The Prophet’s Song, May’s guitar solo from Death on Two Legs and drumming from ’39; these sounds, for Hara, resemble the screech of seagulls or skittering sounds of deer, and have been twinned with significant scenes in the play, or sometimes run alongside the dialogue.\n\nNoda’s play is set not in Verona but in 12th-century Japan, at the beginning of the samurai era, where the Houses of Montague and Capulet find a parallel in the warring Minamoto and Taira clans. A second act jumps in time to mark a dark chapter of 20th-century history when Japanese troops in the Soviet Union were interned to work in labour camps in Siberia as prisoners of war, and where a significant proportion died.\n\nThis aspect of the play contains great trauma and tragedy. For Noda it is a wartime reckoning that Japan is working through, often on the stage. “I was born in Nagasaki 10 years after the end of the second world war so I know about the aftermath. So many soldiers died [in Siberia] but those who came back to Japan didn’t want to say what happened to them. My father only talked [about his wartime experience] when he was drunk. Then, he would say his dead friends’ names – there were so many and I still remember them. They were not killed in battle but from either starvation [on the battlefield] or from diseases like malaria. We couldn’t talk about these things because we had lost the war – that’s very important. We couldn’t talk about our own tragedy, not even the atomic bombs. Only recently have we begun to talk.”\n\nA dark chapter … Takaya Kamikawa as Old Romeo. Photograph: Kishin Shinoyama\n\nThe production has a deliberate mutability of tone that takes the action from tragedy to slapstick, then back to conflict and death with reflections on time, love and unreliable memory. Noda himself plays Juliet’s nurse, Uba, wearing a bobbed white wig and a woman’s kimono (he repeatedly appears as gender-reversed characters in his plays). The comedy and satire undercut the central romance – the famous balcony scene, for example, becomes almost absurd with the young Juliet being advised: “Don’t throw yourself at him.” Romeo and Juliet only have a few days of love in Shakespeare’s play, the script reminds us, and in Noda’s production the pair even come back as older, wiser advisers trying to rescue their younger selves, 30 years on.\n\nThe play’s melange of influences is not surprising for a director with a history of formal hybridity – there were aspects of noh in The Diver and manga in The Bee, both staged at Soho theatre with Kathryn Hunter in the cast. His version of Much Ado About Nothing transposed the court to a sumo wrestling ring.\n\nA Night at the Kabuki incorporates some elements of kabuki, a tradition dating to the early 17th century. There is linguistic virtuosity including puns and a great sense of spectacle, with sumptuous period costumes, beautiful sets and a sea of movement. The show gives the illusion of a production even larger than its cast of 26.\n\nThere is subversion and bawdiness too, in keeping with the essence of kabuki, which arose as the antithesis of the sobriety and spirituality in noh theatre – historically the sole preserve of aristocratic audiences. Kabuki was originally performed by women with links to the sex trade and it was only when women were banned from performing that male actors took to playing the female parts. It is a highly stylised form of theatre, still immensely popular in Japan, and characteristically raucous, with song, dance, mime, adrenaline-fuelled fights and audience interaction. At contemporary theatre shows in Japan, spectators generally do not clap in the interval but the kabuki audience is encouraged to talk back at certain moments. Beginning at 11am, a kabuki show is performed over several hours or even an entire day, with actors speaking directly to viewers who in turn shout out names of the actors as they appear.\n\nSubversion and bawdiness … Suzu Hirose as Juliet of Minamoto and Jun Shison as Romeo of Taira. Photograph: Kishin Shinoyama\n\nIt is a little different now, in the aftermath of the Covid lockdowns (in Japan the closures were far shorter than UK theatre shutdowns). At Super Kabuki, a show I attend in the vast Shinbashi Enbujo theatre, there is no eating or shouting but we are encouraged to switch on the lights of our mobile phones and clap at key moments in the drama. The auditorium is enormous, seating 2,000 with a massive stage and a ramp called the flower road (hanamichi) through which the actors enter and exit wearing traditional kimonos, wigs and powdered faces. But these medieval-era characters – court nobles, samurai and commoners – share the stage with an AI actor on screen and a well-known virtual manga character called Miku Hatsune, who has a flame of blue hair and is masterfully spliced into the live action. It looks both like an ancient epic and a sophisticated video game in one. Technology is increasingly being twinned in this way, with collectives such as TeamLab giving kabuki’s old stories a new edge.\n\nNoda speaks of the imaginative potential of splicing and mixing influences, genres and forms. Culture is made from the creative “chaos” of combining different elements in theatre, he says. “Something new can be born in it.”",

    "Record number of young people in Japan rejecting marriage, survey shows": "A record proportion of men and women in Japan say they do not intend to marry, a trend experts have warned will undermine efforts to address the country’s population crisis.\n\nThe National Institute of Population and Social Security – a government-affiliated body in Tokyo – said the results of its 2021 survey, published this month, would add to concerns about the low birth rate.\n\nAccording to the survey, 17.3% of men and 14.6% of women aged between 18 and 34 said they had no intention of ever tying the knot – the highest figure since the questionnaire was first conducted in 1982.\n\nIn that survey, taken just before the rise of the bubble economy in the mid-1980s, just 2.3% of men and 4.1% of women said they would never marry.\n\nThe decline in marriages has had consequences for Japan’s birth rate as it faces the prospect of dramatic depopulation and a shrinking workforce and economy.\n\nExperts have attributed the trend to several factors, including a growing desire among young working women to enjoy the freedoms that come with being single and having a career.\n\nMen say they also enjoy being single, but also voice concern over job security and their ability to provide for a family. Experts have called on the government to make it easier for women to return to work after having children and to address Japan’s notoriously long working hours.\n\nAsked what constituted an “ideal” lifestyle for women, almost 40% of surveyed single men and 34% of single women cited the ability to balance a career with raising children. In a sign of shifting attitudes towards gender roles, less than 7% of men said they would like their future spouse to stay at home to look after the family.\n\nShigeki Matsuda, a sociology professor at Chukyo University in central Japan, said the declining marriage trend would adversely affect the birth rate.\n\n“The Japanese government has been working to increase the birth rate by trying to help those who wish to get married or have children fulfill their aspirations,” he told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.\n\n“But if the number of people who don’t want to marry continues to increase, the government will be forced to review its policies, and it could lead to a further decline in fertility.”\n\nThe number of babies born in Japan in 2021 fell by 29,231, or 3.5%, from the previous year to a record low of 811,604, the health ministry said in June.

The data prompted an intervention from Elon Musk, who warned that Japan would “cease to exist” unless it relaxed rules on immigration and did more to promote a healthier work-life balance.\n\nThe Tesla chief executive was criticised on social media for “overreacting” and singling out Japan, given that it is not the only developed economy experiencing long-term population decline.",
    "Italy Air Force chief heads to Japan to talk next-gen fighter jets": "ROME — The head of the Italian Air Force will travel to Japan next month to hold talks with his Japanese counterpart about collaboration on sixth-generation fighter technology.\n\nGeneral Luca Goretti said the visit would be a chance to explore what ambitions Rome and Tokyo share for next-generation fighters and what technologies can and cannot be shared by the nations.\n\n“In October I have been invited to Japan by the head of the Japanese air force to discuss common programs — it will be the opportunity to share our vision and common point of view,” said Goretti in an interview with Defense News.\n\nItaly partners with the U.K. on the Tempest fighter program while Japan is pursuing its F-X program to build a replacement for the Mitsubishi F-2.\n\nAt this summer’s Farnborough Airshow, the U.K. said it would undertake “joint concept analysis” with Japan and Italy on sixth-generation technology following the announcement of a flurry of deals between U.K. and Japanese firms on engines and sensors to get the ball rolling.\n\n“The Japanese could take technology from Tempest to insert in their F-X program. We will understand better when we realize what industry can do,” said Goretti.\n\nHe also suggested Japan might get on board with Tempest, stating, “If a partner like Japan enters a program it could be an opportunity to better understand each other’s reality.”\n\nAny cooperation would need to take into account Japan’s area of operations and how best to exchange technology, he said.\n\n“Our operational sphere is centered on the Mediterranean and on our alliances, which are NATO and Europe. That is our main focus,” he said.\n\nUsing the acronym FCAS to describe the Tempest program, he added, “The FCAS development phases will be conducted in order to avoid infringement on security of the NATO alliance because exchange of technologies will be performed strictly respecting every security aspect.”\n\nHe added, “NATO and Japan have different strategic areas of interest and experts are working on the operational concept and how to safely exchange information.”\n\nItaly committed to spending €220 million ($218 million) this year on Tempest work and forecasts spending €3.8 billion ($3.77 billion) by 2036.\n\nMeanwhile work by France, Spain and Germany on a separate sixth-generation program has been caught up in workshare rows between lead contractors Dassault and Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nGoretti predicted Tempest and the Franco-German project could yet merge.\n\n“These programs need a huge investment single nations cannot afford, so nations are trying to reduce costs. It happened with Tornado, and with Eurofighter and will happen again,” he said.\n\n“The French and Germans have gone one way, but we cannot have two platforms doing the same thing in Europe. It may not be economically sustainable. It is logical to say it is very probable that when the nations have defined their requirements, we will see a convergence into a single platform,” he said.\n\nTom Kington is the Italy correspondent for Defense News.",
