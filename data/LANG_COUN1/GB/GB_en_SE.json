    "Sweden proves it: The Left must change": "Sweden has got a new government, a bourgeois one but with the addition of the far-right Sweden Democrats.\n\nWhat does this mean for Sweden and perhaps even Europe’s future?\n\nThe most interesting issues for the Swedish voters in this election was gang violence, integration and, to some extent, electricity prices. There is no point hiding from the fact that the new right-wing alliance gave the most persuasive answers, which has in turn gotten them in power, to put it simply.\n\nSocio-cultural issues are more interesting than socio-economic ones and have given the Left very little space and success. The climate crisis has been turned into a background issue by politicians as much as by the media. Greta Thunberg’s perennial attention to politicians who postpone the problems to the future is proven true repeatedly.\n\nIt is not possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nThe techno-feudal situation with surveillance capitalism and how finance and capital have gone their separate ways and the old capitalism is about to be replaced by an even more remote and oligarchic order, no one even knows about and even less can choose to pay attention to.\n\nThe forecast is that people will continue to pay attention to what concerns the first level of human needs: safety and security, money that keeps flowing in, expenses that are not allowed to increase and passable highways free of sitting climate activists, because we want to get to work on time.\n\nIt is not possible to replace natural laws and, for example, believe that people whose children have been drawn into gang violence should first start thinking about what a post-capitalist world could mean. Nor is it possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nTen years of persistent grinding on the same strategy has been a disaster for the progressives in particular.\n\nCredibility, clarity and respect for people’s concerns are some human qualities that are always needed if you want others to listen to you – this also applies to grassroots democracy.\n\nThe question then is what DiEM25 could do in this crass political market where other parties in Sweden are increasing, where dissatisfaction is increasing and voter turnout is falling.\n\nThere is widespread dissatisfaction with people who see their petrol prices skyrocket because a few politicians believe that we must reduce fossil emissions.\n\nShake hands with them and say that we also think it is unfair and that we want the policy to compensate so that you are in the same boat when we have to help each other with the climate problem.\n\nThere is a hidden dissatisfaction with immigrants and the idea that they contribute to gang violence and shootings in the suburbs.\n\nShake hands with them and tell them we make no distinction when it comes to judging murderers. We can agree that everyone is equal before the law, while also admitting that certain communities need more help than others in order to be defended from a life of crime.\n\nNo progressive needs to lose their core values ​​if they want to approach our fellow unaffected citizens.\n\nToday, Swedish young people vote for Conservatives and the Sweden Democrats, the revolution is blue and if you want to use the momentum that has been built up, it is not time to withdraw and wait for another political wind.\n\nBeing progressive needs to be redefined. Several right-wing nationalist leaders in Europe welcome the Sweden Democrats’ success as a wave of nationalism that confirms themselves. A brave new progressive force may and must change this. A new progressive objective is necessary that can carve a new space for progressive politics among the Left’s old voting base as well as become a new attractive grass root magnet placing the current guardians of political status quo in the shadows.\n\nMats Sederholm\n\nCoordinator Stockholm Local Collective\n\nMember of DiEM25 Press Team\n\nWriter and active for Klimatalliansen\n\nEmail: mats@sederholm.nu\n\nDo you want to be informed of DiEM25's actions?

    "How The Local Sweden uses product thinking to remain \"useful\" to readers": "News organisations around the world are starting to pay attention to their readers’ needs and adopt a user-first model.\n\nThat is the case for The Local, a news outlet for English-speaking expats, published in nine European countries.\n\nIts Swedish edition uses reader surveys and audience data to create editorial products that its readers want and need.\n\nRead more: How BBC World Service engages younger audiences by fulfilling six reader needs\n\nSure, \"product thinking\" is a piece of jargon. What it really means, according to Paul O'Mahony, editorial product manager at The Local Sweden, is simply to make sure the publication is useful to its readers.\n\n\"Why do people buy products? It’s to fill a need or solve a problem in their lives,\" he said in a Journalism.co.uk podcast.\n\nThe \"product\" in product thinking can be anything, from a new article series to a podcast or a comic. The key to success is to provide your readers with valuable information they cannot find elsewhere.\n\nThe Local's membership is a good example, giving subscribers unlimited access to all nine editions. Throughout the pandemic, the news website has become a go-to source of coronavirus updates where authorities do not communicate in English a lot. Subscriptions have grown from 13k to 50k over the past two years.\n\nEditions from different countries collaborate all the time, swapping tips and stories, so individual publications can benefit from a much larger pool of audience data. One example of a successful new product launched in several countries is the \"Word of the day\" series that explains a local word to foreigners.\n\nAnother example is a monthly \"What changes\" article series where The Local Sweden informs foreign residents about upcoming changes in legislation or other areas of public life that could affect them. Originally created in France, the series was a hit with existing users and it also helped convert new readers into subscribers.\n\nProduct thinking is not limited to written articles. Podcast \"Sweden in focus\", created a year ago, answers listeners' needs with a solutions mindset. At a time when the right-wing populist parties are on the rise, O'Mahony is looking at projects that worked elsewhere and lessons we can learn from them.\n\nPodcasts are good for subscription conversions too; 65 per cent of listeners are paying members, of whom 60 per cent say the podcast makes them more likely to renew their membership. Among non-members, half say the podcast is making them consider signing up.\n\nRead more: 'Actionable user needs' make for more efficient newsrooms\n\nTo know whether a product is successful, The Local runs user surveys and makes changes based on readers’ feedback. The make-up of its team gives the publication a head start as most journalists are expats themselves and can use their experience to figure out what the readers may need.\n\nSurveys, on the other hand, tend to ask practical questions and often help journalists unearth new topics or angles they did not think about before.\n\n\"We had an email from a reader last week who said the cost of living made them reconsider their subscriptions. They are going to cut Netflix and a few other things but they said they will never cut The Local because that was their most important subscription. And that’s where we want to be in people’s lives.\"\n\nListen to the full Interview with Paul O'Mahony here.\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nIf you like our news and feature articles, you can sign up to receive our free daily (Mon-Fri) email newsletter (mobile friendly).",
    "From Scotland to Sweden: How smart cities are helping residents save energy": "The university town of Umeå, in northern Sweden, is almost completely dark in winter. Encouraging residents to take public transport on cold, gloomy mornings requires some persuasion, but the city is more insightful than most about the needs of the people living there.\n\nAfter decades of applying a gendered lens to its travel surveys, the city knows that if everyone travelled like women, it would already have reached its sustainable transport goal for 2050.\n\nA bus stop was built with individual wooden pods to help women feel safer in public spaces.\n\n“It started a big discussion in Umeå,” project manager Carina Aschan says of the Station of Being, which uses distinct sounds and coloured lights to announce incoming electric buses.\n\nWhen a glassy note sounds, those sheltering in the Station of Being's rotating wooden pods know the bus to the glass factory is pulling in. RISE Sweden\n\n“It was meant to be an energy solution but it became a social solution too, and sparked a wider discussion about Umeå being innovative, and whether a city should do that.”\n\nDozens of smart solutions have been launched under an EU-funded project called RUGGEDISED, aiming to decarbonise three cities and inspire many more. As it draws to a close after six years, the question of what our cities can do for us, energy wise, has become more urgent than ever.\n\nHere are some of the brightest findings from the ‘lighthouse’ cities of Umeå, Rotterdam and Glasgow.\n\nWhat are smart cities?\n\nSmart cities sound futuristic but are built on some simple ideas around digitising our transport, buildings and other infrastructure. One way of thinking about smart solutions is working better with what’s already there.\n\nIn Rotterdam’s Heart of South experimentation area, the warmth from sewage water (which reaches up to 19C) will be recouped via a heat exchanger and stored in the thermal grid. Close by, tubes have been laid underneath the pavement to extract its heat (the concrete hits 65C in summer). In winter, warm water instead of cold will be pumped through them to melt the icy walkway.\n\nThe pavement heat/cold collector at the Ahoy centre. City of Rotterdam\n\nThere’s nothing flashy about this innovation, hidden below ground and around the back of the city’s Ahoy convention centre.\n\nBut it’s about results, and Ahoy has been fossil free since 2019. A carpet of thousands of solar panels on its roof supply the colossal energy needed for huge light shows, like Eurovision 2021.\n\nRewiring Rotterdam into a smart city\n\n“My dream is to have the built environment connected to sustainable energy sources,” Katelien van den Berge, Rotterdam’s RUGGEDISED project manager, tells Euronews Green.\n\nThe Netherlands’ second city was razed by German bombers during the second world war, so its eclectic architecture has relatively recent roots.\n\n“We do have an advantage because we have quite spacious public space,” explains van den Berge, making it easier to weave smarter infrastructure below roads and into the fabric of the city.\n\n“Rebuilding Rotterdam after World War Two, we had an empty inner city, it was all flattened and they built a district heating system” she says. “The ownership changed and the sources changed, but the system was already there, so that makes it easier to expand it.” Around 11 thousand homes are already connected.\n\nRotterdam's smart thermal grid being installed below ground. A new cinema in the Heart of South district will also be connected once it's built. City of Rotterdam\n\nHow smart solutions reduce energy demand\n\nKnowing more about the way energy flows through our cities also enables us to be more efficient in our use of it. Umeå’s most impactful solution has been better management of demand, says Aschan.\n\nAn intelligent set of sensors were installed in its university buildings, collecting data on human presence, temperature, light and CO2 levels. A smarter heating and cooling system followed which has achieved a 23 per cent drop in energy use during peak times across the campus.\n\nThe city’s university borders its hospital, and RUGGEDISED has sparked conversations between the two. Instead of building a new wing, the hospital realised it can use some of the empty university facilities at night. It may seem simple but using what is already there in a smarter way is what is needed in most cases.\n\nSmarter ways to use energy at home\n\nWheatley tenant Liz used to get up at night to run her washing machine, when electricity was cheaper. Now the new tech is saving her money and time. Peter Mohan\n\nThe main place that many city dwellers desperately need to save energy this winter is at home.\n\nThat’s not equally true across the continent. In Sweden, tenants have a right to a heated home and there’s no phrase for ‘fuel poverty’ (or warm banks). In the UK - despite Prime Minister Truss freezing bills at an average of €2,890 a year - 7 million households are still on course to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on fuel.\n\nTo alleviate the burden on some of its poorest residents, Glasgow City Council has partnered with Wheatley, Scotland’s biggest social housing group. Through RUGGEDISED, new devices have been installed on tenants’ electric storage heating systems, giving them greater control over the temperature in their flats.\n\nPeople are using around 20 per cent less electricity as a result, explains Wheatley carbon reduction and sustainability manager Colin Reid.\n\n“It allows us to interact with households, it offers them for the first time the ability to control heating in their own home when previously they were just the receivers,” he says.\n\n“It’s a courtesy for people that they can see for themselves how their home is operating.”\n\nGlasgow’s smart street\n\nGlasgow City Council is now looking at even bigger renewable energy projects, from covering capped landfill sites in solar panels to digging a borehole by the SEC. Getty Images/ TomasSereda\n\nIt’s often said that people make Glasgow and ‘people make Glasgow greener’ has become another call to action.\n\n“It’s part of the character of the city,” says Reid. “It’s got its issues and has a legacy of industrialisation, but on the whole Glasgow is a warm place. People want community with each other, so that’s a real asset whenever embarking on a just transition.”\n\nRunning through the heart of the city - along a stretch of George Street and Duke Street - is Glasgow’s flagship solution: it’s smart street.\n\nHere the council has trialled a range of measures, including lighting triggered when people walk past, a new solar canopy on the car park roof to charge EVs plus power storage, and district heating.\n\nWhen the world’s leaders descend on your city for COP, decision makers tend to take more notice, says Gavin Slater, head of sustainability at Glasgow City Council. Yet, “the city is a fundamentally better place” because of its participation in RUGGEDISED, he says.\n\nGlasgow has made great progress towards its net-zero by 2030 goal, Slater revealed. Carbon emissions have already been slashed by 50 per cent since 2006.\n\nDigital twins: How far can modelling data help cities get greener?\n\nIn Brno, the Czech Republic’s RUGGEDISED ‘follower’ city, residents can use the data platforms to see what savings they can make from installing solar panels on their roof. Euronews Green\n\nData is quickly transforming how we see our homes and streets, from an energy-saving point of view. Where there used to be one data point a year - someone coming to check your gas and electric - our homes are now a hive of numbers, notes Dr Marcel van Oosterhout from the Erasmus Centre for Data Analytics.\n\nPublic concern over how this data is used is, understandably, slowing its potential. The risk comes from how detailed a picture can fall into the wrong hands. Data about energy usage could be combined with addresses, giving a pretty clear indication of when people are on holiday.\n\nBut representatives from all three cities spoke in glowing terms about what ‘digital twins’ can do for sustainable planning. These are smart 3D models of the city that combine with real time data about how it’s functioning, explains Roland van der Heijden, programme manager for Digital City Rotterdam.\n\nThey enable residents to be brought into the planning process too. At the site of a new square, people can scan a QR code to create and judge designs, then use augmented reality to see how they will look.\n\nGeneric, scalable, maintainable data sources are key, adds van der Heijden. And it’s here that the private sector may have a big role to play. Google is drawing on huge data reserves to build up its environmental insights explorer (EIE) tool, totting up transport emissions, air quality and tree canopies.\n\nAnna Williams, a solutions lead in the tech giant’s Geo team, insists that “helping cities lower their emissions is our north star.”\n\nWhat are the limits on smartening cities?\n\nRotterdam's Ahoy rooftop. But residents with solar panels at home are currently unable to sell their energy to neighbours during peak times in the Netherlands.. Euronews Green\n\n“There’s no cookie cutter copy” to building smart cities, says Adriaan Slob, an expert at the Dutch research organisation TNO which has helped the cities with their sustainable transitions.\n\nA major challenge is that these smart solutions have to be implemented in existing urban areas, with their own messy webs.\n\nIn the Heart of South, Katelien van den Berge’s team could not get their smart electric grid off the ground. Though there are all the elements of smart lighting, electric vehicles and charging points, the city didn’t get the experimental status it needed to connect them, and a key contract bid for by energy partner Eneco was granted elsewhere.\n\n“There was no coordination between tendering on a city scale and implementing on a project level,” reflects van den Berge. And with no overall owner, there was noone to take responsibility for the grid’s success. No matter in a city as restless as Rotterdam; the team are taking their learnings to a number of other big urban development areas.\n\nWhere ambition has overreached itself, RUGGEDISED still provides some striking blueprints. But it’s clear that smarter connectivity is needed at a higher, legislative level too.\n\nAs for the energy crisis overarching citizen’s lives - in Glasgow and Rotterdam at least - van den Berge believes “there can only be a way up. I think this winter will be the bottom, and then we will start working on how we are going to tackle it.”",
    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech? Jest nadzieja na to, że UE zacznie się zmieniać. Dzisiaj jest dzień takiej nadzieihttps://t.co/VFER1wme9V — wPolityce.pl (@wPolityce_pl) September 25, 2022\n\nMorawiecki’s predecessor as prime minister, Beata Szydło, who is now a PiS MEP, also tweeted congratulations to Meloni and FdI in Polish, English and Italian. Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski. Prawica wygrywa wybory we Włoszech! Kończy się nienormalność w UE. Kończą się powoli rządy manipulantów i szaleńców w KE.\n\n🇮🇹🇵🇱 — Michał Wójcik🇵🇱 (@mwojcik_) September 25, 2022\n\nFigures from Poland’s ruling camp had criticised von der Leyen in recent days for suggesting that the EU would use “tools” against Italy, as it had with Hungary and Poland, “if things go in a difficult direction”.\n\nAnother United Poland figure, MEP Patryk Jaki, also hailed “Italians [for] not allowing themselves to be blackmailed by the EU” and achieving “a great victory for the right”.\n\nThe Polish government’s response was, however, criticised by opposition MP Agnieszka Pomaska. “The elections in Italy are won by…the post-fascist Meloni, the pro-Russian [Matteo] Salvini and the discredited Berlusconi,” she tweeted. “And the United Right [Polish ruling coalition] crows with delight.”\n\n❌Wybory we Włoszech wygrywa prawicowa koalicja z postfaszystowską kandydatką na premiera Meloni, prorosyjskimi Salvinim i skompromitowanym Berlusconim. A Zjednoczona Prawica na czele z Kaczyńskim pieje z zachwytu. Jaka partia tacy sojusznicy. — Agnieszka Pomaska (@pomaska) September 25, 2022\n\nBoth PiS and FdI are part of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR), which seeks reform of the EU in the direction of a looser union of sovereign member states and opposes further integration.\n\nIn recent years, PiS has also sought to forge closer links with Salvini’s Lega party, as well as other right-wing and far-right forces in the EU, such as France’s Marine Le Pen.\n\nHowever, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: Santi_ABASCAL/Twitter",
    "The Guardian view on Sweden’s election: enter the radical right": "During an election campaign dominated by the themes of immigration, multiculturalism and violent crime, a spokesman for the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD) tweeted a picture of a metro train in the party’s colours, accompanied by the anti-migrant message: “Welcome aboard the repatriation express. Here’s a one-way ticket. Next stop, Kabul.” Its manifesto seeks to create one of Europe’s most hostile environments for non-Europeans and make asylum almost impossible to obtain. With its roots in the neo-Nazi movement, the SD caused an electoral earthquake this week by becoming the country’s second-largest party.\n\nThe election results leave a loose coalition of the SD and the three centre-right parties ahead by a majority of three in the parliament of 349 seats. The craven compliance of the Moderates, historically the largest of Sweden’s conservative parties, has let a party condemned as “neo-fascists” by the government and shunned for most of the past decade come this close to power. The SD is unlikely to be offered any ministerial posts, but will still be able to exercise considerable influence as the largest party in the electoral alliance. Denmark, Finland, Norway, and now Sweden, once seen as bastions of social democracy – albeit less so of racial equality – have all had, or have, governments either including or relying on populist, anti-immigrant parties.\n\nThere are also early signs that, from its new position of influence, the SD will pursue culture wars and pick fights with public service broadcasters over alleged elite bias against it. In a country historically admired for its consensual politics, further polarisation seems inevitable. It is shaping up to be quite an autumn for Europe’s radical right. In Italy, next Sunday’s election is expected to deliver power to a conservative coalition headed by Brothers of Italy, a party with neo-fascist roots. The SD’s victory brought tweeted acclaim from Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe likely leader of Sweden’s next government, the Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson, will not want Sweden to become a Scandinavian version of Hungary and Poland, where democratic checks and balances have been eroded and judicial independence undermined. If he did, the new administration’s tiny majority would quickly be at risk from its more liberal components. It is also true that under the brash leadership of Jimmie Åkesson, the SD has undergone a makeover, rebranding itself as a socially conservative, nationalist party and clamping down on overt extremism in its ranks. But that scarcely makes its new proximity to power any more palatable.\n\nFor the centre-right Moderates and the defeated Social Democrats (who topped the polls but could not command a majority), the SD’s seismic breakthrough poses awkward questions. Both parties have tacked heavily rightwards on immigration, hoping to see off the far-right threat – yet still shipped votes to the SD. Meanwhile, Mr Åkesson has succeeded in persuading many Swedes that the cost of absorbing asylum seekers has undermined a welfare state that has traditionally been a national badge of pride. Mr Åkesson’s ambition is, he says, for the SD to sit in government. That would be a gamechanger.\n\nIn the wake of the financial crash and the wave of refugees in the mid 2010s, this strategy of combining anti-immigrant sentiment with welfare nativism is allowing the radical right to make headway throughout Europe. Progressive politicians and parties need to find a better and more creative response than one of pale imitation.",
    "7 Fascinating Facts About Gothenburg, Sweden’s Second City": "As Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg has a rich cultural life but a more relaxed pace than ... [+] the capital city Stockholm. getty\n\nIn many ways Gothenburg could be considered the heart of Scandinavia. It’s Sweden’s second biggest city, has a 3.5-hour ferry connection to Denmark and is just a 2-hour drive from Norway.\n\nFrom its status as a global leader in sustainability to a fascinating history of trade and innovation, there’s a lot to discover about Gothenburg. Here are seven fascinating facts about this thriving Scandinavian city.\n\nThe city isn’t actually called Gothenburg\n\nIn Swedish the city is named Göteborg, roughly pronounced yaw-ta-bore(g). This surprises many international visitors as all other Swedish cities use the same name in both languages. To add to the confusion, many business in Gothenburg use the English version in their name.\n\nThe city council has changed its mind over the years about its own branding. In 2003, it was decided to promote the name Göteborg, a decision which was reversed just six years later. Now Gothenburg is the preferred choice for all international communications.\n\nIt’s the fifth largest city in the Nordic region\n\nWhile Gothenburg plays second fiddle to Stockholm in Sweden, it’s a big player in the context of the wider Nordic region.\n\nGothenburg is the fifth largest city in the Nordic region. Getty\n\nWith almost 600,000 people living in the city and about 1.1 million people in the wider urban area, Gothenburg is the biggest Nordic city that’s not the capital of its country. It’s also significantly bigger than Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.\n\nGothenburg was built by the Dutch\n\nAlthough people have lived in the area for thousands of years, the city of today was founded in 1621 by the King of Sweden. However, the city’s early success relied on construction expertise from the Netherlands.\n\nBased on the Dutch experience of building on marshlands and constructing canals, the planning of Gothenburg’s streets and necessary canals followed that of Amsterdam and Dutch colonies of the time, particularly Batavia (now Jakarta).\n\nThe city is a leader in innovative transport\n\nIn 1927, the first Volvo car rolled off the production line in Gothenburg. Since then, Volvo went on to become a global leader in people-first and safety-first design.\n\nThe Volvo Museum exhibits products from the whole Volvo range, including cars, trucks and buses. getty\n\nWhile Volvo Cars was sold to Ford in 1999, Gothenburg remains the headquarters of the Volvo Group that continues to manufacture trucks and buses including new 44-ton electric trucks. The city’s Volvo Visitor Center and Volvo Museum tell the story.\n\nToday, Gothenburg is writing a new chapter in its transport story. Leading electric aircraft developer Heart Aerospace has chosen Gothenburg as its base to create the so-called Northern Runway, a campus of production and flight test facilities.\n\nGotheburg is twinned with Chicago\n\nOf Chicago’s 28 sister cities, Gothenburg is the only one in the Nordic region. Launched in 1960, the sister cities program works on collaborations in the areas of cultural arts and tourism, global education, government relations and international business.\n\nGothenburg is a sustainability leader\n\nA committment to sustainability is a thread that runs through every aspect of life in Gothenburg, from business to tourism. In 2021, Lonely Planet recognized Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable city break, while the Global Destination Sustainability Index ranked Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable destination five years in a row.\n\nGothenburg was the first city in the world to issue green bonds to stimulate investment in solutions to climate change. Almost all the city’s hotels are eco-certified and plans to develop a zero-emissions transport zone in the downtown district are well underway.\n\nThe city’s archipelago is vast\n\nAbout 5,000 people live on Gothenburg’s southern archipalego, but that number rises to more than 10,000 during the summer months.\n\nBoats and bicycles are the primary form of transport in Gothenburg’s southern archipelago. getty\n\nMany Swedes own vacation cottages and spend several weeks on one of the islands, while many more spend weekends there throughout the year.\n\nIn keeping with the city’s sustainability focus, the southern archipelago is entirely car-free. Ferries connect people with the mainland, while bicycles and delivery mopeds are used on the islands.\n\nWhile the islands are forward-thinking, they are also steeped in history. Mentioned in Norse sagas as ‘the river islets’, the southern islands appear to have been used as a location for fairs and duels in the Viking Age.\n\nThe northern archipelago shares much in common with its southern sibling, but has bigger islands and communities accessible by car via the car ferries from Lilla Varholmen. The weekend ferry to Hönö Klåva from downtown Gothenburg is especially popular.",
    "Sweden mulls the cost to save communities from rising sea": "The low-lying farmland around the Swedish village of Skanör is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nSKANÖR, Sweden — On January 4, 2017, a day of clear skies and light winds on Sweden’s far southwestern Falsterbonäset peninsula, the flood warning went out.\n\nRescue services scrambled to help motorists trapped on local roads after unusual winds offshore sent sea water surging toward the villages of Skanör, Ljunghusen and Höllviken.\n\nOne isolated cottage was partially submerged.\n\nBy around 8 p.m., the water was already receding, and while the villagers could breathe a sigh of relief, officials in the municipal offices the in nearby town of Vellinge were realizing that a bullet had just been dodged.\n\n“If there had been a strong onshore wind that day, it could have been a catastrophe,” said Carina Wutzler, mayor of Vellinge Municipality. “We would have seen a lot more damage.”\n\nThe pressing question for lawmakers in such areas across Europe and beyond is what should be saved and how, and at what cost to public budgets and the natural environment, from catastrophic events that are due to become more frequent as the global climate heats up.\n\n“I still get people saying that flooding is not going to happen, and I say to them it is already happening,” Wutzler said. “We need protection now, this is not something for 50 years’ time.”\n\nThe Falsterbonäset peninsula, which is covered by the Vellinge administration, is an affluent mix of high-end summer homes and commuter belt luxury living. It is one of 18 coastal spots on a Swedish government list of areas at risk of flooding as the climate warms, polar ice melts, sea levels rise and storms intensify.\n\nArguably the most vulnerable place on that list, the peninsula is a prime example of the type of low-lying European coastline, inhabited in many cases for centuries, which now suddenly faces an uncertain future.\n\nClimatologists and oceanographers are warning local lawmakers in exposed villages from Fairbourne in Wales to Germany's Halligen islands that new and potentially expensive challenges lie ahead as coastal flooding becomes more common and more damaging. Around half of the peninsula’s 8,800 homes stand on land less than 3 meters above sea level.\n\nEven under the very lowest scenarios for global greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2100, scientists expect sea level to rise between 28 and 55 centimeters. Under the highest emissions scenario, seas could rise by more than a meter. And projections from the European Environment Agency suggest that flooding events that currently come once a century to Skanör will occur six times more frequently by the end of the century.\n\nHard choices\n\nEuropean lawmakers aiming to hold back the sea generally look to the Netherlands, long the Continent’s gold standard in flood management.\n\nWith much of its territory below sea level, the country has already deployed a 3,700km string of flood defenses ranging from natural features like sand dunes to imposing feats of engineering like storm surge barriers.\n\nExperts say that as sea levels rise, a wider range of European leaders must now address similar challenges. But first, there's a more fundamental question: Should anything be done at all?\n\nIn Falsterbonäset, environmentalists had long pushed for little or no response to the rising flood threat, arguing that the area’s coastal meadows and beaches, home to many plants and animals, depended on their interaction with the sea for their existence.\n\nThe council for the county of Skåne, which includes Vellinge municipality, was also among those pushing back against building barriers through sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n\nSand dunes protecting the Swedish village of Skanör from the sea are expected to be breached more regularly over coming years | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\n“One of the big challenges, as the county council sees it, is finding space [for the barrier] without unacceptable intrusions into protected areas,” Maria Nitare, a water management official with the county council, said during a visit to Falsterbonäset.\n\nBut in 2014, Vellinge municipality decided to take a stand and began consultations for a plan to build a 20km long barrier of embankments, walls and dunes round the built-up parts of Falsterbonäset. The planned barrier was to be 3 meters high, relative to sea level.\n\nThe application was submitted in 2018 after discussions with a wide range of interested parties from local residents and business owners to oceanographers and climatologists.\n\nThe proposal was initially approved by planning authorities, but then, in a sign of what could be waiting for other Swedish municipalities facing the threat of flooding, the process stalled. There were objections from some that the barriers went too far and from others that they didn’t go far enough.\n\nOne particularly vocal group were local golf course owners, who have found to their consternation that they won’t be protected by the municipality's barriers.\n\nFalsterbonäset is home to several golf courses and is something of a national center for the sport. Visited on a recent weekday, the course in Ljunghusen was hosting a tournament for pairs of brothers to play against each other.\n\nClub manager Magnus Jivén described how in 2017, he watched in dismay as the sea crept closer to the front door of the clubhouse. To his relief, the building wasn’t flooded.\n\n“If you look at the Netherlands, they would build barriers out in the sea, but here the golf courses and the beaches aren’t being protected,” he said. “These places are some of the main reasons why people live here, so why not protect them as well as the houses.”\n\nOther objections have come from local residents who say the proposed embankments and walls will block their view of the sea as well as impinging on their privacy as people walking on the new embankments will be able to see into nearby gardens and houses.\n\n“The barrier is going to be right outside my fence,” Yvonne Lendrup, a Ljunghusen resident who has objected to the municipality plan, told national broadcaster SVT recently. “We’d really like to avoid this happening.”\n\nLjunghusen is seen as one of the most desirable places to live in Sweden. One house there recently sold for more than €5 million and on a recent weekday, two red Ferrari sports cars navigated the area’s narrow roads in quick succession.\n\nIn the early days of its flood barrier project in 2015, Vellinge Municipality estimated combined property values in Falsterbonästet at more than €5 billion and officials said prices have risen sharply since then.\n\nThe municipal council judged that if it did not provide a credible plan to protect the area over the coming decades, then residents and businesses could be expected to pull out as insurance premiums rocket and the risk of inundation intesifies.\n\nThe cost of the new flood defenses is expected to be around €19 million. Vellinge has applied to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency for funding as well as to the EU via its Life program, but has said it will cover any shortfall through its own budget.\n\nTest case\n\nFor the other 17 Swedish sites judged by the government as at risk of flooding — including parts of the capital Stockholm and second city Gothenburg, as well as smaller towns like Kristianstad — Vellinge is proving an interesting test case serving to highlight gaps in the national response to the threat of climate change.\n\nAs Vellinge worked to develop its plans for flood barriers, mayor Wutzler said she had seen “surprisingly little interest” from ministers and other parliamentarians in the capital Stockholm and called on them to engage more closely with coastal communities facing existential threats from higher seas.\n\nA first report from a government-appointed expert group said Sweden’s response to climate change must be integrated more closely with other elements of the nation’s civil defense.\n\n“We must shift the focus from problems to solutions and from planning to implementation,” the report published in February said. “The efforts that have been made so far have not been able to create the necessary changes in society.”\n\nEnvironmentalists worry that building flood barriers through coastal meadows around Sweden's Falsterbonäset peninsula will damage important habitats | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nIn June this year, the Swedish court of appeal responsible for environmental and land management ruled that construction of the barriers around Falsterbonäset could begin.\n\nWutzler said it was a relief and that construction of the first section of the barriers north of Skanör would begin within a year.\n\n“We are developing a solution so that we have an answer when we look ahead. Because when we look ahead, we see that the threat from flooding is only going to get worse,” she said.\n\nKarl Mathiesen contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of the Climate, Changed series.",
    "I don’t recognize Sweden anymore": "Jim Stenman is a Swedish-Ethiopian journalist. He has worked as a producer for CNN International in Europe and the Gulf, and reported for Reuters and the BBC World Service.\n\nAs Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson arrived in my childhood hometown of Eskilstuna recently, even she must have realized that Sweden was losing its war on gang violence.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the city had finally earned its title of “Little Chicago” — a term casually used during my teenage years, especially when describing rougher parts of town.\n\nThough I never took the analogy seriously, that day, one of those areas became the scene of sheer horror, when a woman and a young child were shot at a playground. Police have since linked the incident to gang crime, and thankfully, it didn’t result in any fatalities — both survived.\n\nWhile addressing the shooting, Sweden’s first female leader, who has been in office for less than a year, warned that criminal gangs now pose a threat for “anyone who happens to come in their way, even normal law-abiding citizens.” And she made a direct correlation between violence and a rise in the drug trade, which she vowed to have a national conversation about, and to crack down on crime by abandoning Sweden’s soft penal code.\n\nFor Andersson, talking tough on crime may be a necessity rather than a choice. Her center-left coalition government risks being voted out of office in the country’s general election tomorrow, as the vote takes place against a backdrop of a rising inflation and mounting fears over Russian aggression in the Baltic Sea.\n\nMany Swedes, as I do, feel the country’s heading in the wrong direction.\n\nA few months ago, three young men in neighboring Örebro were shot dead over the span of eight days, part of a wave of gang violence spreading across Sweden. And while I never expected the country to turn into a gangster’s paradise, it’s always been obvious to me that our approach to integration has been a ticking time bomb.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, I witnessed firsthand just how difficult it can be to become part of mainstream Swedish society. My mother, an Ethiopian refugee, certainly ticked all the “right” boxes, such as marrying a local and accepting whatever jobs came her way.\n\nStill, she was never fully accepted as Swedish, despite having a near perfect command of the language and being clearly embedded within the culture.\n\nIt seemed to me that people like her faced an element of otherness that was difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Moreover, many of my friends, some of whom were born to parents from the Middle East, chose not to identity as Swedish, despite being raised in the country.\n\nSweden, which had a largely homogenous population in the past, has faced serious challenges in welcoming non-European immigrants into its society. And I believe this may partly explain the difficult situation facing the country today.\n\nSweden experienced labor-based immigration in the late 1960s. And government data shows significant migrant arrivals from Iran in the late 1980s and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Immigration numbers then reached an all-time high in 2016, as the country, alongside Germany, opted for a largely open-border policy when it came to Syrian refugees.\n\nAs of 2021, Sweden had over 196,000 Syrian-born residents — a significant number for a country with a population of about 10 million. The total number of foreign-born people has rapidly increased over the last two decades, now amounting to 20 percent of the overall population. And though Syrians make up the largest group of immigrants, those born in Iraq and Finland also contribute to Sweden’s foreign-born population.\n\nPersonally, I don’t buy into the extreme belief held by some Swedes that immigrants largely come to our country to exploit its generous welfare system. But according to the European Commission, as things stand, the unemployment rate among foreign-born residents is more than four times that of native Swedes. It only stands to reason this breeds exclusion.\n\nAnd it’s perhaps not surprising that 2022 is on track to become the worst year on record for violence, with nearly 50 deadly shootings so far — a reality that’s proving a major headache for Andersson’s center-left coalition government, which has been in power since 2014. And her own Social Democratic party has overseen years, if not decades, of failed integration policy under previous prime ministers.\n\nOffering sanctuary to those fleeing war is always the right thing to do, but Sweden’s experiment with multiculturalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse since 2016.\n\nI’m not suggesting Syrians, or any other migrant group, should be held responsible for the rise in gang crime. It’s particularly worth highlighting that the Swedish integration model was failing long before their arrival, even causing some naturalized Swedes, including others with Middle Eastern roots, to support the far right in bid to limit further immigration.\n\nBut now, the country’s second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, is on a mission to restore what they perceive to be “traditional Swedish values.” Historically locked out of power due to other parties’ unwillingness to partner with them, they are projected to secure about 20 percent of the votes tomorrow, and they may be on track to play a key role in a possible center-right coalition that could end up ruling the country for the next four years.\n\nThis would mark their first time in government, and it would certainly prove a game-changer for the country. The party’s priorities include ending segregated neighborhoods, curbing organized crime and limiting immigration.\n\nThough I may morally disagree with closing our borders to those in need, perhaps it’s the best way to recalibrate — at least temporarily — after decades of failed policies.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to turn back the clock on immigration, Sweden must find a way to solve its integration problem before it’s too late. And the only way to achieve this is by recognizing present-day Sweden for what it really is — a multicultural society.\n\nWhile the far right is effectively pitching to make “Sweden Great Again,” I’m convinced we need to forge a more inclusive national identity that recognizes the demographic changes of recent decades, while also embracing the unique dual heritages now present throughout our country.\n\nIt is only by recognizing who we are that it’s possible to create a society that doesn’t breed exclusion or worse, crime.",

    "Sweden votes in election amid fears of far-right role in government": "Swedes are voting in an election pitting the incumbent centre-left Social Democrats against a rightwing bloc that has embraced the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats in an attempt to win back power after eight years in opposition.\n\nWith steadily growing numbers of shootings unnerving voters, parties have vied to be the toughest on gang crime, while surging inflation and the energy crisis in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have increasingly taken centre stage.\n\nLaw and order is home turf for the right, but gathering economic storm clouds may boost the Social Democratic prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, seen as a safe pair of hands and more popular than her party.\n\n“My clear message is: during the pandemic we supported Swedish companies and households. I will act in the exact same way again if I get your renewed confidence,” she said in one of the final debates before Sunday’s vote.\n\nAndersson was the finance minister for many years before becoming Sweden’s first female prime minister a year ago. Her main rival is the Moderates’ leader, Ulf Kristersson, who sees himself as the only person who can unite the right and unseat her.\n\nKristersson has spent years deepening ties with the Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigration party with white supremacists among its founders. Initially shunned by all the other parties, the Sweden Democrats are now increasingly part of the mainstream right.\n\n“We will prioritise law and order, making it profitable to work and build new climate-smart nuclear power,” Kristersson said in a video posted by his party. “Simply put, we want to sort Sweden out.”\n\nPolling stations opened at 8am local time and close at 8pm, with final results due around midnight.\n\nOpinion polls show the centre-left running neck and neck with the rightwing bloc, where the Sweden Democrats look to have recently overtaken the Moderates as the second biggest party behind the Social Democrats.\n\nFor many centre-left voters – and even some on the right – the prospect of Jimmie Åkesson’s Sweden Democrats having a say on government policy or joining the cabinet remains deeply unsettling, and the election is seen in part as a referendum on whether to give them that power.\n\nKristersson wants to form a government with the small Christian Democrats and, possibly, the Liberals, and only rely on Sweden Democrat support in parliament. But those are assurances the centre-left do not take at face value.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "‘People don’t want to hear about it’: how the pandemic shaped Sweden’s politics": "In the Stockholm neighbourhood of Tensta, the pandemic has left many feeling hopeless and disenfranchised, says Fatuma Mohamed.\n\nWhile much of Sweden – including politicians – appear to have forgotten all about Covid, the health communicator and longtime resident said that many in the area are still grappling with its impact.\n\nAlthough people had been advised by authorities to work from home, many in Tensta, with its high refugee population, had no choice but to go out because of the nature of their jobs.\n\n“They didn’t have any possibility to stay at home,” said Mohamed, sitting outside Tensta Konsthall, a contemporary arts centre, where people were arriving for a coffee meet-up.\n\nTwo and a half years after the introduction of the “Swedish strategy”– the Scandinavian country’s divergent pandemic response, which kept schools open and eschewed lockdowns – the results are mixed.\n\nMental health and children’s learning appear to have been less affected than they might have been, although 2.57m infections were recorded in the population of just over 10 million and in excess of 19,900 died, with stark inequality exposed in the process.\n\nIn comparison, Norway, with a little over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.46m cases and nearly 4,000 deaths; while Finland, also with just over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.27m cases and nearly 5,700 deaths.\n\nFatuma Mohamed in Tensta, Stockholm. Photograph: Miranda Bryant/The Observer\n\nAn independent commission into the handling of the pandemic, the findings of which were published earlier this year, found that while the choice of path for disease prevention and control was “fundamentally correct”, the measures “were too few and should have come sooner”. The government, it said, should have taken control of all aspects of crisis management from the start and had relied too heavily on its public health agency, Folkhälsomyndigheten.\n\nAnd yet, as Sweden prepares to go to the polls on 11 September, in the first election since these life or death decisions were made, it is almost as if Covid never happened. Left- and right-leaning party leaders, who are in a tight race, are focusing on crime, immigration and energy prices but not Covid.\n\nFor many, this has highlighted the gulf between the living conditions of Sweden’s different communities. In Tensta, some groups of up to 10 people live in two-room flats, said Mohamed, 43, who has three daughters,\n\n“But the ‘Swedish’,” she said, miming inverted commas with her hands, “they live, maybe two or three people in eight, seven or four rooms, maybe. So they had the opportunity to have social distance.\n\n“It is not just a health problem,” she added. “This is a political problem.” Services such as banks, dentists and job centres had vanished from the area, she claimed, and many people were unemployed, splitting society into “parallel communities”.\n\n“It’s not good to have different lives in the same country. We are all the same people, we are all Swedish citizens, so we should have the same opportunity.”\n\nExperiences of the pandemic have deepened distrust of government and social services, she said. Mohamed isn’t sure how this will affect people’s votes in the election, but the rightwing anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats have become the second biggest party in the polls after Magdalena Andersson’s incumbent Social Democrats. The left, centre and green parties are saying the right things, Mohamed said, but she will be watching to see whether their words are turned into action.\n\nJimmie Åkesson (third from right), Sweden Democrats leader, visiting Linköping in April after riots sparked by a far-right threat to burn the Qur’an. Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/Shutterstock\n\n“I don’t think the people who live in this area have any trust for any party because we don’t have a good life,” she said. “Definitely, they don’t like to vote Sweden Democrats but, for the other parties, interest is not high because they think it’s the same: ‘If I vote or not vote, the result will be the same.’ Most don’t have jobs, we live cramped, we don’t have the same opportunities.”\n\nAnother Tensta resident, Liban Warsame, whose 19-year-old son was murdered in December 2020, said most people in the area felt left out of Swedish society, and that the pandemic had had a huge impact on the community. “Many older people from Somalia died because of the pandemic. In the election, we’re going to vote and we’re going to take our responsibility,” he said.\n\nHealth experts say they are disappointed by the lack of attention the pandemic is receiving and fear that lessons will not be learned from the vulnerabilities it exposed in Swedish society, especially its impact on immigrants and the elderly. Göran Stiernstedt, a member of Sweden’s coronavirus commission and associate professor of infectious disease at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute, said: “It really exposed that the risk for people born outside Europe was much greater than those born in Sweden.” The impact on the elderly was also severe, he added, including lack of medical care in nursing homes and staff left alone with no doctors.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Claudio Bresciani/Getty Images\n\n“It’s not only a problem in the pandemic, it’s a problem also in daily life,” he said. Nothing had been done to fix the issue, he felt, despite investigations. “You could expect that this would have been a great thing now in the election, but you don’t hear a single word about that.”\n\nThe fact that the Corona Commission’s report was published the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not help it gain momentum, but Stiernstedt believes there is also a psychological explanation for the silence on Covid’s impact. “People don’t want to hear about it. They want to live their normal life. And when you walk today, it’s like 2019, actually, and that’s natural. I think it’s related to human nature.”\n\nWhile Emma Frans, a researcher and epidemiologist at Karolinska Institute, is surprised by the silence around Covid in the election, she\n\nsaid: “People have had thoughts about how do we look at our elderly. And also maybe understanding how this type of health crisis affects people differently depending on who they are, their position in society and what means they have.”\n\nThe pandemic had also highlighted “outdated” perceptions of what a “traditional Swedish home” looked like, she said. “And there were problems with not getting information out to people who are not speaking or reading in Swedish.”\n\nThrough the public health agency, which was responsible for responding to the pandemic, politicians had had a “free pass” when it came to Covid deaths, said Frans. The government “hid” behind Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s former state epidemiologist, she added.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an influential independent MP. Photograph: Getty\n\nAt the Stockholm HQ of Folkhälsomyndigheten, Karin Tegmark Wisell, who became its head last November, stands by most of the major decisions made during the pandemic – including keeping schools open and not making face masks mandatory. But, she said, Covid had highlighted ongoing health inequalities, especially among immigrants, more of whom ended up in intensive care.\n\nThese problems, she said, could not be solved by a public health agency alone and needed government intervention; she said she would like to see the matter addressed more in the election. “From my perspective, that is the most important issue,” she said.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an independent politician who has played a pivotal role in the power balance of the current government, said parties weren’t criticising the pandemic response because they were part of the decision-making process. “Each of them had opportunity to say something, to do something – that is why it is passed, even if it is not over. But on class, society and employment, a lot of people still don’t feel good psychologically.”",

    "Sweden and the revolt against the evasive elites": "So now we know: nowhere is immune to the populist surge. Not even Sweden. Not even every European liberals’ favourite welfarist state. Once considered the happy country of Europe, an oasis of technocratic calm in an often unpredictable continent, now even Sweden has been rattled by populism. In last week’s election the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing nationalist party, emerged as the second largest party in parliament. And this has shaken not only the political class in Stockholm but liberal elites around the world. It’s a ‘dramatic shift’, says the New York Times. ‘Astonishing’, says Deutsche Welle. An ‘earthquake’, insist leftist observers. They sound like the troops of an embattled army watching their last patch of territory be conquered by the enemy.\n\nThe feeling that Sweden has fallen – and that its falling represents a blow to correct-thinking people everywhere – is palpable. We all looked upon Sweden as the ‘bedrock of Nordic liberalism’, say two writers for the NYT. And that makes its ‘move toward the more populist right’ seem especially ‘shocking’. It’s one thing for eccentric Britain to succumb to the populist bug, with our vote for Brexit, and for the crazy United States to take a temporary punt on Trump. But Sweden? That social-democratic paradise Guardian columnists dream of retiring to? Many will be asking ‘How did this happen?’, says a startled-sounding Deutsche Welle. How on earth, in this Northern European ‘bastion of tolerance’, did a ‘nationalist party’ find itself surging in the polls? The alarm of the elites is striking. And telling. They seem to be clocking, finally, that their cultural and political values are not safe anywhere. Not even in Sweden. The election results were indeed remarkable. The Sweden Democrats, a party notable for its anti-immigration and anti-Islam stances, stormed into second place. They won 20.5 per cent of the vote. Not bad for a party that only made its debut in the Riksdag – the Swedish parliament – in 2010, when it won six per cent of the vote. That rose to 13 per cent in the 2014 election and 18 per cent in the 2018 election. Now, in terms of seats in parliament, the Sweden Democrats are second only to the Social Democrats, the party that has governed Sweden for most of the past century. Imagine the EDL nipping at the heels of a Labour government in the UK.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats were part of a right-wing bloc that won the election, if narrowly. The Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat and resigned. Ulf Kristersson of the centre-right Moderate party (which won 19.1 per cent of the vote) is now the prime minister in waiting and must stitch together a government. Whether that government will include the Sweden Democrats, or whether they’ll just agitate from the backbenches, remains to be seen. For years there has been a pact in the Swedish establishment never to engage with the Sweden Democrats. That is how significant the election result is. That is why it feels like an ‘earthquake’. Because a party that was treated as a political untouchable, as so vile that a cordon sanitaire had to be put around it, is now the second-largest in parliament, with a remarkable 73 seats. No wonder the managerial elites everywhere from New York to Berlin to Stockholm are reeling. The Sweden Democrats do indeed have disturbing origins. They have their roots in neo-Nazi movements of the 1980s, rallying under the slogan Keep Sweden Swedish. But they’ve changed a great deal. Under the leadership of Jimmie Akesson, just 26 years old when he took over the party in 2005, the Sweden Democrats moved away from their ‘far-right roots’ and took a ‘more populist direction’. And they made huge inroads with certain sections of the electorate. Not the middle classes in Stockholm, of course – strikingly, they had a poor showing in the capital – but rather among what one journalist rather sniffily refers to as ‘undereducated people’ who think the ‘Social Democrats are not representing their interests anymore’. Class and education are strong predictors of who’s likely to vote for the Sweden Democrats. As a Swedish social scientist points out, ‘Voters with university degrees are strongly unrepresented among [Sweden Democrats] voters’. A poll in 2022 found that sympathy for the Sweden Democrats was far higher among blue-collar workers than white-collar workers. So 24.5 per cent of unskilled blue-collar workers expressed a preference for the party, compared with just 8.3 per cent of high-level white-collar workers.\n\nThis echoes the populist moment elsewhere in Europe, and in the US too, where education is very often a key dividing line in electoral behaviour. People who have never darkened the door of a university – and who therefore have not been so exposed to the values and etiquette of the new elites – seem far more content to turn their backs on the increasingly woke establishment and to take a chance on populist upstarts. That many blue-collar folk in Sweden are finally doing this is not surprising. It isn’t because they’re racist. They’re not drawn to the Sweden Democrats because it has some neo-Nazi cranks in its past. Rather, they are revolting against their evasive elites. Against an establishment that seems to be in wilful denial about the problems confronting society, and which will brand you a hateful bigot if you dare to raise those problems. The political life of Sweden has been defined by evasion in recent years. The establishment parties, especially the Social Democrats, flat-out refused to be honest about the social disturbances afflicting Swedish society. Crime and violence have soared. There are now so many grenade attacks in Sweden that it is the only country other than Mexico in which police record the number of such attacks. Explosions generally are rising. As a BBC report in 2019 asked: ‘Sweden’s 100 explosions this year: What’s going on?’ In 2020 alone there were more than 200 explosions and 360 shootings. Sweden is the only country in Europe in which gun murders have surged since the year 2000. Then there are the religious riots. Earlier this year there were Islamist uprisings across Sweden. In various cities, Muslim mobs set fire to cars and hurled stones at cops following a right-wing provocateur’s burning of the Koran. Sweden’s national police chief said he had ‘never seen such violent riots’.\n\nThat much of this spike in crime and rioting followed Sweden’s huge intake of asylum seekers in 2015 has made this a tetchy, touchy subject. Swedish politicians and commentators, keen to dampen down what they consider to be the racist tendencies of the Swedish masses, tended to downplay the social instability. Outside observers did likewise. Remember the trouble Trump got into when he said Sweden was experiencing some big social and cultural problems? Don’t be ridiculous, the chattering classes of the West said – Sweden is fine. But it wasn’t fine. And its problems were at least partly a consequence of a crisis of integration, of the failure on Sweden’s part to assimilate the tens of thousands of largely Middle Eastern migrants it accepted in 2015. Consider this: four esteemed social scientists in Sweden examined the rape trends of the past two decades. They found that of those convicted of rape, 40.8 per cent were Swedish-born with Swedish parents, and 47.7 per cent were born outside of Sweden. Most of those were from the Middle East or North Africa. That is something to discuss, right? Apparently not. Too often, debate was shushed, demonised. The end result was as predictable as it was dire: social instability intensified as the elites looked the other way. Eventually things got so bad that the PM, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to talk about it. We can no longer ignore the fact, she said earlier this year, that we have ‘parallel societies in Sweden’, that ‘integration has been too poor at the same time as we have had large [amounts of] immigration’. But it was too little, too late. Many voters had already turned their backs on Ms Andersson’s Social Democrat party and moved towards the Sweden Democrats, for the simple reason that they wanted someone – anyone – to talk about Sweden’s transformation from a relatively stable welfare-oriented society into a nation beset by gang violence and identitarian grievance. It was the evasions of the elite, their stricture against open, honest commentary, that encouraged many to look to the Sweden Democrats.",

    "Sweden on ‘high alert’ for election interference amid Russia tensions": "Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia.\n\nThe Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources following its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September.\n\nAfter a turbulent period for Swedish politics, including the resignation of Stefan Löfven as prime minister, the rise of Magdalena Andersson, the country’s first female leader, and threats from Vladimir Putin, the latest polls are exceptionally close in a highly charged campaign with a strong focus on immigration.\n\nIn what would be a seismic shift to the right, polls suggest the Sweden Democrats, rightwing populists with neo-Nazi roots, could be on track to replace the Moderates as Sweden’s second biggest party.\n\nGenerally elections have been a race between left-leaning parties led by Andersson’s Social Democrats and a centre-right coalition led by the Moderates, but even the latter party has in just a few years gone from urging Swedes to “open your hearts” to refugees to embracing the Sweden Democrats – a party whose leader, Jimmie Åkesson, has called for asylum to be cut to “close to zero”.\n\nSweden’s perceived vulnerabilities to foreign disinformation include on immigration, violent crime, schools, jobs, pensions and rising energy costs.\n\nMats Engström, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former adviser to a Social Democrat foreign minister, said while it was no surprise violent crime is in the spotlight as deadly shootings rise, discussion linking it to migration has “for years been reinforced by Russian and other troll factories”.\n\nHe said the Swedish election system was “robust” but disinformation aimed at the end of the election campaign would be much harder to counteract.\n\nMikael Östlund, a spokesperson for the psychological defence agency, said: ““We have a high alert all the time but we are aware of the fact that it might be an occasion that someone would like to harm Sweden, impact the Swedish democracy process, to do something exceptional towards the end of the election campaign.”\n\nThe cold war-era government body, intended to protect democracy, freedom of opinion and independence, was reintroduced in January amid rising fears over Russian aggression.\n\nÖstlund said it saw “increased activity” from outside the country, some of which was “quite intense”, after Sweden’s decision to apply to become a Nato member. Ongoing disinformation campaigns, understood to be coming from Russia, include claims that Sweden is a weak country and is not safe for refugees.\n\n“It’s something that we have seen before from Russian actors and also individuals,” Östlund said. “We know that foreign powers and countries that have the capacity might be interested in harming Sweden and harming the elections, or trying to widen divisions between ethnic groups.\n\n“So we are prepared for the event that during the last weeks, the closer to the election day we come, there might be something that occurs that we have quite a short time to counter.”\n\nIn the event of foreign intervention, options for countering it include going public with the breach and naming the source. A recently launched public awareness campaign warned “bli inte lurad” (don’t be fooled) and encouraged people to think about the source and publisher of information before sharing it online. A free online course from the agency shows how to protect against disinformation.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A prosecutor confirmed last week that Annie Lööf, the leader of the Centre party, was the planned target of a suspected terror attack, which killed another woman, at a political festival in Gotland in July.\n\nFrederik Bratt, the Swedish security service’s commanding officer for the election, said while there was no indication of an increased threat targeting the election, the ongoing threat of lone actors was “complex and a challenge”.\n\nEngström said if the Social Democrats held on to power after the election, it would largely be down to Andersson’s personal popularity, but if they lose the party’s focus on crime during the campaign will come under question. He said the Moderates also faced a backlash among the party’s former voters over its embrace of the Sweden Democrats, which could prove “catastrophic”.\n\n“If Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson still can form a new government, he will be very dependent on the Sweden Democrats,” Engström said. “This will affect Sweden’s policy also internationally, for example lower ambitions in climate policy.”\n\nIn Rinkeby, a Stockholm neighbourhood with a large immigrant population, Abebe Hailu, 69, was on Wednesday campaigning for the Social Democrats in front of a shipping container decorated in a poster that read “Our Stockholm region can do better”. He said the issues people care about most are welfare, schools, healthcare and jobs.\n\n“Our party thinks in the first-hand you should invest in children, before it becomes set,” he said.\n\nWelfare is the solution to problems in Swedish society, he added. “We must reduce the class gap between rich and poor and that means good schools for the children.”",
    "Season Starts Early in Sweden": "The SkiStar group which is Scandinavia’s largest ski resort operator, running the region’s most popular resort Åre, as well as other famous centres like Hemsedal and Trysil in Norway and Sälen and Vemdalen is Sweden, has started its 22-23 ski season already in September.\n\nThey’ve done it by creating a year-round ski slope at their ‘urban’ ski resort of Hammarbybacken in Swedish capital Stockholm.\n\nThe group has achieved this by investing in an all-weather dry slope from Italian specialists Neveplast, the company responsible for many of the world’s most interesting dry slope projects, including the famous slope wrapping around a giant green-energy power plant in Copenhagen (below).\n\nSkistar say the new slope, one of the world’s largest of its type, at Stockholm Hammarbybacken, is an important milestone in their move towards year-round activities.\n\nThe main slope is nearly 500 metres long with a surface area of 9,000 m2 and there’s also a summer version of the SkiStar Snow Park with a number of features like rails and boxes designed by SkiStar’s new ambassador, freeskier and Olympic medallist Jesper Tjäder. A separate beginner’s area can be reached easily by conveyor lift.\n\nFirst to try out the slope at the launch was none other than World Cup skier Kristoffer Jakobsen, pictured below, who commented,\n\n“I think it’s a great idea and will help skiing continue to grow. It’s also great to be able to do it in the capital. It was really exciting and cool to be the first out on the slope on a day like this.”\n\nNeveplast and SkIStar both have very high environmental objectives so Neveplast worked to create an even ‘greener’ version of their surface by using a higher percentage of recycled plastics in it, while the slope material itself is also designed so that it itself can be recycled at the end of its life.\n\n“Our unique SummerSki venture in Sweden is finally up and running. It’s fantastic to be able to offer all Stockholmers and visitors the opportunity to go skiing, even outside the winter months, and to discover the joy of skiing all year round. This venture moves us closer to our sustainability goal of encouraging even more people to take up exercise and become more active to improve their health and well-being; the new Stockholm Hammarbybacken centre is an important part of this,” says Stefan Sjöstrand, CEO and Group Manager of SkiStar AB.\n\nBesides year-round skiing (the slope can still be used when snow covered in winter), the arena has a new SkiStar Climbing Park, Mountain Coaster and Mountain Tube, which opened earlier in the summer and have attracted a lot of visitors.\n\nSummerSki at SkiStar Hammarbybacken in Stockholm is open from 2 pm to 8 pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays, 2 pm to 6 pm on Fridays and 10 am to 6 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Skiersand boarders need to buy a SkiPass from skistar.com or the SkiStar app before they can ski or board. Other activities will also stay open from Thursdays to Sundays during the autumn and the autumn break.",
    "Kikilias meets tour operators and airline reps in Sweden": "Tourism Minister Vassilis Kikilias continued his promotional tour abroad with a visit to Sweden on Friday.\n\nIn Stockholm he and Greek National Tourism Organization Secretary-General Dimitris Fragakis met with tour agency and trade representatives, the heads of SAS and Eurowings Airlines, and representatives of Swedish pensioners.\n\nIn statements afterward, Kikilias cited Swedish data revealing that in 2022 flights to Greece registered 97% capacity, while Eurowings showed an increase of 30% in all Northern European markets for flights to Greece, compared to 2019.\n\nHe also noted there was interest in a longer tourism season, especially through themed travel packages including golf, hiking and cycling on Crete, Rhodes and in the Peloponnese and Epirus.\n\n“Meetings showed an interest in new investments in the hotel sector that relate to sports tourism,” he added.",
    "Dagen H: the day Sweden switched to driving on the right – archive, 1967": "Halting way to the right road\n\n4 September 1967\n\nStockholm\n\nCheering crowds brought traffic to a halt here today as Sweden changed to driving on the right after four years of preparations, 40 years of argument, and at a total cost estimated at double the official figure of £40m.\n\nAll traffic had to halt for 10 minutes at 4.50 this morning throughout Sweden’s 60,000 miles of roads, but in Kungsgatan, Stockholm’s Oxford Street, the wait for impatient Swedish drivers wanting to try their luck on the right was much longer.\n\nBarred\n\nThough the centre of the city had been barred for nearly 24 hours to all but taxis, buses, and cars with special permits, a solid jam developed as sightseers, cyclists, and television cameramen swamped the roadway.\n\nThe police watched dourly as long lines of traffic – headlamps glaring, horns blowing –tried vainly to switch sides in the approved manner, getting hopelessly entangled in the process.\n\nWith military helicopters buzzing overhead, order was eventually restored and “Höger-dag”, “Right Day”, as the Swedes reverently term it, returned to the clockwork efficiency which marked its planning. Some 2,000 soldiers, 6,000 civil police, 50,000 school police, and 150,000 volunteers were on duty throughout Sweden, while an army of construction workers had worked throughout the night to make the final alterations to 350,000 street signs.\n\nLast detail\n\nThough there was the occasional jam and a number of minor accidents, the Swedish reputation for thoroughness can hardly ever have been better displayed. Typical of the meticulous attention to detail was that even the elk-hunting season had been brought forward a week so that hunters would not add to the traffic problem.\n\nTo prevent accidents from absent-mindedness after the change, and intensive publicity campaign has been mounted by the government in addition to the imposition of strict speed limits. These range from 40kph (25mph) in built-up areas to 90kph (58mph) on motorways. Drivers have been advised to keep their headlights switched on night and day until tomorrow.\n\nThe testing time, police say, is likely to be in about three weeks when drivers begin to relax and forget. The attitude here to the change seems curiously ambivalent. Many drivers say they are thankful it is at last over, yet are critical of the cost of the operation.\n\nThe criticism is no doubt the sharper because of the proposed 50 percent increase in vehicle tax next year, which is widely held to be the result of “Höger-dag.” And only just over 10 years ago in a national referendum, 83 percent voted against the change. When the Bill was finally passed in the Riksdag in 1963 after a deal between the two major political parties, it was estimated that the cost would be Kr400m (£28m) to be raised by a special vehicle tax of £2 13s for small cars and £5 for large cars, buses, and lorries.\n\nCost of £80m\n\nIn 1965 the official estimate was revived to Kr600m (£42m) and is now believed that the final cost to the government is likely to exceed Kr800m (£60m) with indirect cost of at least Kr200m, making a total of £80m.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iceland now plans to change next year.\n\nThough the British Road Federation, the Ministry of Transport, the AA and the RAC, all had observers in Stockholm, there is as yet no enthusiasm from anyone for a similar move in Britain.\n\nThe cost would be astronomical – £350m was the last estimate – but even more important, the reasons which led Sweden to conform with her neighbours are not applicable. Ninety per-cent of our cars are not left-hand drive and the number of foreign and British cars entering and leaving is still comparatively small.\n\nUntil the Channel tunnel is built and until we get into the Common Market, the idea of a change is almost certainly a non-starter. Even then our insularity in every sense could well delay the move for at least a generation. But by the year 2000 even the Swedes think we will have followed suit.",
    "Sweden taking Turkey 'seriously' on Nato demands": "Sweden and Finland are counting on further talks with Turkey to unlock their Nato accession, as Western diplomats wonder what Ankara really wants.\n\n\"The Swedish government takes the implementation of the memorandum very seriously,\" the Swedish foreign ministry told EUobserver on Thursday (15 September), referring to a deal made in June with Turkey to go after alleged Kurdish terrorists in return for Nato entry.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\n\"Further meetings in the trilateral format between Sweden, Finland, and Türkiye are foreseen,\" the Swedish ministry said, following the last such talks on 26 August.\n\nFinland is also \"working together with Türkiye to organise further meetings at expert level,\" its foreign ministry said.\n\nThey spoke after Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoglu warned one day earlier the Turkish parliament wouldn't ratify the Nordic Nato bids if they didn't play ball. \"No concrete steps have been taken up to today,\" by Stockholm or Helsinki to satisfy Ankara, he declared.\n\nFinland and Sweden are joining the Western alliance to protect themselves from Russia, in a tectonic shift in European security in reaction to the Ukraine war.\n\nSome 24 out of 30 Nato members have already ratified the move in the fastest-paced accession process in its history, showing the overwhelming support for Nordic enlargement.\n\nBut Turkey first wants Sweden to extradite 73 Kurdish separatist suspects and for Finland to hand over 12 more.\n\nIt also wants them to tighten national terrorism laws and to sell Turkey high-end weapons systems, in demands which are being fulfilled.\n\nÇavuşoglu's warning was prompted by the formation of a new right-wing government in Stockholm, including the far-right Sweden Democrats party, following elections last Sunday.\n\nBut the Sweden Democrats endorse Nato entry, and right-wing Swedish voters will likely be more comfortable with extraditing Kurdish exiles than supporters of the outgoing centre-left government would have been.\n\nAnd despite Çavuşoglu's tough talk, few in the EU or Nato think Ankara expects to get everything it wants.\n\nTurkey's demands on Finnish extraditions, for one, could easily melt away because they are largely symbolic. \"There is no PKK in Finland,\" an EU diplomat said, referring to a leading Kurdish militant group.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's \"frustration\" with Sweden giving safe harbour to so many Kurds was more \"real\", Jamie Shea, a former senior Nato official, told this website.\n\nBut given the high burden of proof from Turkey that Swedish courts will require to substantiate terrorism charges, \"it is highly unlikely that all the individuals on Ankara's list will be handed over\", Shea also said.\n\n\"Erdoğan knows that he cannot stop the [Nato enlargement] process indefinitely, whatever the rhetoric from Ankara, and so my sense is that he will declare victory after a few symbolic extraditions and lift his objections,\" Shea said.\n\nTurkish elections\n\nThat still leaves the question of when Erdoğan might budge.\n\nFinland and Sweden are not covered by Nato's mutual defence clause until the day they join, amid concern over the potential for a sudden flare-up in Russian aggression in the Baltic region.\n\nBut Erdoğan is preparing to fight elections in June next year amid an economic slump in Turkey, and his spin-doctors might want to drag out the Nato dispute as long as possible for campaign reasons, the EU diplomat said.\n\n\"It makes him [Erdoğan] look like an important player on the world stage,\" the diplomat noted.\n\n\"It also has a rallying-round-the-flag effect on Turkish nationalists and on those large portions of Turkish society where anti-Americanism is rife,\" he said.\n\n\"Erdoğan has other cards to play, such as creating a new migration or Mediterranean gas-drilling crisis with Greece,\" the diplomat added. \"His people are obsessed with opinion polls, and they'll be frantically doing surveys to see how each of his moves plays out,\" the EU diplomat said.\n\nTurkey sent thousands of Syrian refugees to the Greek border two years ago. It dispatched a ship in August to resume gas exploration in an area criss-crossed by rival territorial claims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Finnish and Swedish bids are proceeding so swiftly because they already became de facto Nato members in military-technical terms during years of close cooperation.\n\nThere is very little left for Nato itself to do to wrap up the process following member states' ratifications, Shea, who now teaches war studies at the University of Exeter in the UK, said.\n\nThis includes tweaking its budget and legal documents.\n\n\"Nato commanders will need to revise their contingency plans for the defence of Europe to cover Swedish and Finnish territory, which includes islands in the Baltic Sea,\" Shea said.\n\n\"They will also be proposing Swedish and Finnish military contributions for the defence of other allies. But again, given the recent closeness of Sweden and Finland to Nato, they probably finalised these plans, at least informally, months or even years ago already,\" he said.",
    "India U-17 women’s team suffers 1-3 defeat against Sweden": "The India U-17 women’s team suffered a 1-3 defeat against Sweden in its first match of the exposure tour in the run-up to the FIFA U-17 World Cup. The match was played at Girona in Spain.\n\nIt was the first match of the exposure tour for the Indian girls ahead of the age-group showpiece, which India is hosting in October-November. Sudha Tirkey (62′) scored the only goal for India after Sweden U-17 girls took a comfortable 3-0 lead through Ida Gramfors (44′) Sara Frigren (52′) and Selma Astrom (54′). India, however, looked promising at the start as they competed on equal terms in an intense midfield battle that saw winger Anita Kumari get an early shot at the rival goal, which was saved.\n\nMinutes later, Nitu Linda tried her luck to take a shot from the edge of the Swedish penalty area, but was blocked. India earned a free kick in the 19th minute and Anita once again made an attempt at the rival goal, this time a header, but the Swedish custodian Elin Ekmark saved it with ease.\n\nA few minutes later Sweden striker Maja Jarvensivu tried a long ranger, which went over the bar. Both Anita and India goalkeeper Anjali enjoyed a good first half. The former made a few inroads around the half-hour mark, while the latter made a few worthy saves to keep her side in the game.",
    "Marine Le Pen wants France to become the next Sweden": "While Emmanuel Macron spent Sunday in London honouring the memory of the late Queen Elizabeth, Marine Le Pen marked her return from a summer break with an address to the party faithful in the south of France.\n\nBuoyed by the success of the Swedish right in last week’s election, and anticipating a similar result on Sunday when the Italians go to the polls, Le Pen attributed what she called a ‘patriotic wave’ sweeping the continent to the EU’s failure to tackle mass immigration in the last decade.\n\nIn the opinion of Le Pen no one embodies this failure more than Macron. Last Thursday the president told an assembly of prefects that a new immigration bill would be tabled by his government in early 2023. He believes it will be a much-needed reformation of the current system, which he described as ‘dilatory’ and one result will be the swifter deportation of undesirable migrants. For those who are entitled to remain in France, Macron said he wanted them removed from the squalid camps in Paris and Calais and relocated to ‘rural areas, which are losing their population’.\n\nLe Pen expressed indignation at Macron’s idea in her speech on Sunday. ‘He is proposing nothing less than to impose on your villages and towns an immigration that you did not ask for,’ she said, in a message to France’s rural mayors.\n\nSome of the mayors will share her disquiet but others are more in tune with president Macron. One such is Jean-Yves Rolland, the mayor of Callac in Brittany, where 70 families from Africa are scheduled to soon arrive. He believes their presence will help regenerate the village and the local area, but some of the 2,000 villagers disagree.\n\nOn Saturday around 300 of them staged a demonstration against the imminent arrival of the migrants, supported by some activists from Renconquest, the far-right party founded by Eric Zemmour. Opposing them in the village square were some pro-migrant villagers and several hundred people from a variety of far-left organisations, including Antifa, who had on social media called for a show of strength against the ‘fascists’.\n\nThe villagers claim their opposition is not motivated by racism but more a feeling of injustice; for years there has been no investment in the village or the region, even though the agricultural industry has been declining. Now suddenly money – private and public – is pouring in to renovate houses and community buildings for the new arrivals. They also want to know how the migrants will find work given that unemployment in the region runs at around 18 per cent.\n\nLe Pen is not a lone voice in challenging the idea of repopulating rural communities with migrants. A scathing editorial by the centre-right Le Figaro declared: ‘Tomorrow, it's the Seine-Saint-Denis for everyone!’, a reference to the department north of Paris, which has come to symbolise the ‘lost territory of the Republic’, where a parallel society hostile to French values has taken root this century.\n\nWhat the vast majority of French people want, concluded Le Figaro, ‘is not a better distribution of immigrants, but a control of our borders.’ Opinion polls consistently bear out this statement; one, in 2021, found that 62 per cent of people supported the idea of a referendum on the question of future immigration.\n\nMacron addressed the prefects on the same day that Magdalena Andersson resigned as Sweden’s Prime Minister after an election that saw the right-wing Swedish Democrats become the country’s second largest party with over 20 per cent of the vote.\n\nAndersson paid the price for years of liberal indifference to mass immigration that has resulted in the emergence in Sweden of unprecedented levels of violence, disproportionally the work of immigrant gangs.\n\nIn response to the Swedish election result the respected French political scientist, Dominique Reynié, predicted that this was just a foretaste of things to come if the continent’s leaders continued to duck the question of mass immigration. ‘Europe is threatened by becoming more right wing in its views as a consequence of EU member states refusing to take into consideration this preoccupation,’ he told the tabloid, Le Parisien.\n\nThere are already several troubling similarities between Sweden and France: the sheer numbers of migrants in the last decade and the resultant rise in gang violence, what the French call the ‘ensauvagement’ of their society. Many of those convicted are foreign nationals: they make up 25 per cent of France’s 68,000 prison inmates.\n\nDistributing migrants to the countryside will do little to ease France’s immigration crisis. That will only be resolved when, as Le Figaro stated, the country regains control of its borders. If it doesn’t the migrants will continue to come, and that will have implications for the number of migrants attempting to reach England from France\n\nEarlier this month a report in Le Monde revealed that more than 70,000 migrants have entered Europe across the Serbia/Hungary border this year, three times the number who used the route in the whole of 2021. Most hail from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.\n\nIn addition, those making the passage across the Mediterranean onto Italian territory are arriving in numbers not seen since the great migrant crisis of 2015, and now as then, the majority are young men.\n\nSweden welcomed 160,000 migrants that year, to the pride of the then prime minister Stefan Löfven. ‘My Europe takes in refugees, my Europe doesn't build walls,’ he told a rally in Stockholm in September 2015. ‘We need to decide right now what kind of Europe we are going to be.’\n\nSeven years later Sweden has decided what kind of Europe it wants to be, and it’s not Löfven’s kind. It remains to be seen whether France will follow in its footsteps.",

Alexander will therefore leave the squad.\"\n\nManager Janne Andersson added: \"It is of course sad, mainly for Alex, but also for us as a team. But after speaking with both our medical team and Alex, it is the right decision for him to leave. I hope he is back as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsak, who started three of his country's four games in June, was disappointed at having to pull out.\n\nHe said: \"It feels very sad to have to leave the team. I had longed to play in the blue and yellow shirt again. I wish the boys the best of luck on Saturday and Tuesday.\"\n\nThe news will come as a blow too to Magpies boss Howe, who completed his swoop for Isak as the summer transfer window drew to a close with Callum Wilson nursing the hamstring injury which has sidelined him since the 3-3 draw with champions Manchester City on August 21.\n\nWilson is close to a return, but Newcastle face an anxious wait to discover the extent of their big-money buy's injury ahead of next Saturday's trip to promoted Fulham.\n\nIsak scored on his debut at Liverpool and converted a penalty to secure a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth at the weekend, but is yet to finish on the winning side in his three appearances to date for the club, who have not won a Premier League game since the opening day of the season.",

    "UK Armed Forces continue to strengthen interoperability with Finland and Sweden": "British troops have taken part in Exercise Vigilant Knife alongside Swedish and Finnish Armed Forces, further strengthening our interoperability in anticipation of Sweden and Finland’s accession to NATO.\n\nThe short notice command-post exercise took place in Rovaniemi and Rovajärvi, northern Finland from 29 August to 2 September 2022 and built on the success of Exercise Vigilant Fox which took place in July.\n\nSecretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace said:\n\nWhilst there is war in Europe, it is more important than ever to strengthen our international partnerships. We welcome Finland and Sweden’s application to join NATO and will continue to exercise together so we are ready to face shared security challenges. Exercise Vigilant Knife is an invaluable opportunity for UK personnel to develop their skills and experience of warfighting in cold weather conditions, enabling them to be effective on the battlefield alongside their Finnish and Swedish counterparts.\n\nAround 80 British Army personnel from C Company, 2 Rifles Battlegroup took part in the exercise, travelling from the island of Santahamina in the south of Finland where they are undertaking a 3 month training deployment as part of a security agreement between the UK and Finland.\n\nFormed of over 2,000 troops, the international force practiced delivering and receiving international assistance as well as enhancing tactical and technical interoperability.\n\nAs a light infantry company, British personnel provided anti-tank, sniper and reconnaissance capabilities to the exercise and were primarily involved in both offensive and defensive actions to test the readiness of the Finnish forces alongside the Swedish unit.\n\nThis added to the invaluable experience that UK troops have already enjoyed whilst on deployment in Finland. Operating in northern Finland presented new challenges enabling troops to train in heavily wooded terrain.\n\nEnhancing our forces through international exercises is crucial preparation should we need to deploy alongside our European partners in the future, enabling us to be effective on the battlefield.",
    "‘World class’: National media hail Tottenham Hotspur player despite 4-1 thrashing": "Tottenham’s Dejan Kulusevski has been praised for his Sweden performance despite their 4-1 defeat to Serbia on Saturday night.\n\nSweden have missed out on a spot in the World Cup later this year having been beaten by Poland in the play-offs.\n\nBoss Janne Andersson is under huge pressure and that isn’t about to change after a chastening night in Belgrade.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic bagged a hat-trick in a 4-1 thrashing, with Sasa Lukic batting Serbia’s fourth.\n\nThis all came after Viktor Claesson had put Sweden in front, with Andersson’s side ultimately falling apart.\n\nPhoto by Srdjan Stevanovic/Getty Images\n\nTottenham’s Dejan Kulusevski has been praised\n\nClaesson’s opening goal came from a Dejan Kulusevski assist with the Tottenham man picking out a fine cross.\n\nClaesson did the rest with a fine dinked finish but that’s as good as it got for Sweden.\n\nThe Swedish press are understandably baying for blood.\n\nMissing out on the World Cup was bad enough but three points from five UEFA Nations League games is a disaster.\n\nFotbollskanalen have published their player ratings from last night’s defeat with the five-star and four-star ratings – for ‘world class’ and ‘very good’ left completely blank.\n\nTottenham star Kulusevski was the only one to land a three-star rating with praise heading his way for being Sweden’s ‘best player’.\n\n“World class in the build-up to Sweden’s 1-0 goal. Always tried to be creative but didn’t really have the teammates with him. Was the team’s best player,” they wrote.\n\nEvery other Sweden player was rated at two or one star with the national media clearly unhappy with the performance.\n\nThis is what we come to expect from Kulusevski though. In a post-Zlatan Ibrahimovic world for Sweden, Kulusevski should become their leading light.\n\nThe 22-year-old is so unselfish, so creative, so mature for his age and Sweden will be looking for him to continue shining – even if others around him falter.\n\nKulusevski doesn’t quite have that role in the Tottenham side but his importance cannot be overlooked; he brings something that Son Heung-min and Richarlison just can’t offer.\n\nKulusevski will hope to start for Tottenham against Arsenal next weekend and take that international praise into Premier League action.\n\nShow all\n\nIn other news, Chelsea now want to sign £30m teenager as Premier League club face transfer deja vu",
    "Heart Aerospace To Build Electric Aircraft Campus In Gothenburg, Sweden": "Gothenburg’s Säve airport will soon be home to an electric aircraft production and test flight ... [+] center. Heart Aerospace\n\nCommercial electric aviation took a big step closer to reality this week with the announcement of a new industry campus at Säve airport, a secondary airport just outside Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nDriven by investment from Heart Aerospace, the campus named ‘Northern Runway’ will include offices, production and test flight facilities for electric aircraft. The first phase should be complete by 2024, with test flights beginning two years later.\n\nInterest in electric aviation is taking off\n\nHeart Aerospace has announced several electric aircraft designs in recent years and has received investment, letters of intent and letters of support from major airlines including Air Canada and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS).\n\nCurrently in the spotlight is the 30-seat ES-30. With an all-electric range of 200km (124 miles) and a hybrid range of 400km (248 miles), it has attracted interest from airlines operating in markets with a big demand for regional aviation.\n\nAir Canada has committed to buying 30 of the Heart Aerospace ES-30 electric aircraft. Heart Aerospace\n\nAir Canada likes the concept so much it has invested $5 million into the company and placed a purchase order for 30 of the new ES-30 aircraft. SAS has also confirmed its interest in the model.\n\nFounder and CEO Anders Forslund said the new project is about much more than developing one aircraft: “We have a plan and it’s not just to build a new electric airplane, but a whole new industry. With Northern Runway we will make electric air travel a reality and preserve flying for future generations.”\n\nA new industry for Gothenburg\n\nHeart’s choice of Sweden’s second biggest city for its new campus is no surprise as the company is already based there. The Northern Runway concept will form part of a wider development area for sustainable logistics and electric mobility named Gateway Säve.\n\nHeart COO Sofia Graflund said the city has “distinguished itself” in the emerging area of electrification, pointing out the world-class research facilities in battery technology and electrification. Gothenburg is also widely known in city planning circles as one of the world’s most sustainable cities.\n\nThe company expects its new facility to stimulate new jobs and plans on growing from 130 employees today to approximately 500 by 2025.",

    "Sweden, Italy: How far-right is conquering new lands": "Sugata Srinivasaraju\n\nTIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Sep 22, 2022, 20:32 IST\n\nIKEA, the home furnishing company, has become an instant hit in India. Crowds have thronged the large physical stores it has opened in three Indian cities, the latest one being Bengaluru. Their Indian e-retail address is popular too. While this global Swedish behemoth has been redesigning Indian homes and homes elsewhere with its sober and sensitive design, there has been some radical reorganisation of political space in its home country.\n\nIn the general elections held last week, the centre-left Social Democrats were jolted by Sweden Democrats (they indeed sound like a new pair of homophones). To bring an Indian audience up to speed as to who Sweden Democrats (SD) are, one need not get into elaborate details of their troubled past or turbulent present. It would suffice to say that they have demanded a ban on halal meat in Swedish schools. Something India was obsessively debating a few months ago. A party leader even reasoned that halal meat had ‘magical powers’ that could turn those who consume it into a Muslim.",
    "Right-wing nationalism comes to ... Sweden?": "As we look ahead to midterm elections, where election deniers are on the ballot in 27 states, it’s still mind-blowing to consider how we got here in just a few years. And the answer, most bluntly, is a rise in right-wing nationalism.\n\nAfter lying dormant for some time, the contours of this new and arguably ascendant movement are by now well-known. There are many characteristics, most of which are deeply troubling if you’re a fan of democracy, including but not limited to:\n\nA preference for national, religious and ethnic purity; an antipathy for migrants and immigrants; an open hostility to the press and a desire to punish critics; and an apologist or even approving approach to authoritarianism.\n\nWhile all of that easily describes the right-wing nationalism stoked and nurtured by Donald Trump here in America, it also describes a stunning surge of authoritarianism in other countries, most notably Brazil and Hungary, where leaders Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orban, respectively, have puppeted Trump’s strong-arm nationalism to considerable success.\n\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, from Boris Johnson and now Liz Truss in the United Kingdom to Marine Le Pen in France, right-wing nationalism is getting a bigger audience, not a smaller one.\n\nThis is disturbing enough. Whether in Latin America or Europe, an embrace of nationalism, and in some cases fascism, recalls some truly horrific moments in world history.\n\nBut what if I told you right-wing nationalism was also winning in some less expected places — say, Sweden?\n\nYes, the same Sweden that American liberals and progressives have long called an egalitarian utopia.\n\nThe same Sweden that consistently ranks among the happiest, the freest, the most liberal, friendliest to immigrants, freest for journalists, the least racist and safest for LGBTQ travel countries in the world.\n\nLast week, this same Sweden held general elections to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag, or legislature. The right-wing Sweden Democrats won a net gain of 11 new seats, for a total of 73, surpassing the moderates to make it the second-most popular party in the country behind the left-wing Social Democrats.\n\nThis was shocking for many Swedes and election watchers, according to Elisabeth Asbrink, author of “Made in Sweden: 25 Ideas That Created a Country.” The success of the Sweden Democrats, she writes in The New York Times this week, “marks the end of Swedish exceptionalism, the idea that the country stood out both morally and materially.”\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nAs she describes it, the party’s origins date back to 1988 and a neo-Nazi group called BSS, or Keep Sweden Swedish. The far-right movement has “profited from the country’s growing inequalities, fostering an obsession with crime and an antipathy to migrants.”\n\nShe notes how the party’s chief of staff in the Swedish Parliament declared that critical journalists should be “punished” and were to be considered “enemies of the nation.”\n\nThe country’s defense minister called the party a security risk, due to its neo-Nazi ties.\n\nEarlier this year, the party’s leader, Jimmie Akesson, refused to choose between President Joe Biden and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis all sounds very familiar to us: It echoes the climate we’ve been living in here in the U.S. for the past six years during the rise of Trump.\n\nIt was once easy to think of this new political populist era as a uniquely American response to uniquely American problems. Trump was, after all, a uniquely American invention, and he was both benefiting from and leaning into uniquely American divisions and grievances.\n\nBut clearly we aren’t as special as we thought. A rise in populism in India and Pakistan, as well as Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France and now even Sweden is proving the movement is global, and so is its appeal.\n\nTo call it merely nostalgia is to divorce it from the racial, ethnic and sexual anxieties that inform right-wing nationalism and make up many of its punitive policies. But a desire to return to some long-gone way of life is a common thread across international borders.\n\n“Back to red cottages and apple trees, to law and order, to women being women and men being men,” as Asbrink describes it in Sweden.\n\nThe reaction to this voting block sounds familiar, too: “Individuals leaning toward the Sweden Democrats … have felt stigmatized … This has not only fed the party’s self-image as a martyr but also nurtured even more loyalty among its supporters,” Asbrink writes.\n\nPerhaps it’s some consolation to know the U.S. isn’t the only democracy in jeopardy — that we aren’t uniquely susceptible to these dark impulses, that this isn’t one of those “only in America” problems.\n\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that none of this is good. The rise in right-wing nationalism is corrosive and chilling, and the more it spreads, the worse it is for the world.\n\nS.E. Cupp is the host of “S.E.

    "How Sweden goes about innovating": "Sweden’s attitude towards innovation is perhaps best exemplified by the Swedish innovation agency, Vinnova, a government agency founded in 2001 based on a series of predecessors going back to at least 1968.\n\nThe innovation agency functions much like its counterparts in other countries, similarly to the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes) in neighbouring Finland, and to the part of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) that does seed funding on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Swedish government gives Vinnova more than €300m each year to invest through grants to different kinds of actors, which might be small companies, research institutes, large competence centres, or consortia of companies working together on projects.\n\nVinnova invests this money along 10 different themes, including sustainable industry and digital transformation. To report on the social and economic effects of its funding, the agency produces two impact studies annually. It has also published a document that describes its approach to tracking the impact of investments.\n\nSuccess stories in innovation “It’s never the case that we’re alone in the responsibility for success or failure,” says Göran Marklund, head of strategic intelligence and deputy director-general at Vinnova. “We usually fund collaborative projects in which we require the actors to contribute 50%, or more for large companies. This ensures they have a stake in the project – and that they will do what they need to be successful. There are often other outside investors.” Vinnova runs several projects in collaboration with the Swedish Energy Agency. This includes supporting a battery revolution currently underway in the north of Sweden – a project that revolves around Northvolt, a company whose founder, Peter Carlsson, was formerly an executive at Tesla. Now Carlsson is pushing Northvolt in directions that are revolutionising battery technology for many industries. For example, its batteries play an important role in transforming vehicles to electric – and automotive is a key industry in Sweden. Vinnova is also involved in artificial intelligence (AI), having written a report on the topic, and having helped start AI Sweden, an umbrella initiative that promotes the adoption of AI in the country. Vinnova looks for opportunities to promote the use of AI within businesses and public service agencies and to increase AI skills in Sweden. Another area where Vinnova has invested is quantum computing. Among other things, the agency ran a kick-start programme in 2021 to support projects that lead to commercialisation of quantum technology. “The global race is between China and the US, and with the EU [European Union] as a whole, particularly France and Germany,” says Marklund. “Though there is good applied research in quantum computing in Sweden, it is a challenge for such a small country to keep up with the rest of the world.” One area where Sweden has excelled for decades is in telecommunications – a key industry for Sweden, with Ericsson standing out as one of the world’s leaders. In an impact study published in 2008 called Effects of research on Swedish mobile telephone developments: The GSM story, Vinnova analysed the connection between research funded by Vinnova’s predecessors (Stu and Nutek) and the transformation of the Swedish telecommunications industry. The Ericsson group was the big winner from the transformation, and the company took an early lead in the global GSM market. According to some estimates, Ericsson had a five-year advantage compared with competitors. While it is hard to measure how important any single contributor was to this success, strategic funding was certainly crucial, especially for innovation in digital radio technologies.\n\nSweden is taking part in the digital transformation of mining Another big industry in Sweden is mining – and a major effort is underway to make mining fully sustainable. With help from Ericsson, ABB and Volvo, Swedish mine operator Boliden set up a test mine in Kankberg (pictured above) that will be completely automated as part of a pilot project overseen by Vinnova. The test mine began operations two-and-a-half years ago and will eventually operate autonomously, with no personnel in the mine itself. The project was kicked off in Sweden when Ericsson approached Vinnova with the aim of conducting digitisation projects. Vinnova suggested two pilots. The first was automation of manufacturing in Gothenburg; the second was the Kankberg mine in the county of Västerbotten that was part of a European effort to make mining more sustainable. Ericsson installed a 5G network throughout the Kankberg mine in early 2016, covering a path down to the mine area. Even with blind alleys and caves without line of sight to the antenna, Ericsson managed to provide high bandwidth (100mbps) and low latency throughout the mine. The network also met stringent requirements for reliability – very important requirements, since a loss of signal, even for a few seconds, could cause big problems. This ongoing demonstration project fits into the EU Commission programme Next Generation Carbon Neutral Pilots for Smart Innovation Mining Systems (or NexGen SIMS). One of the interesting aspects of the project is that it requires innovation in different industries – mining, telecommunications and machinery – which is beneficial to Sweden overall.\n\nSocietal challenges drive investment “Sweden does not have clearly defined national strategies for digital technologies that we can follow,” says Marklund. “But everybody knows what the hot topics are. Rather than try to find an entirely new topic that most of the people in the world haven’t yet thought of, what’s important is execution – how you make it happen on the ground.” “Having says that, Vinnova is definitely aligned with where many of the investments are going, internationally and nationally. We’re all over the board. We’re in IT and digital technologies, as in health, biotech and all kinds of technologies.” Vinnova is also the Swedish hub for the EU framework programme Horizon Europe. In this capacity, it facilitates the participation of Swedish actors in that EU framework programme, the biggest research and development programme in the world, with clearly specified areas for investment. Digital mining is an example of how Vinnova helps fund Swedish projects that fit into EU strategies. “Technologies alone do not lead. We also consider the market around the innovation” Göran Marklund, Vinnova “Our approach at Vinnova is more than just technological,” Marklund tells Computer Weekly. “We start by spotting societal challenges. This is what will drive competitiveness in the future. If you’re good at driving solutions to societal challenges, then you’re probably going to be very competitive, because those markets will grow.” Once a societal challenge is identified, the next step is to think about what it would take to overcome the challenge. The solution may have a technological component, but that has to be designed to work in specific contexts, like sustainable cities, which is one of the 10 themes where Vinnova invests. Sustainable industry is another – industry needs to transform into more sustainable solutions, to protect the environment of course, but also because the market demands sustainability. “If you’re not transforming your whole business, then you will probably be out of the market somewhere down the line,” explains Marklund. “We try to put technology in a wider, systemic context. For example, we look at technology as something that enables a transformation that brings about competitive sustainability.” As much as possible, the philosophy is to invest in technology that meets the needs of society. Vinnova looks at how AI can be employed in the context of social change, and how 5G signalling can be propagated deep underneath the surface of the earth to help automate mining, which will result in sustainable mining. In the case of battery technology, putting the technology into a wider context means answering a series of questions. How do you get the batteries working with the efficiency you need? Then you have questions about how much energy is required, and whether that energy is green. If it’s not green, the solution can’t be sustainable, so the market value of the innovation in question would be very low. The line of questions also leads to the materials needed for the batteries and where they can be obtained. It turns out that the materials currently used for batteries are scarce, and China dominates the market. This leads to questions about what alternative Sweden has for getting those materials. The minerals do exist in Sweden (and elsewhere in Europe) but have been in abundance and cheap in China for so long that these businesses never developed in Sweden. “Sweden has to develop these resources now because it cannot be dependent on China for such critical things,” says Marklund. “Then that becomes a very critical focus and identifies a set of technologies that are needed.” “This is how we go about finding places to invest. Technologies alone do not lead. We also consider the market around the innovation.”\n\nSwedish national advantages The areas of investment also tend to cluster around a country’s national advantages – what a country is already good at, or where industry is already developed. One of Sweden’s national advantages is the existing automotive industry, which is denser in Sweden than in Germany – that is, the amount of revenue generated per person is higher. This includes cars and trucks. By applying technology to overcome the challenges within the country, Sweden sometimes gets so good at it that it becomes a net exporter of certain solutions While the Chinese holding company Geely now owns both Volvo and Polestar, most of the work still takes place in Sweden, using Swedish workers. Automotive also has a big impact on many other sectors that generate solutions for the automotive industry. Another national advantage is the telecommunications industry, with Ericsson standing out internationally and very much linked to digital transformation. Mining and steel are also important industries and are dominant across Europe in certain parts of these industries. Another big industry is forestry. All those industries have given rise to a strong machinery industry. Sweden also has a very advanced research community, with pure and applied research in a several areas including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and the internet of things (IoT). Sweden’s education system is also very good, with a new focus on lifelong learning. Digitisation makes things change more rapidly, so skills have to be developed in the labour force more rapidly than before. Furthermore, an increasing number of jobs require digital skills.",
    "Niam and Solkompaniet to develop solar facilities in Sweden": "The solar projects will have the capacity to power 120,000 households. Credit: Niam.\n\nNorwegian real asset manager Niam , via its Niam Infra Fund, has partnered with solar developer Solkompaniet to develop a 500MW solar portfolio in southern Sweden.\n\nThe solar projects in the portfolio will have the capacity to power 120,000 households in central and southern Sweden.\n\nThey will require a total investment of more than €300m ($297.7m).\n\nSolkompaniet CEO Axel Alm said: “Solkompaniet has built solar parks since the start in 2010, but it is only now that the size of the parks means that they become an important part of our electricity supply.\n\n“The first solar park that we will develop and build for Niam alone corresponds to as much as has been built historically in Sweden until 2021.”\n\nNiam and Solkompaniet are currently developing two 80MW solar facilities under the framework agreement.\n\nOne of these is the Östra Eneby solar facility located outside Norrköping, which is said to be the most progressed among the two.\n\nThe Östra Eneby project is expected to come online by the end of 2024.\n\nThe two companies aim to start developing additional solar parks under the framework agreement over the next two years.\n\nNiam Infrastructure CEO Sverker Åkerblom said: “Sweden has great conditions for solar parks – plenty of land and good solar irradiation in our long coastal areas.\n\n“Niam wants to contribute to solar becoming an important part of the Swedish energy system.\n\n“Sweden’s electricity demand is predicted to double as a result of the electrification that is now taking place, and solar can relatively quickly meet part of the increased demand in southern Sweden, where there is significant near-term need.”\n\nNiam invests in real assets in the Nordic countries and northern Europe, focusing on real estate and infrastructure.\n\nThe company established the Niam Infra Fund last year.",
    "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years": "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to correspondent Charlie Duxbury of Politico Europe, about the rise of the Sweden Democrats, from a neo-Nazi group to an influential political party after Sunday's elections.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA far-right party with roots in neo-Nazi groups is expected to play a central role in Sweden's next coalition government.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have grown more influential in recent years after it moderated some of its positions and expelled some of its extremist members. Its anti-immigration, tough on crime platform resonated with Swedish voters in Sunday's election.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury is the Stockholm correspondent for Politico Europe and joins us. Welcome.\n\nCHARLIE DUXBURY: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: I just heard A say they moderated their positions. What did they stand for in the past, and what do they stand for now?\n\nDUXBURY: Yes, so the Sweden Democrats do have roots in neo-Nazi groups of the late '80s, early '90s in Sweden. In the years since, they kind of cleaned things up and moved more towards the mainstream, but they still stand for a very hard line on immigration and a hard line on law and order. And that's what seems to have attracted voters in Sunday's vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Hasn't Sweden welcomed a relatively large number of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in recent years?\n\nDUXBURY: That's right. During Europe's migration crisis from 2015 onwards, Sweden took a relatively large number of those asylum-seekers. And the government at the time, social democratic government, was relatively welcoming in the same way that Germany was, and tens of thousands of asylum-seekers arrived in Sweden. Since then, there's been a kind of backlash in - among some groups, particularly the Sweden Democrats, who said that that was a mistake and that the integration of immigrants since then has been a failure.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, what does it mean that they did so well in Sunday's election? And how much influence do they now have? They wouldn't be leading the coalition, I guess.\n\nDUXBURY: No. So the count's still ongoing. We should have a final result by this evening. What is expected to happen is that the center-right moderate party will lead the government but will lean heavily on the Sweden Democrats, who achieved a score of about 20% of the vote on Sunday. And the Sweden Democrats will be under pressure from their own voters to show that they can deliver on some quite ambitious campaign pledges to cut down on immigration, to increase policing powers in sentencing in the courts in Sweden. So that will be a closely watched discussion over the days and weeks to come.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the center-right party that seems likely to lead the coalition in a position where they would essentially have to do what the Sweden Democrats demand on their particular issues to keep the coalition together?\n\nDUXBURY: They'll certainly have to offer some serious concessions to the Sweden Democrats to hold this loose coalition together. They may decide to offer them ministerial positions. They may decide to try and run a minority government with the Sweden Democrats outside. But either way, the Sweden Democrats are going to demand serious influence over the government in the four-year mandate period to come, and they will have to show the voters that they've achieved that.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury, correspondent for Politico Europe in Stockholm, thanks so much.\n\nDUXBURY: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

Image: SSAB.\n\nSwedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall has commissioned a green hydrogen storage pilot facility within a 100GWh capacity cavern.\n\nThe HYBRIT facility in Luleå, north Sweden, is a collaboration between Vattenfall, steel company SSAB and iron ore producer LKAB.\n\nIt was inaugurated in June and, following initial pressure tests, has now been filled with hydrogen gas up to a maximum operating pressure of 250 bar. A two-year test period has now started and will continue until 2024.\n\nThe technology will eventually go towards SSAB sponge iron production operations, but the announcement’s wording indicates the next two years is mainly just testing the hydrogen storage capabilities. Sponge iron is produced by reducing iron ore into iron using a reducing gas or elemental carbon, and is used in the production of steel.\n\nThe technology will be used on an industrial-scale for sponge iron production at SSAB’s facility in Gällivare, a few hours north of Luleå, within the next four years, Vattenfall said.\n\nThe pilot facility is 100 cubic metres in size and could be expanded to 100,000 to 120,000 cubic metres. This would equate to 100GWh of energy storage in green hydrogen form, which a press release said was enough to supply a full-size sponge iron factory for three to four days.\n\nLars Ydreskog, director of strategic projects at LKAB, said: “Hydrogen gas and its storage are central to our transition. In just four years, HYBRIT technology will be used for the production of fossil-free sponge iron on a large scale at a first demonstration facility in Gällivare. LKAB will become one of Europe’s biggest hydrogen producers, and this pilot project will provide valuable knowledge for the continuing work on creating the world’s first fossil-free value chain for the iron and steel industry.”\n\nVattenfall said the pilot facility in Luleå is the first in the world to test the technology with repeated filling and emptying of hydrogen gas.\n\nOther large cavern facilities for storing green hydrogen which are in development include ACES Delta in Utah, US, and the HyStock project in the Netherlands. ACES has a total storage capacity of 300GWh and is expected to come online in stages starting in 2025, while the 26 million kg-capacity HyStock is expected online the following year. ACES will supply gas to a combined cycle power plant while HyStock’s developers have been vague on its use cases.\n\nThe main use case for green hydrogen technology at scale is as a feedstock for various industrial processes to help them decarbonise, followed by replacing fossil fuel in transportation and the finally blending with natural gas for conventional gas power plants.\n\nStoring green hydrogen for conversion back to electricity – power-to-X-to-power – has a round-trip efficiency too low to be economical for now, most industry observers say.",

    "Sweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact:\n\nAdam McGibbon, adam.mcgibbon [at] priceofoil.org\n\nSweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment\n\nAt the COP26 United Nations Climate Conference in Glasgow, 39 countries and institutions signed up to the Glasgow Statement, committing themselves to ending “new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” The initiative has the potential to shift $39 billion a year out of fossil fuel projects and into clean energy if countries keep their promises.\n\nAs the deadline for implementing the Statement looms, the Swedish export credit agencies, SEK and EKN, have released an updated policy. A previously-released policy aligned Swedfund – the Swedish development finance institution – with the Glasgow Statement.\n\nSEK and EKN’s new policy ends almost all support to fossil fuels by 31st December 2022, with some limited exemptions:\n\nGas-fired power plants, new oil or gas extraction and oil refineries will still be supported if the project / company “has documented and realistic transition plans in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree target, e.g. equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or equivalent emissions reduction technologies” OR if “The transaction refers to substantial environmental or safety improvement measures while no expansion of the oil or gas operation.”\n\nUntil 31st December 2022, gas-fired power plants can be supported in “countries with large development needs or in countries where the exporter or buyer can show that the project is part of reconstruction after war or conflict.”\n\nEssentially, this means that the Swedish policy, although an improvement, does not rule out support for oil exploration and extraction as clearly as the best-practice UK and Denmark policies. However, in practice, if Sweden’s requirement for a 1.5°C transition plan is implemented with integrity and good faith, this should mean that no new guarantees can be issued for such projects. According to the International Energy Agency, to maintain a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, there can be no investments in new coal, oil or gas fields. Other research shows that on top of ending investments in new fossil fuel supply, 40% of already developed oil and gas reserves need to be left unextracted. A similar rationale applies to new gas-fired power plants: both the production and use of gas needs to be rapidly reduced to limit global heating to 1.5°C and the committed emissions from existing energy infrastructure (including power infrastructure) already jeopardize the 1.5°C target. The good news is that clean and affordable alternatives to gas-fired power exist and can better deliver on energy access needs. In 2020, the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative recommended that “financing of fossil fuel projects as a means of closing the energy access gap should be terminated,” noting that they are no longer the most effective means of providing electricity access.\n\nWhether these projects will actually be ruled out depends on how EKN and SEK evaluate 1.5°C transition plans, which leaves some uncertainty in the Swedish position.\n\nIt is concerning that EKN is considering providing export finance support to CTT Mozambique, a project to build a gas-fired power plant in the east African nation. If EKN intends to act as a climate leader and listen to the science, this project cannot be supported.\n\nAmid all this, a hopeful sign is that EKN and SEK’s ‘Scientific Climate Council’ have made public statements that should provide the Swedish export credit agencies with ample reason to not exploit the loopholes in the policy. The advisory council noted that “the price today for coal, oil and gas makes new fossil-based investments hard to justify based on a strict financial calculation,” that “natural gas should not be seen as a transition fuel” and that “In most cases, it is not possible to justify new investments in fossil-based electricity and energy production. These are long investment cycles which result in lock-in effects, which in turn undermine the possibilities to reach the 1.5-degree target and also risks the investment becoming a “stranded asset”.\n\nAs a member of the Export Finance for Future (E3F) initiative, Sweden must use its diplomatic capital to ensure that all other E3F members implement the Glasgow Statement and present their updated policies at the upcoming E3F Summit. This way E3F members can build momentum towards COP27, ensure other Glasgow Statement signatories follow suit and meet their agreed end of 2022 deadline. [This leadership is vital to mitigating the climate crisis as of all public finance institutions ECAs are still the worst performers when it comes to Paris Alignment. The G20 ECAs provide 11 times as much export support to fossil fuel projects (USD 40.1 bn/yr) as for clean energy (USD 3.5 bn.yr)].\n\nAlthough E3F was designed to “harness public export finance as a key driver in the fight against climate change” and all members signed onto the Glasgow Statement, the coalition is not yet on track. The majority of its members have not yet updated their policies in line with the Glasgow Statement, and E3F itself has not yet made ending international public finance for fossil fuels a prerequisite for joining the initiative. Sweden must use its E3F membership to raise the bar, urging all other E3F members to implement the Glasgow Statement by the E3F Summit in order to build momentum to COP27, and make fossil-free ECAs policies a requirement for new members to join the initiative going forward.\n\n###",
