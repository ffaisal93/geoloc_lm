    "Colombia and Venezuela: Country Program Overview - Colombia": "Work in Colombia\n\nMedGlobal has been operating in Colombia since 2019. Our immediate goal was to provide primary health care services to Venezuelan migrants. We attempted to play a part in the response to the extra burden imposed by this diaspora.\n\nTo provide primary and specialty care, MedGlobal has hired local health staff and has hosted 73 international medical volunteers from a variety of medical specialties such as internal medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, etc., who deployed to help.\n\nIn Cúcuta, Norte de Santander Department, MedGlobal ran a primary care clinic for 2.5 years in the Comuneros neighborhood. This was chosen because the “barrio” (neighborhood) was home to a large number of Venezuelan migrants. Primary care services to children and adults and prenatal care services were among the services provided in this site.\n\nTo serve Venezuelan migrants as well as Colombian IDPs with little to no access to health care, MedGlobal conducted five medical brigades in the El Talento neighborhood, located on the outskirts of Cúcuta. These medical brigades included local staff as well as international medical volunteers, who provided care of acute intermittent illnesses as well as care of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, asthma, and diabetes, plus COVID-19 testing and a COVID-19 immunization clinic.\n\nMedGlobal was invited to participate in an ambitious government program to serve a large group of Venezuelan migrants called Los Caminantes (the walkers). They are Venezuelan migrants and refugees who leave Venezuela, traveling to other countries in the region by foot. Los Patios Migration Center is the first of six way stations along Los Caminantes’ route from Cúcuta to Bogota. MedGlobal was asked to serve as the medical presence at Los Patios.\n\nThe clinic provides Los Caminantes with free, first-contact medical services including acute care, obstetrics and gynecology, psychosocial support services, laboratory services, and medications. The clinic also offers COVID-19 rapid testing and COVID-19 vaccination. Through April 2022, MedGlobal has provided more than 7,600 health services in Los Patios.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, MedGlobal provided a variety of services in Cúcuta and in Bogota. Thousands of Venezuelan migrant and refugee families attempted to return to Venezuela amidst economic instability, creating a public health crisis in the border regions. Migrants were stuck at the border creating an overcrowded area. Tents were established to help mitigate the situation. MedGlobal and its partners began providing health services at a shelter established at the Tienditas Bridge in Cúcuta, providing health screenings and first aid to migrants and refugees. MedGlobal also distributed a range of critically needed supplies and equipment in Cúcuta, including 3 portable ventilators, to the new COVID-19 treatment center at Erasmo Meoz Hospital and hygiene kits for the local community. MedGlobal provided three medical staff to collaborate with the local health system in COVID-19 case surveillance.\n\nTo help build capacity at the border, MedGlobal began a training program for Point of Care Ultrasound. We donated the hardware, and we also provide on-going consultation to Venezuelan physician-trainees facing any difficult diagnostic case. We do this via telemedicine consultations as well as intermittent webinars.",
    "Colombian leader’s promise of ‘total peace’ may prove too ambitious": "The announcement came in a grainy video from the dense jungles of northern Colombia.\n\nA dozen masked men with camouflage uniforms and automatic weapons stand in a cluster, a roaring stream washing over their black combat boots.\n\n“We’re declaring to the government and the Colombian people our will to negotiate,” one man says in a lofty voice. “The Self-Defense Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada are ready.”\n\nIn a tone implying that this is news to be exalted, the militiaman declares that they want to work toward a “stable and long-lasting peace”.\n\nBut most Colombians who saw the clip were probably asking themselves a simple question: who are these people?\n\nThe Self-Defense Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada from northern Colombia declared they were ready to negotiate with Gustavo Petro. Photograph: https://twitter.com/tobymuse/status/1567990708404985856?s=20&t=Z0KhKa9TlPRIRi2rJGheaQ\n\nThe message was a response to a bold promise made by Colombia’s first leftist president, Gustavo Petro, when he took office last month. He declared he would achieve “total peace” in a nation that has been plagued by armed conflict for most of its history.\n\nPerhaps even more ambitious was the way he would go about it. Petro – himself a former member of the now defunct M-19 urban guerrillas – called upon the country’s ever-expanding list of armed groups to join him in a “multilateral ceasefire” and strike peace deals.\n\nBut just a month into his administration, his efforts to untangle an elaborate web of armed groups have already had an adverse effect, and observers worry the new leader may have bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nMilitias in every nook of the country from long-feared guerrilla armies to little-known factions such as the Self-Defense Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada have stepped forward to get in on peace talks, hopeful to reap the rewards from a ceasefire.\n\nChief among those are guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN), which is now set to restart negotiations in Havana after years of failed talks.\n\nBut at the same time, violence has only increased as each armed group scrambles to expand its territory and gain a strategic advantage in the lead-up to potential dialogues. Rates of mass killings, assassinations of human rights activists and attacks on police have all shot up since Petro took office.\n\nGustavo Petro, president of Colombia, called upon the country’s armed groups to join him in a ‘multilateral ceasefire’. Photograph: Joaquín Sarmiento/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“This plan for total peace actually caused a major shuffle in the configuration of the conflict,” said Beth Dickinson, Colombia analyst with International Crisis Group. “It’s really remarkable how significant the increase in violence has been … The mere idea of potential negotiations has completely changed the game.”\n\nObservers like Dickinson say it underscores that the road to true peace will be a long one and filled with many hurdles.\n\nColombia has long struggled to consolidate peace after previous deals with armed groups including rightwing paramilitaries in the 2000’s and with its biggest guerrilla force, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), in 2016.\n\nBut failures by previous governments to implement the most recent deal and assume control of large stretches of jungle left by the Farc brought with it a resurgence of violence.\n\nWhile other big narco gangs and guerrillas moved in on that land, many former Farc combatants grew disillusioned with the peace pact, rearming against the government and joining emerging mafia groups focused on narcotrafficking. More recently, Mexican cartels and Venezuelan gangs have pushed into Colombia, only exacerbating the violence.\n\nNow, if one group demobilizes, there will probably be a slew of smaller gangs waiting in the wings to take what they controlled. For Petro, it creates an ever-expanding puzzle.\n\nIn the Pacific port and trafficking hub of Buenaventura, human rights activist Miyela Riascos said her city now had so many warring armed groups that few knew which was in power at any given moment.\n\n“They never stop killing, and right now we’re seeing another peak in the violence,” Riascos said.\n\nViolence has spiked in the Pacific port city of Buenaventura, Colombia, since Petro took office. Photograph: Joaquín Sarmiento/AFP/Getty Images\n\nViolence in her city has shot up in the months since Petro took office, and Riascos was skeptical that the armed groups would actually follow through on their promises.\n\nYet, for her, the new government still inspires hope.\n\n“It’s really complex, but not impossible because we human beings have the capacity to do harm but also to create,” she said. “It’s worth it to try it without expecting much change, but to try it with the deep desire of wanting total peace.”\n\nCamilo Posso, president of the Bogotá-based thinktank Indepaz, which tracks war and peace in Colombia, said he doubted that such a bold ambition can be realistically achieved in four years.\n\nYet he also said it could mark an important change in strategy for a country that has historically addressed the armed conflict with militarization as opposed to addressing root causes of conflict such as poverty and lack of opportunity.\n\nAnd while Colombia is far from total peace, he said, striking deals with bigger militias like ELN guerrillas could create an important “domino effect” in pushing other, smaller groups to demobilize and lower levels of violence.\n\n“The people don’t want war, they don’t want arms, or politics as we know it,” he said. “They want change that will give this society a future. That’s what we want with this project of ‘total peace’: a future.”",

    "Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry are Colombia's new promising fruits": "The new trades seek to consolidate international markets, such as Mexico and the USA. Both Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry have registered increases in exports during 2022.\n\nThe Colombian fruit export market continues to reactivate and grow. One of the strategies of several entities is to do so with the promising fruits produced there.\n\nThis comes along with a drive to consolidate in international markets. According to reports from ProColombia and the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), the ten most exported fruits are the following:\n\nThe main destinations for this exports are the following countries :\n\nAccording to Catalina Hernández, vice-president of Exports of ProColombia, both Cape gooseberry and passion fruit have great potential.\n\nAs for the first one, between January and July there was an increase of 5.6% in exports, reaching US$ 21.5 million. Recently explored markets include Mexico, Singapore, Brazil and Panama. Admissibility was obtained in Mexico. Although exports to that market have not yet been registered, studies have been shared with companies to support Colombian exporters in their internationalization processes.\n\nPassion fruit, on the other hand, grew by 25.8% during the first seven months of the year, registering US$30.7 million.\n\nFor this fruit, admissibility in the U.S. is a priority. Additionally, Italy was the market that showed the most growth during the first half of 2022.\n\nHernández also advises that, in order to reach international markets more efficiently, exotic fruit producers must adapt their supply to the requirements of these markets. Sustainability, detailed information on the products and a constant relationship with commercial partners are key. The latter is crucial in order to be aware of new forms of consumption and channels.\n\nHernández also explains that, because they are Colombian exotic fruits, other countries do not know how to consume them. For this reason, it is essential that the exporter and promotion entities support the process of educating and raising awareness in international markets.\n\nHow to achieve export success?\n\nThe Colombian Fruit and Vegetable Association (ASOHOFRUCOL) says that to ensure success in the export sector and encourage exports, they provide comprehensive technical assistance from planting to marketing.\n\nThey provide technical and financial resources in their certification processes regarding the quality seals required by the markets.\n\nThe ASOHOFRUCOL also helps strengthen the entrepreneurship of producers, they promote commercial approaches to link producers with formal allies that aim to export and provide training in relevant technical aspects for proper harvesting and post-harvesting.\n\nAlejandro Ángel, general manager of Caribbean Exotics, points out that these fruits are so sought after for their flavor, color, aroma, texture and high nutritional content.\n\nCaribbean Exotics is a leading company in the sector with more than 30 years of experience exporting exotic fruits to 16 countries.\n\nFor example, Cape gooseberries are a source of vitamin A (3,000 I.U. of carotene per 100 grams), vitamin C, vitamin B complex, protein (0.3%) and phosphorus (55%). Research has shown that it may help prevent diabetes when consumed.\n\nAdditionally, passion fruit is a source of antioxidants, healthy fats, calcium, phosphorus, iron and is rich in fiber and vitamins A, B and C.\n\n\"Thanks to the marketing strategy, Caribbean Exotics can ensure the supply of such fruits 365 days a year. Our suppliers are located in the best regions where soil conditions are optimal, so we can guarantee their quality standard,” Angel said.\n\n“In recent years we have reached Saudi Arabia for the first time, although according to information from the sector, these Colombian fruits also reach Lebanon and the Czech Republic.\n\n“Other countries such as Holland, Germany, Canada, France, Spain and the United Arab Emirates have had significant growth in recent years.\" Angel concluded.",

    "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years": "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years\n\nWhat might the official re-opening of the border to trade between Colombia and Venezuela mean for the two countries - and for the record number of Venezuelans trying to leave their own country?\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST:\n\nThe border between Colombia and Venezuela has been officially closed to trade for nearly seven years. The countries recently reestablished diplomatic ties. And on Monday, the border reopens to all traffic. Commercial flights between the countries will also resume soon. Manuel Rueda is on the Colombian side of the border for NPR. Good morning.\n\nMANUEL RUEDA, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning, Ayesha.\n\nRASCOE: Why did the border between the two countries close to trade in the first place?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this began in 2015, when the smuggling of cheap, subsidized goods from Venezuela was increasing into Colombia. And then there was an incident where three Venezuelan soldiers were killed, apparently by smugglers. So that kind of launched everything. And after that, the Venezuelan president shut down the border. Then in 2019, tensions flared up again when the Colombian government, with the help of the U.S., was trying to deliver truckloads of aid, of food to the opposition in Venezuela as part of a greater effort to help the opposition groups in Venezuela. After that, the shutdown intensified for a year. Then it's been open for some time just to foot traffic. But on Monday, things will begin to normalize again because we'll see, you know, more commerce - trucks going along the border with different types of goods.\n\nRASCOE: So you've been talking to people on both sides of the border. What will this mean for them and the region as a whole?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this will be very important for businesses on both sides of the border because they can get exchange - for example, raw materials - with each other, without having to resort to smugglers who take goods along dirt paths, you know, along the border, which is what they've been doing for now. So, for example, I was talking to a baker in the town of - on the Venezuelan side, who said, I can import flour from - I could import flour from Colombia now without having to resort to the smugglers, and maybe that'll make my products cheaper. So that's expected to activate the local economy.\n\nRASCOE: And so record numbers of Venezuelans are leaving their country. Will this change encourage more to stay?\n\nRUEDA: Well, not for now, I think. The economic situation in Venezuela is still quite difficult, and it's going to take some time to get that sorted out. So for example, yesterday, I was driving along a road that goes from the Colombian border into the center of Venezuela, and you can still see many people there walking along the road. These are immigrants from Venezuela trying to get into the center of Colombia and to other countries. And they're just walking - right? - because they can't afford the bus fare, you know?\n\nAnd I met a young man there in one of the shelters. He's 21 years old. And he's telling me, look. In Venezuela, I was working at a chicken plant, and my salary was $20 a month, which is more or less the minimum wage in Venezuela at the moment. So he says, you know, this is no way to live. So that's why, you know, people are still leaving. I mean, in August, there were about - Venezuelans were encountered in the border between Mexico and the United States about 25,000 times, which was four times higher than the number of encounters of Venezuelans in August of last year. So you can still see that people are moving...\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: ...And people will continue to leave Venezuela while the economic situation does not get sorted out.\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: This reopening of the border...\n\nRASCOE: Oh, I...\n\nRUEDA: ...Is a first step.\n\nRASCOE: Thank you.\n\nRUEDA: But there's still...\n\nRASCOE: Thank you. That's Manuel Rueda at the Colombia-Venezuela border. Thank you so much.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Hope for Colombia?": "Francia Márquez serves alongside Colombia’s first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, whose manifesto promises to bring much-needed reform to Colombia.\n\nYet Márquez has stepped into government - the very institution that has for so long excluded the communities she represents.\n\nI’m curious to see how she will be received by congress and whether her activist spirit will shine through in her new position of power and influence.\n\nJustice\n\nMárquez is the daughter of miners. Her lineage is deeply rooted within Afro-Colombian artisanal gold mining in her ancestral town of La Tomba – which has long been threatened by multinational mining companies and land grabs.\n\nHaving become a single parent at 16 years old, Márquez became a miner herself to support her family. She was able to see with her own eyes that the very land she had lived, breathed, and worked on was being threatened by the encroachment of multinational corporations.\n\n“We as a people came to have lands that were fought for by our ancestors. When I speak, it is from a place of justice, not just for black people but for Indigenous peoples, women, and nature itself\", said Márquez in a documentary after winning the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2018.\n\nShe added: “I was just a mining woman and didn’t understand the legal language.”\n\nExplosive\n\nThis is what led her to study the law and eventually become a human rights lawyer. She has long represented Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities.\n\nShe put her law degree studies on hold when black holes began appearing in the red earth rich with gold and rare minerals.\n\nHordes of illegal miners employed by an international gold firm began infiltrating Márquez’s hometown. Márquez spearheaded a ten-day, 350-mile protest march to Bogotá. The marchers stayed in the capital for another 22 days, demanding the withdrawal of the mining company from La Tomba.\n\nThe government agreed and ordered the mining company to leave. When they refused to budge, government forces used explosives to remove the mining equipment.\n\nCommunity\n\nSince that day, Márquez has become a victim of a series of death threats – unable to return to her hometown without being escorted by security forces.\n\nIn response to the success, which led to her winning the Goldman Environmental Prize, she said: “This fight has not only been mine, but the entire community. I was the one that gave it a voice, and sometimes I have given it a face, but we have done all of together.”\n\nMárquez's story is extraordinary, and her entry into a largely elite system is a big step for Colombia’s rural, marginalised populations, who have long battled governments for land rights.\n\nHer political manifesto, which is translated as the The Nobodies, promises recognition for those who have been dispossessed and victims of Colombia’s long history of struggle.",
    "Colombia’s ‘dinosaur of peace’": "Researchers now know that, around 175 million years ago, a 12-metre long sauropod, roamed around an area of northern Colombia. The scientific world is attributing the discovery of this new species of herbivorous dinosaur to the improved security situation that exists in Colombia since the signing of a 2016 peace deal, which put an end to half a century of civil war.\n\nJust two years after the signing of the agreement, it was deemed safe for a group of researchers from the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, and the University of Michigan, United States, to visit the Serranía del Perijá, and gather fresh data.\n\n© Marcos Guevara Professor Aldo Rincón and his guide, Pedro Pablo Contreras, conducting fieldwork in the Serranía del Perijá mountain range.\n\nSearching for clues, 80 years on\n\nThe scientists returned to the place where a fossil of a dinosaur dorsal spine vertebra was found by a geologist working for an oil company in 1943. At the time no-one knew that it was part of a brand-new species and, after the find, the fossil was taken, along with some sediment samples, to the United States and given to the University of California scientific collection at Berkeley.\n\nAldo Rincón Burbano, professor at the Department of Physics and Geosciences at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla and one of the research leaders in Colombia, acknowledged that \"without the security conditions provided in the area today, it would have been difficult to return to the field. This is due to the Peace Agreement.\"\n\nThose security conditions are monitored by the UN Verification Mission in Colombia, which was established by the Security Council in 2017 to support the progress of the Peace Agreement, and verify the reintegration of former combatants of the FARC-EP rebel group and their families into Colombian society.\n\n© UNVMC/Jorge Quintero Félix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC combatant, was one of Professor Aldo Rincón's guides at the ETCR in Tierra Grata.\n\nFrom fighter to guide\n\nFormer FARC-EP fighters provided logistical services, lodging, and guides for the researchers, as they tried to locate the site where the fossil had been unearthed some 80 years earlier.\n\nFélix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC-EP combatant who now works on an ecotourism project in Tierra Grata, accompanied them on long walks, searching for the exact spot. \"I didn't know they were looking for a dinosaur because they were studying rocks; luckily I was familiar with the area because the former 41st front of the FARC operated there\".\n\n\"We spent almost a year in the process, writing and searching, and although we didn't find any new fossils, we managed to get to the site and find the same sediment collected alongside the vertebra in 1943”, says Mr. Rincón. “By studying the sediment, we were able to conclude that the vertebra was from a new genus, and a new species.”\n\nThey named the species Perijasaurus lapaz: the first part after the place where it was found, and the second as a tribute to the historic Peace Agreement. The dinosaur is similar to other sauropods of this period found in Asia, North Africa, and southern Patagonia, which were smaller than the later dinosaurs belonging to this group.\n\n“We still must look for more fossils in rocks of the same age in other areas of the country. Including the Tatacoa desert in Huila; the Girón area in Santander; and Nobsa in Boyacá,\", says Mr. Rincón.\n\nMr. Arango, the former combatant who accompanied Mr. Rincón and his team, says that, hopefully, these other investigations can also tell the story of the experience of former combatants, who now, thanks to peace, play a different role in society.",

    "What Health Care in Colombia Could Look Like Under the Petro Government": "BOGOTÁ, Colombia—The center of this South American capital city filled out on August 6 with Indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians and peasants dressed in traditional attire to carry out the spiritual inauguration of recently elected President Gustavo Petro. The event took place a day before the official inauguration and was accompanied by rituals, songs and speeches.\n\nFor the first time in decades, fear does not reign among the vulnerable and historically abandoned sections of society. Representatives of these groups saluted the president during the inauguration.\n\n“Certainly, the only possible path to real transformation in the country will be achieved with articulated and respectful work between governmental bodies and our own forms of government,” said human-rights defender Marcela Londoño, while reading the popular mandate the collective handed to Petro.\n\nThe Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities that campaigned in favor of center-left former militant Petro and the first Afro-Colombian woman vice-president, Francia Márquez, helped the pair win up to 99 percent of votes in some regions. Now, these oppressed communities see Petro’s proposal to reform healthcare—among other aspects of Colombian society—as aligning with their culture as well as their spiritual understanding.\n\n“[Under the current system], health is seen as a business that does not value life,” said Mama Luz Dary Aranda, governor of the Guambia reservation in the Cauca department, in an interview with this reporter. “The proposal presented by Petro is the opposite.”\n\n‘Health for Life and Not for Business’\n\nPetro’s campaign promoted the slogan, “health for life and not for business,” advocating a reformed healthcare system based on the principles of prevention, participation, decentralization and an intercultural approach. Part of the proposed solution would involve creating a National Health Council, with the participation of civil society including, academics, healthcare workers, patients, peasants, and Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples. Other proposals include ending EPSs (Empresas Prestadoras de Servicios or intermediary health providers); improving scientific investigation and technological development; investing in education; and fighting climate change, among others.\n\nDuring the first healthcare meeting between Indigenous peoples and the Ministry of Health that took place on September 7, Minister Carolina Corcho ratified the compromise of working with the communities to develop the healthcare reform and announced future visits to continue the dialogue.\n\n“The political will by the government of Gustavo Petro—and today more specifically by the Ministry—is very important for this [Indigenous health] system to become a reality,” said Polivio Rosales, senator of the Indigenous Authorities Movement political party.\n\nIncorporating Indigenous Practices\n\nPetro’s program could contribute to complying with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommendation that health policies and programs should recognize and include traditional practices, such as medicine, to ensure the participation of the populations involved, as well as take into account respect for human rights, an intercultural approach, and gender equality.\n\nAfter modernizing medicinal production and engaging government officials—among other actions—the Indigenous and Intercultural Health System (IIHS) was founded in 2014. Yet, such advances have been unequally implemented.\n\n“Within the state’s policies, the Indigenous wisdom of health automatically becomes only an ancestral practice or a belief,” said Mama Ximena Hurtado, director of the Mama Dominga Hospital and health program coordinator on the Indigenous reservation of Guambia in the Cauca department. The title, “Mama,” is given to a woman who holds or has held a position within the Misak government. “Those words minimize our own science, and create a disadvantage and a barrier.”\n\nIn the days before and after Petro’s inauguration, he and a delegation of ministers held regional summits. The administration has prioritized historically abandoned regions, such as the Pacific, the Amazon and the island of San Andrés in the Caribbean Sea, where inequality as well as poor access to healthcare and education reign. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have participated in these summits.\n\nMisak People Develop a Healthcare Model\n\nMost Misak—around 21,000 people or 1.5 percent of the Colombian population—live on the Guambia reservation. It is located in the steep southwestern mountains of the Cauca region, a rich ecosystem characterized by moors, or high-altitude grasslands. This community has been leading nationally in developing a healthcare model, as well as in the recovery of traditional practices.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Misak community began taking back ancestral territories through occupation and, later, by negotiating with the government. Within this land, they have set up the House of Medicine Sierra Morena and the Mama Dominga Hospital. The Payan House of Memory, a three-story building constructed according to Misak traditional architectural practices, preserves their history and knowledge.\n\n“This generation has had the opportunity to receive both types of knowledge: The Western and the one taught here by the ‘shures’ and the ‘shuras’ (traditional doctors), which are transmitted from generation to generation and based on the knowledge about plants,” explained Floresmiro Calambas, in charge of the laboratory in the House of Medicine Sierra Morena.\n\nWithin the House of Medicine, the community has set up a medicinal garden with more than 200 species of plants that are processed in the laboratory to be distributed in the community. Misak people affiliated with the healthcare system can acquire natural medicines free of charge. Other services include midwifery, physiotherapy and care from a traditional doctor.\n\nThe Misak community also manages Mama Dominga Hospital, where locals can access basic health services.\n\n“Many of our Indigenous people do not like to leave the territory for fear of how they will be treated or because they do not speak the language,” Mama Ximena said.\n\nThe availability of a healthcare model within the Misak territory guarantees wider coverage in the community, closing the healthcare gap other rural Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have experienced.\n\nAranda argues respecting traditional knowledge while deploying Western practices, when necessary, is essential.\n\n“Sometimes the national healthcare system wants to impose their institutional practices on us,” she said.\n\n‘The Transition Will Be Difficult and We Understand It’\n\n“As Indigenous Peoples, we see health as a whole,” said Alberto Mendoza, delegate of the Wayuu people, after the September 7 meeting. “For that reason, the lack of water or the consumption of low-quality water, as well as the absence of sustainability, impact the health of individuals, families and communities.”\n\nDuring the Pacific region summit, Petro announced Márquez will facilitate regional equality. He committed to designating the first social expenditure to this region as it is the most unequal. Multidimensional poverty in the Pacific region—which takes into account access to health, education and employment—increased from 26 percent to 31 percent between 2019 and 2020.\n\nPetro recognized during his inauguration speech that the government needs to secure resources to implement social reforms.\n\nCongress members like Gustavo Bolivar recently have denounced the poor state of finances left by the previous president, Iván Duque. According to a report presented by the government transition team, the healthcare system has a budget deficit of 6.4 billion pesos (about $1.4 million) for 2022 and 4.6 billion (about $1 million) for 2023.\n\nA tax reform has already been presented in congress that is expected to raise about 25 billion pesos ($5.76 million) over the next year to help execute social programs. The reform includes increasing personal income taxes for the top 2 percent, who earn more than 10 million pesos monthly (around $2,300). Fossil-fuel exports and sugar-based products also will be taxed. The latter tax is designed to reduce health problems associated with sugar consumption.\n\nAranda recognizes Petro’s proposal will take time.\n\n“The transition will be difficult and we understand it,” she said. “But this is when new proposals will be needed and we believe we will be heard to present our proposals on Indigenous healthcare.”\n\n‘Food As Healthcare’\n\nIndigenous communities understand health goes beyond the absence of an illness. To them, health is linked to the environment, their territory, agricultural practice and nature in general. A relationship that, according to Mama Ximena, previous governments have not understood.\n\n“For us, for instance, food and food production are part of healthcare and, therefore, should be financed,” she said. “But [the Health Ministry] sees it as a responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.”\n\nPetro’s health reform proposal, as well as a wide range of policies that address education, drinking water, the environment and climate change, align with the cosmovision (understanding of life) of Indigenous communities.\n\n“It looks at how health can become a right,” Aranda said, “so that we all can live with dignity.”",
    "Colombia May Shoot Itself In The Foot With Ban On Fracking": "The controversial hydrocarbon technique hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, which sparked the U.S. oil boom catapulting that country to become the largest petroleum producer globally, is drawing considerable attention in Latin America. A major fracking boom is underway in the region’s third largest economy, Argentina, which is driving oil and natural gas production to record highs. Mexico is also embracing the controversial hydrocarbon extraction technique to boost economically crucial petroleum output. Fracking is also under consideration in Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay as Latin American economies, hit hard by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, struggle to boost growth and government income while reducing soaring poverty. In stark contrast the strife-torn Colombia is seeking to ban fracking with newly appointed leftwing President Gustavo Petro having campaigned on an anti-extractivist platform.\n\nDuring his electoral campaign Colombia’s first ever leftwing president stated he intended to end contracting for oil exploration and ban fracking in the Andean country. This will sharply impact Colombia’s hydrocarbon dependent economy and potentially cut funding for Petro’s planned programs aimed at alleviating poverty. For over a decade Colombia has punched well-above its weight when it comes to hydrocarbon production. Despite a lack of proven oil reserves, which at the end of 2021 amounted to just over 2 billion barrels sufficient for 7.6 years of production, Colombia is Latin America’s third largest oil producer. The expansion of the oil industry over the last two decades, with annual average petroleum output exceeding one million barrels per day for the first time during 2013, saw petroleum become a key economic driver.\n\nCrude oil is Colombia’s largest export responsible for around a third of the Andean country’s total exports by value. Data from Colombian government statistics agency, DANE, shows the Andean country exported $12.1 billion of crude oil and derivative products for the first seven months of 2022. That represents 35% of all exports, which totaled $34.6 billion, for the period, making petroleum Colombia’s single largest export. The peak oil industry body, the Colombian Petroleum Association, estimated the hydrocarbon sector (Spanish) directly contributed $20 trillion Colombian pesos to government coffers during 2021 which was a considerable increase over the $11.5 trillion generated in 2020 but less than the $26.2 trillion paid during 2019. The industry body believes that amount will rise to over $24 trillion pesos for 2022. Those numbers indicate Colombia’s oil industry is responsible for generating around a fifth of government revenue. That underscores the industry’s importance as a source of fiscal income, especially with the Petro administration planning to hike government spending on social programs in an uncertain economic environment weighed down by runaway inflation and fears of a global recession.\n\nRelated: Oil Falls Below $80 As Powell Warns A Recession May Be Looming\n\n\n\nColombia’s endemic lack of proven oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with an absence of large-scale discoveries for two-decades, points to fracking being the only viable means of sustaining the Andean country’s vital hydrocarbon sector. This is especially the case with Colombia’s proven oil reserves set to expire by around 2030 and sooner if production returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 880,000 barrels per day. Since 2017 Colombia has been facing a natural gas crisis, which forced the country to start importing liquified natural gas in December 2017. That further stresses the need for Bogota to focus on bolstering energy security and expanding hydrocarbon reserves, particularly with proven natural gas reserves of nearly 3.164 trillion cubic feet only capable of sustaining production for eight years.\n\nFracking has long been seen as a solution to Colombia’s limited proven hydrocarbon reserves. The U.S. EIA estimates Colombia has at least 5.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and 20.1 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the Middle Magdalena and Llanos Basins alone. Colombia’s highest administrative tribunal the Council of State in a July 2022 ruling overturned its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, established in 2018, and rejected a lawsuit seeking to ban fracking in Colombia. The court found that the rules implemented by the Duque administration, which left office on 7 August 2022 when Petro was inaugurated, for fracking are legal. The decision opened the door for the commencement of commercial fracking operations in Colombia.\n\nNonetheless, moves are afoot by Petro’s administration to ban fracking in Colombia despite the Council of State of Ruling. The Andean country’s Congress recently held a hearing for Bill 114 of 2022 (Spanish) which seeks to prohibit hydraulic fracturing of the exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits. The bill is supported by Colombia’s President whose Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development Susana Muhammad was quoted as stating in local media (Spanish):\n\n“We believe that fracking and unconventional ones are not a path that accelerates the energy transition because it would delay it, has high environmental costs especially in land use, in the use of water and irrigation not known and difficult to know only, as is the impact on the very complex Colombian geology,\"\n\nFor the bill to proceed it must be debated by a congressional commission and discussed in both chambers before approval and authorization by Colombia’s president.\n\nRising uncertainty surrounding fracking saw Colombia’s state-controlled energy company Ecopetrol request permission (Spanish) from the industry regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH – Spanish initials), to suspend its two fracking pilots for 90-days. Ecopetrol, which is the operator, partnered with ExxonMobil to develop two fracking projects in the Middle Magdalena Valley, near the municipality of Puerto Wilches, known as Kale and Platero. The pilots are attracting substantial opposition from the local community, primarily over concerns regarding water contamination. A Barrancabermeja court ruled in the favor of a community organization which sought to end the projects on the basis that Ecopetrol had not consulted with the local community as required by Colombian law. The Administrative Court of Santander later overruled that decision finding the request for prior consultation by the local Afrowilches community was inadmissible. Those events indicate that even if Bill 114 of 2022 is not passed into law considerable opposition to fracking will continue in Colombia, making its introduction fraught with uncertainty, thereby deterring the required investment from energy companies.\n\nBy Matthew Smith for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

The organization also runs many smaller missions that support conflict-resolution and justice efforts in specific countries, including several in Latin America. Though they don’t always make headlines, these U.N. projects often serve as important arbiters.\n\nColombia offers one example. U.N. monitors were critical to the rapid demobilization of guerrilla fighters after the country’s 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was signed. Today, the U.N. mission in Colombia is assisting new President Gustavo Petro’s efforts to explore a demobilization deal with other guerrilla fighters who sat out of the negotiations six years ago.\n\nThe mission’s “fundamental legitimacy and strength comes from the fact that both sides [of the 2016 peace deal] called for it to be there,” the International Crisis Group’s Ivan Briscoe told Foreign Policy. Even when Iván Duque—who had been opposed to the deal and was resistant to putting his full support behind it—took Colombia’s presidential office in 2018, the mission found a way to continue its work and preserve its legitimacy, Briscoe said.\n\nIn Honduras, U.N. envoys are currently in talks with President Xiomara Castro’s government about opening a special anti-corruption commission in partnership with local prosecutors and judges. A similar U.N.-backed commission was founded in Guatemala in 2007, and Castro had pledged to establish one in Honduras when she campaigned for the presidency late last year.\n\nA previous Organization of American States (OAS)-backed effort to install an anti-corruption commission in Honduras in 2016 was short lived, and its mandate was allowed to expire under Castro’s predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was extradited to the United States and charged for drug trafficking this year.\n\nFor such a commission to be effective, analysts have argued, it must be free from political inference. Though Guatemala’s commission revolutionized anti-corruption work in the country over the course of about a decade, then-Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales shut it down in 2018—when it began to investigate him. Castro and the U.N. are negotiating just how much independence the commission will have; for example, U.N. envoys have hesitated at her proposal to allow her administration to choose its investigators, El Faro reported.\n\n“Castro’s challenge lies in keeping [her party’s] nose out of the judiciary,” El Faro’s Roman Gressier wrote. If the commission moves forward with independence, it will amount to “[swimming] against the current … in a region whose courts and top prosecutors … have become subservient to the sitting governments.”\n\nMeanwhile, a U.N. fact-finding mission on Venezuela this week released a new report documenting government forces’ torture and rape of detainees from 2014 to the present and tracing the human rights abuses to plans orchestrated “at the highest levels of the government.” Last month, 125 Venezuelan and international civil society and human rights groups praised the U.N. mission and called for its renewal, writing that it has “advanced a search for truth, justice, and reparation.”\n\nThe groups called the U.N. mission’s work complementary to stalled negotiations on Venezuela’s political crisis, writing that its recommendations identify problems that must be addressed in the talks—whenever they resume.\n\nCurrent U.N. missions in Latin America do not always garner this kind of praise from local human rights groups. In Haiti in particular, some civil society advocates have fiercely criticized the U.N. mission there—which has a mandate to enforce political stability, peace, and human rights—for continuing to back unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry as the country has experienced violent unrest in the wake of former President Jovenel Moïse’s 2021 assassination.\n\nStill, the aforementioned U.N. efforts in Colombia, Venezuela, and Honduras are providing support for peace and justice work in ways their polarized host societies would not be able to do alone.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24: The foreign ministers of the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are slated to meet on the sidelines of the U.N.

Human Rights Council discusses Venezuela.\n\nSunday, Oct. 2: Brazilians vote in congressional elections and the first round of the presidential election.\n\nWhat We’re Following\n\nDisaster anniversaries. Mexico and the Caribbean were pummeled by natural disasters on the anniversaries of previous tragedies this week. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit Mexico on Sept. 19, the same day as disastrous 2017 and 1985 quakes, while Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Turks and Caicos Islands on the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria.\n\nFiona’s damage was vast, with Puerto Rican authorities registering up to eight deaths by Thursday. The island also experienced a blackout, and 1 million people were reportedly still without power by Thursday morning. In Mexico, Monday’s quake, which left two people dead, came just hours after residents of Mexico City had participated in an earthquake readiness drill. A subsequent quake on Thursday, which President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called an aftershock, also reportedly killed at least two people.\n\nBukele on the ballot. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said last Thursday that he plans to seek reelection in 2024, an announcement that surprised few. El Salvador’s constitution prohibits presidential reelection, but last year, a panel on the country’s Supreme Court—then recently stacked with pro-Bukele justices—ruled it should be allowed. At the time, the U.S. State Department was among those publicly criticizing the ruling.\n\nReactions from human rights and democracy advocates were harsh. “Today, a new [Hugo] Chávez emerges,” tweeted José Miguel Vivanco, a former Human Rights Watch Americas chief.\n\nThe announcement also prompted a letter from a forum of former Latin American and Spanish leaders that urged the OAS to take measures to “promote the normalization of democratic institutionality” in El Salvador, invoking the OAS’s charter on democracy.\n\nA Guatemalan Indigenous man plays a Mayan ball game at San Juan La Laguna in Sololá, Guatemala, on Sept. 18, 2021.\n\nPause the soccer talk. Mexico’s national Indigenous and Traditional Games took place this month in the state of Sonora, pitting 500 Indigenous athletes against one another in 125 games and sporting activities. It was the 23rd such annual meeting.\n\nWhile some games played at the event involved physical tools—such as balls, gloves, and hockey-like sticks—it also featured mountain running and “mental skill games,” such as contests in how to plan for the harvest. Researchers attended the events to better understand how some of them were connected to Indigenous spirituality, organizer Ana Claudia Collado García told EFE news agency.\n\nOne of the sports played at the event was ulama, where players hit a heavy rubber ball back and forth using their hips. The pre-Colombian game was played across ancient Mexico and Central America and has enjoyed a revival in Mexico over the past decade, during which Mexico City even opened an ulama court. This month’s competition featured Mexico’s second national ulama tournament.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nWhich of the following guerrilla groups had already gone defunct by the time of Colombia’s 2016 peace agreement? National Liberation Army (ELN) First Capital Command (PCC) M-19 Los Pelusos Petro belonged to the group before it demobilized in 1990.

Lasso has sought such a restructuring since early in his presidency, which began last year, and traveled to Beijing in February to pursue it.\n\nUnder the 2007 to 2017 presidency of Rafael Correa, Ecuador took out billions of dollars in loans from China under terms that were opaque to the public, drawing criticism. By this February, Lasso said Ecuador’s outstanding debt to China was $4.6 billion.\n\nUnder the new deal, Ecuador will have three more years to pay back its debts to two Chinese state banks, now due in 2027 and 2032, and will also owe lower interest rates on those payments. Lasso said the deal would free up $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on debt repayments by 2025. Ecuador also owes China barrels of oil as part of a separate debt, and last week, Ecuador announced China would allow a delay in scheduled deliveries. This will grant Ecuador some additional $709 million in oil revenue through 2027, the country’s state oil company said.\n\n“This looks like a fairly standard rescheduling,” the Council on Foreign Relations’ Brad Setser tweeted about the news. “Necessary, but not earthshattering.”\n\nLasso celebrated the deal, and economic analyst Alberto Acosta-Burneo told Bloomberg that it was significant not only for providing short-term relief but also because it represented a “relaunch of the relationship with China” and could even pave the way for a new credit line from China in the future. Ecuador is on a tight repayment schedule to the International Monetary Fund and may have trouble borrowing on international capital markets because of its poor rankings from credit agencies, Bloomberg noted.\n\nChina has now carried out post-pandemic debt extensions in several countries, but it has rarely done so in cooperation with other creditors. The sheer scale of Chinese lending to developing countries has prompted scholars, such as Ulrich Volz at SOAS University of London, to call for a more multilateral approach to Chinese debt restructurings.",
    "Colombia relaunches plan to buy fighter jets": "SANTIAGO, Chile — Colombian President Gustavo Petro has reactivated the process to acquire new fighter jets to replace the country’s aging Kfir fleet.\n\nPetro’s decision may come as a surprise given his stance earlier this year on the campaign trail, when he said the purchase of combat aircraft or other military hardware would not be a priority during his time in office, if elected.\n\nMilitary sources in the capital Bogota, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their careers, told Defense News that the credit for Petro’s U-turn belongs to Gen. Luis Carlos Córdoba, the chief of the Colombian Air Force. They explained that Córdoba convinced Defense Minister Iván Velásquez about the urgent need to replace at least part of the Kfir fleet, which will begin retirements later this year, and Velásquez in turn persuaded the president.\n\nSince 1989, Colombia has acquired 24 Kfir jets, made by Israel Aerospace Industries. To counterbalance the acquisition of Sukhoi Su-32 fighters by Venezuela, Colombia’s Kfir fleet underwent upgrades between 2009 and 2017 performed by IAI’s Lahav Division.\n\nThe last upgrade, to the C-60 standard, involved fitting Elta Systems’ ELM-2032 active electronically scanned array radar and a data link as well as integrating Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ Derby weapon — an air-to-air, beyond-visual-range missile. IAI says that standard is equivalent to the F-16 Block 52.\n\nColombia’s modernized Kfirs are possibly the most advanced fighter jets with the most capable systems in service in South America. But the age of the airframes is taking its toll; between 2012 and 2014, multiple aircraft were lost in accidents, at one point grounding the entire fleet. Extensive maintenance support from IAI brought the aircraft back to service.\n\nThe Colombian government is now considering how it can afford to buy new fighters. The president is already pressing for investments in social issues, and about 25% of the country’s annual budget is earmarked to pay off debts.\n\nBogota-based independent defense and security analyst Erich Saumeth is skeptical.\n\n“President Preto came into power making many promises about social development spending, and has a core group of supporters that are not friendly about buying military equipment. On the other hand, the Army and Navy also have need of modernization,” Saumeth told Defense News. “So either nothing will happen, or [there will be] a not-so-good, sort-of-mediocre stopgap solution.”\n\nColombia previously received offers of secondhand Eurofigher Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighters, but the Air Force, which prefers single-engine aircraft, appears focused on Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and Saab’s Gripen. The government has already received offers of both new aircraft of the latest variants as well as secondhand, upgraded options.\n\nOne of the military sources told Defense News that “most likely a first batch of 12 aircraft will be procured” and that “secondhand offers of modern airframes with a large service life remaining and significant upgrade potential are surely to attract more interest than before.”\n\nJosé Higuera is the South America correspondent for Defense News, covering South American and Latin American affairs.",
    "Part 1: Colombia's advertisers recognise their agencies great work": "Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 in Colombia reconfirms the great potential of this market, which has historically surprised with its high satisfaction levels in advertiser-agency relations.\n\nSource © Flavia Carpio Unsplash Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 reconfirms the great potential of the Colombian market\n\nThe following positive results are revealed in Scopen’s Agency Scope 2022 study in Colombia.\n\nSatisfaction of advertisers with their creative and media agencies\n\nAll indicators related to advertisers´ evaluation of their agencies are highly positive, and even better than those obtained in past editions, which were already good.\n\nAdvertisers declare themselves much more satisfied than in 2020 (43.6% declare themselves \"very satisfied\" with their creative agencies. 13.3% more than in 2020 and 39.6% with their media agencies - 10% points more than in the last edition).\n\nDue to this great satisfaction, the predisposition to change has decreased: 75.5% of advertisers will most definitely not change their creative agency and 76.9% their media agency (20 points more in 2020 in both cases).\n\nAll this reflects the great work that agencies are doing for advertisers. Of 47 service attributes analysed, in 32 of them, creative agencies are better valued than in the last edition; and of 35 attributes, media agencies evolve positively in 27 of them (especially in the digital area).\n\nAnd, not only that, but advertisers consider that their agencies are contributing more and more to the growth of their businesses (in both cases with a percentage close to 30%). That almost a third of business growth is due to the agency´s work reflects the importance that the advertising industry has when it comes to its clients ' businesses, and the great work they do together.\n\nConsequently, advertisers recommend their agencies to a greater extent (NPS grows by 15 points for both creative and media agencies) and advertiser-agency relationships are consolidated, both in duration (average duration grows by half a year) and, in the relationship model, becoming more and more ongoing and less for specific projects.\n\nThe great positioning that agencies have achieved in the minds of advertisers\n\nWhen we ask advertisers about their current internal challenges, they remain the same as in the past: strengthening their prestige and perception in the market and adapting to the new times.\n\nHowever, they are increasingly concerned about understanding their consumers and how to reach them, and betting internally on creativity, innovation and digital.\n\nOnce they´ve declared their challenges, we ask them which companies (agencies, media, platforms, consultants, etc.) they consider could help them face these challenges, and this is where the great change lies compared to the past.\n\nIt is no longer the large digital platforms that dominate the top positions (as was the case in 2020 and is still the case in most of the markets where we carry out the Agency Scope), but rather the most mentioned creative and media agencies.\n\nAdvertisers consider that they are the ones who can and have to help them overcome their challenges. They trust them and see them as responsible for this help.\n\nAnother point we ask advertisers is if, of all the agencies they work with, regardless of their profile, they consider any of them as their \"lead agency\" (an agency that leads the communication of their company and is the one that coordinates the rest of partners). In just six years, the percentage of customers who confirm this has almost doubled, increasing from 24% to 46%.\n\nThe agencies have positioned themselves internally with their clients, not just as providers of communication and marketing services, but as partners capable of leading, coordinating and implementing. The internal reinforcement that the agencies have made in key areas such as data, strategy and digital, has resulted in the current better positioning.\n\nAdvertisers´ in-house movement loses strength\n\nHistorically, Colombia has been a market in which important advertisers worked internally on their communication. When people began to talk about this trend in the UK we had already seen it in Colombia. It was a big concern for the agencies. Their competitors were no longer so much other agencies or consultancies or digital platforms, but rather their own clients.\n\nHowever, in this edition, we observe how advertisers work less in marketing areas and disciplines internally. And not only that but, compared to the rest of the markets, Colombia is behind when it comes to in-house services.\n\nThe great work of agencies with advertisers, their constant evolution in areas such as data, and business strategy among others, and the \"bad experiences\" of some advertisers that have tried out this trend, have been the main reasons behind this change. Work carried out by the agencies, their knowledge, their contribution are very complex to internalise.",
    "Five Ways Sustainable Travel is Accelerating Across Colombia": "The secret has long been out: Colombia is booming as a travel destination, and a visit now will reveal far more gringos visiting than what could be seen only a few short weeks before the global pandemic shut everything down. But now, travelers are back, and popular hotels, guesthouses and hostels are booking up fast. With an influx of visitors comes social and environmental risks, but there are ways to visit this incredible country while mitigating your impact, starting with a few examples below.\n\nNo, you don't need to kill anything now if you want a taco craving (Leon Kaye)\n\nVegan restaurants are easy to find and widely available\n\nColombian food is often brilliant in its simplicity: a protein with sides of starches such as rice, plantains, yucca and potatoes (usually fried) as well as a salad or vegetables. But for those visitors who prefer to avoid any animal products, vegan eateries are increasingly are becoming an option — and while Happy Cow is always a reliable source for locating these places, walking around any neighborhood to find a vegan place should be a matter of minutes, not hours.\n\nTake Medellín, for example. As in many Colombian cities, Mexican food has long become a thing. Walking around El Poblado, a neighborhood long popular with visitors for its forested landscape, range of accommodation and nightlife, it’s easy to find vegetarian and vegan options: and requesting a dish to be vegano is often accommodated. El Pablado itself has at least a couple places offering vegan tacos: Other popular eateries, such as Criminal Taquería, will tweak their menu items if requested.\n\nEven smaller towns, such as the lakeside resort of Guatapé, has vibrant vegan options – and the chances are high that you’ll see locals dining in restaurants as well.\n\nA vegan cazuela (stew), in Guatapé (Leon Kaye)\n\nMore responsible options for transport\n\nPublic transport is always the best option to get around, especially in Colombia, were traipsing within the city centers of Medellín, Bogotá and Cali will nudge you to wear a mask, even if COVID isn’t a concern of yours. Diesel emissions from old vehicles, paired with the fact many of Colombia’s larger cities are wedged between mountains, means dubious levels of emissions.\n\nUber says it is doing its part to take on this challenge. You won’t be able to book an electric car in Colombia yet, but the company is offering riders in big cities an “Uber Planet” option: a 2 percent increase in fees that Uber says will fund Anaconda Carbon, a non-profit partner that issues carbon bonds. These bonds will fund programs that will take on local climate action projects, boost biodiversity protection and reduce the environmental impact of illegal activities such as informal gold mining.\n\nIf you use Uber, keep in mind the fraught relationship the company as with the Colombian government. For a while, Uber was outright banned, but now the service is currently available. But depending on who you talk to, however, Uber is “illegal.” Drivers often keep their phones on their leg or close to the stick shift to avoid any attention from the police — they’ll also often ask you to sit in the front, so they don’t score any attention from police officers or any taxi drivers who resent the service.\n\nOther options to Uber include DiDi and Cabify, which allow you to book through a smartphone app but give you the option to pay the driver in cash.\n\nMedellín’s metro is a gem — fast, efficient and clean and about 3,000 pesos ($0.75) a ride, and they include transfers to most cable cars (gondola lines), which allow you to snap breathtaking views of the city.\n\nAttractions such as Jardín Botánico Joaquín Antonio Uribe in Medellín are accessible by the city's metro (Leon Kaye)\n\nCycling offers a great path toward learning more about Colombia\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of transportation, no trip to Colombia is complete without experiencing its cities and land from two wheels.\n\nPart of cycling’s popularity stems from that fact that Colombians were besides themselves when one of their own, Egan Bernal, won 2019’s Tour de France. In a race dominated for decades by the Belgians, Spanish, Italians and yes, the French, Bernal was the first Latin American to win the 2,200-mile (3,500 kilometers) race.\n\nThe surge in the popularity of cycling is seen in cities such as Bogotá, which has opened up new lanes in order to help citizens move more freely across the city. Bogotá, which years ago launched its ciclovía program on Sundays to encourage residents to walk or cycle on roads that ordinarily would be choking with cars and trucks, has expanded the program so that it’s now occurring daily. Depending on the day of the week, the length of streets closed to cars and opened to cyclists have expanded as much as five-fold. This is on top of the 300-plus miles (500 km) of permanent bicycle lanes that crisscross Colombia’s capital.\n\nMedellín and Cali are among other Colombian cities that have closed major roads on Sundays for years, in part to combat those urban areas’ stubborn air pollution. The success of those car-free days, or ciclovía, have led cities worldwide like Los Angeles to launch their own version of open street days.\n\nCycling tours in Colombia's cities are easy to book (Leon Kaye)\n\nPublic libraries for all\n\nColombia still has deep social divisions, evidenced in the recent elections that launched the country’s politically left president ever. The country of 52 million-plus people has one of the widest income gaps between the rich and poor worldwide. Nevertheless, some local governments deserve credit for addressing the problem. Medellín’s municipal government is one of them.\n\nAmong its various programs, Medellín’s parques bibliotecas (library parks) rank as among the most innovative tactics to expand social welfare. Over the past ten to fifteen years, many of these libraries were built in the poorest neighborhoods where social services were often non-existent or difficult to access. Most of them are architectural gems, deserving of a visit. Residents apparently agree, and the fact that these libraries have a full calendar of events geared to education and children certainly help boost their popularity.\n\nParque Biblioteca León De Greiff La Ladera, Medellín (via Facebook)\n\nVisiting national parks, with limits\n\nColombia’s lush biodiversity is one reason why travelers are increasingly finding their way to the country, whether they seek to trek up one of the few glaciers in a tropical zone, visit the lush Pacific coast or explore the country’s mountainous Zona Cafetera.\n\nBut that tidal wave of interest is paired with the risk of more ecological damage. To that end, local authorities have established limits on how many people can visit these natural wonders, including Los Nevados and Tayrona.\n\nImage credits: Leon Kaye",

We played together. She is one of us.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these remote parts, where destiny is shaped by water and gold, the reference was clear: Francia Elena Márquez, the most eminent, and provocative, citizen of La Toma, a string of villages and farmsteads spread over verdant hills and valleys that is home to some 8,000 people, overwhelmingly of African ancestry. Most are descendants of slaves brought to South America centuries ago by the Spanish to work in mines and on plantations.\n\nThe view from a hilltop in La Toma, Colombia, hometown of Vice President Francia Elena Márquez. (Liliana Nieto del Río / For The Times)\n\nMárquez is a single mother and former live-in maid who escaped rural poverty and threats to become an outspoken social activist — winner of the Goldman Prize, the so-called environmental Nobel, awarded for her battle against large-scale illegal gold mining.\n\nToday, Márquez, 40, sits improbably as Colombia’s vice president. She took office last month alongside President Gustavo Petro, 62, an ex-urban guerrilla and the first leftist chief executive of this nation of 50 million, long a key U.S. strategic ally.\n\nThe meteoric rise and ballot-box draw of Márquez — her charismatic appeal with minority, female and young voters helped boost Petro over the top in his third presidential bid — is a singular development, even at a moment when the left is again on the upswing in Latin America.\n\nPresident Gustavo Petro greets Vice President Francia Elena Márquez as Senate President Roy Barreras, left, and Chamber of Representatives President David Racero look on during the Aug. 7 inauguration in Bogota. (Guillermo Legaria / Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMárquez, who had never before held elective office, is the first person of African heritage to attain such a high post in Colombia, a country where discussion of race has mostly been muted, if not taboo. That is often the case in Latin America, where racism has persisted, typically in a less institutional, albeit no less insidious, manner than in the United States.\n\nHer high-profile advocacy has placed Márquez at the vanguard of an awakening of identity — and push for equality — among the country’s long-marginalized Afro-Colombian masses, who officially tally less than 10% of Colombia’s population. Advocates call that a vast undercount, reflecting centuries of neglect.\n\nColombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez takes part in a ritual during a traditional ceremony in her home municipality of Suarez on Aug. 13, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\n“People of African descent are at the bottom of the pyramid in terms of inequality,” said Helmer Quiñones, an activist who wears a Black Lives Matter pin on his lapel. “Francia Márquez is not the first great political leader in Colombia of African descent. But she also has a global profile, not just domestic.”\n\nMárquez’s big jewelry and multi-patterned outfits have emerged as a style point for admirers from backgrounds rural and urban, poor and wealthy. Her face stares from flamboyant wall murals, many proclaiming her campaign slogan: “Vivir sabroso” — roughly, live life to the fullest.\n\nAfro-Colombians were major participants in nationwide protests last year against what was then a conservative government. The massive street mobilizations, and police violence against protesters, set the stage for a “change” agenda in this year’s national voting.\n\nStill, many didn’t take Márquez’s chances seriously last year when she announced her bid for the presidency. But, in a March primary of the leftist Historic Pact coalition, she garnered almost 800,000 votes.\n\nPeople in Suarez, Colombia, watch the inauguration of President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez\n\non Aug. 7, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPetro, a sitting senator and former mayor of Bogota, the capital, won the primary and named Márquez his running mate; in a June runoff, the pair narrowly beat a conservative businessman. Their platform vowed social and political reformation of a nation battered by decades of civil war, narco-violence and deepening inequality.\n\nMárquez calls herself a champion of the “nobodies” — the county’s Black and Indigenous minorities, the poor, working-class women and others at the fringes of a nation historically dominated by a white-mestizo male elite based in the cool Andean climes of Bogota. Most of Colombia’s Afro-descendant peoples hail from the torrid zones along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.\n\nBeyond race, Márquez has unabashedly challenged sexism, classism, inequality and gender prejudice, among other incendiary topics. She has weathered threats against her life, racist taunts and denied allegations of links to armed guerrillas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternationally, Márquez has developed a kind of rock-star following as a fearless crusader for environmental, racial and gender justice, climate change and other timely issues.\n\n“I am part of the struggle against structural racism,” she declared in her 2018 Goldman Prize speech in San Francisco. “Among those women who raise their voices to stop the destruction of rivers, forests and wetlands. Among those who dream that, one day, all human beings are going to change the economic model of death to an economic model of life.”\n\nHer critics label her a divisive figure who deploys multicultural rhetoric to mask a lack of government experience in her ambitious march to the Casa de Narino, the presidential palace.\n\nA man holds a cardboard cutout of Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Bogota on Aug. 7, 2022. (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n“It’s very convenient for her and her followers to construct a defensive wall that characterizes as racist or classist any type of criticism,” Luis Guillermo Vélez, an opposition politician, wrote during the presidential campaign. “Francia Márquez’s personal story may be admirable.... But that doesn’t exempt her from responding to questions about her political ideas.”\n\nAfter less than two months in office, Márquez’s exact role in the new administration remains largely undefined, a fact that has unsettled some of her supporters. Márquez has pushed for the creation of a Ministry of Equality, with her at the helm. But that has yet to happen as Petro faces various daunting challenges, notably pacifying a deeply polarized nation.\n\n“The time has come to build peace, a peace that implies social justice,” Márquez said after the election.\n\nMárquez’s activist roots lie here in La Toma, one of a number of predominantly Afro-Colombian townships in Colombia’s southwestern Cauca department.\n\nThe region’s breathtaking beauty belies a harsh reality: It is a largely lawless, conflict-ridden zone where narco-traffickers harvest swaths of coca and marijuana, wildcat miners poison waterways and fell forests, and sundry armed groups — guerrillas, killers for hire, paramilitaries, criminal bands — hold sinister sway and grab land.\n\nColombia perennially ranks among the world’s most perilous places for activists protecting land and water resources. Scores are killed each year. And Cauca is ground zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the people of La Toma and environs, gold mining has historically been a key source of income, supplementing subsistence farming. But gold, and gold fever, have inevitably spurred conflict.\n\nResidents of La Toma have long practiced both alluvial mining — panning in the Ovejas for gold washed down from the hills — and digging for ore in tunnels cut deep into dirt and rock.\n\nIn an autobiographical article for Colombia’s El Espectador newspaper, Márquez recalled that Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were always dedicated to family gold mining. When she finished primary school, Márquez wrote, her mother — a midwife who had 11 children — said there was no money for further studies. But an aunt invited the young Márquez to work in a mine, a job that provided cash to buy a school uniform, books and cover other educational costs.\n\n“She was very studious, very extroverted and very involved with her process of education,” said Azael Balanta, 54, who was Márquez’s primary school teacher in her home village, Yolombo, one of five villages that make up La Toma, part of the municipality of Suárez. “But I never thought that the Francia Elena who was my student would so quickly become vice president of the Republic of Colombia.”\n\nLa Toma, Márquez wrote in El Espectador, has a history of land battles. Her grandfather and other elders were thrown into jail in a dispute with a landlord. Relatives gathered gold to pay a lawyer to help free them.\n\n“The struggle in my territory, in my community ... has passed from generation to generation,” Márquez wrote.\n\nIn her youth, she wrote, outsiders would casually fling racist insults — “You are descendants of slaves.” Or: “You come from Africa, a miserable place.”\n\nEarly on, Márquez also heard about environmental injustice. The 1980s construction of the Salvajina Dam, on the Cauca River, near La Toma, was widely condemned. The project flooded the lands of thousands of Afro-Colombian and other farmers and devastated traditional fishing, mining and agricultural activities, residents say.\n\nAs a teenager, Márquez joined her La Toma neighbors in protesting a multinational company’s plan to divert the Ovejas river — La Toma’s essential water source — to boost power for the Salvajina Dam.\n\nThe rising price of gold eventually drew the interest of multinational companies and others keen to cash in on the area’s treasures. Márquez became a plaintiff in a 2010 lawsuit alleging that Colombian authorities had awarded mining rights in La Toma without soliciting community input, as required by law. Colombia’s highest court agreed and suspended the concessions, a major victory — and a signal to Márquez that the legal system could be an ally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople work at a street market in Suarez, Colombia. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nStill, the situation in La Toma and surrounding areas was becoming more fraught. In April 2010, gunmen killed eight miners along the Ovejas. Residents blamed right-wing paramilitary forces in the employ of mining interests. Authorities pointed to leftist guerrillas who impose extortion fees on anyone mining on their turf.\n\nSoon, a rash of bulldozers and backhoes moved into La Toma, tearing up the riverbank and hillsides in search of gold. Gunmen threatened anyone who stood in the miners’ way, residents said. The influx worsened deforestation and increased dumping into the Ovejas of mercury and cyanide, two highly toxic chemicals widely used to separate gold from rock.\n\nThe mass intrusion into La Toma provided the impetus for Márquez’s signature act: In November 2014, she burst onto the national stage leading a march of 80 Black women — known as the March of the Turbans, after their African-inspired head attire — from La Toma to Bogota, more than 300 miles away, protesting the presence of the illegal miners.\n\nThe demonstrators remained outside the Interior Ministry for three weeks, demanding a solution. Finally, the government relented and agreed to evict the illegal miners.\n\nBy then, Márquez was a single mother of two, and had received threats. Joining the ranks of millions of Colombians displaced by violence, she had left vulnerable La Toma for the city of Cali, home to a large Afro-Colombian population, and began studying law.\n\nIn 2015, Márquez received a national human rights award. Three years later, she won the Goldman Prize, which thrust her into international prominence.\n\n“She overcame sexism, racism and corruption to lead La Toma’s struggle,” the Goldman citation said. Not long afterward, while working at cleaning houses, Márquez told a newspaper editor: “I’m going to be president one day.”\n\nIn La Toma, reached on a bumpy two-hour drive from the nearest major city, Márquez is a figure of adulation. She has also raised some modest expectations — that running water will finally be widely available, that more roads will be paved, that educational opportunities will improve, that the pervasive sense of insecurity will diminish.\n\nA mural portrays Colombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Suarez. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We want to be able to keep on studying to become better people, just like Francia did,” said Doris Adriana Ocoró, 22, a nursing student who was panning for gold on a recent morning with her husband, as her daughter, 3, watched. “We have learned a lot from Francia, and from our ancestors.”\n\nOver at the Santa Rosa de Lima school, students said Márquez’s ascension had also inspired them. At an outdoor musical performance, Jinller Leany, 12, and Andrea Torres, 15, sang a song about dignity and pride:\n\nI was born Black and my companion is the sun\n\nTo the rhythm of the marimba and first the drum\n\nMy name is African mixed with Spanish ...\n\nI am proud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nProud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nBlack I was born, and Black I am.\n\nSpecial correspondents Liliana Nieto del Río in La Toma and Cecilia Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.",

    "Colombia Expects Record Passenger Numbers In 2022": "Colombia has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas in 2022.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities (Aerocivil) expect the country to receive up to 46 million passengers in 2022, which would be an all-time record, surpassing pre-pandemic traffic levels by nearly 12%. Colombia, fueled by the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers such as Viva and Ultra Air, and a strong recovery from domestic powerhouses Avianca and LATAM, has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas this year.\n\nFlying high\n\nAerocivil released the latest traffic numbers this week, stating that the airlines in this country carried 31.6 million passengers between January and August. This number represents an 85.6% increase compared to 2021 levels and a 17% increase compared to 2019 levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDomestically, Avianca has carried around eight million passengers, followed by LATAM Colombia, with approximately six million passengers, and Viva Colombia, with about 4.5 million travelers.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities estimate that, by the end of 2022, close to 46 million passengers will travel to and from the country. If this number is achieved, the traffic levels will grow by nearly 12% compared to 2019, when Colombia received 41.13 million travelers.\n\nGuillermo Fransico Reyes González, Colombia’s new Minister of Transportation, said that the record numbers posted by the South American country are not only an achievement of the airline industry and local authorities “but also a commitment to Colombians, to whom we have to provide increasingly accessible and quality services.”\n\nFrancisco Ospina Ramírez, director of Aerocivil, added that growth presents the country “with enormous challenges to continue strengthening airport infrastructure and operations in general. We are committed to the country and the air connectivity of its people.”\n\nColombia expects to receive up to 44 million passengers this year. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe strongest recovery\n\nColombia became the country with the most robust recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), Colombia had a 9% increase in international passengers up until July 2022, and a 22% growth in the domestic segment, compared to 2019. Only the Dominican Republic surpassed Colombia in the international segment, with a 16% growth over pre-pandemic levels. Domestically, Colombia was first.\n\nOverall, the Latin American region has had the strongest passenger recovery worldwide (although this does not mean regional airlines are financially recovered from the pandemic). On the contrary, most airlines across the region have experienced financial losses; rising fuel costs, ramping inflation, and the devaluation of local currencies could put some of these airlines in danger of disappearing. Among the airlines that are currently under threat are Viva Colombia, Viva Peru, and Aeromar.\n\nColombia has had the strongest traffic recovery in the region. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe voice of the expert\n\nJosé Ricardo Botelho, executive director and CEO of ALTA, recently said that the continued removal of restrictions on international traffic in the Latin American region has been critical to the remarkable recovery of countries such as Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Brazil.\n\n“Looking to the future, we know that the population will continue to require air transportation; however, in order to make it truly possible for more people to use this means of transportation, we need to continue reducing costs associated with fees and taxes, as well as continue optimizing regulations that generate inefficiencies,” he added.\n\nHave you traveled recently to Colombia?

    "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information": "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information\n\nCity view, Medellín, Colombia (source: flickr/ *Iván Erre Jota*, creative commons)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 13 Sep 2022\n\nThe Colombian Geological Service has published the Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information, a guide for the documentation of geothermal data from exploration areas.\n\nThe Colombian Government has worked to advance the energy transition for Colombia and, through its Congress, published Law 2099 of July 10, 2021, which defines provisions for the use, development and promotion of non-conventional sources of energy, including geothermal energy.\n\nIn “Chapter III of the Geothermal Resource,” is the geothermal registry where all those projects for exploration and exploitation to generate electricity will be registered. On the other hand, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Minenergia),\n\npublished Decree 1318 of July 27, 2022 which regulates the development of activities aimed at generating electricity through geothermal energy, and Resolution 40302 of August 5, 2022, which establishes the technical requirements that will govern the Geothermal Registry and geothermal resource exploration and exploitation permits.\n\nFor its part, the Colombian Geological Service (CGS), a Science and Technology entity linked to Minenergia, represented by the Geothermal Research Group, actively participated from the beginning of the geothermal working tables developed from 2016 to 2020, carried out with Colombian government entities, with the support of the IDB and led by Minenergia, and with the participation of state and regional entities such as the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, autonomous corporations, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), among others.\n\nAs a contribution to this inter-institutional effort, the CGS published in November 2021 the Approach to the geothermal potential of Colombia (Alfaro et al., 2021), estimated at 1170 MWe; and supported the definition of annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of August 5th 2022 issued by Minenergia.\n\nThe Annex 1 “Geothermal exploration information delivery guide” was defined for the information generated by public and private entities in terms of geology, geophysics, fluid geochemistry, conceptual modeling of geothermal fields; and the Annex 2 “Guide for delivery of well drilling information and its evaluation” was defined for the information generated by the drilling of geothermal wells and their evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, the Geothermal Research Group of the CGS recently published the Cartographic Standard for Geothermal Information (ECIG) as a milestone for the entity. This document is the first Colombian CGS geographic information standard, prepared in accordance with the guidelines and policies of the Colombian Spatial Data Infrastructure (ICDE), which guarantees the interoperability of the data, not only for the CGS, but also at an intersectoral level and national, because it complies with ISO and NTC standards.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the ECIG is to define the basic guidelines for the storage and cartographic representation of the geothermal data\n\nacquired in the geothermal exploration areas, which guarantee the quality, organization and uniformity, thus being the technical support to comply with the delivery of information required in Annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of 2022. The information will be integrated from geology, geophysics, geochemistry, geomorphology and elements of geothermal energy, in accordance with the SGC standards, for its availability to the scientific and academic community and the general public.\n\nTherefore, the inter-institutional efforts of the Colombian State are focused on the significant progress in the recognition and investigation of geothermal resources, in the definition and establishment of the regulatory framework for the use of the resource; and the granting of tax benefits, such as incentives, for the generation of electricity with non-conventional energy sources (FNCE), including geothermal energy, and efficient energy management, in accordance with\n\nLaw 1715 of 2014, modified by Law 2099 of 2021.\n\nSource: Email correspondence via our Spanish language platform PiensaGeotermia",

    "Ceferina Banquez, One of Colombia’s Last Bullerengue Cantadoras": "On stage in Washington D.C.’s Kennedy Center, 80-year-old Ceferina Banquez cuts through the anxious silence of the crowd before her with a full wail. For a few seconds, Banquez’s voice, bold and unrestrained, fills the expanse of the auditorium until pulsating African drums and shakers jumpstart the beat, jolting the audience members out of their chairs and into the aisles to dance.\n\nAfter a lifetime dedicated to the Afro-Colombian music of bullerengue, the stage is where the prolific singer-songwriter appears most at home, whether at a prestigious concert hall, miles away from home in the U.S. American capital, or in the small-town sweaty venues of the Colombian Caribbean Coast.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nDubbed once as the Queen of Bullerengue, Banquez is one of the genre’s top ambassadors. After existing in near-obscurity in Afro-Colombian towns and villages along the Coast, bullerengue today has transcended cultural and national borders, been adapted by young indie superstars, such as Lido Pimienta and Combo Chimbita, and become embedded in Colombia’s national identity. Women like Banquez have been crucial in bridging audiences in cities across Colombia, as well as Europe and the United States, to the centuries-old Black tradition.\n\nWith the support of Juan David Banquez, her musician nephew and bandmate, Banquez, the singer, meets me online, on a pixelated video call, from her daughter’s home in the town of Turbaco. As the day nears noon, the sweltering sun of the tropics peeks out from behind the clouds. Banquez, dressed in a pale pink turban and a white immaculate dress, with a few delicate gold chains dangling from her neck, is seated under the shade of a cool porch.\n\nThroughout the video call, the humble, yet stoic matriarch often lets her verses speak for her, interspersing her words with bursts of song. Even with her success, she explains she’s led a simple life close to her family, residing now in Guamanga, the same farming community along the coast where she was raised.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\n“I like to plant my rice, my plantain, my yucca,” stated Banquez.\n\nThere, she lives on a farm without running water, relying on the rains and a river to drink and wash. Electricity is drawn from a government-installed solar panel. Other basic services, such as the internet, considered luxuries in these remote swathes of the countryside, are absent. However forgotten these lands may be, they remain the subject of praise in various of Banquez’s songs. The Caribbean Coast is, after all, the birthplace of bullerengue, a genre born of enslaved people brought over from Africa who sang through their suffering in melodies and rhythms, passed down through generations. Cantadoras, the female singers like Banquez that front the bullerengue groups, have kept the tradition alive for centuries.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of these cantadoras has slimmed, making Banquez one of the last remaining great singers and composers of the genre. While many her age have quietly retired, Banquez is instead busy reaching new heights in her career, recording new material and touring new cities.\n\n“We’re going to keep recording in the studio as long as Banquez has the spirit, the voice, the desire, and the strength,” said Javier Mutis, co-founder of Om Producciones and Banquez’s manager. “We want to preserve this memory, this legacy.”\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nBanquez’s story is rare in Colombia, where few poor, Black women are recognized for their musical talents. Singing bullerengue, a genre started by Black Colombians, only created additional barriers. It wasn’t until 2010, when Banquez was 68, that the opportunity first arose for the cantadora to record.\n\nBefore this, violence uprooted her family from their home in 2001 and forced them to find refuge in the nearby town of Maria La Baja, where they struggled for 18 years. Throughout her marriage, her husband prohibited her from taking the stage because he believed it would distract her from her children. After her husband died and her children came of age, Banquez was a free woman to sing as she liked.\n\nNow, at the ripe age of 80, Banquez is back home in Guamanga, where in 2007 she returned after the worst violence subsided. While much of her earlier work focuses on the pain of the armed conflict, her latest album, Que Le Baile Yo, released earlier this year, is a testament to the humor and joy with which Banquez has chosen to lead such a tumultuous life.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nBanquez was born in the farming town of Guamanga, today a two-hour drive from the seaside tourist city of Cartagena, on February 3, 1942.\n\nLong days working the fields were punctuated with afternoons enjoying the crooning sounds of vallenato, accordion-led folk music, as well as rancheras. These were the sounds that filled Banquez’s early life. A talented vocalist since youth, Banquez could have grown up to be a vallenato or ranchera singer. She liked both genres, which were both more commercial, but it was bullerengue, the music of her ancestors, that won her heart. “Later on, I realized that bullerengue was my thing,” explains Banquez. “Bullerengue comes from the Black African race and I’m Black and African.”\n\nAt the time, processions of cantadoras would travel from town to town, singing, dancing, and recruiting women to join them along the way. In Guamanga, it was Banquez’s maternal aunts, who were the pueblo’s musical celebrities. When she was a girl, her aunts encouraged her to compose a song out of a fall that had left her nose oozing with blood. At the age of nine, she had her first song.\n\n“Bullerengue comes from things that happen to you. It’s not about romantic lyrics. It’s based on the pain you may feel because bullerengue comes from the Africans that were brought over to Colombia,” said Banquez.\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nSince then, Banquez has never stopped composing, even if her songs stayed in the confines of her head. Not knowing how to read or write, Banquez could never write her verses. Instead, she repeated songs until they locked in her memory.\n\nHer first compositions related to the growing pains of a girl: a nose injury after a fall or a heartbreak following the end of a relationship. In adulthood, after her family was displaced, she dedicated her compositions to the trials she experienced, living in exile from her home. Music had a balming effect on Banquez, allowing her a creative outlet for emotions few people understood.\n\n“I suffered a lot because of the violence. It hurt a lot to leave my land,” she said.\n\nIn perhaps Banquez’s most well-known song, “Adios mamá,” she recalls the moment she was forced to flee: “I left the mountain/Of Montes de María/At six in the morning/I heard gunshots/Since I was scared/I paced from livingroom to kitchen/And now I’m with my godmother/I cried without solace.”\n\nThe song is a call for peace. At the time of the song’s composition, Colombia was the closest it had ever been at ending decades of conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government. The country would soon vote on a peace deal. In the song, she explained her support of the treaty: “We have to forgive in order to obtain peace.”\n\nPhotography by Carolina Assik. Read more\n\nIn the next coming weeks, Banquez is expected to return to the studio. She’s recorded 20 original songs so far, but many more are still stowed away in her memory, which Mutis, her manager, likes to call a “box of surprises.”\n\nRecently, she unburied six songs she will soon record: one about a dog she lost years ago and another about the island of San Andrés and its native people. The subjects may seem to stray from Banquez’s usual subject matter, but throughout her life, the cantadora has proven she’s not easily predictable and that if an idea comes to mind, she can, and will, transform it into song.",

However, the five authors go beyond categorisation and seek to ensure that journalism transcends digital barriers to reach every reader.\n\nIn this way, those who access the material may have another point of view on some assertions such as the inherent violence in human beings as a form of defence or survival; although this type of violence only deepens social rifts, generating greater violence and victimisation in society.\n\nFinally, Pía Figueroa reported that, in addition to the different editions of the book, “the first virtual course on nonviolent journalism in English is underway with students from several countries.” Thus, Pressenza hopes to be able to replicate this experience in other languages.\n\nFigueroa announced that this year the English version of the book will be released and there are plans to translate the text into German, Portuguese, Greek, Italian and, soon, French, and possibly also in Mandarin.",
    "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity": "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity\n\nEvening view over Bogota, Colombia (source: flickr/ Tijs Zwinkels, creative commons)\n\nAlexander Richter 4 Sep 2022\n\nGeothermal energy could play a huge role in the provision of energy to the megacities of this world, e.g. covering all electricity (and more) to Bogota, capital of Colombia.\n\nThe city of Bogotá, the Capital of Colombia in South America, is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, representing a great opportunity to tap geothermal energy. It represents the opportunity to decarbonize the energy matrix of megacities, that is, those inhabited by more than 10 million people, so a recent article shared by the the University of the National University of Colombia (UNAL). The article builds on a study carried out in three megacities: Los Angeles (U.S.), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Bogotá (Colombia), which showed that between Zipaquirá (Cundinamarca) and Paipa (Boyacá) [in Bototá] there is an area with high potential to extract energy from the earth, which would potentially cover the total residential energy demand for Colombia’s capital.\n\nDecarbonization is the focus of the research in which Professor Carlos Vargas, from the Faculty of Sciences of UNAL, participated. The research focused on data that the National Hydrocarbons Agency and the Colombian Geological Service have compiled and used for many years to have a measurement of the magnetic, thermal and geochemical information of the Colombian territory.\n\nThis data made it possible to map the zones, estimating the “Curie depth”, a measure inferred from the magnetic anomalies present in the subsoil, which means that the higher the temperature when the earth falls, the more the magnetic force of the earth decreases. the minerals present there, and when this occurs it can be said that in these areas there is a greater possibility of extracting energy from the earth.\n\n“It was found that the region near the north of Bogotá, between Zipaquirá and Paipa, is an important area that contains this heat resource, which is evidenced by the presence of thermal waters and pools, in addition to other geochemical parameters evaluated there by the oil industry”, so the expert.\n\nIn Bogotá today 14,509,200 GWh (14,509 TWh) are consumed and the supply can grow more and more. The investigation determined that up to 16,603 TWh could be provided by the exploitation and extraction of geothermal energy.\n\nTogether with professors Luca Caracciolo, from the GeoZentrum Nordbayern (Geocentre of North Bavaria) of the Friedrich-Alexander University (Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany), and Philip J. Ball, from the Faculty of Geography, Geology and Environment of the Keele University (United Kingdom), estimated that 73,502,200 GWh per year are used in Los Angeles, and it is calculated that geothermal could supply up to 4.25 times more energy to the city; For its part, Jakarta consumes 10,927,163 GWh, and geothermal could provide capacity by 1.84 times more. The report was published in December 2020.\n\nGeothermal energy as a sustainable alternative\n\nAccording to the geologist, “this amount of energy can guarantee sufficient resources for long-term geothermal plants that take advantage of their location to supply electricity and hot water for industrial and recreational processes.”\n\n“Geothermal energy has greater stability –having sufficient resources– than other energies such as hydroelectric or hydraulic –because in times of drought there are problems of storage and reserve of this resource–, solar energy –since its recharge depends on the moment of the day in which the sun’s rays provide it– and wind power, whose operation is subject to specific currents at certain times of the year”, highlights the teacher.\n\nAlthough at the beginning the costs are higher –machinery, studies, experts, transportation, precaution to treat the subsoil–, in the long term these are reduced, which is evident in Los Angeles and Jakarta: while in LA geothermal energy costs 0.004 cents dollar ($18) and fossil 0.138 ($606), in Jakarta the ratio is 0.006 ($26) geothermal and 0.112 ($492) fossil.\n\nThe academic explains that “geothermal energy has various industrial uses, including producing the electricity that supplies cities; improve plant cultivation processes in greenhouses, as well as heating for homes during the winter, especially in some regions of the planet (high latitudes and altitudes)”.\n\nFor the researcher, the implementation of these energy strategies allows expanding the range of possibilities, since the processes and changes of radiation or heat generation inside the Earth change in millions of years, and not in seasons of days, months or years. .\n\nIt is important to emphasize that geothermal extraction can also have disadvantages, the most important of which is the possible contamination of nearby waters by substances such as arsenic or ammonia -extremely toxic to living beings-, components found in the soil and that can be released when doing the extraction, if the procedures are not carried out properly.\n\nSource: UNAL",

    "Colombia and Venezuela to reopen shared border to cargo transport": "Easing of restrictions comes as neighbouring countries seek to normalise relations after years of tension.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Venezuela have announced that commercial flights will resume between the two nations and cargo transport will be allowed across their shared border on September 26 after a years-long closure.\n\nThe announcement on Friday marks the latest example of increased cooperation between the neighbouring countries since left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro took office in August on a promise to re-establish formal relations with Venezuela.\n\nThe 2,200km (1,370-mile) shared border between Colombia and Venezuela is currently open to pedestrian traffic, but only limited cargo transport.\n\n“We confirm the government’s commitment to restore brotherly relations,” Petro said on Twitter on Friday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro also tweeted that “the exchange and cooperation between our peoples are starting off on the right foot”.\n\n“In addition, we will resume flights between Caracas-Bogota and Valencia-Bogota,” Maduro added.\n\nLast month, the two countries restored full diplomatic relations after a three-year break. Both countries have now accepted each other’s ambassadors, but the two heads of state have yet to announce a state visit.\n\nUnder Petro’s right-wing predecessor Ivan Duque, Colombia refused to recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s leader after his 2018 re-election, which Duque said was fraudulent.\n\nColombia’s ambassador arrived in Venezuela last month and was welcomed by Venezuela’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Rander Pena Ramirez, who tweeted that “our historical ties summon us to work together for the happiness of our peoples”.\n\nCaracas broke off ties with Bogota in 2019 after members of the Venezuelan opposition tried to cross from Colombian territory with trucks loaded with food and medicine.\n\nIt also closed the border, saying the aid masked an attempted coup by the opposition with support from the United States. Embassies and consulates in both countries were shut down, and flights between the neighbours were grounded.\n\nMaduro had ordered the closure of legal crossing points in 2015 after an incident during an anti-smuggling operation along the border. Foot traffic eventually resumed, and some cargo continued to move through a bridge in the north.\n\nThe closures have not ended the transportation of various goods, some of them over dirt roads by armed groups, into Venezuela. Criminal groups have also used the roads for trafficking operations.\n\nColombia has previously accused Venezuela of offering assistance and shelter to armed groups in the border region, a claim bolstered by a report by Human Rights Watch in March.\n\nThe Chamber of Venezuelan-Colombian Economic Integration has estimated that reopening crossings to vehicular traffic could result in a substantial increase in commerce, from $406m last year to an estimated $1.2bn this year.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has said the economic activity within a year of a fully reopened border could be more than $4bn.",
    "Colombia’s new left-wing government: three opportunities to build stronger ties with Africa": "The recent election of Colombia’s first left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, and first black vice-president, Francia Márquez, creates a new opening to revitalise ties with Africa.\n\nColombia is often overlooked as a nation of interest because of its reputation for violence. Its negative standing results mainly from the decades-long armed conflict between previous governments and the Marxist-Leninist group FARC. The conflict has been linked to the production and export of illicit drugs. It ended with the signing of a peace agreement in 2016.\n\nDespite such a reputation, the country is an important regional economic hub. In 2021, its GDP was US$315 billion, the third largest in South America, after Brazil and Argentina. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the country’s economy will grow at 5.8% in 2022.\n\nThe election of Petro and Márquez provides three opportunities for stronger Africa-Colombia relations that can yield mutual benefits. These are Colombia’s cultural and historical ties with Africa, strong trade potential and south-south cooperation.\n\nRead more: Colombia: Gustavo Petro and Francia Márquez have achieved a historic victory for the left – so who are they?\n\nThree opportunities\n\nColombia’s strong African roots\n\nMárquez is Colombia’s first black woman vice-president. Her election could enhance Afro-Colombians’ consciousness of their African ancestry. It’s also an opportunity to diversify Colombia’s foreign policy, by strengthening cultural connections with African nations.\n\nThe Afro-Colombian community includes 4.7 million people, around 10% of Colombia’s population of 51 million. They are the descendants of Africans who came to Colombia during the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nRead more: Book review: how Africa was central to the making of the modern world\n\nUnlocking the trade potential\n\nColombia lags considerably behind countries like Brazil in trade and political ties with Africa. Colombia and African nations can better explore and exploit their comparative advantages in goods and services.\n\nTheir trade volumes are still low, showing a significant opportunity for new commercial relations. In 2021, Colombia imported around $150 million in goods and services from Africa, only 0.25% of its total imports. Its exports to Africa were around $400 million, only 0.98% of its exports. No African country features among Colombia’s top 30 trading partners.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Petro said Colombia would seek to build stronger economic alliances with African countries. Colombia’s focus on energy, mining and agrifood means that African countries have much to gain from partnerships with it.\n\nVisa systems on both sides need to be relaxed. South Africa, for example, does not have an embassy in Bogotá. Its diplomatic relations with Colombia are led by its embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. The countries have had a healthy relationship since 1994, but it has often faced difficulties in getting visas.\n\nAnother challenge is related to connectivity between South America and Africa. In the past, most flights between Africa and South America went through São Paulo, Brazil. The COVID pandemic reduced the number of flights. By 2022, the only connections between South America and Africa were via Angola or Ethiopia. Avianca, Colombia’s national airline, could provide a new route to help improve connectivity.\n\nPromoting south-south cooperation\n\nDuring the election campaign and her activist history, Márquez often used the African idea of ubuntu (humanness) to promote interdependence within (and between) societies.\n\nRead more: What Archbishop Tutu's ubuntu credo teaches the world about justice and harmony\n\nColombia could also look to Africa for lessons, share experiences and identify opportunities to deal with land use and distribution. Márquez has presented views that show the importance of dealing with land issues in a way that empowers poor people.\n\nTechnical cooperation programmes can be essential in realising the potential benefits of interdependence. For instance, Colombia has a long experience in developing public transport systems. These have become essential for social integration and environmental sustainability.\n\nCities like Medellín have already become an example of how to provide efficient public transport for poor urban neighbourhoods.\n\nColombia’s Agency of International Cooperation has already signed a framework agreement with the African Union Development Agency to bolster technical assistance in Africa.\n\nLooking forward\n\nAfrican countries should seek further interactions with the global south to increase their voice and agency in pursuit of a fairer international order. For instance, agriculture, food security and climate change are important areas where Colombia and the African continent could jointly influence global discussions that directly affect the developing world.\n\nColombia’s chargé d’affaires to South Africa, Jose Ignacio Julião Alí, told me the new moment\n\nmarks an opportunity to close gaps between emerging countries with similar challenges, in terms of social cohesion and reconciliation, climate and environmental focus as part of megadiverse regions.\n\nThe world’s economic relationships are shifting and new powers such as China, Brazil and India are rising. Petro’s and Márquez’s election offers a chance to deepen Africa-Colombia relations and cooperation.",

    "My mom moved me to the US when I was 7 years old. Now, 21 years later I decided to move back to Colombia and my quality of life is much better.": "My mom moved me and my fraternal quadruplet brothers to the US when we were 7 years old.\n\nWe landed in Miami, where she wanted us to have better education and quality of life.\n\nNow at age 28, I've moved back to Colombia, and my life is so much better than it was in the US.\n\nOver 3 million people read Morning Brew ; you should too! Loading Something is loading. Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nI boarded a plane holding hands with my mother and fraternal quadruplet brothers at 7 years old. She sacrificed her upper-class life in Bogotá, Colombia, venturing into the unknown as a single parent of four and immigrating to Miami for us to achieve educations in English and dreams in dollars.\n\nJust over two decades later, I've come back for the reason she left: the pursuit of happiness. For my mom, that meant safety and opportunity during a time when our country was considered one of the most dangerous in the world. In certain parts, it still is. I built on her foundation to seek opulence.\n\n\"The ones that live there are the ones that can, not the ones that want,\" my private driver commented while arriving at Poblado, my new neighborhood. I blushed, thinking I was finally included in the elite.\n\n\"You can't just give up,\" my mom said on the phone when I arrived.\n\nBut entering my two-bedroom, two-bathroom doorman apartment with a balcony overlooking a city surrounded by mountains did not feel like defeat. I treated myself to dinner at a renowned restaurant and walked out thinking, \"How cheap!\" The next day, I paid $13 for a manicure and pedicure, then $37 for a facial.\n\nYou can't buy happiness, but I suddenly felt the high of power and access that doesn't exist in the US for a freelance writer.\n\nI couldn't afford my lifestyle in New York\n\nI began researching digital nomads after ending a four-year relationship that ran long past its expiration date. I never imagined finances would be a reason to stay, until I couldn't afford to leave. I came to terms with the fact that my lifestyle belonged to his executive-legal job while searching for an apartment in Manhattan when the average rent had reached $4,000 a month.\n\nI refused to accept that I needed to fall in love and move in with someone else with an executive position for bills to not be a stressor — but it turns out it's not just me, because according to CNBC, 77% of Americans are anxious about their financial situations.\n\nWhat seemed most paradoxical was that my career never looked better on paper, and I wouldn't choose to do anything else. Yet, I couldn't afford to live alone in a city I swore I couldn't live without. Becoming roommates with strangers sounded like another step back, and other metropolitan cities seemed to compete to win the title of \"most overpriced.\" I decided if I could let go of my toxic relationship with a man, I could do the same with geography.\n\nI chose to live where I'm better off\n\nDigital-office culture has empowered many like me with the privilege of lifestyle migration — working remotely abroad, typically somewhere much cheaper than where they lived previously.\n\nI'm not ignorant of the fact that Poblado, where I live now, is a bubble like most affluent neighborhoods. There's an incomprehensible amount of poverty in Colombia — but not unlike America. So why not decide to reside where I'm better off? I still use Apple Pay, order Ubers, and find all the avocado toasts and green juices a New Yorker needs, except I won't be stressed about payment. Buenos Aires is next on my list.\n\nA career that once limited my income now enables me to find happiness — and purpose — worldwide.\n\nThere's a privileged irony in an immigrant returning to their native country and being received as a gringo by locals. Still, I want to thank my mom for the sacrifices she made so I could be here now.",
