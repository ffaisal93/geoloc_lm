    "Did a Nobel Peace Laureate Stoke a Civil War?": "Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAt the wheel of an armored Toyota Land Cruiser, trailed by a car full of bodyguards, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed drove me around Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. With a politician’s pride, he pointed out some of his recent civic projects: a vast park and a national library; a handicrafts market; a planetarium, still under construction. Throughout the city were government buildings that he’d built or remade: the federal police headquarters, the Ministry of Mines, an artificial-­intelligence center, the Ministry of Defense. In the Entoto Hills, above Addis, he had established a complex of recreational areas to showcase his Green Legacy Initiative, aimed at making Ethiopia a pioneer in sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. He boasted of having planted eighteen billion trees. “If in five years the world does not recognize what we have done,” he said, as he negotiated a turn, “then I am not your brother.”\n\nIt was all part of his vision, he explained, to transform his country into a modern state. Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous nation, with the largest economy in East Africa. But it is ethnically fractured, with more than eighty distinct groups, many of them beset by old enmities and overlapping territorial claims. Abiy came to power in 2018, promising to heal the country’s divisions. A former soldier and intelligence officer, he was born to parents from Ethiopia’s two main religious communities—his mother from the Orthodox Christian majority and his father from the sizable Muslim minority. His guiding principle was medemer, an Amharic term meaning “syn­­ergy,” or “coming together.”\n\nAbiy, at forty-six, could be mistaken for a prosperous real-estate agent: medium height, trimmed goatee, and a wardrobe of khakis, casual shirts, and gold-rimmed Cartier sunglasses. He projects the self-assurance of a motivational speaker. Soon after taking office, he published a best-selling book about the transformative power of med­emer, which is sold at roadside stalls, alongside volumes by Tony Robbins and Jordan Peterson. In conversation, Abiy does most of the talking, but he demands constant feedback. It is not enough to nod along with him; he wants to know what you think, if only to disagree.\n\nAbiy writes in his book that human beings have a “direct existential need” to be free of massacres and wars, and not long after his election he delivered a surprising advance. For two decades, Ethiopia had been in a hostile standoff with its neighbor Eritrea—the lingering aftereffect of a war that claimed as many as a hundred thousand lives. Abiy forged a peace deal, which ended the standoff and earned him a Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his efforts to “promote reconciliation, solidarity and social justice.” At the Nobel ceremony, in Oslo, he invoked both the Bible and the Quran: “Before we can harvest peace dividends, we must plant seeds of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation in the hearts and minds of our citizens.”\n\nBut the spirit of reconciliation did not flourish in Abiy’s Ethiopia. In November, 2020, just eleven months after he was awarded the Nobel, violence erupted in Tigray, a rebellious region in the north. Abiy’s army became embroiled in a conflict that involved gruesome ethnic killing, gang rapes, and mass executions. Hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans were soon on the brink of starvation, while others poured across the Sudanese border to find refuge in hastily built camps.\n\nThe violence has sparked an international argument about Abiy. His supporters say that he is a modernizer, whose only mistake was that he moved too fast to overturn Ethiopia’s corrupt old order. His critics accuse him of starting an ethnic conflict in order to favor his political allies; some demand that his Nobel be revoked, and warn that the unrest that has attended his time in office is spreading through the region. But, as Abiy and I toured Ethiopia, he seemed to want to talk about everything but the conflict that had engulfed his country. From inside his motorcade, it was as if there were no war going on at all.\n\nIn “Crabs in a Bucket,” a forthcoming book, the Somali author Nuruddin Farah likens Ethiopian politics to a destructive Groundhog Day. Farah, who is seventy-six, grew up in a part of Somalia that was ceded to Ethiopia by the colonial British after they ousted the Italians in the Second World War. “Think of a demolition site when you think about Ethiopia, a country under constant rebuilding, one whose laws are often dismantled to accommodate the new ruler, and whose peoples’ nerves are frequently shredded before another regime gains power, only to demolish what has gone on before,” Farah writes. “Ethiopian leaders are famous for telling big and small porky pies to their fellow citizens and to the rest of the world; they know how to start conflicts that lead to wars, not how to resolve conflicts.”\n\nFarah’s assessment is bleak, but the past half century of Ethiopian politics largely supports it. In 1974, a military faction called the Derg seized power, overthrowing the emperor, Haile Selassie. The Derg’s leader, Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, presided over a murderous purge, known as the Red Terror, intended to remake the country as a Communist stronghold. Mengistu ­had several dozen rivals machine-gunned at the national palace, and subsequently held a ceremony in the newly named Revolution Square, in which he swore to eliminate “voracious feudalists, hired fascists, and running dogs” and smashed bottles filled with red liquid, symbolizing his enemies’ blood. Even as the country suffered one of its periodic droughts, Mengistu launched a Stalinist collectivization campaign, and hundreds of thousands died of starvation.\n\nIn 1991, the Derg was overthrown by a coalition of rebel militias; Abiy, who was then in the seventh grade, left school for a time to join the cause. When the fighting was over, the fiercest and most cohesive of the rebel groups, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, took charge of the governing coalition, and led the country’s politics for the next twenty-­seven years. The T.P.L.F., as it was known, imposed a program of economic modernization, which in time produced striking gains. For a decade and a half, the growth rate hovered around ten per cent, and Ethiopia became known among boosters as the China of Africa. But the real wealth went largely to those who were already rich, or to people connected with the government, which controlled much of the economy. And the leadership tolerated little dissent, imprisoning and torturing thousands of political opponents.\n\nThe problems of ethnic division also lingered. The Tigrayans came from a region in the north that contains ancient sites of civilization, and they thought of themselves as the heirs of a profound historical lineage. But they were a relatively small group, making up just six per cent of Ethiopia’s population, and they were trying to retain control of a fractious country.\n\n“I liked this place better when it was a cat café.” Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nShopping Cartoon by Joe Dator\n\nIn an effort to reset the balance of power, the T.P.L.F. split Ethiopia into semi-autonomous regions, encompassing the traditional territories of the main ethnic groups. The effect, a senior Western official told me, was to “seed the future with ethnic problems,” creating a system of eleven mini-states in near-perpetual tension. For much of the twentieth century, the Amhara, the country’s second-largest group, had dominated Ethiopian politics. Now the government gave the Tigrayans a portion of land that the Amhara regarded as theirs, provoking an enduring re­sentment. Just about everywhere an internal border was created, people felt that their traditional lands had been breached, and that they had been shut out of power.\n\nIn 2012, a non-Tigrayan became Prime Minister—Hailemariam Desalegn, a mild-mannered Wolayta who had trained as a water engineer. But Tigrayans still held key positions in the government, the armed forces, and the state-controlled economy. Ethnic militias clashed, and resentments festered.\n\nThere was particular discontent among the Oromo, the country’s largest group. As the government pushed to expand the capital city into surrounding Oromo villages, many people complained that their land had been seized without compensation. Protests broke out, and the unrest spread to other regions. In 2018, Hailemariam abruptly stepped down as Prime Minister, calling for “reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy.” His departure gave Abiy his opening.\n\nAbiy has an unshakable belief in his ability to overcome obstacles—not just to see the future but to shape it. “I used to tell all my friends thirty years ago that I was going to be P.M., and everyone took it as a joke,” he said, on one of our drives. “Then, once I became P.M. and I made peace with Eritrea, I asked my minister of foreign affairs, ‘Do you think I could get the Nobel?’ He said, ‘It’s true you have done everything you promised, but on this I am not sure.’ And then I won the Nobel.”\n\nBefore Abiy took office, he did not seem to outside observers like an obvious candidate for a country seeking radical change. He had spent his early career working within the ruling coalition. After rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the military, he went into politics in 2010, winning a seat in parliament. He served briefly as minister of science and technology before becoming vice-president of the Oromia region. By Abiy’s account, though, he was already agitating from the inside. “I was always telling the former P.M.s that I was going to replace them,” he told me. “You know, they can kill you for that—but I said it.”\n\nWhen the position of Prime Minister opened up, Abiy’s candidacy offered a new vision for the country: shrinking the Ethiopian state to allow greater freedom and a more democratic system. It would also put an Oromo in charge of the country for the first time. In April, 2018, after a brief and contested shuffling of legislative leaders, parliament elected him to the job.\n\nWithin days of coming to power, Abiy moved to overturn the status quo. He began by releasing thousands of political prisoners, and decried the use of torture in Ethiopia’s prisons. He also ended a state of emergency imposed by the T.P.L.F. and launched an overhaul of the country’s security agencies.\n\nThe first months of his tenure were dizzyingly ambitious. He announced his intention to privatize state-owned enterprises, including telecommunications and aviation, and sought agreements to give his landlocked nation access to ports in Djibouti, Sudan, Somaliland, and Kenya. He went on to implement an economic plan, focussed on five areas: mining, information and communications technology, manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism. In the West, his advocacy of freedom—in politics and, especially, in the market—drew praise. The Financial Times called him “Africa’s new talisman.”\n\nAbiy speaks about his initiatives with unwavering confidence. “I wanted to add value for my country, and I am doing it,” he told me. But his leadership was quickly met with violent opposition. Barely two months into his term, as he addressed a crowd in downtown Addis, an assailant mounted a grenade attack, in which two people died and scores were wounded. A group of policemen were arrested for failing to prevent the attack; Abiy’s sympathizers saw it as evidence that he had enemies on the inside. In June, 2019, the military attempted a coup in the Amhara region, killing the region’s president and the national armed forces’ chief of staff. Abiy carried on with his reforms, and increasingly worked to force T.P.L.F. members out of his administration. That November, he eliminated the governing coalition that the Tigrayans had led. In its place, he devised a new political vehicle, the Prosperity Party—essentially the same coalition that he had disbanded, except for the T.P.L.F., which refused to join.",

    "Conflict in Ethiopia: UK Minister for Africa's statement": "Commenting on the breakdown of the cessation of hostilities in Ethiopia, the Minister for Africa said:\n\nThe return to conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front ( TPLF ) and the Ethiopian Government is catastrophic for the people of Ethiopia. This development risks tens of thousands of deaths – both directly through fighting, and indirectly through a further deepening of the already dire humanitarian situation. 22 months since fighting first began, it is clear that there is no military solution.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities agreed in March 2022 created an opportunity to resolve this conflict politically and enable Ethiopia to return to sustained development and economic growth. The resumption of fighting makes the path to peace much more difficult. Tigrayan forces should immediately cease fighting in Amhara region and return to Tigray. Eritrean forces should leave Tigray. We remain confident that progress towards peace can be made if talks begin.\n\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia has contributed to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, leaving 13 million people in Tigray, Amhara and Afar requiring humanitarian assistance. Conflict, and the TPLF ’s seizure of fuel from the World Food Programme, makes the work of humanitarian agencies more difficult. The UK urges all parties to the conflict to guarantee unfettered humanitarian access by immediately ceasing hostilities. The UK calls on the Ethiopian Government to urgently restore services to Tigray and the TPLF to enable the seized fuel to be used for aid distribution and critical services.\n\nPrevious phases of the conflict were marked by terrible violations and abuses of human rights, including sexual violence. The UK will strongly support all efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses, including by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia. There have already been reports of airstrikes on Tigray by the Ethiopian Government resulting in civilian casualties, and of ethnically targeted arrests. It is the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to prioritise the protection of civilians, respect human rights and uphold International Humanitarian Law.\n\nThe only way to resolve this conflict is to reinstate the cessation of hostilities and immediately begin political negotiations. We support the African Union’s mediation efforts to this end, and urge a redoubling of these efforts to avert further escalation.",
    "Ethiopia: Civilians again mired in intractable and deadly war, Human Rights Council hears": "In their first, extensive report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia said that they believed that crimes against humanity had also been committed in the on-off war that erupted in the northern region in November 2020.\n\n#HRC51 | Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia told the Human Rights Council that it found reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the conflict had committed serious violations & abuses of international human rights & humanitarian law https://t.co/w9dGB6qK4x pic.twitter.com/5OKpgw8Yei — UN Human Rights Council 📍 #HRC51 (@UN_HRC) September 22, 2022\n\nWorst rights violations\n\nSerious rights violations in Tigray were “ongoing”, the report maintained, noting that fighting resumed last month, breaking a five-month ceasefire.\n\n“Extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual violence, and starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare” have happened in Ethiopia since the earliest days of the conflict, the Council heard.\n\nCiting information from “credible sources”, Commission chairperson Kaari Betty Murungi – who like the two other members of the panel is an independent UN-appointed rights expert - said that there had been an “escalation” in drone attacks by Government forces that used explosive weapons “with wide area effects in populated areas”, since hostilities resumed.\n\n“Our investigation indicates that their use has exposed civilians to new and heightened risks,” she said. “We have received reports of drone strikes in Tigray in the last four weeks, which have allegedly killed and injured civilians, including children.”\n\nTurning to Tigrayan forces, Ms. Murungi insisted that they had also likely committed serious human rights abuses “which amount to war crimes”.\n\nThese included “large-scale killings of Amhara civilians, rape and sexual violence, and widespread looting and destruction of civilian property in Kobo and Chenna in August and September 2021.\n\n“During their searches of homes in Kobo, for example, Tigrayan forces looked for weapons and pulled many men from their homes, executing them, often in front of their families.”\n\nDesperate conditions\n\nToday, international humanitarian access into Tigray continues to be blocked, despite the dire situation there, Ms. Murungi said.\n\nThere were reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government and its allies “looted and destroyed goods indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in Tigray, killing livestock, destroying food stores, and razing crops while also implementing severe restrictions on humanitarian access to Tigray”, she added, noting that for more than a year, six million people had been denied access to electricity, internet, telecommunications and banking.\n\nThis denial and obstruction of access to basic services, food, healthcare and aid relief “amount(ed) to the crimes against humanity of persecution and inhumane acts”, the Commission chairperson insisted.\n\nStarvation ‘tactic’\n\n“We also have reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government is committing the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare,” the top independent rights expert continued, noting that Tigrayan forces had reportedly looted humanitarian aid.\n\nAccording to the latest dire humanitarian data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), conflict and displacement in northern Ethiopia has left more than nine million people in need in Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions, while severe drought is affecting millions more in the south.\n\nCiting OCHA, Ms. Murungi said that that the combined effect of the Federal government’s measures had left 90 per cent of the population in acute need - an 80 per cent increase since the beginning of the conflict.\n\n“Most of the population in Tigray must now survive on limited and nutritionally inadequate diets,” she said, adding that there had also been “an increase in child marriages and child labour, human trafficking, and transactional sex as desperate means for survival”.\n\n© UNICEF/ Christine Nesbitt A child sits inside a vehicle burned out during fighting in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia.\n\nTigrayan women and girls not spared\n\nAccording to the Commission chairperson, rape and crimes of sexual violence had happened “on a staggering scale” since the earliest days of the conflict, “with Ethiopian and Eritrean forces and regional militias targeting Tigrayan women and girls with particular violence and brutality”.\n\nTigrayan forces had also committed rape and sexual violence against Amhara women and girls and Eritrean refugees, Ms. Murungi said, highlighting the devastating long-term impacts for the survivors that included trauma, unwanted pregnancy and HIV infection.\n\n‘Unfair and biased scrutiny’\n\nRejecting the report’s findings, the Ethiopia delegation repeated its claim that the federal government had been subjected to “unfair and biased scrutiny” at the Council for more than a year.\n\nAddis Ababa was engaged in responding to an “insurrectionist armed group that has endangered the territorial integrity of the country”, the Council heard.\n\nThe international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia was established after the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-33/1 on 17 December 2021.\n\nIt mandated a panel of three human rights experts - appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council - “to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law and international refugee law in Ethiopia committed since 3 November 2020 by all parties to the conflict”.",
    "U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Hammer’s Work in Ethiopia": "Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa (SEHOA) Mike Hammer arrived in Ethiopia on September 5 to encourage efforts for an immediate stop to the fighting and participation by the government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayan regional authorities in African Union-led peace talks. Special Envoy Hammer met with Ethiopian government officials, AU representatives, and international partners on next steps forward, and returned to Washington September 16. He will continue diplomatic efforts on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York during high-level week beginning September 19.\n\nDuring his visit to Ethiopia, Special Envoy Hammer met with the AU’s High Representative Olusegun Obasanjo on several occasions to discuss how the United States can partner to support the peace process. In addition, SEHOA Hammer met with his counterparts the UN Special Representative to the Secretary General Hanna Tetteh and EU SEHOA Annette Weber, as well as other international partners. Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary Molly Phee, who attended the inauguration of Kenyan President Ruto in Nairobi, also advanced these diplomatic efforts aimed at getting AU-led talks launched in pursuit of peace. The United States welcomes the Government of Ethiopia’s restatement of its continued readiness to participate in talks, as well as the September 11 statement by Tigrayan regional authorities accepting an AU-led process, including by naming its delegation. Based on these commitments, the United States seeks tangible follow through from all parties to the conflict to enter into negotiations in good faith.\n\nSpecial Envoy Hammer and Chargé d’Affaires ad interim Tracey Ann Jacobson at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa also met with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and with Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen to discuss U.S. concerns about the renewed fighting in the north of Ethiopia and Eritrea’s re-entry into the conflict as well as the urgent need to redouble efforts to begin AU-led talks aimed at bringing a permanent end to the conflict. During his meetings with Ethiopian government officials as well as with Tigrayan regional authorities Special Envoy Hammer reiterated the need for unhindered humanitarian access in the Tigray, Afar, and Amhara regions, stressed the need to respect human rights and avoid civilian casualties, raised ongoing reports of ethnically-based detentions, and pressed for accountability for those responsible for atrocities and justice for the victims and survivors.\n\nFinally, he met with AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat, Minister of Justice Dr. Gedion Timothewos, and National Security Advisor Redwan Hussein. The United States is committed to the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ethiopia and seeks peace and stability for the benefit of all Ethiopians. Special Envoy Hammer received briefings on the ongoing severe drought in eastern and southern Ethiopia, including delivery of humanitarian assistance as the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia.",
    "Al-Shabaab’s Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?": "Al-Shabaab’s Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?\n\nEthiopian forces in July contained and repulsed an attack conducted in the eastern part of the country by Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Fighters from the militant group entered from southwestern Somalia and targeted four border towns in Ethiopia’s Somali regional state known as Ogaden Region. The estimated 500 al-Shabaab fighters had moved 150 kilometers inside Ethiopia before being met by the Ethiopian military and retreating (Garowe Online, July 30).\n\nAfter several days of fighting, the Ethiopian military claimed it killed as many as 800 militants, including Fuad Mohammad Khalaf, who is also know as Fuad Shangole and was a senior al-Shabaab leader. The U.S designated Shangole as a foreign terrorist in 2010 and placed a $5 million bounty on his head in 2012 (People Dispatch, August 1). Al-Shabaab, however, later denied the Ethiopian claims about the death totals and asserted it had killed at least 100 Ethiopian servicemen, including policemen, before taking control of the town of Aoto (Sudan Tribune, August 7).\n\nThe attack came as surprise since al-Shabaab had not launched cross-border attacks into Ethiopia in years. However, the group has frequently targeted the nearly 4,000 Ethiopian troops operating in Somalia under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), which was formerly known as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). On August 21, Somali security forces, which are backed by ATMIS, for example, fought off a 30-hour al-Shabaab attack on Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, which left at least 21 people dead. The attack was the first major attack since Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohammud took office in May (Nation, August 22).\n\nA More Confident and Expansionist Al-Shabaab\n\nThe attempt by al-Shabaab to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been thwarted by Ethiopian forces, but the attack underlines a resurgent, more confident, and strengthened al-Shabaab. Despite the group losing key territories to ATMIS forces and some of its top leaders in U.S airstrikes, such as Aden Hashi Farah “Ayro” in 2008 and Moktar Ali Zubeyr in 2014, the group continues to show resilience after each setback, always launching fresh attacks. It has also carried out continuous recruitment campaigns throughout the East Africa region (Garowe Online, January 1).\n\nAt the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia create favorable ground for the militant group’s continued attacks. Ethiopia’s security forces have been struggling with internal unrest since the launch of the military operation in the northern state of Tigray in November 2020 (Terrorism Monitor, December 7, 2021). As the conflict persists, it is likely that al-Shabaab will take advantage of the turmoil to launch more cross-border attacks (Africa News, August 5).\n\nAdditionally, the push into Ethiopia can be seen as part of al-Shabaab leaders’ attempts to expand the conflict beyond Somalia. The vision was first articulated by the late Shaykh Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the group’s emir and was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2014 (aljazeera.com, September 6, 2014). Less than a year before the attacks in Ethiopia, Ahmed Diriye, who is al-Shabaab’s current emir, appeared to restate Godane’s vision. He called for external attacks beyond Somalia with emphasis on American and French interests, especially in Djibouti (African News, March 29, 2021).\n\nNorthern Kenya Under Threat From a Financially Emboldened Al-Shabaab\n\nApart from the attack in Ethiopia, al-Shabaab has persistently attacked parts of the northern and coastal regions of Kenya. In one of the latest attacks, five policemen were injured in Mandera in northern Kenya after suspected al-Shabaab fighters ambushed them while they were on patrol. In January, six people were also killed in Lamu in another attack by suspected members of al-Shabaab (The Star, January 3).\n\nMoreover, while controlling large swathes of territory in southern Somalia, the group has also outpaced the government in revenue collection. This provides al-Shabaab with the financial muscle it needs to further expand the insurgency (Somali Guardian, February 22). As a result, al-Shabaab has been strengthening its arsenal by spending a reported US$24 million out of its annual budget of US$180 million on arms purchases. The money is raised through taxation at checkpoints in Somalia or persuading or coercing the local population into paying tax (Hiraal Institute, October 2020).\n\nBesides purchasing guns, ammunition, explosives and other heavy weapons, the manufacture of explosives and some ammunition also comprises part of al-Shabaab’s budget. The weapons are being obtained from the local black market and international sources, with Yemen as a key exporter. Other weapons are also seized in battles with the Somali national army and ATMIS troops (Africa News, February 22).\n\nConclusion\n\nAl-Shabaab’s attempt to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been contained, but this was not a one–off attack and more attacks should be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia are creating fertile ground for the militant group’s attacks. The resolution of the Tigray crisis is paramount if any further spread of al-Shabaab into Ethiopia is to be stopped.",
    "Smoke leads the way: Rochester Ethiopians mark the finding of the cross": "ROCHESTER — For the second year in a row, local Ethiopian Orthodox Christians observed Meskel on the shore of Cascade Lake.\n\nAlthough the event went on without a hitch this year, last year’s celebration almost didn’t happen.\n\nSounds of song and wood smoke filled the air at Cascade Lake Beach Sunday as the traditional bonfire, known as a Demera, burned to mark Ethiopian Orthodox Church’s observance of the discovery of the cross on which the Christian messiah Jesus was crucified.\n\nSome Demera are assembled around a wooden cross to symbolize the discovery. Passersby last year saw the wood cross in the middle of a large pile of firewood on the beach last year. They misinterpreted the set up for a possible cross burning, a hateful symbolism used by the Ku Klux Klan to terrorize African Americans and Jews and other groups.\n\n“They perceived it in the wrong way and dismantled it,” said Eyob Adehane.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA group quickly reassembled the pile and attendance at last year’s event was good enough to encourage church leaders to plan public observances again this year, Adehane added.\n\n“It went beyond our expectations,” he said.\n\nAbout 500 Ethiopians live in Rochester. Community leaders estimate about 80% of them are Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. The Meskel celebration is a way for members to come together and celebrate one of their most important holidays.\n\n“Even though we’re a small community, to celebrate, to fulfill our observations, that by itself is a blessing,” Adehane said.\n\nA service preceded a procession to the beach where a pile of wood was set on fire as people sang songs and danced in the sand near the bonfire.\n\nThe fire marks Ethiopian Orthodox belief that Queen Eleni, mother of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, had a revelation that smoke from a bonfire would lead her where the cross was buried.\n\nThe holiday marks the beginning of the excavation of the cross.\n\nMore than 100 people attended the service celebration Sunday. The City of Rochester Parks and Recreation Department allowed the group access to the beach in the off season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“It’s very nice to get this location,” Adehane said.\n\nThe nearby water and sand reduced the risk of the blaze accidentally spreading, he added.\n\nThis year, Meskel observances in Ethiopia are planned for Sept. 27.

    "A Wounded Ethiopia": "Last month, Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict resumed after months of truce, once again bringing desperately-need humanitarian aid flows to a halt and drawing in neighboring Eritrea’s armed forces. The return of outright hostilities in Tigray has prompted more intense international efforts to get a peace process on track, including the deployment of U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer to the region for intensive talks with the parties to the conflict. External actors who desire stability in the Horn recognize that neither of the main antagonists can decisively defeat the other.\n\nThe setback in Tigray came in the context of escalating civil conflict in multiple parts of the Ethiopian state, from Afar and Oromia to Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella. Questions about the capacity of the Ethiopian government to provide security throughout the country have grown more urgent. An incident in July in which al-Shabab fighters crossed into Ethiopia from Somalia to stage attacks, suggests that they perceived Ethiopia to be both weakened and distracted. It’s difficult not to get a sense that the government in Addis Ababa, which has little economic room to maneuver, has no real long-term strategy for coping with these multiplying crises.\n\nIronically, Prime Minister Abiy initially rallied domestic and diaspora support for his scorched-earth tactics in Tigray by framing the conflict as one in which Ethiopia’s sovereignty and right to self-determination was a stake. But as his government becomes overwhelmed by security and economic struggles on multiple fronts, it becomes an ever-more appealing target for international opportunists of all stripes, from organizations like al-Shabab to governments that can offer some short-term relief in the form of economic support and weapons, even as they build long-term leverage and influence. In the geostrategically vital Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has gone from a power that shaped the contours of regional dynamics to a state cobbling together reactions to the forces affecting it. The outcome is precisely the opposite of the one that Ethiopian nationalists seek. If the state can avoid collapse, it may be far more beholden to outsiders than just two years ago.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

Instead, the Horn of Africa grows more unstable, malign actors like Eritrea are emboldened, and the horrifying human costs of a manmade famine in Tigray lay bare the international system’s dysfunction. In the face of fierce Ethiopian resistance to UN Security Council involvement, the supposed guarantors of international peace and security have been unable to meaningfully address the Tigray issue, despite its interstate dimensions and collective international efforts to place humanitarian siege strategies beyond the pale of acceptability globally.\n\nA ray of hope emerged on Sunday, when Tigrayan forces indicated they were prepared to enter into a mutual cessation of hostilities agreement and participate in African Union-led talks without delay. This announcement creates a new opportunity to build positive momentum toward an end to the Tigray crisis. Whether real progress toward lasting peace will materialize remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is just how difficult the outlook for Ethiopia will be without it.",

    "Deadly Diseases Rise as War Limits Vaccinations in Ethiopia": "Deadly diseases like measles, tetanus and whooping cough are on the rise in Ethiopia’s Tigray area. Vaccination rates have fallen sharply there during the almost two-year-long civil war.\n\nThe percentage of children receiving usual vaccinations has fallen below 10 percent this year, data from the Tigray Health Bureau shows. That has undone years of government efforts to increase vaccination rates.\n\n\"The hopes of the children in the region to grow healthier and happier were snatched away in the blink of an eye,\" the agency wrote in a letter this month to the international vaccine group Gavi.\n\nThe letter said attacks on Tigray by Ethiopian government forces led to supply shortages that reduced the number of vaccinations. The Tigray agency also wrote that power outages have disrupted vaccine supply chains. The agency added that it is difficult for people in rural areas to get to health centers.\n\nA ceasefire from March to late August made it possible for foreign medical aid to enter the area. But humanitarian access has been suspended since fighting began again, U.N. human rights experts said Monday.\n\nThe experts said in a report that they had reason to believe that the denial of access to healthcare and other aid by federal officials is a crime against humanity.\n\nEthiopian government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the U.N. report.\n\nThe government has denied blocking aid and says the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the party leading the area government, is responsible for the conflict. The fighting has killed thousands of civilians in Tigray.\n\nMeasles outbreaks\n\nHealth Minister Lia Tadesse said vaccines had been provided to Tigray this year. She said that more were ready to be provided once conditions improved.\n\nIn its letter, the Tigray Health Bureau said the percentage of children receiving the full dosage of vaccines had dropped to very low levels.\n\nVaccination rates against several diseases including whooping cough, tetanus, and hepatitis B dropped from 99.3 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in 2021. This year, the vaccination rate is seven percent.\n\nThe rate across Ethiopia was 65 percent in 2021, said the U.N. children's agency UNICEF.\n\nThe letter also reports a drop in percentages of children being vaccinated against tuberculosis and measles. The vaccination rate was above 90 percent in 2020 and is below 10 percent this year.\n\nThe letter said measles have spread in 10 of Tigray’s 35 districts since the war began.\n\nThe nonprofit organization Gavi pays for and ships vaccines to developing countries. It said it had provided measles and COVID-19 vaccines during the ceasefire in Tigray, but that some activities had been suspended since fighting began again.\n\nEthiopia's Lia said 860,000 doses of measles vaccines were sent to Tigray last December and more doses were provided on April 2. And she said the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) is delaying a planned transport of humanitarian aid into Tigray.\n\nBut WFP spokesperson Claire Nevill said the agency was waiting on approval from Ethiopia’s government.\n\nWithout the clearances, she said, “lifesaving humanitarian supplies, including food, nutrition and medical items, will have to be on hold.”\n\nI’m Dan Novak.\n\nDan Novak adapted this story for VOA Learning English based on reporting by Reuters.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nWords in This Story\n\nregion — n. a part of a country, of the world, etc., that is different or separate from other parts in some way\n\nsnatch — v. to take (something) quickly or eagerly\n\nin the blink of an eye — n. very quickly\n\ndisrupt — v. to cause something to be unable to continue in the normal way\n\naccess — n. a way of getting near, at, or to something or someone\n\ndose — n. the amount of a medicine, drug, or vitamin that is taken at one time\n\ndistrict — n. an area established by a government for official government business\n\nclearance — n. an official decision saying that someone has permission to do something\n\nnutrition — n. the process of eating the right kind of food so you can grow properly and be healthy",

    "Wang Yi Meets with Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Demeke Mekonnen Hassen": "On September 19, 2022 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Demeke Mekonnen Hassen on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nWang Yi said, China and Ethiopia are comprehensive strategic cooperative partners with mutual trust. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations over half a century ago, no matter how the international landscape evolves, bilateral relations have always moved forward with sound and steady development. Mutual trust has kept deepening and pragmatic cooperation has been at the forefront of China-Africa cooperation. China highly appreciates Ethiopia's adherence to the one-China principle and its firm stand with China on issues concerning China's core interests. China will also continue to uphold justice on issues concerning Ethiopia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. China attaches great importance to deepening and carrying forward mutual trust and friendship with Ethiopia and stands ready to make joint efforts to elevate the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries to new levels.\n\nDemeke Mekonnen Hassen expressed that he thanked Mr. Foreign Minister for his visit to Ethiopia last year at a time when Ethiopia was in difficulties. Ethiopia cherishes the deep and strong friendship with China, and is ready to strengthen the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and carry out all-round cooperation with China, and hopes that China will increase support for Ethiopia's personnel training. Ethiopia definitely agrees with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and will continue to stand firmly with China.\n\nDemeke Mekonnen Hassen briefed on Ethiopia's commitment to advancing the peace talks on the northern conflict, and spoke highly of China's proposal on the \"Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa\".\n\nWang Yi said, China appreciates Ethiopia's efforts for peace and supports Ethiopia in independently handling its own affairs. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity to Ethiopia in dealing with temporary difficulties and jointly uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. China appreciates Ethiopia's active support for the \"Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa\" and supports Ethiopia's proposal for the institutionalization of the Horn of Africa Peace Conference. China is ready to maintain close communication with all parties to encourage regional countries to build common ground, independently handle regional affairs and advance the process of regional integration.",

    "S. Sudan, Ethiopia agree on joint project to link with Djibouti port": "By Tesfa-Alem Tekle\n\nSeptember 23, 2022 (NAIROBI) – Ethiopia and South Sudan have agreed to carry out a series of joint infrastructure projects that would eventually enable the latter to link with the port of Djibouti.\n\nThe agreement was reached on Tuesday after a high-level South Sudan delegation led by Vice-President, Taban Geng Gai, met with a group of Ethiopian Ministers led by Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide.\n\nEarlier, the two sides discussed ways how to enhance joint infrastructure connectivity projects.\n\nIn this regard, both sides agreed on ways to enhance their previously designed plans in the areas of road infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, water transportation, and other vital economic sectors with a view to creating integration for mutual benefits.\n\nPer the newly reached agreement, one of the key projects being prioritized was to undertake road projects with a view to boosting connectivity between the two landlocked countries.\n\nAfter the discussions, Ethiopia’s Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide, confirmed that the two sides have concluded a very important agreement in terms of advancing two road projects.\n\n“We comprehensively agreed to work on joint infrastructural connectivity that will overcome geographical barriers in terms of trade and logistics flows between our two countries and people-to-people relations.”\n\nCut reliance on Kenya’s port\n\nThe fresh agreement with Ethiopia comes only a few days after South Sudan announced buying three acres of land at the port of Djibouti for the construction of a facility to handle its import and export of goods as the landlocked country eyes an alternative route to cut high dependency on Kenya’s Mombasa port.\n\n“We have only been using Port Sudan and Mombasa but recently, we have decided to go to Djibouti and as I am speaking to you, we have landed in Djibouti,” South Sudan Minister for Petroleum Puot Kang Chol is quoted as saying by local media.\n\nThe minister said the land was procured by the Ministry of Petroleum for the purpose of exporting the country’s crude oil as well as using it on imported goods. If effected, the move will hit the port of Mombasa given that Juba is one of Kenya’s largest clients importing nearly all of its cargo through the Kenyan port. Rising costs Khartoum charges Juba for pipelines have also pushed South Sudan to eye alternative routes to export its crude oil to the international market.\n\nPort of Djibouti\n\nThe road projects will be given top priority to open up transportation so that connectivity of South Sudan will be enhanced via Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor, the Ethiopian minister added.\n\n“These projects will be financed jointly and we have agreed to finalize the feasibility and preparations in terms of selecting a contractor so that the joint financing mechanism will be worked upon,” Shide said. The South Sudanese delegation, on its part, vowed to cooperate and work for the immediate implementation of the joint projects.\n\n“The agreed projects will be operationalized and put into consideration as soon as all the technical aspects are addressed,” said Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan’s Information minister said on behalf of the delegation.\n\nLueth said that it is worth mentioning that South Sudan, as a landlocked country, will benefit from the port of Djibouti using Ethiopia as a transport hub. “Trade can be facilitated by Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor,” he said adding “We expect Ethiopia to support us so that we can grow and be as strong as Ethiopia is today.” the South Sudanese minister added.\n\nIn transport connectivity, river, fibre optics and transmission line connectivity has been agreed upon and the preparation to realize the agreement will commence right after this meeting, Ethiopian officials said. “As soon as the preparations are completed we will work together for resource mobilization and reaching out to development financial institutions as part of the Horn of Africa initiative” Shide added. Aviation Sector The two sides have also agreed to work on the aviation sector. “Ethiopia has massive experience in airport construction. With this capacity, we have also agreed to share our experience and work on a joint mechanism on aviation connectivity and development with the republic of South Sudan.” the Ethiopian Finance Minister told journalists. Peace Process Ethiopia will continue to work and support the peace process in South Sudan, the minister said. He noted that ensuring regional peace and stability are crucial for the two countries’ joint infrastructural development. “We have a very comprehensive political commitment and will to advance the cooperation between the two countries,” Shide added. The South Sudanese high-level delegation arrived in Addis Ababa on Wednesday for a three-day official working visit. Upon arrival at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, the South Sudanese delegation was warmly received by Ethiopian Defense Minister Abraham Belay and Director General of African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fisseha Shawul, among other senior government officials.",
    "UN Human Rights Council 51: UK statement for the Item 4 General Debate": "Thank you, Mr President,\n\nThe former High Commissioner’s report found that possible crimes against humanity have taken place in Xinjiang, China. It found evidence that Muslim women are being forcibly sterilised. That Uyghurs are not allowed to practice their religion or speak their own language. That people are being detained and tortured– merely because they belong to a minority group. We cannot ignore such severe and systematic breaches of human rights. This Council must not, cannot, stay silent.\n\nWe have oft spoken in this Chamber of Putin’s flouting of international law through his military aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe sham referendums currently being held in Ukraine can have neither legal effect nor legitimacy. Russia can’t change the borders of another sovereign state. It’s a clear breach of the UN Charter.\n\nWe have also repeatedly heard the harrowing reports of Russia’s violations of human rights in Ukraine, including of those subjected to Russia’s so-called filtration operations. Aggression overseas is accompanied by repression at home as those brave Russians who dare to speak out against Putin’s war are detained in their thousands.\n\nMr President,\n\nThe death of Mahsa Amini in Iran, following her arrest, has shocked the world. We call on Iran to carry out independent, transparent investigations into her death and the excessive violence used against subsequent protests.\n\nIn Ethiopia it is crucial that the truce is reinstated and that peace talks begin to avoid a repeat of the atrocities including extrajudicial killings and sexual violence seen earlier in this conflict.\n\nFinally, ahead of COP 27 - we urge Egypt to ensure that independent civil society, human rights defenders, and the media can operate freely. The success of the conference - as we saw in Glasgow - depends on vibrant civil society participation.\n\nThank you",

    "Report: Gap Between Ethiopian Currency's Official and Parallel Market Exchange Rate Grows to New Record – Africa Bitcoin News": "Report: Gap Between Ethiopian Currency's Official and Parallel Market Exchange Rate Grows to New Record\n\nThe Ethiopian birr currency’s parallel exchange rate against the U.S. dollar recently dropped to a low of 92 birrs per dollar, a report has said. The report added that following this latest plunge, the gap between the birr’s official and parallel market exchange rates has widened to a record high.\n\nResumption of Fighting Between Ethiopian Government Forces and Tigray Rebels Identified as the Cause\n\nThe gap between the Ethiopian currency’s official and parallel market exchange rate against the greenback widened to a new record higher after the latter rate plunged 92 birrs for every dollar. Officially, one dollar buys 52.5 units of the local currency.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report that quotes Fikadu Digafe, the vice governor and chief economist at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), the resumption of hostilities in the Tigray region is one of the key factors that caused the Ethiopian currency’s latest plunge. As many media reports have suggested, the fighting between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels restarted in late August after five months of a lull in hostilities.\n\nHigh Cost of War Making Monetary Policies Ineffective\n\nExplaining how the fighting impacted Ethiopia’s economy, Digafe identified the imbalance between the supply of foreign exchange and the demand as a problem that afflicts the country. In addition, the vice governor also suggested that the high cost of the war meant the NBE’s monetary policies are now largely ineffective.\n\nBesides the costs associated with the fighting, Ethiopia has grappled with the problem of dwindling foreign exchange reserves. As per the report, the landlocked horn of Africa state’s reserves stood at $3.3 billion by the end of 2021. This was enough to cover Ethiopia’s import costs for just 1.9 months.\n\nTherefore, as part of efforts aimed at boosting the country’s foreign exchange reserves, the NBE effectively devalued the birr by 26% between February and May. Also, as reported by Bitcoin.com News, the central bank has now imposed restrictions and controls on the amount of foreign exchange that Ethiopian residents are allowed to take out of the country.\n\nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

    "Confronting Ethiopia's Abusive Siege": "Click to expand Image Ethiopians wait for food distribution in a small town north of Mekele, in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, May 7, 2021. © 2021 AP Photo/Ben Curtis © 2021 AP Photo/Ben Curtis\n\nThe United Nations’ first chartered ship carrying Ukrainian grain, which had been sitting in blockaded silos as a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion, docked in Djibouti on August 30. Free passage of this shipment, destined for Ethiopia, followed concerted pressure by African governments on Russia as well as U.N.-led negotiations. But more diplomatic muscle, including by African countries, is needed to end the Ethiopian government’s almost two-year-long chokehold on humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered Tigray region. Otherwise, many of the Ethiopians most at risk of hunger are unlikely to benefit.\n\nEthiopia is one of six countries the U.N. has singled out for having people at risk of starvation. Millions in the country’s south and east are grappling with alarming levels of hunger and malnutrition due to one of the worst droughts in decades. Communities in conflict-affected areas in the country’s north rely on humanitarian assistance. But it is in the Tigray region, specifically, where a severe starvation crisis has persisted for over a year and could be reversed through government actions.\n\nSince the outbreak of war in Tigray in November 2020, Ethiopian forces and their allies have frequently violated the laws of war. They pillaged and targeted homes and civilian infrastructure—crimes the Tigrayan forces would later replicate in other regions—while shutting off basic services and severely obstructing aid to civilians caught up in the fighting. Then the authorities imposed an effective siege on the entire region, keeping out virtually all humanitarian assistance for civilians in violation of Ethiopian domestic law, international human rights, and humanitarian law.\n\nFor the first eight months of the conflict, Ethiopian forces and their allies pillaged businesses, hospitals, banks, livestock, and harvests, leaving the region dependent on assistance. The impact of this destruction has been devastating. It has prevented people from getting healthcare, food, and other basic services, and stymied the recovery of a health system broken by the conflict. For months, federal and regional forces blocked off the roads, making it nearly impossible for private actors or humanitarian agencies to carry in medical supplies or food. Supplies decreased to alarming levels.\n\nHuman Rights Watch researchers spoke to doctors in February who had treated dozens of survivors of a deadly drone strike without access to intravenous fluids or protective gloves. A journalist who traveled to Tigray in late May and early June told us he saw “hunger everywhere.” In August, the U.N. warned that one out of three Tigrayan children under the age of 5 is acutely malnourished.\n\nSince the Ethiopian government declared a humanitarian truce in late March, humanitarian convoys previously blocked from entering Tigray were finally making it into the region. But what was getting didn’t come close to matching the mounting needs of a vulnerable population. With fuel deliveries and cash flows stymied—and the government still keeping the banks closed and telecommunications shut off—aid organizations are struggling to save lives.\n\nThe resumption of fighting in northern Ethiopia on Aug. 24 puts aid agencies’ efforts at further risk. A U.N. spokesperson noted that Tigrayan fighters entered a U.N. warehouse in Tigray’s capital, Mekelle, and seized 12 fuel tankers intended for humanitarian use. Tigrayan forces have also pushed into the neighboring Amhara region. A probably Ethiopian government airstrike in Mekelle on Aug. 26 reportedly struck a kindergarten and killed at least seven people, including children. Delivery of humanitarian supplies by road remains suspended since then, as are humanitarian flights. The siege in Tigray remains very much in effect.\n\nAirstrikes, and the pillage of limited fuel supplies, will only harm Tigrayans who are already suffering the effects of the conflict and the siege. Most people in Tigray can’t buy the food that is available because the cost of staples continues to soar. A resident of the town of Shire said that the cost of teff, a grain that is one of the country’s main staple foods, had tripled over the last five months.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council sought to tackle broad restrictions on aid and essential goods in the conflicts in Yemen and South Sudan by passing a resolution in 2018 condemning the unlawful denial of lifesaving humanitarian aid and essential services as a strategy of warfare. In the hope of preventing this elsewhere, the Security Council resolution pointedly calls on the U.N. secretary-general to swiftly inform the council when the risk of conflict-induced famine arises.\n\nAnd yet, faced with flagrant violations of its own resolution in Ethiopia, the Security Council never sanctioned those most responsible for unlawful actions during the conflict. What’s more, the council hasn’t even placed the ongoing siege in Tigray on its formal agenda.\n\nConcerted African diplomacy around the Ukraine grain crisis and Russian blockade stands in stark contrast with Africa’s inaction on Ethiopia on the Security Council. The three elected members representing the African Union on the Security Council—Gabon, Ghana, and Kenya, known as the A3—have repeatedly stalled any public discussion on Ethiopia, allowing this blatant disregard for international norms to persist.\n\nIn the meantime, Ethiopia and its partners in the region and beyond have allowed access to life’s necessities to become a political bargaining chip. Ethiopia’s state minister for foreign affairs recently said that basic services won’t be restored until the two parties begin peace talks, whereas Tigrayan authorities want services restored before talks can begin. With the resumption of fighting, it's even more essential for the world to make clear that negotiations and access to aid must be decoupled.\n\nSo, what’s to be done?\n\nThe U.N. Security Council, starting with the A3, and the African Union need to act now. They should publicly call on Ethiopia to completely lift its chokehold on desperately needed humanitarian aid and its shutdown of basic services. They should insist that the warring parties, including Tigray’s forces, abide by international law and facilitate assistance to those in need without any preconditions or delay. The Security Council should hold a public debate to address conflict-induced hunger and place Ethiopia on the council’s regular agenda.\n\nIt is crucial that such governmental practices are not normalized. Those responsible for blocking food, fuel, and medicine, as well as using basic services as a bargaining chip, should be held accountable. Those using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by impeding relief supplies or depriving civilians of what they need for their survival can be prosecuted for war crimes. For this to happen, continuing the work of the United Nations International Commission on Human Rights in Ethiopia, which is up for renewal by the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in September, will also be critical.\n\nAfrican and U.N. engagement over Russia’s Black Sea blockade has demonstrated what public pressure combined with diplomacy can deliver on humanitarian aid. Ships departing from Ukraine’s ports laden with grain is the best kind of dividend of that approach. But we’ve also seen the opposite: a largely forgotten crisis in Ethiopia where the weaponized starvation of an entire region hasn’t generated anywhere near the same attention. Unless the international community rallies to ensure everyone in Tigray has full access to humanitarian assistance, grain shipments finally arriving in Ethiopia may not get to one of the populations in greatest need. If that’s the ultimate result, the grain deal will be a hollow victory.",

    "Avoiding the Abyss as War Resumes in Northern Ethiopia": "War rages – again – in northern Ethiopia. The resumption of conflict on 24 August between the federal military, forces from the Amhara region, which borders Tigray, and Eritrean troops, on one side, and Tigray forces, on the other, marks the breach of a roughly nine-month truce that had largely halted some of the world’s deadliest fighting. The return to blows is a setback for a struggling peace process and strenuous efforts to get food to millions of besieged Tigrayans. Although it is unclear exactly why combat restarted or whether either side planned a sustained campaign, both immediately escalated, with a Tigrayan offensive to the south into Amhara and a joint Ethiopian-Eritrean incursion into Tigray from the north. Sustained full-blown hostilities would mean prolongation of a likely unwinnable war, creating more mass suffering. Instead, the Ethiopian parties must renew the truce and overcome the obstacles that have impeded the beginning of formal talks. Concerted high-level pressure by donors, many of whom have been distracted by the Ukraine crisis, will likely be vital to any breakthrough. A Return to Arms Fighting in Ethiopia’s nearly two-year civil war – a brutal conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions and generated credible reports of atrocities on all sides – resumed in northern Amhara on 24 August. Efforts to commence formal talks have failed to end the siege and humanitarian crisis in Tigray, and tensions have been rising over the course of the summer. As when the war broke out in November 2020, each side blamed the other for starting the hostilities, and it is not clear who shot first. As in 2020, federal troops had been massing near Tigray’s southern border for weeks. In recent months, Tigray’s leaders have also bolstered their own forces through rearming, recruitment and training. The late August clashes in northern Amhara – just south of a part of Tigray that Amhara groups claim as their own – were preceded by smaller incidents. Federal forces shelled Tigray positions at Dedebit in north-western Tigray on 15 August. That was the first serious violation of a truce dating back, in effect, to December 2021 but formalised in March. Then, on 24 August, the day fighting to the south began, the federal military said it had shot down a plane the previous evening coming from Sudanese airspace to deliver weapons to Tigray. No independent source has verified that the plane was indeed carrying arms, but Tigray has previously received other air deliveries of unspecified cargo that Addis Ababa believes to have been lethal aid.\n\nWhether or not either side fully intended it, the fighting quickly spread, taking the country back to full-blown confrontation.\n\nWhether or not either side fully intended it, the fighting quickly spread, taking the country back to full-blown confrontation. Tigray’s fighters seem to have had the better of the first exchanges in the south, taking the northern Amhara town of Kobo on 27 August; Tigrayan media showed footage of prisoners of war arriving in Alamata town in southern Tigray. For its part, the federal air force bombed Tigray’s capital Mekelle on 26 August, and again overnight on 30-31 August, reportedly causing deaths by hitting a kindergarten and civilian areas near the main hospital. As new fronts opened, each side painted the other as the aggressor. On 1 September, Tigray authorities said the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies had launched major offensives from Eritrea to the north. On Twitter, Eritrea’s ambassador to Kenya and Tanzania implicitly confirmed Asmara’s renewed involvement. Federal authorities, a day earlier, accused Tigray forces of staging an “invasion” of areas to the west of Kobo and also close to the disputed Sudanese border in Western Tigray. The latter clashes reportedly involved Tigrayan former UN peacekeepers who were stranded in Sudan during the war when they refused to return to Ethiopia. A top Tigray official told Crisis Group that these forces were defending their position near the Sudanese border, and that federal and Amhara units had tried to penetrate Tigray in the south. War, Truce and War Again Ethiopia’s civil war began in November 2020, when a constitutional dispute between Tigray and federal leaders escalated into conflict amid a prolonged power struggle. Momentum has repeatedly flipped sides. At first, the federal government (backed by Eritrea’s military and Amhara forces) pushed into Tigray, took Mekelle and compelled the region’s ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) administration to flee to mountainous areas. Tigray forces subsequently regrouped to launch a guerrilla campaign that thwarted federal plans and, months later, recaptured Mekelle and reinstalled the TPLF government. In July 2021, partly in response to a renewed federal blockade, Tigray’s troops mounted an offensive, pushing in several directions in Amhara (amid accusations of atrocities), as well as south toward Addis Ababa in an attempt to dislodge Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government. Then, in turn, the federal government, armed with new drones and backed by strong popular mobilisation, beat back Tigray’s forces, which retreated to their home region in December. The subsequent lull in fighting evolved into a fragile, informal truce, with both sides making conciliatory gestures. In December, Addis Ababa ordered the release of key opposition prisoners and put forward a plan for national dialogue to address Ethiopia’s long-festering political challenges. In late March, the parties formalised a humanitarian truce, after which critical aid deliveries into Tigray began picking up. In the precarious new status quo, federal troops stayed largely outside Tigray, while Tigrayan forces left the Amhara holding onto Western Tigray (which the Amhara call Welkait) – where rights group say Amhara groups have committed atrocities and displaced 700,000, mostly Tigrayan residents, since the war began. Eritrean soldiers continued to occupy parts of Western Tigray (in the north) and north-eastern Tigray. Even following the truce, the humanitarian situation in Tigray remained dire. Despite the increase in food aid, Addis Ababa and its allies continued to block commercial traffic into the region, while tightly restricting the fuel supply and failing to restore Tigray’s electricity, telecommunications and banking services, all of which the federal government had severed in the conflict’s early phase and cut again after leaving Mekelle in June 2021. Efforts to get peace talks off the ground also foundered. Both sides took steps and offered commitments to engage in formal negotiations, but the latter never commenced amid squabbling between the two sides over mediators and preconditions. While the federal government and many outside actors backed an African Union-led process, the Tigray authorities expressed scepticism that this body, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, could act as a fair arbiter, and rejected a lead role for its envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Tigray authorities have said they prefer Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta as mediator, but he is leaving power, having served his final term. It is unclear if Kenyatta could still play such a role after his anointed successor, Raila Odinga, lost to Deputy President William Ruto, who has a bitter relationship with Kenyatta, in Kenya’s 9 August election. Further complicating matters, the federal government demanded talks without preconditions, while Tigray authorities made negotiations contingent on both unfettered humanitarian operations and a full restoration of services, as well as the return of Western Tigray (a hotly contested area that the Amhara, who currently control it, claim the TPLF violently annexed in the early 1990s).\n\nDistracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western capitals reduced their high-level focus exactly as the truce in Ethiopia was beginning to take hold.\n\nInternational efforts to steer the parties toward peace have been uneven. Distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western capitals reduced their high-level focus exactly as the truce in Ethiopia was beginning to take hold. The diplomacy that persists is often disjointed. For instance, the U.S., which has now dispatched its third regional envoy since creating the post in April 2021, facilitated a secret meeting between senior officials from both sides in June in Djibouti (there was a similar one earlier in Seychelles), where the federal government pledged to restore services to Tigray. But there was little follow-up to that meeting, with Tigray accusing Addis Ababa of breaking its pledge and Washington of failing to act as guarantor. When the AU’s Obasanjo subsequently tried to go to Mekelle days after a joint UN, U.S. and EU visit, and with still no progress made toward service restoration, Tigray’s leaders took it as another sign Abiy was reneging on the Djibouti pledges and rejected his request to visit. Obasanjo’s call for Eritrea to also attend prospective talks caught many other actors by surprise and cemented Mekelle’s view that he should not lead mediation efforts. For Tigrayans, the conflict’s further escalation would bring major risks. Any form of renewed war is in fact likely to worsen the blockade of Tigray and the humanitarian crisis, with all aid operations to Tigray suspended since hostilities kicked off. In a 23 August letter to international partners, which reiterated demands for federal authorities to restore services and return Western Tigray to Mekelle’s control, Tigray’s president concluded by warning again that the region would fight to end the blockade if necessary. But the reality is that, while Tigray may well be able to demonstrate its military prowess, it looks unlikely to achieve its ends in the short term. Its forces would face a major challenge in seeking to break through the combined force of federal, Amhara and Eritrean troops to open and then maintain a corridor to neighbouring Sudan. Nor is there much reason to think that another push south, aimed at overthrowing Abiy, is likelier to succeed than last time. Rather, renewed fighting could well embolden hardliners in Addis Ababa and Asmara, as well as among Amhara’s political leaders who want to double down on the siege strategy that has so devastated Tigray. Abiy, too, would likely lose out from an escalation. He still has no viable military and political strategy for bending Mekelle to his will. His administration has already proven unable to hold and govern Tigray in the face of a resolute and popular insurgency, which his own brutal tactics served to inflame. A rebooted full-blown war is likely to increase his government’s international isolation at a time when the Ethiopian economy desperately needs foreign aid, while bogging Addis Ababa down in a costly, deadly and unwinnable conflict with a foe that has had time to regroup and is fighting for its survival. Clashes near the Ethiopia-Sudan border in an area contested by those two states as well as by Amhara and Tigray raise the stakes further. Should these skirmishes persist, Sudanese troops could become involved, possibly in a de facto alliance with Tigray forces. That development would increase the likelihood of a disastrous, wider confrontation, pitting Sudan against Ethiopia – they are already at loggerheads over disputed border areas and Ethiopia’s new megadam on the Blue Nile river – and maybe Eritrea as well. If any actor expects to gain from more violence, it is probably Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, whose forces fought alongside federal and Amhara troops against Tigray during the war’s first phases, re-entered the fray recently and, as noted above, continue to occupy parts of the region’s west and north east. Isaias considers the TPLF a historical and existential foe. He thus opposes any rapprochement between the TPLF and Addis Ababa that would mean rehabilitating the Tigray party (he almost certainly welcomed Ethiopian federal authorities classifying the TPLF as a terrorist organisation in May 2021). He may well struggle to take on Tigray on his own, however, meaning that he is unlikely to be able to pursue war if Abiy wants to return to the truce. Renewing the Truce It is essential that the African and international envoys who have been engaged diplomatically continue to demand that the main antagonists rein in their forces, prevent further escalation and agree on a new truce – while beginning to set the stage for formal talks. The window for averting a return to a sustained full-blown war appears to be short. Until a 2 August visit to Mekelle by the EU, U.S. and UN special envoys – which has now been followed by an early September visit to Addis Ababa, under way as this statement goes to press, by the U.S. and UN emissaries, plus Obasanjo – outside actors working for a peaceful resolution had been watching too passively, as a volatile standoff drifted back toward conflict and the peace process stalled. A higher-level, more intense degree of engagement is required. The main external actors, including the AU, U.S., EU and UN, as well as Kenya, should move immediately and in concert. The recent joint trips by envoys to Mekelle and Addis Ababa are a welcome start and should be paired with higher-level engagement from all, such as telephone calls from senior officials. They should make clear to Abiy’s government that major non-humanitarian assistance, including World Bank projects and any new International Monetary Fund financing, may be in jeopardy should the federal government fail to stop its offensives and continue the de facto blockade of Tigray. The war puts donors seeking to ease Ethiopia’s economic difficulty in a bind. Yet, while they should keep scaling up humanitarian relief, they should take direct budget support off the table for now lest they wind up bankrolling a revived federal war effort. Further, donors risk undermining a key incentive for Abiy to make peace should they continue to ramp up major development assistance even as war resumes. External players, including the AU, should also insist with as much unity as possible that Eritrea withdraw its troops from Tigray (and that Abiy press for this result) and that the federal government honour its representatives’ private pledges at the U.S.-facilitated June meeting in Djibouti with Tigray officials to restore banking, telecommunications and electricity services to the beleaguered region.\n\nMekelle should agree to hold the necessary discussions with the federal authorities on the logistical and security aspects of restoring services to Tigray.\n\nOutside actors should lean on Tigray as well. They should keep demanding that its leaders desist from steps that would further escalate the fighting and agree to a truce. Mekelle should agree to hold the necessary discussions with the federal authorities on the logistical and security aspects of restoring services to Tigray, such as how to manage payments and provide security for installation and maintenance technicians. Diplomats also need to mediate a dispute between Tigray’s government and the World Food Programme after the former grabbed twelve WFP tankers on 25 August, saying the UN agency refused to return in kind fuel it was owed. Tigray’s seizure of the WFP fuel trucks creates a further constraint on already woefully insufficient humanitarian operations that have left at least half of Tigray’s approximately seven million people in need of support. Unless the incident is remedied, federal authorities are likely to use it as a reason to restrict, or completely close off, the region’s fuel supply, arguing that Tigray’s authorities redirect humanitarian assistance to their military operation. If the parties can be persuaded to de-escalate and restore the truce, the next step is clearing still substantial hurdles to formal talks. At the end of August, a senior Tigray commander insisted to Crisis Group that the federal government must at least publicly commit to completely lifting the blockade and restoring services before any form of discussions can occur. For its part, Addis Ababa’s latest position on the issue was that those things would happen only alongside discussions over a permanent ceasefire. An Ethiopian diplomat told Crisis Group on 31 August that it was not practical to restore services with the TPLF still armed and prepared for war. Much as African and international players should continue to insist that Ethiopia restore services, Tigray’s leaders should also weigh whether their demands for the government to fulfil what they cast as its legal obligations in advance of talks are well advised, particularly if they help prolong an intolerable, immiserating status quo. There are alternatives that could allow Mekelle to maintain a position of principle while making practical progress toward peace. For example, Tigray’s representatives could attend formal talks but limit their discussions to the logistical and security issues of reconnecting Tigray to trade, aid and services, leaving formal talks on other issues until the government has lifted the siege. In such a scenario, the formality of the process and extra international scrutiny could help increase external pressure on the federal government to honour its pledge to restore services and end its punishment of Tigray’s civilian population, even if international actors’ pleas to this effect have long gone unheeded. Another hugely difficult issue that will likely need to be finessed until talks get off the ground is the status of Western Tigray. The area has been administered by Tigray throughout the current federal era that began in the early 1990s, but is also claimed by the Amhara, which seized it when the present conflict began, citing their longstanding stance that the TPLF forcibly took it, displacing the native population when the Tigrayan party rose to power in the 1990s. The 2020 Amhara takeover involved the violent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans and widely reported atrocities by Amhara forces and militia against civilians. Tigray’s leaders face substantial pressure from Tigrayans not to make concessions that legitimise these new facts on the ground and have refused to negotiate over the area’s constitutional status. Reclaiming the area would also allow the besieged region a corridor to resupply itself through Sudan. Finding common ground with respect to Western Tigray will be no small task, as the sides remain far apart. Amhara outright rejects Tigray’s demand that it withdraw and return the territory to its pre-war status, and Addis Ababa has thus far declined to force the issue. Abiy may well have assessed that favouring Tigray in this instance would be too costly for him in Amhara, which has been a core pillar of his political and wartime coalition. In recent months, in order to assert control, the federal and Amhara governments have arrested thousands of members of Amhara’s nationalist militia, known as Fano, causing opposition to Abiy to grow in Ethiopia’s second-largest region. Abiy can ill afford to lose more Amhara support given the host of other problems his government is facing, including the growing rebellion in Ethiopia’s most populous region, Oromia, which is nominally Abiy’s base. Furthermore, the prospect of Tigray gaining the capacity to resupply itself from Sudan via Western Tigray is unacceptable both to Abiy and Isaias.\n\nThe federal government could publicly acknowledge that Amhara’s violent take-over [of Western Tigray] was unconstitutional.",

    "Feature: Ethiopian coffee garners popularity among Chinese consumers": "ADDIS ABABA, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of consumers and growing popularity of Ethiopia's coffee among the Chinese people is propelling Ethiopia's coffee export market, officials and coffee exporters said.\n\n\"Currently, the youth in China are really fond of Ethiopian coffee and we are witnessing growing coffee market share in China and other parts of Asia,\" Adugna Debela, director general of the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA), said in a recent interview with Xinhua.\n\nFigures from ECTA showed that Ethiopia exported 11,935.65 metric tons of coffee to China during the last Ethiopian fiscal year which ended on July 7, earning 65.31 million U.S. dollars, up by 84 percent year on year.\n\nThe increase has made China the seventh major importer of Ethiopian coffee last fiscal year (July 8, 2021-July 7, 2022), up from 33rd in the previous fiscal year (July 8, 2020-July 7, 2021)\n\nEthiopia obtained a record 1.4 billion U.S. dollars from exporting over 300,000 metric tons of coffee last Ethiopian fiscal year. The top five export destinations were Germany, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Japan.\n\nDebela argued that China would be one of the main destinations for Ethiopian coffee due to its population size and the growing coffee drinking habits among the people.\n\n\"Very recently, countries like China, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates are coming to the front line, after consumers in those countries tested and proved that Ethiopian coffee is an organic one,\" Debela said.\n\nAmid the growing demand for Ethiopian coffee in the Chinese coffee market, a growing number of Ethiopian coffee growers and exporters are vying to penetrate the emerging Chinese coffee market.\n\nIsrael Degefa, Chief Executive Officer of Kerchanshe Trading, the largest producer and exporter of coffee in Ethiopia, shares the idea of the director general and anticipates \"China would be one of the main destinations for Ethiopian coffee in the near future.\"\n\n\"In general, the Chinese market is growing every year and we are tripling our export to China both in volume of coffee and value. The demand is high and we are preparing to grow more coffee to feed the Chinese market,\" Degefa said.\n\nEthiopia, which is known as the origin of Arabica coffee, is recognized worldwide for its rich coffee quality, variety of flavors and aroma, making the demand for the commodity increase globally.\n\nFor Degefa, the rising demand for Ethiopian coffee in China has to do with a cultural shift. \"I think there is a cultural shift among the Chinese people. The Chinese new generation is adapting to drink tea and coffee concurrently,\" Degefa said.\n\nTemesgen Cherkos, export manager of Hadeed Trading Private Limited Company, said his company is making increasing shipments of coffee to China, attributing the rise in the volume of coffee export to growing coffee drinking habits in China.\n\n\"We have been sending coffee to China for two years now. We exported a small volume of coffee the previous year but this year, after we got registered in China, we are exporting an increasing volume of coffee to China. At least we make shipments of 10 containers of coffee to China every month,\" he said.\n\nThere are about 5 million coffee growers in Ethiopia and more than 25 million people in the country depend on coffee production and processing for their livelihood. Also coffee accounts for up to 30 percent of Ethiopia's export revenue, according to ECTA.\n\nHowever, figures from the ECTA show that only 12 percent of Ethiopian coffee export commands the highest price in the international coffee market due to lack of using modern technology and the best variety of species in the production and processing of coffee.\n\nAccording to ECTA, coffee Arabica is highly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions, especially the desert weather which is posing a potential threat to coffee production. ■",

Humanitarian partners continue to provide assistance to those relocated in their current location, including supporting health services and water infrastructure in Ab'ala. Voluntary relocation from another site in Semera and of internally displaced persons (IDPs) residing with the host community will be conducted once preparations are completed and if security situation permits.\n\nMeanwhile, new displacements continue to be reported due to the ongoing hostilities in Afar Region. Displacements are also being reported due to floods, withmore than 59,000 people reportedly displaced in Asayita, Afambo, Dubti and Mille in Zone 1 and Gewane, Gelalo, Amibara, Hanruka, Buremudaytu, Awash Fentale and Dulecha Woredas in Zone 3. Additional areas are at risk of floods. Some of the newly displaced people have received food, emergency shelter and non-food items assistance, albeit still very limited compared to the high needs. At the same time, some flood-affected areas remain temporarily inaccessible.\n\nIn Amhara Region, the hostilities are affecting communities in North Gondar, North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones among others. Debark in North Gondar, Kobo and Woldiya in North Wollo as well as Abergele and Sekota in Wag Hemra remain hard-to-reach for humanitarian operators due to the volatile security situation. Destruction of property and of civilian infrastructure has also been reported. In North Wollo Zone, Jara IDP site was reportedly looted and part of the existing infrastructure damaged or destroyed. On 30 August 2022, more than 30,000 IDPs who were sheltering in the site had left looking for safety as news spread about fighting reportedly nearing Woldiya City, which is located some 50 kilometers from Jara. Most of the IDPs have now returned to the damaged site where the Government and humanitarian partners have resumed the provision of food and water trucking services. Lack of fuel and intermittent access challenges, however, are limiting the response efforts.\n\nRegional authorities have recently set up six collective sites in Mersa Town in North Wollo Zone on 6 September to accommodate increased number of IDPs. At least 12,000 newly displaced people, mainly women and children, are taking refuge in the town. Following the findings of a recent interagency needs assessment mission to Mersa Town, partners are mobilizing food and non-food items for distribution to assist them. A mobile health and nutrition team has already been dispatched to the town.\n\nThe overall food security level is concerning with at least 5 million people considered food insecure in Amhara. The situation is particularly dire in conflict-affected areas in the region. Malnutrition levels in more than 80 per cent of these areas are high. The most recent Government nutrition hotspot classification published in March 2022 revealed 125 hotspot woredas across the region, of which 74 are Priority One for response. Blanket and targeted supplementary feeding as well as school feeding programs are ongoing, but due to resources' constraints, partners can target only 83 per cent of the targeted food-insecure people, including some only receiving an incomplete food basket (limited to wheat).\n\nFlooding has also been reported in several flood-prone areas in Amhara Region, including in North Gondar, South Gondar and West Gojam zones. The Regional Flood Contingency Plan estimates that more than 487,000 people will be affected, of which more than 29,000 are likely to be displaced across 32 woredas in seven zones. Food response is ongoing but with severe limitations due to resource constraints.\n\nSimilarly, in Tigray Region, hostilities continued to be reported in several parts with tens of thousands of people reportedly displaced and civilian property and infrastructure damaged. New conflict-induced displacements are expected around Adigrat, Mai Tsebri and Sheraro. Movements of humanitarian convoy along the Semera - Mekelle route remains suspended since 24 August, hindering the transportation of humanitarian supplies. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) flights, which had been flying between Addis Ababa and Mekelle twice per week and had recently announced the organization of a third weekly flight, also remains suspended since 26 August, hampering the rotation of humanitarian workers and the transfer of cash for humanitarian operations. Nevertheless, the distribution of humanitarian assistance continues in accessible areas in Tigray with the remaining available stocks in the region, including supporting health centers and hospitals medical supplies and cold chain equipment (freezers and refrigerators). Partners have also mobilized shelter supplies for 23,000 newly displaced households in Shire and Mekelle towns, while preparations are underway to receive new IDPs in Sebacare IDP site in Mekelle and Mai Dimu site in Shire.\n\nHostilities in parts of western, southern, and eastern Ethiopia also continue to drive humanitarian needs. Hostilities in western Oromia, particularly in the Wollega zones, have also led to an influx of displacement across the Wollega zones and into Amhara Region, particularly to Debre Birhan Town in North Shewa Zone. The latest insecurity in Somali Region continues to impede the drought response, particularly in parts of Afder and Shabelle zones, as well as partially in Liben Zone. Meanwhile in Siti Zone, people displaced by violence in recent months are receiving assistance. The displaced population is sheltering in Aydhidhi, Bediwayn, Caska and Garba sites. An inter-agency mission will be monitoring the ongoing response to gauge new needs as well as identify gaps.\n\nIn eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, the Government and humanitarian partners continue to mobilize resources to scale-up multi-sector lifesaving assistance to close to 17 million people living in drought-affected areas, but the needs still surpass ongoing response, where the drought continues to impact several essential and critical sectors. In addition to deepening food insecurity and rising malnutrition, school dropouts and protection risks are rife. At present, around 9.9 million people require food assistance, and 2.9 million children and pregnant and breastfeeding women require nutrition interventions until the end of the year. The education of 1.4 million children has also been disrupted due to drought-induced migration, school closure or communicable diseases. The health impacts of the drought are also rising, including measles and diarrheal cases.\n\nIn Somali Region,for example, the number of dysentery/diarrheal cases have shown an increasing trend in recent weeks, particularly in Afder, Dawa, Fafan and Shabelle zones. Overall, the number of diarrheal cases in the region has increased by 33 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Government and partners are implementing prevention and control measures, including increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation, provision of drugs and overall support to health facilities. Overall, 11 million people in drought affected areas require health interventions until the end of the year. In SNNPR, even if water availability has improved following the good rains received during the summer/*Kiremt (*June-September) rainy season, water trucking support needs to continue in the chronically water-insecure areas such as Benatsemay, Dasenech, Gangatom and Hamer woredas of South Omo Zone; Wera Dijo *Woreda *of Halaba Zone, and Dugna Fango Woreda of Wolayita Zone.\n\nThe humanitarian situation is expected to deteriorate further in parts of drought affected areas with the reported fifth consecutive failed Deyr/Hageyarainy season (October -- December), according to most recent forecasts. The extent of the drought impact is captured in the revised Drought Response Plan (1) published on 8 September. This plan will serve to organize and monitor the drought response until the end of 2022.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. Find link to the Drought Response Plan here: https://bit.ly/3S5zzYf",

Equity opened a representative office in Addis Ababa in 2019.\n\nKCB Group recently entered an agreement to acquire 85 per cent stake in Trust Merchant Bank (TMB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nIts entry into DRC take bring competition to the doorstep of its rival Equity Group, which in 2020 purchased a 66.5 per cent stake in Banque Commerciale Du Congo, entrenching its foothold in the hugely unbanked mineral-rich country.",

    "Ethiopia: Civilians in Western Oromia Left Unprotected": "Click to expand Image Distribution of approximate 480 damaged structures destroyed by fire in five villages in Tole kebele, Gutin, Silsaw, Chekorsa and Begene as of July 25, 2022. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it was only conducted within the area covered by the satellite imagery, and additional structures might be also affected. Satellite image: 25 July 2022. © 2022 Planet Labs PBC. Analysis and graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\n(Nairobi, August 31, 2022) – An armed group killed several hundred Amhara civilians in western Oromia in June 2022 while Ethiopian security forces did little to protect them, Human Rights Watch said today. Nearly three months later, the Ethiopian government has failed to provide adequate shelter or meaningfully address the serious health and protection concerns of surviving residents.\n\nFor eight hours on June 18, heavily armed assailants shot and killed about 400 Amhara civilians, including many women and children, in villages in Tole and Sene kebeles (wards). The unidentified assailants also burned and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, and looted livestock and other property. Satellite imagery analysis corroborated the burning of at least five villages and the destruction of approximately 480 structures. Despite warnings, government security forces stationed nearby did not arrive until hours after the attack.\n\n“Armed attackers destroyed one village after another, killed entire families with unmitigated cruelty, all while nearby government forces appeared to do nothing,” said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “This is just the latest such massacre for which the Ethiopian government needs to do more to ensure credible and independent investigations, identify those responsible, and ensure adequate assistance reaches everyone in need.”\n\nSince 2019, government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have been fighting in western Oromia, resulting in serious abuses against Oromo and minority communities. Ethiopian authorities alleged that the OLA was responsible for the June massacre and other attacks. The OLA accused a government militia of carrying out the attacks and called for an independent investigation.\n\nBetween June and August, Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 people by phone, including 19 witnesses and relatives of victims from 5 villages: Gutin; Chekorsa; Silsaw; Begene, in Tole kebele in western Oromia; and a village in neighboring Sene kebele in the Benishangul Gumuz region. Human Rights Watch obtained lists of those killed from residents and analyzed satellite imagery collected before and after the attack. From April to May 2021, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 12 witnesses and family members of a similar attack in Bone kebele, in Babo Gembel district in western Oromia, and conducted follow-up interviews in August 2022.\n\nOn the morning of June 18, as male residents left to tend to their crops on nearby farmland or to go to the market, leaving woman and children in the villages, groups of heavily armed men unexpectedly attacked villages in Tole and Sene kebeles.\n\nA farmer from Gutin said he first heard gunfire and saw smoke rising from the direction of Silsaw, a village north of the main asphalt road and near Gutin and Chekorsa. “I ran toward my house and noticed the area encircled by gunmen,” he said. “I took my children to the bush for safety and hid in a tree near the village. The gunmen were … fully uniformed and armed … I heard them saying: ‘Finish them. Don’t Leave. End them.’”\n\nA woman from Chekorsa escaped with her five children to nearby maize fields. The attackers pursued them:\n\n\n\nMy 8-month-old child started crying. I heard an attacker say, ‘Look there, look there …’ before they shot in our direction. They shot my baby dead. I wrapped the dead body with some clothes I was wearing. My other child was shot in her back; the bullet came out around her neck … I then pressed my injured child against my chest, and I prayed to Allah to save her life.\n\n\n\nHer older child survived but required two weeks of hospital treatment.\n\nThe attacks lasted several hours in some villages, including until 2 p.m. in Gutin and longer in others. Five residents said they made numerous frantic calls to district authorities for help, and to federal and regional government security forces stationed in Jogir, about 17 kilometers from Tole, as well as to a military camp in Didessa. A small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived only at 4 p.m., after the attackers had left. Residents then began returning home, where they witnessed the aftermath of the onslaught, and began burying those killed in mass graves.\n\nIn Silsaw, residents found bodies throughout the village, including about 29 in the mosque compound. “From a single family, five, six people were killed,” said a 20-year-old woman. “In other cases, families lost 20 people.” In Gutin, residents found 12 charred bodies among the remains of a burned grass house.\n\nThree residents involved in burying victims believed that over 400 people had been killed in at least 6 villages. Community leaders, who gathered lists of those killed and property destruction, estimated that at least 112 were killed in Silsaw, 105 in Chekorsa, 37 in Gutin, 72 in Begene, 16 in Hayaw, and 50 in Sene kebele. At a June 30 media briefing, a spokesperson of the Office of the Prime Minister said that the bodies of 338 people had been identified.\n\nThe attacks in Tole and Sene mirror other killings of Amhara civilians in western Oromia. Less than two weeks later, the media reported that armed groups attacked predominantly Amhara civilians in Hawa Gelan district, Kellem Wellega Zone, killing scores. A March 2021 attack on Amhara civilians in Bone kebele, West Wellega Zone, similarly left scores dead.\n\nSurvivors from Tole and Sene said that fear of continued attacks in the area, and insufficient protection and humanitarian support was forcing many residents to leave Oromia.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that at least 4,800 people were displaced from Tole, and that more than 500,000 had been displaced in western Oromia due to the conflict there.\n\nOCHA also reported that it was hard for aid groups to get access to the region because of access restrictions, inadequate funding, and a lack of humanitarian presence. Ethiopian authorities need to create a conducive environment for aid delivery, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe Ethiopian authorities’ immediate response to the attack was to announce that they would intensify “law enforcement measures” against armed groups. On July 6, Ethiopia’s parliament authorized the establishment of a special committee to investigate violence against civilians in several regions in Ethiopia, including Oromia, and to make recommendations.\n\nBut people in Tole, Sene, and Bone kebeles said there have been little signs of investigations so far. The government should provide regular public updates on its investigations, and its steps to curtail abuses by armed groups as well as federal and regional security forces and militias, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nBoth the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the African Union Chairman Moussa Faki called for independent investigations into the attacks in western Oromia. In a June 30 Oral Update before the UN Human Rights Council, the chairperson of the UN International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia expressed alarm at atrocities against civilians in Ethiopia, including western Oromia, and urged member states to provide the commission with experienced investigators and other support.\n\n“Communities in western Oromia have been left reeling from repeated attacks and are living in fear of the next attack,” Bader said. “Ethiopian authorities should urgently move beyond promises to act and provide urgent and adequate humanitarian assistance to affected communities, and support for credible independent investigations.”\n\nConflict in Western Oromia\n\nSince 2019, Ethiopian government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have engaged in an armed conflict in western Oromia. The OLA was previously the military wing of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), a once-banned political opposition group, that fought a low-level insurgency for the self-determination of Oromos for decades.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed assumed office in April 2018, the government reached an agreement with various opposition groups, including the exiled leaders of the Oromo Liberation Front in Eritrea, who agreed to lay down arms, reintegrate, and commit to a peaceful political struggle. However, negotiations soon broke down.\n\nBy early 2019, the government had established military command posts in western and southern Oromia. Federal and regional security forces began coordinated military operations against the OLA. In April 2019, the OLA formally broke its ties with the OLF and continued its armed operations.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in serious human rights abuses. Government forces have carried out summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and detentions of Oromos, and have at times cut communications in the area. The OLA has killed government officials and attacked non-military government offices. Unidentified armed assailants have also been implicated in killings, abductions, destruction of homes, and mass displacements of ethnic Amhara communities. Residents of Tole kebele in western Oromia said that OLA fighters in the neighboring hills for the past three years have abducted people and demanded ransom.\n\nHuman Rights Watch documented a March 30, 2021, attack on Babo Gembel district, West Wellega Zone. At around 8 p.m., gunmen surrounded Sedeka village, in Bone kebele, forced the Amhara residents to gather for a meeting, and shot 28 dead. A man who had fled the village as residents were being gathered said that the armed men spoke Afaan-Oromo, the Oromo language, and had distinctive long hair, which residents said was common among OLA fighters. He climbed a tree and stayed there until 2 a.m., “I later heard gunfire,” he said at the time. Residents called for help from the Oromia regional special forces, who were stationed about 30 minutes away, but they didn’t arrive until 2 a.m., long after the attack had ended.\n\nOne village leader lost his brother and his sister-in-law in the attack. “We had just celebrated their marriage on Thursday [March 25], and they were then killed on Tuesday evening,” he said. “After all the preparations to celebrate their marriage, we began to prepare for their funeral … A mother of a 15-day-old baby was also among the killed.”\n\nAttacks in Tole and Sene Kebeles, June 18\n\nOn June 14, the OLA clashed with government forces in the Gambella region, and in Gimbi town, in western Oromia, 49 kilometers from Tole kebele. Around June 17, government security forces stationed in Tole, along with a small number of local militiamen and Oromia police, left the area without explanation, several local residents said.\n\nIn the early hours of June 18, residents in several villages in the adjacent Tole and Sene kebeles saw armed men gathering. They said the attackers wore a mix of civilian clothes and uniforms worn by the Oromia regional special forces, militias, and the former Ethiopian national military uniform. They later noted that they spoke in Afaan Oromo and some of the armed men had long hair.\n\nAt 7 a.m., a farmer in Silsaw village and a kebele official, among others, called various officials and security forces for protection and support. The official said, “When I first called, they said they couldn’t take action, without discussion and reaching an agreement with the zone [an administrative division].”\n\nAround 9 a.m., attackers began shooting near Silsaw village in Tole kebele andstarted torching village buildings. Residents said scores of men, armed with military assault weapons, then stormed villages around Tole and Sene kebeles and pursued residents who fled into surrounding areas.\n\nSome farmers around Silsaw and other villages reported that they initially tried to resist the attack, but were outnumbered by the armed men, who carried machine guns, rifles, and Kalashnikov assault weapons. “Some of the men among us had our own guns,” said a farmer from Silsaw. “When they started shooting, we also tried to defend ourselves. Twelve people among us who were trying to defend themselves were also killed.”\n\nMany residents began to flee into nearby farmland or river areas. An 18-year-old woman from Silsaw village described being captured:\n\nI was fetching water when these forces approached. I ran to Chekorsa village, but I was caught and taken away from there to a field. Others that were running away were shot. They gathered other people as well [and brought them to the field]. Many were children. We were around 60. They asked us for money, phones, jewelry, and watches. After they took our property, they started shooting. They were bragging, as they were shooting … saying “We are heroes, and no one can escape from us. We will kill you all. Even those who escape, we will come after you wherever you are.”\n\n\n\nThe woman said she was shot in the arm, around her back, and in her leg, but managed to survive, along with seven other people.\n\nA man, 48, said: “We hid in the bushes. Two people were killed near me. One was my wife’s relative. He left behind three young children.”\n\nA woman, 20, fled Silsaw village along with her aunt and her aunt’s 6-month-old twins. “I was carrying one of the babies … It was such a difficult moment,” she said. “Bullets were going over our heads. I thought we were doomed. We survived by God’s mercy.”\n\nRetrieval of Bodies, Burials\n\nAt about 4 p.m., a small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived in Tole kebele. Residents began returning home that evening.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Gutin lost four family members, including his 22-year-old in daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old granddaughter. He found their charred bodies along with 10 other people, in a burned grass-thatched house in the village. He said that 5 of those killed were children under age 8.\n\nIn Sene kebele, a man from Sene village returned to find 21 people in his compound dead, including his wife and daughter, 8 other relatives, and several neighbors. His 11-year-old son survived but had been shot 4 times.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said he had desperately searched for his family:\n\nI tried to go check on the house where I took my family members [for safety], but they weren’t there. I looked for them in the maize fields but couldn’t find them. I heard that many people were collected and killed in Silsaw [a neighboring village]. I saw people injured and dead on the way.\n\n\n\nHe said he found the bodies of his wife, who was 8-months’ pregnant, and their three young children in the mosque compound, where the assailants had gathered and executed 29 people:\n\nMy wife and three children, ages 2, 6 and 10, were killed with others in the compound of the mosque. Everyone was rushing to identify the dead bodies. I tried to help gather those killed. It was raining heavily at the time.\n\nIt’s difficult to explain what I felt after what happened. I can’t say that human beings did this. It is the maximum cruelty I have seen. We couldn’t bury them all that day.\n\n\n\nResidents said that 112 people were killed in Silsaw alone and that they buried about 60 people in the mosque compound. Community leaders said that over 400 people were killed in Tole and Sene areas, during the June 18 attack, and had made lists of the dead.\n\n“The majority of the victims were women and children,” a kebele official from Gutin village said. “The village was filled with dead bodies … We started collecting them and burying them in different areas, some in mass graves.”\n\nSome of the survivors had been displaced from other areas. “We previously lived in Arjo [East Wellega Zone],” said a 38-year-old woman from Tole. “We were forced to leave the area after our houses were burned and property looted. That was eight months ago, and we fled to Tole, now [this] happened again.”\n\nLooting and Destruction of Property\n\nThe assailants looted property and livestock and destroyed civilian structures during the attack. Satellite imagery recorded on June 18, at about 10 a.m., shows smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, and Silsaw villages. Additional smoke plumes were visible over Gutin 45 minutes later. Thermal anomaly data collected by an environmental sensor, and reviewed by Human Rights Watch, also confirms the time of those attacks, showing several fires in Tole kebele.\n\nClick to expand Image Six distinct smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw villages and surrounding areas in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia, on June 18 at 10:07 am local time. Satellite Image © 2022 Planet Labs PBC. Analysis & graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch.\n\nHuman Rights Watch was able to estimate the scale of the destruction by analyzing satellite imagery recorded on July 25. Damage signatures detected on satellite imagery are consistent with arson and confirm the destruction of approximately 480 structures across 5 villages in Tole kebele, including Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw and Begene, but were unable to identify the fifth village with visible destruction. Most of the damaged structures seen on imagery are tukuls (huts). Silsaw and Begene recorded the highest number of structures affected. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it only included the area covered by the satellite imagery.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said that his house had bullet holes and several other houses in the village were burned, and stores destroyed.\n\n“I had so many properties back there,” said a man from Silsaw. “I had a farm, I just brought fertilizer. But my house was burned down, I lost everything.” He had left Silsaw for Wollo, in the Amhara region and had no plans to return.\n\nClick to expand Image Satellite image showing a snapshot of the substantial damaged structures by fire across four different villages in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia.

Analysis and graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\nThree residents from Silsaw and Begene villages said that a separate group of attackers had looted property, including livestock and personal items. A resident of Begene said:\n\nThere were three groups. The first that killed people indiscriminately, a second group that looted cows and properties, and a third that burned houses. Sixteen of my cows were taken, and 100 quintals [a unit of weight equal to 112 pounds] of grain destroyed. My house was burned down, and I lost over 200,000 Ethiopian birr [US$3,800].\n\n\n\nInadequate Investigations and Humanitarian Assistance\n\nThe government and the Ethiopian Red Cross reported that they provided humanitarian assistance to residents following the June 18 attack. However, remaining residents who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that they only received a one-time distribution of food, and as of August lacked shelter and faced serious health risks.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Silsaw said: “We are now living with the help of the Ethiopian military who are sharing their own food … We don’t even have enough cooking utensils, so we are sharing one utensil among 10 people.” A man from Chekorsa said a registration of remaining residents took place in early August but added that they still did not receive any additional aid.\n\nA farmer from Begene said: “There is nowhere to shelter now. It’s the rainy season. We sometimes use plastic shelter from the rain. But we don’t have enough food to sustain our lives ... we are worried about malaria.” He added: “It’s time to remove the weeds from the farms, but we can’t because it’s not safe. The Ethiopian military can’t protect us there so people are losing hope to live here and are leaving … Many went to Wollo or Debre Birhan [in the Amhara region].”\n\nSurvivors with serious injuries have also faced obstacles to receiving adequate medical care. The man from Sene whose 11-year-old son was shot four times said he had been struggling to get him proper treatment: “I am begging to treat my son and moving from hospital to hospital … My son is not completely healed, but the hospital gave me a discharge letter. And I don’t know where to take him now. I am standing in the rain. I don’t know where to go. Right now, I have nothing.”\n\nSimilarly, more than 18 months after the March 2021 attack on Bone kebele, the survivors were still living at a displacement site in Benishangul-Gumuz. “It’s been four months since we received food aid, we are starving,” said the village leader in August. “We received a call from the local authorities to return, but still, we are afraid. We were informed that it is still insecure …We heard that only four people were punished, and that many residents seeking to flee have been abducted.”\n\nSeveral residents from Tole raised concerns that the government had inadequately investigated the attack. “One week after the incident, a wereda (district) official and the vice-president of the Oromia regional state came and talked to us,” said a man from Gutin. “Since then, no one has talked to us.” A farmer from Begene said that “no government body came to my village to investigate the number of killings or property destroyed.”\n\nHowever, a farmer from Silsaw said that government investigators came once to speak to communities gathered around Chekorsa village: “They went around Chekorsa and Silsaw. They went to Silsaw to observe where people were buried, and property destroyed. But they didn’t go to other areas where the attacks happened.”\n\nRecommendations\n\nAll parties to the armed conflict in western Oromia should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to all populations at risk. They should also cooperate and provide full, unimpeded access to independent investigators to all conflict-affected areas.\n\nThe Ethiopian government should:\n\nPublicly provide information on the steps it is taking to investigate and appropriately prosecute killings, pillage, the destruction of property, and other abuses by non-state armed groups.\n\nUrgently provide or facilitate humanitarian assistance, including food, medical care, and shelter to Amhara and other communities affected by June 18 violence and other incidents of violence in Oromia.\n\nInvestigate the role of local and regional authorities and national security forces who may have been negligent in their duty to protect civilians, and publicly disclose the results of the investigation.\n\nEnsure credible, independent, and impartial investigations into reports of security force abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial executions of Oromo communities in western Oromia.\n\nTo the OLA and other armed groups operating in western Oromia:",

Parliament early this year reportedly approved an additional $1.7 billion budget for defense.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a drone strike hit a university campus in Tigray’s capital, Mekele, causing an unknown number of injuries, according to a media worker there who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn’t have authorization to speak to other outlets.\n\nEthiopian officials continue to paint a rosy picture for the country of well over 110 million people. “Our economy has continued to grow amid natural and man-made problems,” the planning and development minister, Fitsum Assefa, said earlier this month.\n\nBut the Ethiopian Economic Association’s meeting this month made clear the country is hurting, while international mediators urgently seek progress on talks to end the fighting.\n\nBecause of internal conflicts, the destruction of infrastructure and uncontrolled spending are hurting the economy while ordinary Ethiopians face weakening incomes and rising poverty, economist Alemayehu Seyoum told the meeting.\n\nEthiopia once seared into the global consciousness with a devastating famine in the 1980s. The country has since transformed its economy with mega-projects like the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the largest in Africa, and large-scale construction projects in Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital.\n\nThe economy grew at an average of 11% over the past decade.\n\nBut the war in the northern Tigray region, which began in late 2020, has caused immense disruption. In June, the International Monetary Fund said growth likely fell to 3.8% for 2021-2022 because of the war and a “sharp fall in donor financing,” among other factors.\n\nThe finance ministry has declined to approve the financing of three industrial parks, symbols of Ethiopia’s China-like development, citing “budgetary pressure.”\n\nInstead, the economy has shifted to a war focus.\n\nThe finance ministry now pleads with the public and Ethiopia’s large diaspora to contribute to a “national cause” for war reconstruction and aid. Ethiopia’s National Bank introduced changes to give the government all possible access to foreign currency, including requiring foreign residents to convert all in their possession upon entry.\n\nCertain development works continue, including Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s flagship projects like the beautification of the capital.\n\nBut some critics such as the spokesman for the outlawed Oromo Liberation Army, Odaa Tarbii, say “vanity projects” are not necessary now.\n\nAnything seen as criticism of the war can be stifled. Last week, authorities blocked 31 local civil society groups from organizing a media briefing calling for peace.\n\nFollowing criticism that its financial support was enabling the government's war efforts, the World Bank last week said it will continue its partnership but expressed concern.\n\nSome state-run sectors of Ethiopia’s economy continue to open to investors, as Abiy promised after taking office. The cabinet this month approved the entry of foreign banks, a significant step.\n\nEthiopia’s ambassador to the United States, Seleshi Bekele, said the “international community should support this initiative by helping to disarm the hostile (Tigray forces).”\n\nU.S. special envoy Mike Hammer was again in Ethiopia last week to “discuss the urgency of immediate cessation of hostilities,” according to the State Department, which said “the Ethiopian people have suffered tremendously from this conflict.”\n\nEthiopia’s government was unsettled when the U.S. last year removed it from a preferential trade program over its failure to end the war in Tigray that the U.S. said led to “gross violations” of human rights. Addis Ababa is lobbying for a reversal.\n\nSince then, global companies like PVH Corp have left Ethiopia, citing security reasons, and others are laying off thousands of employees.\n\nEthiopian Airlines, the largest aviation group in Africa, remains one of the country's few profitable companies but has been accused by Tigray forces of transporting troops and weapons to the war front. The airline has denied it.\n\nInside Tigray, millions of residents are still largely cut off from the world. Communications and banking services are severed, and their restoration has been a key demand in mediation efforts.\n\nAn agricultural survey conducted in several accessible parts of Tigray last month by Mekele University personnel, shared with The Associated Press, found many crops were failing because of the lack of fertilizer. Even traveling had become “tiresome” because of the lack of fuel, the survey said.\n\nOther shortages are deadly. In an email to the AP, the head of the Tigray health bureau said vaccines for children ran out more than a year ago, and women don’t have family planning supplies. Humanitarian deliveries have stopped because of the renewed fighting.\n\n“The list is very long. I just don’t want to bore you with the details,” Amanuel Haile wrote. “The above are just enough.”",
    "Aid halted to Ethiopia's Tigray, UN says, as fighting escalates": "Ethiopia's northernmost region has been suffering from severe food shortages and limited access to basic services\n\nAddis Ababa (AFP) – Renewed clashes in northern Ethiopia have forced desperately needed aid deliveries to a halt in war-torn Tigray, the United Nations said, as fighting escalated Thursday between Tigrayan rebels and pro-government forces.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe resumption of combat last month shattered a March truce and sparked international concern, with frantic diplomatic efforts now under way to find a peaceful resolution to the nearly two-year war.\n\nThe truce had allowed aid convoys to travel to Tigray's capital Mekele for the first time since mid-December.\n\nBut in its first situation report since clashes broke out on August 24, the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA said the violence was \"already impacting the lives and livelihood of vulnerable people, including the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance\".\n\n\"The last humanitarian convoy to enter Tigray before the interruption was the humanitarian convoy on 23 August consisting of 158 trucks with humanitarian and operational supplies,\" the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Wednesday.\n\nIt said twice-weekly UN humanitarian flights between Addis Ababa and Mekele have also come to a halt since August 26.\n\nFighting erupted around Tigray's southeastern border, but has since spread along the region's southern border to areas west and north of the initial clashes.\n\n#photo1\n\nA diplomatic source and a foreign source, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, said fighting had intensified along Tigray's northern border, with pro-government forces and troops from neighbouring Eritrea -- which backed Ethiopia's army in the early stages of the war -- targeting rebel positions.\n\nBoth sources described heavy artillery fire near Adigrat, a town in northern Tigray not far from the Eritrean border.\n\nThere is \"intense shelling from Eritrea into the Adigrat area, around the border\", said the diplomatic source. The second source confirmed the details.\n\nBoth sources said pro-government forces had captured the town of Mai Tsebri in Tigray, but Kindeya Gebrehiwot, spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), denied the claim, telling AFP: \"It's incorrect.\"\n\nAFP was not able to independently verify the claims. Access to northern Ethiopia is severely restricted and Tigray has been under a communications blackout for over a year.\n\nDiplomatic efforts\n\nThe uptick in violence has sparked international concern, with the US envoy to the Horn of Africa, Mike Hammer, extending his stay in Ethiopia, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nThe European envoy to the region, Annette Weber, is also expected to visit the country soon, diplomatic sources told AFP, without elaborating.\n\n#photo2\n\nThe warring sides have traded blame for starting the latest round of hostilities, with the TPLF accusing the government and Eritrea of launching a joint offensive against Tigray.\n\nEthiopia's northernmost region has been suffering from severe food shortages and limited access to basic services such as electricity, communications and banking.\n\nThe fighting has also hit access to aid in neighbouring regions, with the OCHA report saying that \"humanitarian operations in hard-to-reach areas in Amhara region, such as in parts of Wag Hemra, were put on hold due to security concerns\".\n\nEven before the latest clashes, Tigray was in the grip of a hunger crisis, with the UN's World Food Programme warning last month that nearly half of the region's six million people were \"severely food insecure\".\n\n\"Hunger has deepened, rates of malnutrition have skyrocketed, and the situation is set to worsen as people enter peak hunger season until this years' harvest in October,\" WFP said in its latest assessment covering November 2021 to June 2022.\n\nThe war erupted in November 2020 when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops to topple the TPLF, the region's former ruling party, saying the move came in response to attacks by the group on army camps.\n\nThe TPLF mounted a comeback, recapturing most of Tigray in June 2021 and expanding into Afar and Amhara, before the fighting reached a stalemate.\n\nUnknown numbers of civilians have died and millions need humanitarian aid.\n\n© 2022 AFP",
    "Tigist Assefa Runs Nearly 20-Minute PR to Destroy Berlin Marathon Course Record": "Tigist Assefa of Ethiopia defied the odds with a shocking victory at the 2022 Berlin Marathon, clocking 2:15:37 to obliterate the course record by almost three minutes. The run is the third-fastest women’s marathon ever, and, most astonishingly, a personal best of nearly 20 minutes.\n\nThe 28-year-old was a non-factor in the lead-up discussion to the race, as she had run just one marathon: a 2:34:00 this past March at the Riyadh Marathon in Saudi Arabia. On Sunday in Berlin, Assefa ran 1:08:13 for the first half with the pack, then negative split 1:07:25 on the back end, throwing down 15:53 and 15:46 splits at the 30K and 35K marks to distance the field by nearly three minutes.\n\nShe held an average mile pace of 5 minutes, 10 seconds for the duration of the 26.2 miles.\n\nMore From Runner's World\n\n“My preparation was very fantastic. I did what I need [sic]. My training was really fantastic… I am really happy today,” Assefa said through a translator after the race.\n\nThe race for runner-up honors was tight, as Rosemary Wanjiru of Kenya edged Ethiopia’s Tigist Abayechew, 2:18:00 to 2:18:03, in her debut marathon. Both ran under the previous course record of 2:18:11, set in 2018 by Gladys Cherono.\n\nAssefa has only recently turned to the roads after spending much of her career as an 800-meter runner. She represented Ethiopia at the 2016 Olympic Games in the 800 meters, where she bowed out in the first round with a 2:00.21 performance. With personal bests of 1:59.24 in the 800 meters and 54.05 in the 400 meters, Assefa’s range is unprecedented.\n\nPrerace favorite Keira D’Amato’s attempt to improve her American record of 2:19:12 did not come to fruition, though she held on to finish sixth in 2:21:48.\n\nRelated Story The World’s Fastest Marathoners\n\nJohanna Gretschel Johanna Gretschel is a freelance writer and broadcaster living in Austin, Texas, who has covered elite track and field and running in all its forms.

    "An extreme citizen science approach to digital mapping in Ethiopia": "Key messages\n\nParticipatory mapping enables laypeople to be part of the map-making process, which has historically been the preserve of experts.\n\nLack of education is not necessarily a barrier to participation. When they know the landscape well, non-literate participants can provide information that is rich, detailed, and valuable for decision making.\n\nChallenges include the cost and accessibility of equipment and data, and hostile legal environments that obstruct restitution of common resources.\n\nHistorically, mapping has been predominantly a tool of colonial and state power, representing reality primarily in ways useful to administrators and extractive projects. However, laypeople have long made their own maps and used them in resistance to forces that ignored claims to customary territory.\n\nThe features that distinguish this approach from the standard citizen science model are, first, that the ends to which data collection is directed are determined by or co-created with the community of users; and second, that rather than targeting people with high levels of digital literacy, the approach includes collaborators regardless of literacy.\n\nThe work took place in Ethiopia’s Lower Omo region, where there is a long history of maps being used as tools of state power, and a more recent history of participatory mapping by indigenous people and their allies. The authors’ aim was to explore the potential of a digital mapping process that responded to indigenous people’s priorities, and in which locals could take a leading role regardless of their levels of literacy.",
    "The Art of Dominance: biased UN system perpetuates conflict in Ethiopia": "Aklog Birara (Dr)\n\nPart 10 of 14\n\nIt has been clear to me since TPLF colluded with Ethiopia’s foreign adversaries and initiated its treasonous war in November 2020 that the European Union (EU), the US and UN Specialized institutions such as the Human Rights Council as well as the UN Security Council will be unrepentant in showing favoritism by dominating the international narrative and by exercising unabashed dominance concerning the causes, pains, and possible outcomes of the war in Ethiopia.\n\nBehind this unrepentant one sidedness and flawed Western position on Ethiopia and Eritrea is deliberate Western pressure on Ethiopia and the rest of Africa to choose between the potentially explosive struggle between the USA/EU on the one hand; and China, Russia, and the rest on the other. Sadly, the UN system is unable to play its neutral and impartial role.\n\nIt is my contention in this commentary that the UN Human Rights Council dominated by the West has become a misnomer. Its name no longer represents truth, impartiality and or justice. Eurocentric to its core, the Council’s pronouncements are heavily politicized and pro-West. This is true regarding its repeated claims, assessments and conclusions concerning human rights violations, atrocities and socioeconomic destruction caused by the TPLF. The Council singles out the victims, namely, Eritrea and Ethiopia as victimizers. It never refers to TPLF atrocities in Mai-Kadra in November 2020 and Mai-Kadra like atrocities perpetrated by TPLF since then.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council took advantage of this year’s UN Annual General Assembly deliberations in New York. In a seamlessly synchronized parade of fake news and propaganda blitz, the Council lodged formal complaints from Geneva against Ethiopia. On September 22, 2022, the Council quoted so-called International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia that “Ethiopia’s people are once again “mired…in the intractable and deadly consequences” of conflict between Government troops and forces loyal to Tigrayan separatist fighters, who are all responsible for war crimes.”\n\nIt is true Ethiopians are “mired” in a death trap. It is equally true human atrocities are caused by the TPLF that initiated its third people’s war on August 24, 2022. Neither the “Experts” nor the Council identified the primacy causes of continued atrocities let alone condemn the culprit and its foreign backers. “The Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia told the Human Rights Council that it found reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the conflict had committed serious violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law.”\n\nI believe both the Council and the Commission of Human Rights Experts that includes a prominent African on Ethiopia that the Council charged to conduct violations failed to conduct due diligence. For example, they did not acknowledge the fact that the government of Ethiopia had declared a unilateral ceasefire while the TPLF had failed to do so. The “five -month ceasefire” had offered ample opportunity for TPLF to reciprocate. Instead, TPLF amassed more fighters, including child soldiers, received more lethal weapons from foreign sources, diverted foods and fuels from humanitarian agencies like the World Food Program. In effect, declarations and pronouncements by the UN system emboldened the TPLF and made it more reckless.\n\nWestern monopoly on truth\n\nThere is a plethora of material evidence for the Council to hold TPLF accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and economic crimes. It chose not to revert to truth for geopolitical, strategic, and political reasons. The reader must ask “What is the motive behind treating the terrorist and treasonous TPLF at par with the government of Ethiopia?”\n\nThe Council and its Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia failed regarding the impartiality test too. Let me give the Council and its experts the benefit of the doubt that both believe in the core principle that each person’s life matters in Ethiopia, and further believe that a “Rwanda-like scenario is unfolding and must be prevented.” If true, why fail to recognize the following facts perpetrated by the TPLF and its backers:\n\nRecruitment and deployment of child soldiers by TPLF is a crime for which it must be held accountable. It also demonstrates TPLF does not believe in peace or stability.\n\nCapturing and diverting humanitarian aid including food is a crime for which TPLF must be held accountable. Humanitarian aid agencies have an obligation to recognize the TPLF and not the government of Ethiopia has weaponized starvation in Tigray.\n\nExpanding the war to the Afar and Amhara regions as well as to Eritrea caused and still causes instability, human atrocities, and economic destructions by TPLF for which it must be held accountable. A conflict-ridden Ethiopia destabilizes the entire Horn and TPLF is the culprit.\n\nSealing off Tigray from independent international public scrutiny and forcing Tigrean mothers to deliver their children to TPLF’s asinine war killing machine with the consent of the EU, USA, and the UN system is a core part of war crimes that the Council and Experts are unwilling to consider.\n\nIt is patently false and immoral for the Council and its well-paid HR Experts on Ethiopia to claim that non-Tigrean Ethiopians: Fano, Amhara and Afar Special Forces, Ethiopia’s National Defense Forces as well as Eritreans have targeted or are targeting Tigreans and are committing genocide. The Federal Government of Ethiopia is not deploying child soldiers. TPLF is. Thousands of child soldiers are dying. Communities treat those who surrender more humanely than the Council and the Experts are willing to admit. The Experts reported to the Council “Extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual violence, and starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare.” There is no independent and credible evidence to support this allegation.\n\nThe Experts took the TPLF unfounded narrative of the use of drones and the dropping of explosives on the civilian population in Tigray and declared these as facts. UN-appointed HR Expert leader Kaari Betty Murungi says “Our investigation indicates that their use (drones) has exposed civilians to new and heightened risks…We have received reports of drone strikes in Tigray in the last four weeks, which have allegedly killed and injured civilians, including children.”\n\nEthiopia is fighting for its very existence. It is legitimate for Ethiopia to use drones in defense of the country’s sovereign rights and to protect its territorial integrity with utmost caution concerning civilians.\n\nTo give credence and balance to her allegations, Ms. Murungi insisted that they (Tigrean forces) had also likely committed serious human rights abuses that amount to war crimes: large-scale killings of Amhara civilians, rape and sexual violence, and widespread looting and destruction of civilian property in Kobo and Chenna in August and September 2021.”\n\nI agree with Ms. Murungi that “During their searches of homes in Kobo, for example, Tigrayan forces looked for weapons and pulled many men from their homes, executing them, often in front of their families.” They raped girls and women in front of their spouses and families.\n\nHowever, the Experts failed short by not documenting and or reporting the scale of TPLF rapes, slaughters of innocent Afar and Amhara, thefts, lootings, and the immense destructions of social and economic infrastructure in successive wars conducted by the TPLF that will take billions of dollars in investments and decades to rehabilitate and reconstruct. Their report is deliberately partial and partisan.\n\nThe Council places greater burden on the Federal Government of Ethiopia. Experts including Ms. Murungi weighed in by declaring the Federal Government and its allies “looted and destroyed goods indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in Tigray, killing livestock, destroying food stores, and razing crops while also implementing severe restrictions on humanitarian access to Tigray.” These well documented atrocities by Ethiopian sources were in fact committed by the TPLF and not by Ethiopian Federal and allied forces. The most compelling evidence is that the Federal Government of Ethiopia declared a unilateral ceasefire and gave peace a chance. Why did the UN system fail to demand reciprocity?\n\nThe Experts flipped the accusation and placed unjustified and unwarranted blame on Ethiopian Defense and allied forces. They failed to recognize an internationally recognized and accepted mandate that Ethiopian and allied forces have a Constitutional obligation to defend the safety and human security of Tigreans, Amhara, Afar and other Ethiopians from the mayhem inflicted on them by TPLF. How come principles that apply in Europe do not apply in Africa.\n\nYou cannot restore basic human services like “electricity, internet, telecommunications and banking” when you are cognizant that TPLF destroys them and blames it on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Experts and the Council know well that TPLF destroys social and physical facilities (hospitals, schools, bridges, roads, electric grids etc.) and blames it on Ethiopian and Eritrean forces repeatedly. TPLF diverts international humanitarian food and medical supplies and weaponizes the gaps deliberately and repeatedly without a modicum of challenge from the UN system. It accuses the Federal Government of Ethiopia that it is starving Tigreans and forcing TPLF to surrender without due diligence. Quoting TPLF and its diehard supporters is hardly due diligence. “We also have reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government is committing the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare.” I wonder why the Experts dd not interview the thousands of Tigreans who either surrendered or captured. hosted and treated most humanely by Afar and Amhara communities.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIt astonishes me that Ethiopia is not fighting solely a terrorist group. It is also fighting a biased, partisan, and politicized UN system.\n\nIt astonishes me because Ethiopia is a founding member of the UN and hosts the African Union. Yet, the Council treats Ethiopia like a pariah.\n\nIt astonishes me that Ethiopia contributes its share in the fight against terrorism, but the UN system does not give it support in its fight against the terrorist TPLF.\n\nIt astonishes me that the Eurocentric and Western dominated UN system of which the Council is a core part criticizes one of the most ancient countries on this planet for defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity while giving a differential treatment to Ukraine.\n\nIt astonishes me that the UN Human Rights Council and its Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia can get away with “unfair and biased” reporting at a time when the General Assembly of the United Nations is in session. It is hardly coincidental that the Experts submitted this pro-terrorist TPLF report with intent that the entire world would buy into it.\n\nTo say the report by the UN Human Rights Council based on its high-powered Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia is “unfair and biased scrutiny” is an understatement. The conclusions absolve the TPLF. Its lead conclusion is to hold Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders and officials accountable for a war they never initiated and for crimes they did not commit.\n\nI am not saying there has not been collateral damage, including deaths of innocent civilians: Tigreans, Afar, Amhara and Eritrean. We are talking about a civil war. But placing the burden of war crime, crime against humanity and crime of genocide on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea is patently partisan, unfair, unjust, and arrogant. For me, the international governance system is breaking apart. The pronouncement on Ethiopia and Eritrea shows Eurocentric bias and Western hegemony concerning a Black African state.\n\nMy conclusion is this is a form of proxy war on the diplomatic front that Ethiopia must deal with.\n\nI urge Ethiopians in Europe to demonstrate against the UN Human Rights Council.\n\n__\n\nTo Publish Article On borkena, please send submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nTelegram Channel : t.me/borkena\n\nJoin the conversation.

    "Grain from Ukraine Arrives in Ethiopia": "Some 23,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat arrived in Djibouti by ship late last month. Now, trucks have delivered a portion of that wheat to the World Food Program's main warehouse in Ethiopia, where food aid is desperately needed.\n\nThe World Food Program said the 23,000 tons of grain is enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month.\n\nSome of the grain is destined for Somalia, which like the rest of the Horn of Africa is reeling from severe drought.\n\nWhile it is not clear how much grain is going to Ethiopia, the WFP has said it hopes to reach 11.5 million Ethiopians in need by the end of 2022.\n\nThe WFP said food needs to continue to flow in for that to happen. Ukrainian food exports were cut off for months until Ukraine and Russia reached an U.N.-backed agreement last month to open a corridor for the free flow of food shipments.\n\nThe WFP says this is the first humanitarian aid shipment from Ukraine to arrive in Ethiopia under the agreement.\n\nEthiopia is experiencing drought and conflict in the northern Tigray region which have put more than 20 million people nationwide in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe recently renewed clashes between the government forces and the rebel Tigray People’s Liberation Front have displaced more people, and the lack of access to some areas has complicated relief efforts.",
    "Consultations under way between Egypt, Sudan on Ethiopian dam": "Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abul Gheit said that consultations are ongoing between Egypt and Sudan from one side and international parties on the other to address the file of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).\n\nIn an interview with Al Arabiya Al Hadath news channel, Abul Gheit added that the Nile Basin’s downstream countries and the international community cannot accept to have Ethiopia imposing its will in defiance of international law and rules in the using of waters of international rivers.\n\nThe issue that should be addressed is the importance of Ethiopia’s respect for international law.\n\nOn the Palestinian cause, Abul Gheit asserted that the US was not enthusiastic about the two-state solution between the Palestinians and Israelis unlike the Europeans.\n\nHe warned of attempts to bury the Arab Peace Initiative, saying that Israel should prove its seriousness about the two-state solution through its actions.\n\nOn the situation in Syria, Abul Gheit said that the UN envoy to Syria has failed to achieve any breakthrough until now. He warned of the grave humanitarian conditions in the country, noting that the continued US and Russian military presence and the muscle-flexing by Iran and Israel are impeding efforts for reaching a political settlement in Syria.",
    "Virginia man works to get used computers to schools in Ethiopia": "Almost 21 years after he emigrated from Ethiopia to the United States, Solomon Desalegn returned to his neighborhood in the eastern African country.\n\nHe saw new buildings and roads in the capital city of Addis Ababa, where he was born and raised, and thought, “Wow, this is a great improvement.” Then, he visited his old high school, which had a new shell on the outside, but few changes had been made on the inside since he’d been a student there.\n\nTeachers were still instructing “the old-fashioned way, standing in front of the board, writing,” he recalled.\n\nThere were no computers in the classroom and certainly no labs where students could learn keyboarding. In colleges he visited, professors taught computer theory and demonstrated the skills on a computer, but the students didn’t get the chance to try it out themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, his oldest son had been using computer apps like Google Earth since he was 6. His parents would tell him a relative’s location and the boy would pinpoint their home on the map.\n\nDesalegn realized the only difference between his three sons and other children in the Horn of Africa was the address of their birth.\n\nIt was a life-changing moment for the Stafford County man, now 50.\n\n“You go to those elementary schools and you see all those kids have no clue whatsoever what’s out there. It’s heartbreaking and it’s difficult to express in words the emotions you feel,” he said, tears forming in his eyes.\n\nDesalegn came back to the U.S., determined to make a difference. Between his full-time work for the Marine Corps, where he’s an electrical engineer who tests and evaluates systems, his quest to earn his doctorate degree and his family obligations to his wife and three teens, Desalegn formed the nonprofit, Educate Africa.\n\nLast month, the group shipped 55 laptops to Wollo University, one of the institutions looted during the recent war between the government and rebel forces. Both Educate Africa and university officials had to complete mounds of paperwork to get the government to waive the typical customs fees and allow the donation.\n\nA relative, Yonhatan Goitom, helped the nonprofit register as a charitable organization in Ethiopia after it got the proper paperwork in the U.S.\n\nFredericksburg Personal Computer Users Group also assisted by providing a $5,000 grant to help purchase the computers, replace missing or damaged hard drives or memory and ship them to East Africa. Desalegn paid the other $2,000 out of his own pocket.\n\nFPCUG board member Frank Fota helped download new operating systems, when needed, and has served as Educate Africa’s only volunteer, other than Desalegn, for about eight months.\n\nThe two know from their work experience that federal and local governments, as well as school systems and universities, tend to replace their computers every three years and there aren’t many places that recycle electronics. Equipment often is auctioned and sold in bulk, and Desalegn and Fota have acquired dozens of computers that way.\n\n“But we’re not awash with cash donations, so we’re just trying to get the word out,” Fota said.\n\nHe and Desalegn are eager to partner with other nonprofits, businesses or individuals who have the time, talent and resources to take equipment possibly headed for the landfill, and make it part of a “necessary life-changing educational experience” in Ethiopia and eventually other African countries, according to the website educateafricaweb.org.\n\nIf there’s anyone who could be the poster child for the difference education can make, it’s Desalegn.\n\n“Being driven comes with the lifestyle” of growing up in a third-world country, he said. “Everybody understood the value of education and they worked hard for it.”\n\nHis father, who worked for a government logistics company, made it clear that Desalegn’s sole purpose in life, while under his roof, was to focus on his studies. While others brought their sons into family businesses, Desalegn was motivated to pursue his education.\n\nHe finished high school and had a couple years of college in Ethiopia where he also was trained as an aircraft technician and worked for two years. He was 23 when his immigration papers were approved and he used his training to apply for a Federal Aviation Administration license to work on commercial aircraft.\n\nDesalegn serviced airplanes in Pennsylvania for two years, then did the same in Arizona and Minnesota until Delta Airlines transferred him to Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, he resumed his studies in the United States. While holding down various jobs, he earned his engineering degree from George Mason University, his master’s in systems engineering from Johns Hopkins University and is working on his doctorate from Liberty University.\n\n“I’m telling you this to give you a picture of the drive and the value of education that we were told when we were kids,” he said. “It still impacts in some form or fashion.”\n\nDesalegn has about 50 desktop computers ready to be shipped overseas and he knows exactly where they’ll go. He was in Ethiopia last month when the first shipment arrived and he talked to officials at his old high school, which has become Tegbareid Polytechnic College. There are about 1,600 students there in eight different departments, and Desalegn and the dean agreed the nonprofit would provide at least 50 computers to each section.\n\n“There are so many colleges, so many high schools, so many middle schools that would die to get these computers,” Desalegn said. “I have made a promise to him that he will get his computers, but I did not promise on the time.”\n\nMore information about Educate Africa’s mission is available at its website, educateafricaweb.org.",
    "New Report: Women champion forest conservation in Bale, Ethiopia": "A new report outlines how Farm Africa and SOS Sahel Ethiopia’s Bale Mountains Eco-region REDD+ forest conservation programme in Oromia, Ethiopia has achieved impressive results in its priority objectives of reducing deforestation, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing household incomes. It has also helped the community take significant strides towards advancing gender equality.\n\nLibby Plumb , Head of Communications, Farm Africa\n\nA new report outlines how Farm Africa and SOS Sahel Ethiopia’s Bale Mountains Eco-region REDD+ forest conservation programme in Oromia, Ethiopia has achieved impressive results in reducing deforestation, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing household incomes and gender equality.\n\nSince 2012, Farm Africa has been working in partnership with the NGO SOS Sahel Ethiopia, with funding from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Ethiopia, to deliver a project that lowers greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation in the Bale Eco-region, while also boosting the livelihoods of local communities living in poverty.\n\nThe project has helped more than 34,000 members of 64 forest cooperatives increase their incomes from the sale of forest-friendly products as well as carbon credits sold on the voluntary carbon market, both of which created an economic incentive to preserve the natural forest and biodiversity.\n\nThe project achieved impressive results, both for people and the planet.\n\nThe report, Making Forests Sustainable, details how over the period 2012-2020, deforestation in the Bale Eco-region was 58% lower than it was projected to be in the absence of the project. This avoided deforestation resulted in more than 25,000 hectares of forest being saved and emissions being reduced by 10.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nMeanwhile, the average annual household incomes of forest-dependent communities in the eco-region rose by 143% from an average 17,000 Ethiopian Birr per household per year at the start of the second phase project in 2016 to 43,000 Birr in 2021.\n\nThe Bale Eco-region hosts the largest Afro-alpine ecosystem in Africa and is one of the two major biodiversity rich rainforest blocks in Ethiopia. By conserving forests, the project contributed significantly to the conservation of unique flora and fauna.\n\nCarbon credits\n\nThe project is the first of its kind in Ethiopia to secure income from REDD+ carbon credits. Income from carbon credit sales, which is additional to the average increases in household incomes mentioned above, is enabling forest management cooperatives to invest in community development initiatives.\n\nFemale representation in leadership positions has helped ensure the cooperatives’ investment plans will deliver tangible benefits to women, such as a new local flour mill, which will relieve women of the need to undertake arduous, unsafe journeys on horseback to the nearest grain milling facilities.\n\nThe project’s success has paved the way for more REDD+ initiatives in Ethiopia. The communities supported by Farm Africa and SOS Sahel Ethiopia in Bale are now taking part in the jurisdictional Oromia Forested Land Programme (OFLP) REDD+ scheme, which seeks to reduce deforestation across the whole of the Oromia Regional State.\n\nForest-friendly businesses\n\nBoth men and women were offered opportunities to develop income streams from forest-friendly businesses selling products such as coffee, honey and bamboo. The work to support forest coffee production was particularly successful, with cooperatives achieving an increase in the grade of their coffee from grade 6 to specialty coffee (grade 1 or 2) as measured by the Coffee Exchange standards. This enabled the sale of more than 67 metric tonnes to the international specialty coffee market in the season running from October 2020 to July 2021, at average prices of between US $4.34 to US $5.45 per kg.\n\nThe by-laws of the community-based cooperatives producing and marketing non-timber forest products were changed to stipulate either the Chair or Deputy Chair had to be female, leading to 61 of the 64 organisations having a woman in one of the two highest positions in 2021, up from 10 in 2016. This in turn encouraged more women to join the cooperatives.\n\nFuel-efficient stoves\n\nIn Bale, responsibility for feeding the family falls on women and girls. Most meals are cooked on open fires. Food preparation and firewood collection dominate women’s time. To reduce pressure on both women and the forest, Farm Africa and partners distributed a total of 5,961 fuel-efficient stoves.\n\nOn average, households’ annual consumption of fuelwood fell from 12.84m3 to 9.25m3 over the last four years, enabling the project to reduce forest degradation by saving a total volume of 34,500m3 of fuel wood that would otherwise have been collected from the natural forest.\n\nThe stoves have also brought improvements to women and children by reducing the smoke they inhale. The time saved from firewood collection and cooking is time that women are now able to invest in other activities, including income-generating work.\n\nEtagegegnehu Mulushewa, who makes a living by selling the Ethiopian staple food, home-baked injera, commented: “With the traditional open smoky stove, I had to use more than 200kg of firewood to bake 800 injera. Now, with the fuel-saving one, I only need 100kg firewood for the same amount.”",
    "Indonesia, Ethiopia discuss global COVID-19 vaccination developments": "Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and Ethiopian Health Minister Lia Tadesse Gebremedhin discussed the developments in global COVID-19 vaccination.\"Indonesia remains committed to fighting for fair distribution and access for COVID-19 prevention products,\" Marsudi noted in a meeting with the Ethiopian minister of health on the sidelines of the High Level Week of the 77th Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, as quoted in a press statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday.The COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) cooperation program could play its role in strengthening the capacity of developing countries and the global health architecture in the future, Marsudi remarked.\"COVAX can help better prepare for other potential pandemics because COVAX's work mandate will be extended until 2023,\" she added.As a forum for multilateral cooperation, COVAX has proven that multilateralism works effectively, according to the minister.To date, at least 1.84 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been delivered by COVAX to various countries through multilateral channels.A total of 79 countries have achieved the vaccination target of at least 70 percent, including Indonesia.Through COVAX, Indonesia has received 130,662,975 -- or 25.6 percent -- of free COVID-19 vaccine doses.Meanwhile, Minister Tadesse said that the structure of COVAX should be adjusted to the developments of the pandemic in order to increase the capacity of countries to prepare for other potential pandemics.The two ministers agreed that in future, COVAX should continue to work with WHO as well as ensure countries have the necessary resources to accelerate and develop their national health strategies.The Indonesian foreign minister and the Ethiopian minister of health along with the Canadian Minister of International Development are the Co-Chairs of the COVAX Advance Market Commitment Engagement Group (AMC-EG).",
    "The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam: Limited Options for a Resolution": "On August 12, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced that his country has now completed the third filling of the reservoir behind its controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). And the country also recently announced that the second of the GERD’s 13 hydropower turbines is now operational. Ethiopia’s recent moves in filling the dam have been seen as a provocation by the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan, which have rejected Ethiopia’s unilateral policies in this regard and have urged it to negotiate a binding agreement that would regulate both the filling and operation of the GERD, and that would enhance cooperation among the three countries over the use of the Nile’s water. However, absent such an agreement, tensions among the three countries are likely to grow, with limited options for a resolution.\n\nEthiopia’s GERD Policy\n\nIn 2011, Ethiopia began construction on the GERD without consulting or negotiating with Egypt and Sudan, both of which lie downstream from the dam and depend on the Nile waters that flow through it. International law and relevant treaties underscore the importance of coordinating the use of watercourses between upstream and downstream countries. For example, the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses urges countries that share watercourses to consult and negotiate “in good faith” over their use of water, and to do so without causing significant harm to each other. However, it is worth noting that neither Egypt nor Ethiopia is among the signatories of this convention.\n\nEthiopia began construction on the GERD without consulting or negotiating with Egypt and Sudan, both of which lie downstream from the dam and depend on the Nile waters that flow through it\n\nIn March 2015, Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia signed a declaration of principles that would serve as the basis for negotiations among the three countries over the filling and operation of the GERD. The agreement asserted that cooperation between the three countries should be based on “mutual understanding, common interest, good intentions, benefits for all, and the principles of international law.” It also stated that guidelines on the first filling of the GERD reservoir should be developed as the dam was being constructed. However, since signing the declaration of principles, Ethiopia has essentially acted unilaterally regarding the filling and operation of the dam. For example, the country began the first filling of the GERD’s reservoir on the Blue Nile in the summer of 2020, and completed the third and final filling in August without resolving outstanding objections that Egypt and Sudan have raised. Ethiopia ignored both countries’ multiple calls to reach a binding agreement on the dam, one that would secure Sudan and Egypt’s water rights and interests.\n\nSince signing the declaration of principles between the three countries in 2015, Ethiopia has essentially acted unilaterally regarding the filling and operation of the dam\n\nIn addition, Ethiopia began generating electric power from the dam by switching on two turbines on the GERD, despite claims from Egypt and Sudan that doing so may affect their own hydroelectric power initiatives. When Ethiopia established its first hydropower turbine in February 2022, both countries criticized the move, with a spokesperson for Sudan’s negotiating team calling it a “breach of Ethiopia’s international legal commitments.” Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, meanwhile, slammed Ethiopia for its announcement of the third GERD filling, describing the country’s unilateral actions as “a clear violation of the 2015 Declaration of Principles Agreement and a grave violation of the applicable rules of international law.”\n\nFrom Ethiopia’s perspective, the GERD is an essential tool for it to meet its economic and development needs especially through generating hydroelectric power, as more than half of its population lacks access to electric power\n\nFrom Ethiopia’s perspective, the GERD is an essential tool for it to meet its economic and development needs. This is a fact that is recognized by all parties in Article 2 of the declaration of principles, which states that, “The purpose of the Renaissance Dam is to generate power, contribute to economic development, promote cooperation beyond borders, and regional integration through generating clean sustainable energy that can be relied on.” Ethiopia is one of the least economically developed countries in Africa, with more than half of its roughly 117 million people lacking access to electric power. But the country plans to reach 100 percent electrification by 2025, in large part due to hydroelectric power produced by the GERD. The dam is also expected to help expand agriculture in Ethiopia (a major sector of the Ethiopian economy), helping irrigate hundreds of thousands of acres of land and creating numerous jobs for Ethiopian farmers.\n\nThe great benefits that the GERD promises to bring to Ethiopia help explain the country’s position regarding Egypt and Sudan’s demands and unwillingness to reach an agreement\n\nIn addition, the GERD has a storage capacity of about 74 billion cubic meters of water and is expected to generate more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity, an amount that far outstrips Ethiopia’s domestic needs, and that will allow it to become an electricity exporter. Furthermore, according to one study, “The Nile River in Ethiopia has over 15,000 MW of undeveloped hydropower potential. Exploitation of this potential could improve access to electricity in Ethiopia and other East African countries that are connected to the Ethiopian power grid [such as] Sudan, Kenya, and Djibouti.” Therefore, not only will the GERD help Ethiopia overcome its economic and development challenges, but by turning the country into a major regional exporter of electricity, it will significantly increase Ethiopia’s national income, while also benefitting neighboring countries. The great benefits that the GERD promises to bring to Ethiopia help explain the country’s position regarding Egypt and Sudan’s demands, and shed light on why it appears unwilling to negotiate to reach an agreement over the dam’s filling and operation.\n\nProfound Mistrust\n\nOne key reason behind the tensions between Ethiopia on one side of the negotiating table and Egypt and Sudan on the other is profound mistrust between the two sides. The three parties have held several rounds of negotiations over the past seven years in order to resolve their disputes and disagreements over the dam. However, negotiations have repeatedly led nowhere. Ethiopia believes that Egypt and Sudan have been utilizing the Nile River unfairly for decades, at the expense of both it and other upstream countries. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a treaty that allocated 55.5 billion cubic meters of Nile water to Egypt and 18.5 billion cubic meters to Sudan. Ethiopia, however, was not a party to the treaty, and has attempted to challenge the agreement over the past several decades. In fact, Ethiopia views both the 1959 treaty and a 1929 treaty between Egypt and Great Britain that recognized Egypt’s rights to the Nile’s waters and gave it the ability to veto construction projects on the river and its tributaries as remnants from the country’s colonial era that are, in Ethiopia’s view, no longer binding. In fact, the building of the GERD can be seen as an Ethiopian response to what it views as unjust treaties that prevented it from using the Nile waters fairly.\n\nOne key reason behind the tensions is profound mistrust between the two sides; Ethiopia believes that Egypt and Sudan have been utilizing the Nile River unfairly for decades, at the expense of both it and other upstream countries\n\nIn addition, Ethiopia believes that the construction, filling, and operation of the GERD is a sovereign right that cannot be disputed or compromised under any circumstances. As Spokesperson of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dina Mufti stated, “Ethiopia has legal and sovereign right to use the Nile water for development fairly and equitably and…Ethiopia has no interest in harming the lower Nile Basin countries in doing so.” However, Egypt and Sudan believe that the GERD will have a significant impact on their economic and development needs, as both countries rely heavily on the Nile River to fulfill them. Egypt and Sudan both obtain the vast majority of their fresh water from the Nile River, which reaches them via Ethiopia. Another key concern for Egypt and Sudan relates to the operation of the GERD during times of drought. Both countries are concerned that without a clear and binding agreement with Ethiopia, the latter will have full control of the passage of water from the GERD during droughts, which would be devastating to the lives of millions in Egypt and Sudan. As Egypt’s Sameh Shoukry said in an address to the UN Security Council, “It is not an overstatement to affirm that, for Egypt, the GERD is an existential threat.”\n\nEgypt and Sudan believe that the GERD will have a significant impact on their economic and development needs, as both countries obtain the vast majority of their fresh water from the Nile River which reaches them via Ethiopia\n\nDisagreements and disputes over the use of the Nile’s water, and particularly between Egypt and Ethiopia, are nothing new. Starting in the early 1990s, the two countries held several talks on how to resolve their disputes, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement. Further complicating the matter, Egypt has said on more than one occasion that it would resort to force if needed in order to protect what it perceives as its historical rights to the Nile waters, a stance that heightened tensions and expanded the gulf of mistrust between the two countries. And recently, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi warned Ethiopia of the “grave threat” that the GERD represents, and cautioned that if the dam affects Egypt’s water supply, the region will experience “unimaginable instability.” The Ethiopian prime minister, meanwhile, stated in 2019 that his country is ready to go to war in order to protect the dam, saying, “If there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied.” These mutual threats only increased tensions among the three parties involved in the GERD dispute, and reduced the possibility of reaching an agreement.\n\nLimited Options for a Resolution\n\nOver the past decade, Egypt and Sudan have tried in earnest to reach an agreement with Ethiopia over the dam. But the two countries signed the declaration of principles in 2015 after Ethiopia had already begun building the dam, which weakened their position in subsequent negotiations. Whereas Egypt and Sudan seek a legally binding agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD, Ethiopia prefers a set of non-binding guidelines that can be modified at any time. After failing to resolve the dispute on their own, Egypt and Sudan petitioned the UN Security Council to intervene and resolve the issue. While the two countries had hoped that the Security Council would mediate negotiations with Ethiopia, in September 2021 it simply called upon the African Union to take the lead and resolve the issue. The council also highlighted the importance of reaching an “acceptable and binding agreement on the filling and operation of the [dam] within a reasonable time frame.” While Egypt and Sudan welcomed the council’s statement and saw it as supporting their position, Ethiopia rejected the involvement of the Security Council in the dispute. Egypt and Sudan also attempted to lobby the international community—particularly the US, China, and Russia—to support their position in the negotiations. However, their efforts to break the stalemate have been hampered by quarrels between these global powers, especially due to Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine.\n\nWhereas Egypt and Sudan seek a legally binding agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD, Ethiopia prefers a set of non-binding guidelines that can be modified at any time\n\nEgypt also attempted to rally the Arab world behind its position, approaching both the Arab League and individual countries that maintain good relations with Ethiopia, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In June 2021, the Arab League urged Ethiopia to engage in “good faith” negotiations with Egypt and Sudan and to avoid making any unilateral decisions in the matter. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry, however, rejected the statement, and called upon the Arab League to “desist from making such unhelpful statements, which will only serve to antagonize the relations between the three countries and undermine the tripartite negotiation.”\n\nThe UN Security Council called upon the African Union to take the lead and resolve the issue and highlighted the importance of reaching an acceptable and binding agreement, which Egypt and Sudan welcomed and Ethiopia rejected\n\nIn July 2021, Saudi Arabia threw its support behind Egypt and Sudan, issuing a statement calling for the preservation of their “legitimate water rights” and stating that the international community should “intensify efforts to find a clear mechanism to start negotiations between the three countries to get out of this crisis.” The UAE has also attempted to play the role of mediator. In August, the Permanent Mission of the UAE to the United Nations urged all three countries to continue negotiations under the auspices of the African Union. The UAE believes that it can play an effective role in mitigating the dispute by relying on its massive financial resources and its strong diplomatic ties with all three countries. And over the past year, Abu Dhabi has hosted technical talks between the three nations, but without making meaningful progress or being able to break the current stalemate.\n\nWith the construction and filling of the GERD now nearly complete, Egypt and Sudan are running out of options. But without an agreement, existing tensions and disputes threaten to potentially break out into a larger conflict.\n\nWith the construction and filling of the GERD now nearly complete, Egypt and Sudan are quite simply running out of options in their efforts to push Ethiopia to sign a binding agreement that would preserve their rights and interests in the Nile waters. But without an agreement, existing tensions and disputes threaten to sit and fester, and to potentially break out into a larger conflict. As the GERD’s hydropower operations ramp up, it remains to be seen what moves Egypt and Sudan will try next."
