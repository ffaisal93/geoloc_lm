    "Hungary PM Orban says EU sanctions on Russia have \"backfired\"": "BUDAPEST, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Hungary should prepare for a prolonged war in neighbouring Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday, sharply criticising European Union sanctions imposed on Russia which he said have \"backfired\", driving up energy prices.\n\nOrban, long at odds with the EU over some of his policies seen in Brussels as anti-democratic, urged a ceasefire to end the war and said the sanctions against Russia were dealing a blow to Europe's economy.\n\nOrban, who was reelected for a fourth consecutive term in April, now faces surging inflation, plunging consumer confidence and the prospect of a recession next year.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nHe told parliament it was no surprise that governments were falling in Europe, referring to the Italian election on Sunday following which Giorgia Meloni looks set to lead Italy's most right-wing government since World War Two.\n\n\"We can safely say that as a result of the sanctions, European people have become poorer, while Russia has not fallen to its knees,\" Orban said. \"This weapon has backfired, with the sanctions Europe has shot itself in the foot.\"\n\n\"We are waiting for an answer, the entire Europe is waiting for an answer from Brussels on how long we will keep doing this,\" he said, adding it was also time to discuss the sanctions with the United States.\n\nOrban, whose government is in talks with the European Commission to secure billions of euros in EU funds blocked over rule-of-law concerns, said his government would launch a \"national consultation\" asking Hungarians about sanctions. Orban has previously used this campaign tool to shore up domestic support for his Fidesz party on policies such as gay rights or migration.\n\nOrban said his government had revised its long-term energy strategy and aims to overhaul the power system and extend the lifespan of the Paks nuclear power plant, with a total of 32 big investments planned to be financed using EU funding.\n\n\"If the Brussels bureaucrats do not give us this money, which Hungary is eligible for, then we will get the necessary funds from other financial sources,\" Orban said, adding Hungary had started talks with the EU and \"other international partners\".

    "Hungary Should Guarantee Safety of Lesbian Activists During DykeMarch": "Click to expand Image Rising anger over policies of Hungary's right-wing government filled the streets of the country's capital as thousands of LGBT activists and supporters marched in the city's Pride parade in Budapest, Hungary, July 2021. © 2021 Anna Szilagyi/AP Images\n\nHungarian lesbian activists are set to hold their second DykeMarch on October 1, the final day of the EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community (EL*C) Conference in Budapest. This year’s conference, “Lesbian Resistance,” will open two weeks after Serbia initially banned EuroPride 2022, the latest in a two-year spate of attacks on Pride marches and other queer events in Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch come amid ongoing government harassment of lesbian activism in Hungary. In February, an appeals court ruled against Labrisz Lesbian Association, finding that an article in a pro-government newspaper likening lesbian activists to pedophiles did not injure their reputation. This reversed a lower court decision, which deemed the article to be unfounded and offensive.\n\nIn June 2021, a Hungarian law criminalized showing “any content portraying or promoting sex reassignment or homosexuality” to children, falsely conflating LGBT rights with pedophilia. In August 2021, a government decree restricted customer access to the children’s book “A Fairytale for Everyone”, published by Labrisz Lesbian Association in 2020, under a new requirement that children's books seen to “promote homosexuality” be sold only in “closed wrapping.” The Labrisz book retells traditional fairytales with queer, feminist characters.\n\n“Having the conference in Budapest means a lot to us,” said Dorottya Redai, an activist with Labrisz. “Labrisz has been fighting against the political oppression of sexual minority women since 1999. Under the current government, we work harder than ever. We hope the Conference will signal to the government that lesbian resistance is powerful and won’t be silenced.”\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch take an intersectional approach, demanding rights for migrants, refugees, Roma communities, and other minority groups. As such, organizers could be at risk vis-a-vis Hungary’s sweeping criminalization in 2018 of migrant and refugee rights defenders. That law, condemned by several United Nations Special Rapporteurs and held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to violate EU law, remains in effect.\n\nGiven these wide-ranging attacks on queer, feminist, migrant, and minority rights advocacy, Hungarian authorities should ensure that the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression are protected during the EL*C conference and DykeMarch, and repeal laws that criminalize the work of activists and human rights defenders.",

    "The E.U. Is Finally Standing Up to Viktor Orbán": "For more than a decade, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has been locked in battle with the European Union over the democratic rules that Brussels expects E.U. member states to uphold. His commitment to “illiberal” Christian democracy has long since become a flashpoint. An E.U. report released earlier this month accuses Orbán of transforming Hungary into an “electoral autocracy” in which the prime minister has made “deliberate and systematic efforts” to undermine E.U. values.\n\nOrbán, a talented populist who has built his public popularity by picking fights with Eurocrats, insists he is merely defending Hungarian traditional values. But he stands accused in the report of attacks on press freedom, the independence of judges and courts, academic freedom, minority rights, and the rights of asylum seekers. None of this is new, but the report dropped at a highly charged moment.\n\nOn September 15, the European Parliament voted by an overwhelmingly majority to approve that report, which not only criticized Hungary for undermining democracy and the rule of law but also the European Commission for failing to force Hungary to change course. Orbán dismissed the report and the vote as a “bad joke.”\n\nFor years, the E.U. has had few good options to force Orbán and his Fidesz party to respect the rules, because so many of its potential punishment measures against offending member-state governments require unanimous support from other EU members, allowing Orbán to rely on support from fellow populists in Poland who can use vetoes to provide him with cover. But Brussels can hold back badly needed cash from the EU budget if it can prove there is credible risk the funds will be stolen by corrupt officials within the country in question.\n\nOn September 18, the E.U. fired this shot for the first time in its history.\n\nThe European Commission formally recommended that EUR 7.5 billion in funding for Hungary be held back until its government addresses a long list of specific issues. This isn’t the only money at risk. Unsuccessful E.U. bargaining with Hungary over terms of disbursement of EUR 14.9 billion in grants and loans as part of a COVID Recovery Fund leave Budapest short of money equaling about 8.5% of the country’s GDP. That’s a big hit for a small country.\n\nOther member states will vote in November on whether to withhold these funds, and the outcome won’t require unanimity but simply a “qualified majority,” a much lower threshold that leaves Orbán without protection. If the vote is yes, as is widely expected, Budapest will have one month to respond with changes meant to meet E.U. demands.\n\nOrbán is holding a weak hand. His government is already contending with high prices, a wobbly currency, and an energy crisis. Headline inflation rose to 15.6% in August, its highest point in 24 years. Prices for staple foods like milk, bread, and poultry have surged between 40% and 65% over the past year. After an election-year spending spree to support Orbán’s most recent victory, Hungary’s budget deficit is already far worse than his government forecast. Despite that, the government has buckled to public pressure by taking on an even heavier burden. In particular, it will extend price caps on some foods and fuels until the end of the year.\n\nRead More: The E.U. Is United Against Russia, With One Exception\n\nAdding to the pressure on Hungary’s economy, fears raised by E.U. action have weighed heavily on the forint, Hungary’s currency. It’s down 16% against the EUR over the past 12 months and 37% against the US dollar. Hungary’s current account deficit more than doubled from July to August of this year.\n\nIn short, the writing on the wall is so clear that even Viktor Orbán can read it. He and his party are still plenty popular at home. He can get by a while longer by blaming the E.U. and the war in Ukraine for Hungary’s economic problems.\n\nBut a rough winter looms, as Hungary, one of the countries most deeply dependent on energy supplies from Russia, scrambles for help. Failure to get prices under control could well start to cut into his support. Hungary needs that money, and it will have to jump through dozens of hoops to get it. Orbán’s government has already moved to begin meeting E.U. demands. On September 19, it sent parliament an anti-corruption bill. More such moves are in the works or will be soon.\n\nMore broadly, this is the opening salvo in a bid by E.U. officials to become much tougher with the governments of member states that flout Union rules on core values like rule of law. Brussels doesn’t want this fight to escalate, but it knows that other members are watching to see if these newly tough measures have teeth. Orbán will try to do as little as possible to unlock the funds his government needs. The E.U. doesn’t want a crisis that inflicts pain on Hungary’s people, but its leaders know they need to send a message that will be received across Europe.\n\nThe two sides will probably reach a deal, though it will surely take time. There will be many devils in many details that must be managed. The E.U. escalation is just the opening salvo of a much longer bureaucratic battle ahead.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",
    "Hungary Will Continue Issuing Visas to Russians, Foreign Minister Says": "Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, has confirmed that his government will continue issuing Schengen visas to Russian nationals, despite the ongoing sanctions imposed on the latter and talks for an eight package of restrictions being on the way.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“It’s a somewhat more complex and slow procedure compared to when there is such a treaty. But even when there’s no agreement, it doesn’t mean we don’t issue visas. Of course, we will continue doing so, in accordance with the procedure,” Szijjarto said in New York, attending the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe EU agreed on July 31 to discontinue the agreement with Russia, which simplified visa issuance to Russian citizens, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania later introduced restrictive measures to Russian tourists, including visa issuance, later also joined by Finland. On the other hand, Germany and France opposed a blanket ban on Russian tourists entering the zone.\n\nSpeaking regarding these measures, the Minister said that those sanctions imposed on Russia haven’t proved to be any successful, and they are, in fact, harming Europe, citing the sanctions as the reason why inflation has increased, utility bills, gas and food prices are soaring, putting the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nSzijjarto said for Kossuth Rádió, a Russian media, that an agreement reached with EU leaders in the most recent meeting for an eighth package had failed as no proposal was made, let alone a final decision.\n\n“We will not approve any decision that harms Hungary’s national interests. The security of our energy supply remains a red line. Any sanction that puts our energy supply at risk is unacceptable for us,” he said.\n\nHe also noted his disappointment for his “Western colleagues” that don’t want to negotiate, while Szijjarto values dialogue and negotiations. According to him, if the EU closes diplomatic channels, there could be no end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom is delivering 5.8 million cubic metres of gas to Hungary on a daily basis, in addition to volumes regulated in the country’s long-term contract. Hungary’s reserves now contain enough gas to cover 41 per cent of annual consumption, considerably more than the 23 per cent that Europe currently covers as a whole, as Szijjarto said.\n\nThese declarations follow the proposal of the European Commissioner for Budget, Johannes Hahn, to cut funding to Hungary, as the country is failing to align its politics with those from the EU. More specifically, €7.5 billion designated to Hungary will be cut off, as the country is also lacking in respecting democracy, in addition to refusing to impose sanctions on Russia.",
    "Hungarian government offering partnership to municipalities": "The government offers a partnership to municipalities and “will talk to everybody to ensure that fundamental public services are continued” in the next year, the head of the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.\n\nGergely Gulyás told a press conference after the general assembly of the federation of cities with county rights (MJVSZ) that the government expected its partners to economise “in return” with their resources.\n\nGulyás said Hungary’s 25 largest cities would face an extra burden totalling at 135 billion forints (EUR 131.7m) in increased energy costs next year. “This is in fact a result of major European disputes about the war and especially about the energy sanctions launched in response to the war,” he said.\n\nThe government and local authorities will have to rely on each other in this situation, Gulyas said, and asked local councils to reduce their “extra costs” but maintain “essential public services”. They would still need government assistance, he added, and said the government would talk to the municipalities and help out.\n\n“There is only one solution on the long run: energy sanctions should be replaced by a policy aimed at stabilising energy prices in Europe,” Gulyás said.\n\nGulyás called for “sensible” European policies, which “do not favour Russia, the aggressor, through soaring gas prices, but which hurt the aggressor and cause no harm to Europe”, and added that “so far the energy sanctions have proven otherwise.”\n\nRead also Hungarian local governments in big trouble, Budapest may also have a freeze break\n\nGulyás noted that national energy company MVM had recently offered municipalities various deals in which they could pay “different prices” for their energy with no obligation to pay several months in advance, but added that “issues around prices have not yet been fully settled”.\n\nKároly Szita, the head of the federation, said municipalities should work to “use the least possible amount of energy next year, but in any case less energy than in 2022”. He said fundamental services should remain, but some municipal institutions could stay closed for the winter months. He suggested talks between the government and ailing municipalities to start in the second half of October or November.",
    "Hungary Wants to Host Italian Super Cup": "Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported over the weekend that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has offered 8 million euros to the Italian Football Federation if Hungary hosts the next Italian Super Cup (Supercoppa Italiana), according to Index, a Hungarian news site, which contacted the Prime Minister’s Office in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper, a few weeks ago, the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the idea of Budapest hosting the Italian Super Cup, and the Italian Football Federation is reportedly considering the offer.\n\nThe out-of-town venue would not be new, with Saudi Arabia hosting the 2018 and 2019 Super Cups, and the country is also planning to host the upcoming match on January 18, 2023. However, according to La Repubblica, this could easily change and the federation could decide to host the match in Hungary instead.\n\nRelated article 0:1 - Hungarian Team Beats Dull Germany in Leipzig Ádám Szalai's goal keeps Hungary in top position in the group of deathContinue reading\n\nEven though the original article mentioned Budapest as a possible venue, several media outlets reported that the Hungarian Prime Minister offered to host the match at the Pancho Aréna in Felcsút, close to his home. However, this might be an error, since the Pancho Aréna can only accommodate 3,500 people. The Hungarian offer probably stands for the Puskas Aréna in Budapest which can host more than 67,000 fans.\n\nBudapest would be a good alternative, if only because Hungary is significantly closer to Italy than Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo the fact that teams and fans would have to travel less to the Hungarian capital is not a negligible factor. The Italian Super Cup will be played between Inter Milan and AC Milan, and according to media reports, both teams would prefer Hungary as the venue.\n\nLa Repubblica reports that the decision about the football match could be heavily influenced by the result of the Italian elections on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian coalition of right-wing parties won the election by a large margin, as a result of which Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and an ally of Viktor Orban, is likely to become the next Italian prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary and Italy will play against each other today in Puskás Aréna in the Nations League.

That is because they offer practically all kinds of goods that are needed in everyday life. TEDi’s motto, for example, “Everything decoration, party, stationery and much more” does not tell us too much. The range of goods on offer is reminiscent of the once common “hundred-forint” shops, a concept that existed abroad in the same way, as one-euro, one-dollar shops.\n\nWhat will be the future of these chains in Hungary?\n\nAlthough KiK has been present in our country since 2008, Pepco, which has been expanding since 2015, has many more stores.\n\nPepco Hungary Kft., the operator of the Pepco store network, generated net sales of HUF 68.5 billion from domestic sales in its last known financial year, from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021.

    "Hungary’s ‘pro-Russia’ stance was inevitable": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán traveled to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev. His attendance leaves Europe questioning if Hungary is pro-Russia | Evgenia Novozhenina/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWilliam Nattrass is a freelance journalist and commentator based in Prague.\n\n“Hungary condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The words sound unequivocal, but in the context of Hungary’s actions, do they ring true?\n\nAs European allies send weapons to Ukraine and try to minimize their dependence on Russian energy, Hungary has been taking a starkly different path. So far, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has refused to send military aid to Kyiv, and he recently concluded a new gas deal with the Kremlin to help Hungary weather the winter. He’s also more open to continuing normal diplomatic relations with Russia, traveling to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, who he said helped Central Europe “rid itself of Communism peacefully, without loss of life or blood.”\n\nWithin Europe, the country stands out like a sore thumb. And with broad support for Orbán’s non-interventionist policy, the question of involvement in the war isn’t even a major wedge issue domestically. So, is it reasonable to claim that Hungary is “pro-Russia”?\n\nThe short answer is no. Hungary’s ambivalent stance is the inevitable result of a combination of domestic political influences, as well as its complex relationships with Russia, Ukraine and the West. In many ways, it is the story of the country’s recent history.\n\nThe main problem with the simple pro-Russia label is that Hungarian attitudes toward Russia and Russians are far from friendly. Perceptions of Russia are still colored by Soviet forces crushing the Hungarian uprising of 1956, just as the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia haunts Czechs and Slovaks to this day. Even Orbán himself was a fervent anti-communist campaigner in the twilight years of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nPro-Russia social currents are also arguably much weaker in Hungary than among its Slavic neighbors. Nationalist movements in Slovakia, Serbia and the Czech Republic often share a sense of ideological kinship with Russia, one linked to suspicion of the West, seeing Ukraine’s pro-Western policy as something akin to a betrayal of Slavic identity.\n\nHowever, such interpretations of the war don’t exert the same sway in Hungary because Hungarians aren’t Slavic — neither do they nurture positive attitudes to Russians in general.\n\nSo how, then, to account for the country’s current pro-Russia stance?\n\nFirst off, it’s important to highlight that Hungarians have strikingly negative attitudes toward Ukraine. While Russia has harmed Hungary at various times in the past, Ukraine is seen as wronging Hungarians in the present.\n\nRelations between Budapest and Kyiv took a dramatically negative turn in recent years, when Ukraine introduced restrictions on national minorities intended to combat Russian influence. Hungarians claim minority communities in Transcarpathia — a region of Ukraine ceded by Hungary after World War I — faced hostility because of these policies.\n\nSince then, Orbán has been accused of fostering resentment. Tensions flared in 2018 over a video that apparently showed diplomats illegally issuing Hungarian passports to people in Transcarpathia. Later, in 2019, Hungary was accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in the region, and blocked Ukraine’s NATO membership negotiations over the row.\n\nToday, from the Donbas to Kosovo, events are again proving the potency of nationalist narratives over lost territory and peoples separated by the claimed injustices of history. Yet, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the simple fact that many Hungarians have negative views of both Russians and Ukrainians is pertinent.\n\nAnd while these views have clearly influenced Hungarian government policy on both military aid and sanctions, other historical, economic and cultural factors have played their part as well.\n\nMany Hungarians worry about the gravitational pull that wars can have on neighboring countries. In the early 1990s, Hungary only narrowly escaped being sucked into the wars in the Balkans, after it was revealed that Budapest had been supplying tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles to Croat forces.\n\nOrbán’s economic model built around geopolitical ambivalence has influenced the country’s resistance to energy sanctions as well. Orbán describes Hungary as a “transit economy,” which can only thrive by drawing investment and opportunities from both East and West.\n\nIn this context, German-Russian energy cooperation is paradoxically believed to be fundamental to Hungarian national security. Orbán argues that the German-Russian energy axis remains the only way to stop Eastern Europe from becoming “dependent on the Americans” for energy and military protection. Though, his warning against American energy dominance does seem bizarre given that Hungary, Germany and others have had few qualms about relying on Russia.\n\nFinally, the economic arguments against cutting Russia off dovetails with Hungary’s growing cultural rift with the West. The progressive values rejected by Orbán are also mocked by Moscow, and Orbán has portrayed the country as emblematic of traditional mores. “Russians speak an old language. When we listen to them, it’s as if we are hearing the sounds of the past,” he said.\n\nWith Orbán presenting Western progressivism to Hungarians as dangerous, it should come as no surprise that Russia’s more traditional cultural values exert a certain appeal. As Attila Demkó, head of the Center for Geopolitics at Budapest’s Mathias Corvinus Collegium, says: “After 12 years of pressure from the EU and the West,” many Hungarians fall into the trap of feeling that “if the West is ‘bad,’ there must be some ‘truth’ in what Russia is doing.”\n\nAnd as Orbán voters believe they’ve been demonized by their supposed Western allies in recent years, why, they might ask, should they back a sanctions program?\n\nHungary’s stance on the Ukraine war isn’t based on popular pro-Russia social currents. Rather, it is the result of historical and recent political factors, many of which have been shaped by Orbán himself.\n\nSimply put, Hungary isn’t pro-Russia. But even so, President Vladimir Putin’s invasion hasn’t made it pro-Ukraine either.",
    "Hungary backs down on push to lift EU sanctions on 3 Russian oligarchs — for now": "Hungary has, for now, dropped its demand to lift sanctions imposed by the European Union on three Russian oligarchs — a push that had threatened to derail the process for renewing the penalties, as POLITICO had reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe EU must periodically review and renew its time-limited sanctions against individuals, imposed at the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine, or they will lapse. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting of EU envoys, the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU reached an agreement with the Hungarians to avoid a blockade on the extension process by postponing the discussion on the three names to the next time the list must be reviewed in a couple of months.\n\nThis avoided a clash at Wednesday's meeting, according to three EU diplomats. Budapest's push ahead of the talks had infuriated other EU countries, which have bitter memories of Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s hold-up on the EU’s oil ban earlier this year.\n\nAccording to two diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned are Alisher Usmanov, Petr Aven and Viktor Rashnikov.\n\nThe Council will now take the next technical steps to make sure the sanctions list gets prolonged by the deadline of mid-September.",

Between November 20-28, the questionnaires will be available at the municipalities, for those who were unavailable for the census officers, she added.\n\nParticipation is mandatory for everyone who is a resident of Hungary on October 1, she added.\n\nThe census, conducted every 10 years, yields a “snapshot” of the country, with details about the living and working conditions, health and religious denomination of Hungarians, Vukovich said.\n\nThe information collected is crucial in determining local demand and for making decisions for the future, Vukovich said.\n\nAt the same time, this will be the last census where data is collected with the active contribution of the population, Vukovich said. The next will be completed using government databases, she said.\n\nThe census will contain new questions on the energy efficiency of houses and the digital literacy of residents. Responding to questions on health, disabilities, ethnic and religious identity, the respondents’ mother tongue or the language used in the household will be voluntary, she added.\n\nThe questionnaires will be available in 20 languages at www.nepszamlalas2022.hu.",
    "Hungary’s clean energy transition is the key to reach energy independence": "Hungary’s transition to clean energy can enable it to achieve greater energy security and independence as it navigates the supply challenges that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created for countries across Europe, according to a new in-depth policy review by the International Energy Agency.\n\nHungary has a strong starting point for its energy transition thanks to rapid growth of solar PV and a solid base of nuclear power. But it still has considerable work ahead to achieve its objectives for emissions reductions and energy sovereignty.\n\nSince the IEA’s last in-depth energy policy review in 2017, Hungary has increased its climate ambitions. In 2020, it became one of the first countries in Central Europe to put a carbon neutrality goal for 2050 into law and presented a long-term National Clean Development Strategy the following year. Hungary is aiming for 90% of its electricity generation to come from low-carbon sources by 2030.\n\nHowever, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created a new set of energy security challenges in Europe. In response to the current global energy crisis, Hungary declared a state of energy emergency in July 2022 that allowed the government to increase domestic gas and coal production, secure additional gas imports from Russia and increase the output of the Mátra coal power plant. The government is also considering extending the lifetime of the four reactors at the country’s Paks nuclear power plant, which guarantees almost 50% of Hungary’s electricity supply.\n\n“Prioritising energy efficiency and renewables is a pragmatic approach that aligns with Hungary’s energy and climate goals in the short term and the long term. It can avoid increases in both fossil fuel imports and emissions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol as the IEA released the report today.\n\nAttila Steiner, Hungary's State Secretary for Energy and Climate Policy, said: “Hungary has a strong commitment to renewables. As the next step, the government's priority is to upgrade the national grid to be capable of integrating the rapidly growing electric capacity generated by weather-dependent energy sources. However, to guarantee supply security and reach our ambitions climate goals, it is imperative to maintain or even increase our reliable and emission-free nuclear capacity as well.”\n\nAs a landlocked country, Hungary is today heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports and new nuclear investment. The IEA review calls on Hungary to reduce fossil fuel consumption and diversify its energy sources towards a broader portfolio of renewables by drawing on the considerable potential of its wind and geothermal energy resources as well as extending the lifetime of existing reactors, where safety permits.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary should make the best use possible of its energy market interconnections, which it has significantly increased in recent years, to get energy supplies from diverse routes, sources and suppliers. The IEA report highlights that Hungary has a critical role to play in the major task of improving Central and Eastern European countries’ links to regional gas storage sites and new LNG terminals elsewhere in the European Union.\n\nThe IEA report recommends that the Hungarian government adopt additional targets and policies to lower fossil fuel consumption, increase energy efficiency and promote investment in clean energy technologies, skills and jobs. Paying close attention to ensuring a fair transition, including providing adequate support for people and communities associated with the Mátra coal plant, will be crucial to secure a smooth phase-out of coal.\n\n“A stronger focus on investment in clean energy technologies is critical,” Dr Birol said. “Hungary has a huge opportunity to develop hydrogen for industrial sectors. Continued investment in developing its solar PV, geothermal and wind resources will allow Hungary to reduce its reliance on natural gas and coal in both heating and power generation. Hungary possesses the technologies it needs to advance its transition toward a clean and more secure energy system, which in turn will improve regional energy security.”",

His policies are far from ours, and so is his vision of Europe”.\n\nAccording to Berlusconi, “alliances in Europe must be made with large friendly countries” to protect Italy’s national interest.\n\nFor their part, EU socialists have warned that Italy will face the risk of “Orbanisation” if Meloni comes to power.\n\n“A radical right-wing government in Italy could open the door to an ‘Orbanisation’has of democracy in an EU-founding state,” Udo Bullmann, a German MEP from the social democrat party SPD and former S&D chief, told EURACTIV Italy on 31 August.\n\n(Federica Pascale | EURACTIV.it- Edited by Sarantis Michalopoulos, Alice Taylor | EURACTIV.com)",

That is because Hungarian public institutions will only be heated to 18 °C, while on the streets there will be 25 °C and sunshine. Indian summer will arrive in Hungary soon. Below you may read the details.\n\nThe end of this September is much colder than average, and there are a lot of rains everywhere in Hungary. That is good news because of the drought that hit Hungary hard during the summer but depletes our bank account. The heating season started in many places in Hungary because of the extra low temperatures, so people have to pay their increased energy bills earlier than people previously thought. Indian summer may ease that burden for a while soon, rtl.hu reported.\n\nIn Hungary, summer is hot and dry while autumn is windy and rainy but not extreme cold. However, hot weather can return even in October. The characteristic of such days is that, despite morning fogs and rains, late morning and afternoons are nice and warm, perfect for a jogging program or a trip. Therefore, it is not unusual to see people going to work, and school in jackets and returning home wearing only a T-shirt.\n\nRead alsoHungarian international airport to close in October\n\nThat is because on windless days, the sun waves reaching our body can raise even 10 °C on our general feeling of heat.\n\nThis year the Indian summer will not be long, rtl.hu says.

    "Hungary breeds unquiet on Ukraine’s western front": "Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine | Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nBUDAPEST — The Western alliance is pledging to support Ukraine till the bitter end. Hungary is openly calling on Kyiv to give up.\n\nAcross Europe, capitals are funneling Ukraine weapons to fuel a critical counteroffensive. And they’re broadly insisting Ukraine will decide when it is time to start peace negotiations.\n\nNot Hungary.\n\nThough Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, it has declined to join other Western allies in providing Kyiv with military support. Instead, it has banned weapon deliveries from crossing through Hungary into next-door Ukraine.\n\nWhile Budapest has signed off EU sanctions, it first insisted some of them be watered down. And even as fighting raged in eastern Ukraine this summer, Hungarian officials traveled to Moscow to negotiate a deal for extra gas supplies.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine. The West’s focus, he said in a speech in July, “should not be on winning the war, but on negotiating peace and making a good peace offer.”\n\n“The task of the European Union is not to stand alongside either the Russians or the Ukrainians, but to stand between Russia and Ukraine,” he said.\n\nWestern assistance, he has argued, is only prolonging the conflict. “Sanctions and arms deliveries won’t lead to results,” Orbán told local radio in August. “When one rushes to put out a fire, one doesn’t bring along a flamethrower.”\n\nOrbán’s stance on Ukraine — coming as European leaders worry about war fatigue and a winter of spiking energy prices and inflation — has raised concerns in Kyiv and abroad that Hungary could prove to be the West’s weakest link as it seeks to manage the largest military crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that Budapest does not always stand alone, with other capitals sometimes sharing at least part of Hungary’s concerns. But as the EU and NATO allies seek new ways to support Ukraine in a longer-term conflict, Budapest’s reluctance will be a persistent thorn in the Western alliance’s side.\n\nOrbán “doesn’t give a damn about Ukraine,” said András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to NATO and the United States.\n\nHungary’s position on the war “is not just a nuisance — this is a threat,” he said. “I don’t think NATO or the European Union is taking this seriously. And I think it’s a mistake.”\n\nCloser to the Kremlin than Kyiv\n\nSince returning to power in 2010 Orbán has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nHungary and Ukraine may share a border, but Budapest has long put more emphasis on its relationship with Moscow.\n\n“Hungary’s Ukraine policy has always been to a certain extent subordinated to Hungary’s Russia policy,” said András Rácz, an associate fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. He pointed to energy dependency and investments in Russia as driving Budapest’s calculus.\n\nOrbán began his political career as an anti-Soviet liberal. But since returning to power in 2010 he has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin, holding frequent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and striking a controversial deal with a Russian state-owned company to expand an existing nuclear power plant. On August 26, more than six months into Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine, Hungary issued a permit for the project to go ahead.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary’s relationship with Ukraine, particularly over the past five years, has been rocky.\n\nBudapest has repeatedly clashed with Kyiv over education and language policies it says are infringing on the rights of over 100,000 Hungarian speakers living in western Ukraine. As a result, prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Budapest repeatedly blocked NATO from holding ministerial-level meetings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of Orbán’s Ukraine strategy — both before and after February 24 — is driven by Hungarian domestic politics.\n\nBlaming Kyiv — and the West — for the war plays into Orbán’s electoral narrative, said political scientist and re:constitution fellow Edit Zgut-Przybylska. “It nicely fits the Euroskeptic populism of Fidesz, claiming that the corrupt imperialist West is endangering stability in Central and Eastern Europe,” she said.\n\nAhead of an election this past April, officials from the ruling Fidesz party claimed — falsely — that Ukraine was trying to meddle in the proceedings. In his victory speech, Orbán even cited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as one of his adversaries.\n\nOrbán also seems to be playing a longer geopolitical game, banking on the rise of like-minded forces on both sides of the Atlantic, according to Simonyi, the former ambassador.\n\nThe prime minister — under fire from Western allies for undermining Hungary’s democratic institutions — often speaks about a relative decline in western power and the need to build relationships in other parts of the world.\n\nThe results of the upcoming congressional midterms in the United States, Orbán said in his radio interview, “could influence U.S. foreign policy — including on the question of war and peace. I’m counting on this happening.”\n\nSimonyi said Orbán is seeking the “best of all worlds” — an American populist, right-wing government that would leave him alone, as well as relationships with Russia and China, which don’t care what happens domestically in Hungary.\n\nWar changes everything — for a time\n\nWith the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line | Nicolas Maeterlinck/BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor the moment, however, Russia’s February assault has changed the calculus. With the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line.\n\nWhen EU leaders agreed to grant Ukraine candidate status, opening the door to eventual EU membership, the Hungarian leader did not stand in their way. And while Hungary doesn’t allow weapons to cross into Ukraine, it does permit them to transit to other NATO countries, from where they can continue their journey toward the frontline. Budapest also quietly backed using an EU fund to reimburse countries sending Kyiv military equipment.\n\nHungarian officials say their country is in line with the Western alliance. “There are many myths about the Hungarian position,” said one senior Hungarian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He described Budapest’s stance on sanctions, especially when it comes to energy, as a reflection of the country’s “geographic and economic realities.”\n\n“We were not the only ones having national caveats,” the official said.\n\nBut there are still concerns. “Hungary is performing only the necessary minimum,” said Rácz, of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I think it’s not breaking the consensus, it’s not breaking the unity,” he said. “It is weakening the unity.”\n\nOfficials fret over an alliance straining\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe | Anatolli Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe and cooled the country’s relationship with its closest ally, Poland.\n\nBut now, over six months into the war, the Western alliance’s unity on Ukraine is also straining. There are fissures between Europe’s Russia hawks — in particular the Baltic states — and some western capitals on issues such as Russian visa bans and how to proceed with future sanctions packages.\n\nThere is also, some officials say, a discrepancy between Washington’s expansive support for Kyiv and Europe’s relatively more modest assistance. And war fatigue fears are infiltrating capitals ahead of a tough winter.\n\nAmid this landscape, Western partners fret that Hungary — as such an outlier — risks undermining the EU’s unity and security policies.\n\n“The Hungarians are practicing their own imperial policy towards countries surrounding them where there is Hungarian minority,” said one Central European official.\n\n“Orbán needs to fund his generous social politics by selling out European security,” the official adding, describing the Hungarian government’s behavior “as a Russian and Chinese Trojan horse.”\n\nHungary, according to the official, will continue resisting some efforts to help Ukraine — but within the limits of how “they were acting until now.”\n\n“They are only thinking of themselves, only acting for themselves,” this person said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, meanwhile, has moderated its public criticism of Hungary over the past weeks, after vocal criticism from Zelenskyy in the first months of the war.\n\nBut concerns in Kyiv persist.\n\nHungary’s leadership has put its “political internal agenda and agenda of their Russian friends forward as opposed to unity and values — unfortunately,” said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, chair of the Ukrainian Parliament’s committee on EU integration.\n\n“There are political forces in different European and NATO countries that actually are also working to undermine the unity,” Klympush-Tsintsadze noted, adding that in Hungary, these forces are in power.\n\nThe Hungarian government’s approach, she said, “worries me — how it will further undermine the common response.”",

    "Brussels considers cutting Hungary out of global tax rate bill": "Hungary’s veto on the EU's tax bill is embarrassing for Brussels | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPRAGUE — The European Commission is asking member governments whether they’d support a plan to cut Hungary out of the EU’s bid to introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent.\n\nFour officials from EU national finance ministries told POLITICO the Commission officials have been putting calls into capitals to gauge their appetite for a so-called enhanced-cooperation deal that would nullify Budapest’s veto of the initiative.\n\nTax bills require unanimity to get through Brussels’ legislative machinery, giving any EU country of any size the power to block them. But enhanced cooperation would allow member countries that favor the measure to progress without having to reach unanimity — leaving Budapest out in the cold.\n\nIf there’s support against Hungary, the EU’s executive arm could unveil the enhanced-cooperation initiative by the time finance ministers meet in Luxembourg next month for their monthly Ecofin meeting, one of the officials said.\n\n“Implementing the historic international agreement on minimum taxation remains a high priority for the European Commission,” a spokesman wrote in an email to POLITICO when asked about the phone calls. “We are in close contact with Member States with a view to delivering on that objective.”\n\nHungary’s sole veto against the tax rate is embarrassing for Brussels. EU institutions had hoped to be quick about implementing the global initiative and set the pace for over 130 countries that also backed the accord, including the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development orchestrated the initiative in a package of corporate tax reforms, designed to render tax havens useless and ensure global companies — and tech giants — pay their fair share of dues.\n\nThe two-pronged package is made up of the tax rate for multinationals and a measure that’ll ensure the world’s 100 biggest companies pay taxes on their operations and sales around the globe.\n\nLeaders from G20 countries rubber-stamped the package in the fall of last year but the OECD is still putting the final touches on the global levy for the 100 biggest companies.\n\nHostage-taking\n\nThe Commission copy-pasted the tax rate into an EU bill in December and EU finance ministers almost agreed on the text in April were it not for Poland.\n\nTreasury officials were quick to accuse Warsaw of holding the bill hostage over a rule-of-law dispute over which the Commission was withholding Poland's share of the EU’s €800 billion post-pandemic recovery fund.\n\nThe dispute with Warsaw was settled in June. But Hungary then followed suit at the 11th hour amid its own frustrations of not getting access to its recovery fund cash. The Czech finance minister visited his Hungarian counterpart in August to discuss the deadlock after taking on the administrative duties of the EU’s six-month presidency in Council — but left empty-handed.\n\nPatience is wearing thin with Budapest, said treasury officials, who were tentatively supportive of the Commission’s plan — although nothing has been decided yet.\n\nFrance and Germany have voiced support for the strategy in the past. There’s concern among smaller countries, however, that this strategy could embolden the Commission to keep using enhanced cooperation to circumvent them if they oppose tax bills in the future.\n\nBut the tax rate needs to happen to ensure that global momentum for the OECD accord continues, they add. If not, the fear is that the U.S. will fail to implement the deal, especially if Republicans win a majority of seats in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.",
    "EU Commission still probing Hungary's Covid recovery plan": "The EU Commission said on Tuesday (30 August) it wanted to conclude its assessment of Hungary for EU pandemic recovery funds \"as fast as possible\" — which have so far been held up by rule-of-law concerns.\n\nThe EU executive, however, did not comment in detail on Hungarian media reports that the government of Viktor Orbán has been already making the funds available — pre-financed from the national budget, to be covered later by the EU.\n\nStudent or retired?

    "How Hungary Abandoned Roma Refugees": "In a community centre in the north of Hungary, eighty Roma refugees silently marked the six-month anniversary of leaving Ukraine. With the men having left early in the morning to find work, the women took turns to look after the children of those out on shifts, chatting as they swept the long corridors that connected their rooms. ‘Some of them have been here six months to the day, since day Russia invaded on 24 February,’ the centre manager, Bence*, told me. ‘It seems they had little they felt could protect them in Ukraine.’ Though the vast majority of the 1,240,000 refugees who fled across the Ukrainian-Hungarian border have moved onto more affluent countries, a number of Ukrainian Roma have remained. As native Hungarian speakers, sometimes holding Hungarian citizenship as a result of Orbán’s mission to appeal to Hungarian-speaking minorities in Slovakia, Serbia, Romania, and Ukraine, and with a larger number of migrant workers already having settled in the country before the war, Hungary was a natural choice. These facts notwithstanding, many Ukrainian Roma feel abandoned by Hungary. ‘Though access to healthcare in Hungary is free, in practice doctors often refuse to treat Roma or send them home with nothing more than painkillers, failing to make any substantive referral,’ Máté*, a social worker at the centre, told me. That same day, tragedy had already struck; a pregnant eighteen-year-old resident of the centre complained of excruciating stomach pains and called an ambulance. Paramedics only arrived an hour and a half later, at which point she had given birth to a stillborn baby. She told her social worker she could feel a distinct change in tone when the operator realised she was in a centre housing Roma people. Roma refugees’ access to educational services is no better, Máté said. He explained that many Hungarian teachers, due to deep-seated prejudices aggravated by Orbán, refused to teach Roma, and one of his colleagues told me that she had struggled to even register Roma children for school. ‘They tell me they don’t have enough spaces for new students—but what they really mean is that they don’t want any more Roma children.’ Speaking to one of the mothers, it seemed that her difficulties enrolling her children at school awakened memories of her childhood in the Caparthian region of Ukraine, from which many Roma hail. ‘Teachers always used to sit me at the back of classroom, far away from the other children, and would send me out whenever they could,’ she said, ‘often because I didn’t have schoolbooks or pens with me, because my parents couldn’t afford them.’ She left school in the second grade, as did most of the women in the centre. Bence estimates that fifty percent of the centre’s residents had been left functionally illiterate by their lack of access educational services.\n\nThe Broader Picture The situation of Roma in Hungary, regardless of whether normally resident there or not, has long been difficult. Many Roma have been relegated to essentially segregated settlements in a desert of state services that offer few employment opportunities. Just twenty-six percent of working-age Roma in Hungary are employed, while life expectancy for Roma born in Hungary is some ten to twelve years less than for non-Roma. The situation has only worsened since Orbán’s second spell as prime minister; in 2020, the supreme court ruled that segregation of Roma children in church schools was lawful. A director of a charity working for Roma inclusion felt that Orbán’s strategy to address the segregation of Roma was to downplay the problem as much as possible by marginalising Roma’s engagement in public life, relegating them to the fringes of society. Estimates of the number of Roma in Hungary vary—census data suggests that Hungarian Roma constitute 3.6 percent of the population, though academics have suggested that that it could be as high as 8.82 percent, due to Roma being fearful of self-identifying as Roma in front of state officials. What is not measured is invisible, and Roma have thus been cut out of aid for decades. The Hungarian government has failed to publish a list of the Ukrainian Roma centres across the country—a situation exacerbated by the fact that many Ukrainian Roma hold Hungarian citizenship, and therefore are not recorded under the refugee population—leaving charities scrambling to locate Roma desperately in need of their support. ‘We only heard about some of these settlements when the family members started to visit each other,’ the programme director of a Hungarian charity told me. ‘It makes it impossible for us to fundraise, to plan, to work out which staff to hire.’\n\nRefugees in Hungary Government services for refugees are scant, regardless of whether the recipient is Roma or not. Hungary has spent the least on refugees fleeing Ukraine out of the V4 countries, disbursing just 22,800 Hungarian forint (56 euros) per month, less than half of what refugees fleeing Ukraine receive in Poland. The government has also refrained from cooperating with any international organisations, including the UN, and therefore life-sustaining cash grants disbursed by the UN refugee agency in Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, and the like haven’t been available to those in Hungary. This has long been interpreted as a signpost to leave the country: in the words of one Roma inclusion expert, ‘Short of actually saying it, less than 60 euros a month makes clear that they’re not welcome here.’ More worryingly, the space in which charities operate is shrinking. A 2018 ‘Stop Soros’ law—a common anti-Semitic trope that links the existence of a global cabal interfering with Hungary’s internal affairs to NGOs helping refugees—outlawed helping undocumented migrants to lodge an asylum claim. A twenty-five percent tax on charities supporting migrants was launched in 2018, and though rarely enforced, this has left small organisations live in fear of falling foul of the law when the government suddenly demands said tax. Attacks on the charity sector have also spilled out into ad hominem targeting of employees. The government circulated a blacklist of NGOs, with individual names of charity employees working with refugees and/or Roma even published in newspapers. One such charity worker working with Roma told me that she only found out about the existence of the blacklist when her children came home from school asking why their mother had been singled out as a ‘bad person’ in the newspaper. This has contributed to an atmosphere of suspicion in Hungary, with charity workers refraining from coordinating or sharing what small data there is—no longer discussing sensitive topics on the phone, and leaving their devices at home when meeting with colleagues outside of their office.",

    "Hungary's bakers feel the heat as bread prices skyrocket": "The cost of bread is much more expensive now in EU countries than before the start of the Ukraine conflict; both nations are major exporters of grains and fertilizers.

In Hungary, however, the price of bread rose by a whopping 66 percent during the same time period.\n\nBut the global surge in wheat prices is not the only factor driving up the cost of bread in Hungary. Record-high inflation and a weak national currency, the forint, is leaving local bakers with little options but to charge more for their baked goods.\n\nAndras Timar heads one of the largest restaurant consulting firms in Budapest.

The goal is to develop the central part of the heritage site, providing a better experience for visitors.\n\nThe Hortobágy National Park is a true Hungarian experience. Whenever you think of Hungary, you probably conjure up images of horses, gray cattle, crane wells and wide lush meadows. Now it is time for Hortobágy to get a revamp, and thus, provide an even more memorable experience. The proposal’s deadline is in October, so they are still waiting for the offers.\n\nHowever, we have insight into what is being planned thanks to magyarepitok.hu. The development plan includes the restoration of the Szekérállás building. The Körszín building will be reconstructed and turned into an information point. Lastly, a comprehensive public utility upgrade can be expected.\n\nThe Szekérállás\n\nThe building is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage attribute and it is also under monument protection. While trying to reconstruct the original form of the roof and openings, they will be preserving the structure of the roof and the walls of the building. Inside, a complete modernisation is to be expected both from a utility and architectural perspective. An independent space will be made inside the building accommodating all the functions necessary to keep the building running, while the machinery will be located on the floor above.\n\nThe Körszín\n\nDuring the transformation of the building into a Touristic Information Point, it will be completely demolished. Following that, based on the needs of the new facility, it will be rebuilt in the same form. Essentially, from the outside, it will look the same, but from the inside, it will be modernised and reorganised. The new building will have 125 m² of public space and another 16 m² area inside. The surroundings will also change as new perennial plants and ornamental grass will be planted in the framework of complete landscaping. The water supply will be rethought and rainwater will be led back to the river.\n\nThe visitor centre, new roads and parking\n\nAlthough the visitor centre had been expanded and transformed in 2020, there is still some complementary work left to do. This will not be anything noticeable as most of the work had already been done. These additional upgrades will help to modernise the technical side of the building.\n\nNew parking spaces will be created along with a road leading to the local market square. This initiative also aims to finish all the necessary landscaping work to create a better environment. The whole project will affect an area of 11,600 m² to make the national park a modern and vibrant place to visit.\n\nRead also Hungary Helps: It’s factually clear that Christianity is the world’s most persecuted religion\n\nSource: magyarepitok.hu",
    "Hungary requires doctors to present women with fetal vital signs before abortion": "Owen Dyer Montreal\n\nDoctors in Hungary must provide women with “a clearly identifiable indication of fetal vital signs” before carrying out any abortion, according to a decree of the government led by Viktor Orban.\n\nThe rule came into force on 15 September, only three days after the decree was announced. Doctors must sign a document verifying that they complied with the rule for every abortion.\n\nAbortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy has been legal in Hungary since 1953, with later abortions permitted if fetal defects are judged probable. The Orban government wrote a new constitution in 2011 guaranteeing that “the life of a fetus will be protected from conception,” but this week’s decree is the first move to affect patients.\n\nDora Duro, a legislator with the far right opposition party Our Homeland, claimed on Facebook that it was her party’s proposal that the government had adopted. The decree broke a “decades old taboo” against “pro-life moves,” she wrote.\n\nSo-called fetal heartbeat laws have been a feature of anti-abortion legislation in the US. Early laws aimed to force the pregnant patient to listen to the ultrasound monitor in the hope that it would discourage them from proceeding with abortion. More stringent recent laws, like the Texas Heartbeat Act of 2021, prohibit physicians from providing abortion if they can detect “cardiac activity” in the fetus or embryo.\n\nHungary’s main doctors’ organisation, the Hungarian Medical Chamber, and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) criticised the government for proceeding with no public consultation and no input from women or doctors. The new requirement “has no medical purpose and serves only to humiliate women,” said the IPPF.\n\nGynaecologists have pointed out that fetuses at the early stage of pregnancy when most abortions occur do not yet have working hearts, only clumps of cells sending electrical signals. The “heartbeat” sound is generated by the ultrasound monitor to represent these electric pulses. It is not a real sound of heart valves operating as is heard in an adult or child using a stethoscope.\n\nAs Hungary’s prime minister, Orban has employed almost no women in his cabinets, arguing that women are unable to handle the stress of Hungarian politics.\n\nHis nationalist government has stopped almost all immigration to the country, and he drew outrage in July when he said that Hungarians opposed the “mixing of races.” But with one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, at 1.45 children per woman, the approach has led to an ageing population and a declining workforce. A population of nearly 10 million today is on course to hit 8 million by 2050.\n\nOrban sought to wring more hours from the labour force with an unpopular law that allowed employers to compel overtime, dubbed the “slave law” by critics. He also offered tax incentives for fecundity, including a complete exemption from income tax for any woman who has four children.\n\nAfter winning re-election in 2018, Orban promised to “reach a comprehensive agreement with Hungarian women,” making it clear that he expected them to have more babies.\n\nHe said in 2019, “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the West to this is migration. They want as many migrants to enter as they are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children.”\n\nAbortion bans take effect in Indiana and West Virginia Meanwhile, in the US, abortion bans continue to be passed in conservative states following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade in June. As of 15 September two more states, Indiana and West Virginia, banned all abortions at any stage of pregnancy except in the case of rape, incest, threat to the mother’s life, or “fatal fetal anomaly,” although this last category is not clearly defined. Republican lawmakers in West Virginia, in passing their law, expressed frustration that it included exemptions for rape and incest, and lacked a criminal penalty for doctors. The Indiana law allows doctors to be imprisoned for up to six years if they provide an abortion or fail to file required reports. Thirteen states had “trigger bans” that came into effect when Roe v Wade was struck down. A further 13 are working on legislation and are likely to enact either blanket bans or bans after six weeks’ pregnancy, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute.1 Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina this week proposed a national abortion law that would ban the procedure after 15 weeks, which he described as a compromise solution. But his bill is unlikely to make headway in Congress, where his fellow Republicans are increasingly backing away from taking public anti-abortion stances following the negative public reaction to the Roe v Wade decision.",
    "Hungary demands EU lift sanctions on 3 Russian oligarchs": "According to two diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned include Alisher Usmanov, a former shareholder in Arsenal football club | Yuri Kochetkov/EPA-EFE\n\nHungary is again proving to be the roadblock when it comes to EU sanctions against Russia — this time by pushing for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the sanctions list.\n\nThe EU has a deadline of September 15 to renew its measures against individuals who were sanctioned since the outbreak of Russia's war in Ukraine or they will lapse. Within the bloc, this extension was seen as a technical formality, as it has been with previous sanctions against Russia over Ukraine since 2014.\n\nBut Hungary has thrown a spanner in the works. Budapest has asked to remove three Russian nationals from the EU's sanctions list, according to four EU diplomats and officials who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity. The move has infuriated other EU countries, which have bitter memories of Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán's hold-up on the EU's oil ban earlier this year.\n\nAccording to two of the diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned are Alisher Usmanov, Petr Aven and Viktor Rashnikov.\n\nUsmanov made his fortune in mining and investments and is a former shareholder in Arsenal football club; Aven is a businessman and politician who led Russia's biggest commercial bank; and Rashnikov is an iron and steel billionaire.\n\nHungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said the EU would reach a joint decision on the sanctions list. \"The EU sanctions lists are constantly under review, and there are concerns time and again that the inclusion of certain persons or entities on the sanctions list is not sufficiently justified,\" he tweeted.\n\nHungary has also asked the EU to broaden the exception on sanctions for humanitarian aid. This has created fear among other EU countries that Budapest wants to create loopholes in EU sanctions at a time when the European Commission is trying to tighten the rules.\n\nEU envoys are set to discuss the war in Ukraine at their meeting on Wednesday. While the extension of the sanctions listings is not formally on the agenda, Hungary's demands will definitely be raised during the talks, given the outrage they have caused already, diplomats said.",
    "The countercultural island within conservative Hungary": "The physical architecture of Sziget Festival, Hungary’s answer to Coachella and a popular destination for young party-goers across Europe, is unintentionally quite revealing. The festival takes place every August on an island in the middle of the Danube. To get there, attendees must leave downtown Budapest and journey north on a suburban railway line, where bedazzled flower children briefly rub shoulders with bemused commuters and annoyed grandmothers. After this awkward interlude, Sziget does its best to ensure attendees don’t stray from the festival and certain tourist-friendly city precincts. The path from the closest railway station to the island is quite literally fenced off from the outside world. Once you arrive, you can take a boat back to downtown Budapest or a taxi straight to the airport. Or you can set up a tent and settle in for six days of music, drugs and debauchery.\n\nThe festival is a postmodern refugee camp\n\nSziget bills itself as “the island of freedom”, and the slogan is not a bad description for a festival that briefly creates a parallel universe within Hungary, a country that has recently become a byword for conservatism. Once you step onto the island, you’re not in Kansas, or rather the Alföld, anymore.\n\nMusic is the main draw, and the festival brings together international pop acts (Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala), electronic DJs and local artists. But music is only one aspect of the Sziget experience. This year, the festival featured performances to raise awareness for Ukraine, vendors selling t-shirts with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in lipstick and drag, even a European NGO centre. Among the festival sponsors were an array of multinational companies and Telex, a prominent news website known for its sceptical coverage of Orbán and Fidesz (Hungary’s ruling conservative party). Sziget’s counter-cultural aesthetics, corporate sponsorship, lefty activism and ubiquitous pride flags mark it as an outpost of Western liberalism, as surely as Roman forts or Royal Navy coaling stations delineated the boundaries of older imperial states.\n\nThe actual festival, with its array of vendors, beer tents and packed campgrounds, is a postmodern refugee camp. Attendees live in crowded tents, wear little and produce an immense amount of trash. Energetic crowds kick up a lot of dust, and many festival-goers wear Covid masks or bandanas to keep out the gritty air. In the mediaeval era, armies would periodically shift camp to avoid outbreaks of disease and dysentery. Based on the port-a-potty situation, Sziget should consider similar arrangements for next year’s festival.\n\nIt would be easy to suggest that Sziget, with its hippy atmosphere and hordes of out-of-towners, is hopelessly cut off from “Real Hungary”. Indeed, the festival is worlds away from the poorer, rural counties that delivered Orbán and Fidesz a decisive victory in the April parliamentary elections. It also offers an amusing contrast to another Western export, the wave of conservative intellectuals and media figures who have recently flocked to Orbán’s Budapest.\n\nBut plenty of Hungarians attend Sziget, and those that can’t afford the increasingly-pricey tickets go to smaller festivals like Volt, Campus and Balaton Sound. This summer festival circuit embodies the aspirations and tastes of younger Hungarians who prefer liberal, cosmopolitan Budapest to small-town Hungary. They may have lost the April elections, but this cohort still has considerable sway.\n\nIn Hungary, the rift between the cosmopolitan capital and the countryside goes back generations. Budapest was famously called “the guilty city” by Admiral Horthy, an interwar autocrat who liberal Hungarians sometimes compare to Orbán. Budapest’s current mayor is a lefty former academic, and its streets and public squares are often choked with anti-Fidesz demonstrations. Such antics are rare in smaller towns and villages.\n\nOrbán’s critics often suggest that he is on the verge of establishing (or has already built) a one-party state. This overstates the degree of control he wields over Hungarian society, perhaps because foreign reporters have a tendency to over-sample the Sziget demographic: young Hungarians who speak English, are immersed in Anglophone culture and vote for the opposition.\n\nOrbán is nothing if not an opportunist\n\nThe combative Hungarian prime minister has pushed Fidesz’s institutional advantages to the limit and clearly enjoys tweaking liberal sensibilities. But would Orbán ever break with the EU and install himself as prime minister for life? The festival-going younger generation are one reason why such a rupture is unlikely.\n\nSince the fall of communism, and especially since Hungary’s accession to the EU, Hungarians have enjoyed the opportunities afforded by growth and European integration. They holiday and go to music festivals in Western Europe. Many have friends or family members who live and work abroad. Hungary benefits mightily from generous EU subsidies. Budapest, the economic and cultural centre of gravity in an otherwise conservative country, draws tourists, foreign investment and big multinationals in large part due to its cosmopolitan atmosphere.\n\nEastern European countries already suffer from “brain drain” as talented and ambitious young people leave for opportunities in Western Europe. At least in Hungary, the impact of these departures is mitigated by EU membership. Expat Hungarians send back remittances and return frequently to visit friends and relatives. Many move back permanently after enduring a few years at a gruelling but remunerative service sector job.\n\nLeaving the EU, outlawing opposition parties or banning independent media would threaten this arrangement. A dramatic break with the West would prompt many young Hungarians to permanently relocate abroad and cut ties with the mother country. After the Soviets crushed the 1956 uprising in Budapest, a generation of young people fled their homes, depriving Hungary of many of its most talented and dynamic citizens. If Orbán declared himself dictator tomorrow, a similar exodus would occur — except this time, there is no superpower patron to prop up the regime.\n\nOrbán is nothing if not an opportunist. He courts German manufacturers, Chinese investors and American conservatives. In the summer of 2021, he was on the verge of opening a satellite campus of the Shanghai-based Fudan University in Budapest, only to back down after a dramatic public backlash. When Russia invaded Ukraine and anti-Putin sentiment was running high, Hungary joined in the EU’s unprecedented economic sanctions. Now that winter looms and Hungarians face a cost-of-living crisis, Orbán has cut deals to secure access to Russian gas.\n\nOrbán is a conservative politician who governs a centre-right country. He is also not a fool. He will continue to favour a political strategy that gives conservatives disproportionate influence over key Hungarian institutions, from state-run media to the universities. Critics will darkly mutter that this is a prelude to a full authoritarian takeover. In truth, the current shaky equilibrium will probably endure. Orbán can keep winning elections, but he still has to account for the festival-goers of Sziget.",
    "Hungarian Wizz Air ready to conquer the Middle East": "The Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air has announced 11 new routes and is ready to conquer the Middle East.

In addition, 10 of the 11 routes involve bases, therefore, they are simple there-and-back operations. Only Athens to Tel Aviv does not fall into this category and will use Albania-based aircraft and crew.\n\nRead also: Budapest Airport announced changes concerning many passengers\n\nWizz Air’s Polish network is expanding\n\nAdding Łódź and Bydgoszcz means that there will be 12 Polish airports involved. These are Bydgoszcz, Gdansk, Katowice, Kraków, Łódź, Lublin, Olsztyn-Mazury, Poznan, Rzeszów, Szczecin, Warsaw Chopin, and Wrocław. As Łódź is very close to Warsaw, it has not attracted Wizz Air back so far. However, the situation has changed and now, Poland’s third-largest city is joining Wizz Air.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nWizz Air Holdings Plc also aims to establish a fleet of 50 aircraft at a new unit in Saudi Arabia. “The LCC hopes to achieve the target fleet size by the end of the decade, although Chief Executive József Varádi stressed that the priority was finding a local partner,” writes ch-aviation.com. The newly established fleet in Saudi Arabia serves the purpose of developing its aviation market to rival carriers from smaller Gulf states and attracting more tourists. “The first and foremost process is to find the right partnership with local investors, and this is what we’re working on. Once this gets sorted out, then we can complete the formal process of an airline application,” Varádi said.\n\nSource: ch-aviation.com, simpleflying.com",

The EU Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson – responsible for transnational energy supply interoperability – will deliver a keynote speech today on energy transition and security in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nHungary has recently been seen as a balancing actor – with a reliance on Russian gas and oil despite an active support of NATO movements into Ukraine.

    "Gabor Király is looking forward to Hungary’s game against Germany and talks about his team’s strengths": "Most fans will know who Gabor Király is. The Hungarian shot-stopper wore a distinct pair of gray trousers in pretty much every game he played in (cue “Baggy Trousers” by Madness). He has played in 198 Bundesliga games for Hertha Berlin from 1997 to 2004 represented Hungary from 1998 to 2016 and retired in 2019. He even has his own club back in Hungary: Király SZE.\n\nThe 46-year-old goalie recently sat down with Sport1 ahead of Germany’s clash with Hungary in the penultimate matchday of the group stage. Király said that Hungarians were always excited when their national team plays against European heavyweights like Germany and credits their current state to the team’s development over the years.\n\n“Very big, we Hungarians always look forward to this duel,” Király said. “Looking at the table, we can see that Hungary, as leaders, has a very good starting position. Our national team has worked hard for this, but it also deserves it thanks to the great development in recent years.”\n\nKirály also spoke of the Hungarian players in the Bundesliga and how it serves as an advantage for their national team.\n\n“I’m very happy that these guys are here; each of them has Bundesliga experience,” said Király. “It’s also very good for our young players. These five players know what German football has given them. If you understand that, you can counter it. We are on a good way.”\n\nOf the five Hungarian players in the Bundesliga, Király said that Dominik Szoboszlai of RB Leipzig will be their key player.\n\nHungary’s coach received praise for the recent improvements to the team from Király, who revealed what their biggest strength is.\n\n“The self-confidence of every single player has increased significantly. With Marco Rossi we have a great strategist as national coach. He’s doing a great job and has a good tactical instinct,” Király said. “Marco knows Hungarian football and our country very well. He knows where the talent is, and which experienced players he needs. He has everything under control. I’m glad we have such a clear-headed coach. His strategic thinking is always right.”\n\n“The strength of the team is their unity. This is very strong with us. The quality of the German players is maybe a bit better, but as a team we can cause problems for Germany,” Király continued. “If it works collectively with the Germans, then we must be careful. In the past few games, Hansi Flick (former Bayern Munich coach)’s players didn’t seem so focused.”\n\nSpeaking about Hungary’s chances against Germany, Király is confident of getting a result against Flick’s men.\n\n“We’re not afraid of Germany, but, as already mentioned, we’ve gained a lot of self-confidence in the past,” Király said. “The last duels were very close. Of course, as the leaders of the table, we believe in a win against the Germans.”",

The police are obliged to inform you that you can request for your information to be handled in a higher level of confidentiality. In this case, your data will be attached to the file in a closed envelope. If you name the perpetrator, they will only find out about the report if they are arrested.\n\nNeither extramarital sex nor homosexuality is considered a crime in Hungary. The legal drinking age is 18 (with a zero alcohol tolerance for driving), and both the consumption and possession of any drugs is illegal.\n\nLocal authorities do not normally inform the authorities of the UK about a denunciation (and information about you may only be requested from foreign authorities in justified circumstances). They will contact a consular officer who can assist you in the proceedings if you request it.\n\nDuring the proceedings you do not have to surrender your passport and you can leave the country freely at any time. You do, however, have to notify the authorities within 3 working days if your residential address, mailing address or actual residence changes.\n\nIf you don’t want to report the incident to the police in Hungary\n\nThe British Embassy will still be able to help you. This includes helping you contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.\n\nThey can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.\n\nIf you are travelling with a tour operator, you can also report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.\n\nIt is your choice whether to report the crime, and you can get medical attention whether you report it to the police or not.\n\nIf you want to report the incident to the police in the UK\n\nIf you are staying in the country where the crime took place, it might be best to report the crime in that country. If you are a British national in Hungary and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the British Embassy by telephone at +36 1 266 2888 or online.\n\nIt is possible to report the crime to the police in the UK after you return there. However, UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. It is for the police in Hungary to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe UK police can decide to request assistance from the Hungarian police, but this cannot be guaranteed and it can be a lengthy process. It can therefore be difficult to ensure that justice is served without reporting the crime locally. Please see Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information.\n\nYou can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.\n\nReporting the crime in Hungary - what happens next?\n\nIf you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. If possible make notes about what happened during the assault before making the report, so that you can refer to them if necessary.\n\nYou can bring a person you trust with you to the police station.\n\nWashing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.\n\nAt the police station – what to expect\n\nYou will be provided with an interpreter as soon as possible (free of charge), and will be asked to describe in detail what happened so that immediate action can be taken to identify the alleged offender.\n\nWhere possible, female victims will have a female officer in attendance. Unfortunately at some police stations this might not always be manageable.\n\nIf the police officer seems reluctant or is not willing to take minutes of your criminal report, ask for his/her name and service number and make a complaint.\n\nYour consulate will always be notified, as well as any other person you wish to notify.\n\nEvidence such as the clothing and underwear you were wearing and other items that the offender has touched will help the police to gather evidence and to build a criminal case. These items will be sent in for forensic examination, after which – if they are not needed for your case anymore - they will be given back to you.\n\nOnce the police officer has taken minutes of your testimony, read it carefully and, if you find that it is full and correct, sign it. If you think it does not correctly contain your testimony, do not sign it and request a correction. You can insist on certain parts of your testimony being included in the minutes word-by-word.\n\nPay attention to specifically include in your testimony that you wish the perpetrator to be brought to criminal justice (if you so wish).\n\nAn officer will give you the police reference number for future reference, as well as the contact details of the officer responsible for the case.\n\nThe police will arrange to take you to the hospital for a medical and forensic examination if that’s what you wish.\n\nThe medical examination – what to expect\n\nThe examination may be carried out by a family doctor, a specialist, a general practitioner or a specialist on-call doctor; it can take place in a hospital, surgery or forensic medical institution. It is highly advisable that you see a forensic medical expert and not just a doctor who is not a forensic medical expert. The opinion of a forensic medical doctor qualifies as an expert opinion for the purposes of official proceedings, whereas the opinion of a doctor (who does not qualify as a forensic medical doctor) qualifies as a deed for the purposes of official proceedings.\n\nWhen you present yourself to have evidence secured confidentially, it may be helpful to use the phrases below to explain what you need to the receptionist.\n\nfemale: “Szeretnék egy nőgyógyász igazságügyi orvosszakértővel beszélni és sürgős vizsgálatot kérni” – I need to see a forensic gynaecologist urgently\n\nmale: “Szeretnék egy urológus igazságügyi orvosszakértővel beszélni és sürgős vizsgálatot kérni” – I need to see a forensic urologist urgently\n\nYou should not take a shower or bath before the examination, so that any evidence is preserved.\n\nYou will have a forensic medical examination and possibly tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs, such as syphilis). This may include taking a blood sample and, if you consent, taking photographs to document any injuries.\n\nThe doctor will first look for external signs of harm. It will help if you can describe where on your body you were injured and be sure to mention if you feel pain anywhere or certain body parts are sensitive. The doctor may perform a vaginal examination, which is similar to a gynaecological examination. Inform the doctor know if you never had this before.\n\nIf you were under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the attack, you may not have been able to defend yourself effectively. You can ask the doctor to examine your blood. This will not make you liable in criminal proceedings – on the contrary, this circumstance can increase the responsibility of the offender alleging that he took advantage of your inability of self-defence.\n\nHIV as well as syphilis testing are usually performed, however, hepatitis B is not routinely screened for. Since pregnancy would not be detected until one week after the incident at the earliest, a pregnancy test is not performed by the doctor at this stage.\n\nTreatment\n\nHIV PEP medication (post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection) needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.\n\nThe preventative use of the HIV medication (emtricitabin/tenofovir) is not yet supported by the Hungarian health care; patients have to pay for this service in full.\n\nTo prevent pregnancy you can ask for an emergency contraception prescription and get the pill at a pharmacy. The pill should be taken within 72 hours.\n\nThe NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on return to the UK. If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home. Ask to be informed and advised about what treatment is recommended in your particular case to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nTreatment charges\n\nIn the case of social security-based care, the examination is free of charge, and if the examination is carried out in the framework of private health care, it must typically be paid for on the spot after the examination. Check with your travel insurance provider regarding their policy.\n\nPatient confidentiality\n\nSexual violence is a privately punishable offence (except for certain sexual violence crimes which qualify as a more serious category of offence), which means that proceedings can only be initiated following a complaint by the victim. The doctor is obliged to report the crime to the authorities.\n\nMedical findings may be important evidence if the case goes to court. (Although you can request a medical examination even if you decide not to involve the police.) If you want the assault to be investigated you will need to give consent to the doctor at the hospital to share information with the police.\n\nPolice investigations in Hungary – what to expect\n\nThe British Embassy has received feedback from some rape victims that they have found the process of reporting the assault at times difficult, lengthy and quite different from what they would expect of UK police proceedings.\n\nNormally you would first speak with an officer at the nearest police station, who will record a criminal complaint. An interpreter will be called in as soon as possible. If you know the whereabouts of the offender, it is enough if you provide this information and a description of him/her to the police. Identification is usually based on your description and a photograph, so in most cases you will not have to meet the perpetrator in person unless it is absolutely necessary for the investigation.\n\nThe officer will refer the case to a criminal investigator, who will be responsible for interviewing you about the assault and for investigating the assault. You can freely leave the country after this, but must be available for contact until the end of the procedure.\n\nCourt procedures – what to expect\n\nThe police can detain a suspect for 72 hours. They will notify the Public Prosecutor’s office about the detention, who will than decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to court.\n\nThe court can order an arrest for a period of one month, which can be extended by a period of up to three months at a time during the first year, and by periods of up to two months at a time subsequently.\n\nTrial procedures\n\nYou will know whether there is going to be a trial when the Public Prosecutor has made a decision. This decision is dependent on the evidence gathered during the investigation phase.\n\nThe language of the hearing is always Hungarian. The authorities will provide an interpreter if you do not speak the language – this will be free of charge (the cost will be paid by the accused or the State, depending on the outcome of the trial).\n\nDuring the investigation phase you are free to go home to your home country or elsewhere.\n\nIf it is difficult for you to travel to Hungary for the trial, depending on the nature of the case you may be able to give evidence in writing or by telecommunication, or possibly by means of procedural legal aid before the authorities in the UK.\n\nIf you do travel to Hungary for the trial, the court will reimburse travel and, if necessary, accommodation costs - within the limits of reasonableness and necessity, under a special law. However, the authorities will not provide any special assistance in organising travel.\n\nCommunication\n\nEven if you do not have a lawyer, you will still be able to request information about your rights from the authorities (police, prosecutor’s office, court) at any time. You can inspect the case file, attend hearings and make motions.\n\nIf you wish to be informed of the future developments of the case, the criminal proceedings or the court trial, request this. Your request will then be added to the investigation file, so that the Public Prosecutor and the Judge know that you wish to be kept informed of the future stages of the investigation and the result of the trial.\n\nLegal aid\n\nWhile not obligatory, it is recommendable that you seek legal advice from a lawyer. If you think you need it, you can request financial legal aid even if you are not Hungarian. This benefit is granted depending on your income and assets (a minor victim is eligible regardless of his/her income and assets). The application must be submitted to the determining authority on the form provided for this purpose (it can obtained from any legal authority).\n\nIf the legal aid is granted, you will be entitled to advance payment by the State to cover the fees and expenses of the lawyer acting in your defence and, where appropriate, to have them borne by the State; to advance payment by the State of the fees and expenses of the guardian ad litem; and to advance payment by the State of the court fees for the civil proceedings of a civil claim brought by you.\n\nA list of English-speaking lawyers is available online.\n\nSentencing\n\nIn case the accused is acquitted, it has essentially no consequences for you. However, if there is a suspicion that you have deliberately accused someone else of falsehood or given false testimony in the proceedings, you may be prosecuted.\n\nCompensation\n\nYou might be entitled for compensation for your injuries, regardless of your nationality. Damages closely linked to the crime can be claimed in criminal proceedings, while other indirect damages (such as damages for emotional distress or quantifiable additional damages related to the offence) can be claimed in civil proceedings.\n\nSupport organisations in Hungary\n\nIt is your choice to let people know what happened. If you are ready to talk about it, these organisations may be able to help you:\n\nWhen you return home to the UK\n\nYou may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live.\n\nSupport Organisations in the UK\n\nIf you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you.

    "EC proposes suspending two thirds of Hungary's cohesion funds": "The European Commission has proposed to the European Council a suspension of 65% of three cohesion funds due to Hungary, amounting to an estimated €7.5bn. The council will now have one month to approve the Commission's proposals with a qualified majority, which can be extended by a further two months under special circumstances.\n\nIf Hungary fails to adopt relevant legislation it could lose two-thirds of funds from the Operational Programmes for Environment, Transport and Rural Development.\n\nThe amount in question amounts to 5% of the country's estimated 2022 GDP and a third of the funds the country is eligible for under the 2021-2027 budget.\n\nHungary could become the first EU country to lose significant EU funds under the bloc's new Conditionality Mechanism if it fails to implement reform measures to prevent and detect systemic fraud and abuse. Viktor Orban's regime is currently struggling to keep its budget deficit under control, and the hold-up in the payment of EU funds has caused the forint to plunge.\n\nHowever, Hungary believes it can secure the frozen funds by the end of the year by pushing through what critics allege are superficial reforms to its deeply flawed procurement process and a stepping up of prosecutors' investigations of the country's rampant corruption, which has up to now failed to prosecute offenders close to the ruling radical rightwing regime.\n\nThe European Council must decide on dropping financial sanctions or imposing them by December 18 at the latest, by a qualified majority, which means that 15 of the 27 countries must support the decision, and the 15 must represent at least 65% of the total EU population.\n\nJohannes Hahn, the Commissioner for Budget and Administration, informed reporters on the decision of the European Commission’s assessment of Hungary's reply to allay the concerns of the EU’s executive body on corruption at a Sunday press briefing.\n\n\"It's about breaches of the rule of law compromising the use and management of EU funds,\" Hahn said, adding that so far \"we cannot conclude that the EU budget is sufficiently protected\".\n\nHahn said Hungary's latest promise to address EU criticisms in 17 areas was a significant step in the right direction, but must still be translated into new laws and practical actions.\n\nReplying to a question, the commissioner said the conditionality mechanism could be relaunched if Hungary fails to implement its commitments.\n\nThe rule of law conditionality mechanism was triggered just after the fourth consecutive supermajority of the ruling Fidesz party in early April after the EU courts turned down the legal challenges posed by Poland and Hungary.\n\nThe EU and Hungary have been at odds over the systematic irregularities in public procurement laws, shortcomings in other anti-graft measures and weaknesses in effective prosecution.\n\nBudapest has made a string of pledges over the last two months, which includes the establishment of an anti-fraud \"integrity authority\" to oversee public procurement procedures using EU funds. Its head will be chosen by independent experts through an open application process. The authority could begin its work in the second half of November.\n\nHungary has also promised to set up an anti-corruption working group that will be independent of the government and will be tied to the integrity authority, Hahn said.\n\nThe government will further strengthen anti-corruption systems, he said, noting changes to be made to the asset declaration system.\n\nRules on conflicts of interest when it comes to foundations managing assets of public interest will also be tightened and be based on EU regulations\n\nHungary's commitments, he noted, also include ensuring a legal remedy against the prosecutor's decisions in corruption cases.\n\nTibor Navracsics, the minister in charge of the uptake of European Union funds, on Sunday welcomed as \"progress\" the European Commission's decision on EU funds allocated to Hungary, saying it would allow for a swift conclusion of the talks on the cohesion monies and post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF) payments, which are also frozen.\n\nNavvacsics told a press conference that the government was hopeful that negotiations could be concluded by the end of the year.\n\nBecause the government intends to fulfill the commitments it made during the procedure regarding the conditionality mechanism linking EU funding to the rule of law, the sanctions proposed by the Commission \"are of secondary importance\", as \"their approval cannot happen\", Navracsics said.\n\nHe said that the government will submit the related legislative proposals to parliament on Monday and Friday.\n\nThe EC’s announcement on Sunday means that in the best-case scenario Hungary can wind up talks on cohesion funds and the RRF before the end of the year, which means the first transfers could be made in early 2023, financial website Portfolio.hu commented.",
    "Hungarian minister of finance: EU’s euro billions ‘closer’": "When the government’s commitments to the European Union are enforced, disputes with the EU over the recovery fund are expected to be resolved by mid-November, Mihály Varga, the finance minister, told a conference of economists in Szeged, in southern Hungary, on Friday.\n\nAs well as the economic crisis owing to the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, political disputes are also having a major effect on Hungary’s economic policy, Varga noted. One such dispute is EU pressure on Hungary in respect of the recovery fund, he said. Varga said the government would have to amend next year’s budget. While 2022 and 2023 are expected to be “difficult years”, there is reason to hope that Hungary’s economic growth will be back on track by 2024, he added.\n\nThe government’s budget deficit is expected to be around 6.1 percent of GDP this year, up from the previously targeted 4.19 percent, owing to additional gas purchases to ensure the necessary reserves, he said. Inflation, skyrocketing prices of energy resources and raw materials, this year’s drought, and migration “show that the decade ahead will not be easy”, Varga said. “Those crises point to an unprecedented loan and financing crisis,” hitting countries with high debts the hardest, he added.\n\nRead also Ridiculous? Hungarian politician gave away goldfish to save energy\n\nWhile Hungary’s robust food industry can protect the country from a food crisis, its exposure to foreign energy resources makes it vulnerable on that front, he noted. The current energy price increase was an “unforeseeable” situation that “was impossible to prepare for”, he said.\n\nMedium-term economic planning will therefore have to rely on energy efficiency, he said. Accordingly, the government has taken measures to cut gas consumption and reduce heating in public buildings, and has launched energy efficiency programmes, Varga said, citing an insulation programme for residential buildings as an example.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s crisis management programme is focusing on large corporations and small and medium-sized firms, he said.\n\nRead also Dormitory placement costs may rise at several universities in Hungary\n\nSource: MTI",
    "Hungary’s premium real estate market drastically transforming": "The Hungarian premium real estate market is changing: the rate of foreign investors in Budapest decreases, but they are still very active around Lake Balaton. Here is the analysis of the Duna House, a Hungarian real estate agency. They say that more and more English, Dutch and Belgian nationals would like to buy real estate in Hungary, which is a new trend.\n\nDuna House told MTI, the Hungarian News Agency, that demand is growing for houses and apartments with the most modern technical solutions. Meanwhile, fewer people would like to buy real estate only in the premium category because of its size but needing urgent revamp. Their analysis says that owners of such apartments should consider renting out their apartments during the swiftly changing economic environment.\n\nKároly Benedikt, the leading analyst and PR expert of the Duna House, said that the Hungarian luxury real estate market moves on a wide palette. There are modern, newly built apartments and modernized ones not older than five years, having solar panels, state-of-the-art technical solutions, and heat pumps. Furthermore, some homes are in the premium category because of their excellent location and size, but they have outdated technical equipment.\n\nRead alsoHungarian real estate market changes due to the war in Ukraine\n\nDuna House reported a growing demand for premium apartments in Budapest, in the suburbs and around Lake Balaton. They expect an increase in supply in this sector. But selling non-modernized apartments will become harder, Duna House added.\n\nSome real estate owners in that category decide to rent their apartments, which can generate an acceptable profit. For example, an apartment worth 250 million HUF can be rented for 1 million HUF/month.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the number of potential foreign buyers decreased significantly in Budapest and the agglomeration’s premium real estate market. Currently, most Hungarians would like to buy apartments in that category. Meanwhile, Lake Balaton remained popular among German, Swiss and increasingly English, Belgian and Dutch buyers. Around Lake Balaton, demand for houses and apartments with 3-4 rooms is still high.\n\nRead also How much will an apartment in Budapest be worth in a year?\n\nSource: MTI",

The town has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and the origins of viticulture can be traced back to the Celts, and officially to the Romans. There are a significant number of Germans living in and around the village, many of them claiming a dual German-Hungarian identity.\n\nThe Villány wine region is one of Hungary’s prime wine tourism destinations, with the Villány-Siklós Wine Route, which has been active since 1994, linking the region’s tourism service providers. The region is particularly ideal for the Cabernet Franc grape variety, which has also given rise to the Villány Franc wine brand.\n\nFeatured photo via Pixabay"
