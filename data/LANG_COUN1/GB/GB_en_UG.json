    "Ebola Disease caused by Sudan virus - Uganda": "Outbreak at a glance\n\nOn 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.\n\nDescription of the outbreak\n\nOn 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nThe case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the eyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.\n\nResults of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases of Ebola caused by SUDV.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths have been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases is 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.\n\nEpidemiology of the disease\n\nAccording to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.\n\nSudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.\n\nThe virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.\n\nThe incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).\n\nThe diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.\n\nThere are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.\n\nUganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.\n\nPublic health response\n\nCoordination\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support\n\nThe Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country office\n\nThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected region\n\nWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case management\n\nA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identified\n\nSurveillance and Laboratory\n\nWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districts\n\nContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing\n\nWHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillance\n\nCase Management\n\nWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patients\n\nWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral Hospital\n\nInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districts\n\nCommunication and Risk Communication\n\nAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of Health\n\nCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nUganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\n\nIn the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\nAccording to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains have not been not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.\n\nIn addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.\n\nThe currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.\n\nAt Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.\n\nWHO advice\n\nEffective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.\n\nEarly initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread.\n\nBased on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine — used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks — will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data. Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response.\n\nWHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.\n\nFurther information\n\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (26 September 2022).

    "Standard Bank sees Tanzania-Uganda pipeline as ‘positive’": "Something went wrong - please try again later.\n\nThank you for signing up to our newsletter.\n\nRegister here for the Energy Voice daily newsletter, bringing you key news and insight from across the global energy landscape.\n\nA proposed natural gas pipeline running from Tanzania to Uganda may have a positive environmental impact in a region where the majority of households still cook using charcoal or wood, according to Patrick Mweheire, Standard Bank Group’s regional chief executive officer for East Africa.\n\n“One of the biggest issues in Uganda is that you know, 70% of cooking is still done by charcoal and firewood, so they’re cutting trees down,” Mweheire said in an interview Friday.\n\nThe line, if built, would run parallel to the $4 billion East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) currently under construction. The EACOP, being developed by a group including TotalEnergies SE, will transport crude from Uganda’s oil fields to Tanzania’s coastline.\n\nThe oil pipeline is opposed by environmentalists and the gas line may face similar resistance. But Mweheire said the projects would have “huge benefits” for both nations. The gas pipeline, in particular, would help curb deforestation, he said.\n\nUganda intends to proceed with the EACOP, which will transport oil 900 miles from the shores of Lake Albert on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Tanzania’s Tanga port on the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe European Union has urged the governments to stop work on the pipeline on the grounds that it threatens fragile wildlife habitats.\n\nMweheire said the EACOP will require $15 billion of investment in the region over the next three to five years to build new road infrastructure and an airport in western Uganda, which is already 80% complete.\n\nStandard Bank believes Uganda’s GDP is going to start growing by double digits in the next three years, and “will effectively double also in five years from roughly $30 billion today to $60 billion by 2028,” he said.",
    "Uganda: Opposition kicks off Consultations on Copyright Law": "Opposition MPs have started holding stakeholder engagements with a view of improving a draft private Members’ Bill that seeks to amend the 2006 Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe Bill is sponsored by the Shadow Minister for Culture and Performing Arts, also Mawokota North MP, Hillary Innocent Kiyaga (NUP).\n\nThe first stakeholder meeting was held on Friday, September 23, 2022, at Parliament under the chairmanship of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament (LOP), Hon Mathias Mpuuga, and drew the participation of officials from the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs led by the Deputy Solicitor General, Pius Biribonwoha, Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and representatives from the arts industry.\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to close gaps in the 2006 law to recognize and protect the rights of a composer of artistic work and to streamline the registration of copyrights among others.\n\nThe Registrar General, Mercy Kainobwisho told the meeting that while her agency, URSB recognizes that there are gaps in the existing law coupled with implementation challenges, there is no need for a Private Members’ Bill her entity had already engaged Uganda Law Reform Commission to process an amendment that would lead to the domestication of international treaties on copyright and audiovisual performances.\n\n“The provisions of this Bill and the proposed amendments of the current Act may be parallel to the steps URSB is taking to amend the Act,” Kainobwisho said.\n\nHer submissions were however challenged by MPs, Abdulhu Byakatonda (Ind., Workers), Geoffrey Kayemba Solo (NUP, Bukomansimbi South) and Kiyaga. Their concerns were amplified by artistes, Hannington Bugingo (comedian) and Sylver Kyagulanyi from the Copyright Institute.\n\n“We wish to have this law amended in the areas of regulation, administration and protection. Regulation is so pertinent because we already have an existing issue with [Uganda Communications Commission] UCC,” Kyagulanyi said in reference to the stage plays and public performance rules which were announced by UCC in 2019.\n\n“We the creatives need to be regulated but what UCC is doing is an exhibition of the gap in the current law. UCC is using a 1964 draconian law – The Stage Plays and Public Entertainment Act which ought to be repealed. UCC would be within their mandate if they try to regulate broadcast but are trying to [stretch their mandate] to the regulation of everything including creativity and creative work,” he added.\n\nThe meeting later agreed to a harmonization of the positions of the two sides and hold joint consultations to have the legislation processed within the current financial year.\n\n“With these very good proposals, if we don’t sit and agree on the issues as we have heard them, we [risk] talking about the 2022 law the same way we are talking about the 2006 law,” Biribonwoha said.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda.",

    "Uganda rejects UN definition of abortion as a human right": "Uganda has joined several other African countries to oppose the contentious United Nations Human Rights Committee’s definition of abortion as a human right.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines abortion as termination of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks gestation.\n\nDr Jesca Nsungwa, the Commissioner for Maternal and Child Health at the Ministry of Health, told this publication yesterday that abortion in Uganda is illegal and that the country does not support UN definition of the act as a human right.\n\n“We don’t promote or support abortion in Uganda. We are pro-life and, therefore, we oppose that definition,” Dr Nsungwa said in telephone interview, “There are many things that are promoted as a human rights including homosexuality but we do not support them given our laws, culture and morals, “she added.\n\nInternational media reports indicate that a United Nations resolution defining abortion as a human right and advancing gender ideology was passed early this month, and was backed by majority of Western countries, but was rejected by others, especially from Africa.\n\nAccording to fsspx news, the resolution’s focus on abortion and gender ideology was criticised by 33 countries, mostly located in Africa.\n\nIt reported that among the 32 nations that joined Nigeria in supporting amendments to strike abortion and gender language from the resolution were Uganda, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal. The Philippines, Nicaragua, Russia and a handful of Middle Eastern countries also joined the effort.\n\nSenegal’s representative condemned the inclusion of abortion as a method of family planning and argued that the word ‘gender’ should only refer to “social relations between men and women.”\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Thomas Tayebwa, in April said that he would promote and protect human rights, including fighting abortion.\n\n“I promise the Parliament and the people of Uganda that I will do things that will give respect to God. Personally, I have values that I believe in. We must respect the lives of every individual including the unborn. I’m pro-life,” Mr Tayebwa emphasised.\n\nArticle 22 of the 1995 Constitution provides for the right to life and Article 22(2) clearly states that no one has the right to terminate an unborn child except if authorised by law.\n\nDr Nsungwa also said unsafe abortion is a vice that must be fought to save the lives of women and girls. According to the Ministry of Health, Uganda loses about 16 women and girls on a daily basis and complications arising from unsafe abortion account for about 22 percent of deaths.\n\nWHO abortion stand",

So I had to go back downstairs and say that I had found out.”\n\nEllie is no stranger to the big occasion; she has competed in the sport’s first ever franchise league with London Pulse, making 38 appearances for the Pulse since their inception in 2019.\n\nDespite the meteoric rise to success, Ellie is under no illusions to the tough nature of the challenge in front of her, accepting she will have to be patient for her chances.\n\n“I think being on tours from Under-17 and Under-19’s with England and the Roses Academy definitely prepares you for understanding what it’s like to be away from home for that period of time and being in camp for a long period of time. All you are doing is netball,” she explained.\n\n“So I think that’s been really, really beneficial. But I think it’s always going to be a shock going up to international standard.\n\n“It’s not like playing your age group, it’s the top dogs, it’s the best in the world.\n\n“It’s definitely going to be a shock to the system, but hopefully one that I can manage.”\n\nCoverage on Sky Sports\n\nThe three-match series is due to be covered by Sky Sports from 5th to 9th October, with Rattu hopeful of making an appearance.\n\nHer game has improved under the tutelage of London Pulse Performance Director, Lisa Alexander, hugely experienced in the netball world after nine years as head coach of the Australian Diamonds.\n\n“She just is very good at talking about the little one percenters,” said Rattu of Alexander.\n\n“You know that it’s not just on court, it’s everything that builds up around that.\n\n“So it’s how you prepare, your sleep, your mindset and everything else. So I think it’s learning those sorts of things off the court and how they will then translate on court as well.\n\n“But equally all the technical work that we’ve done with Pulse in the past couple of years, those connections, a lot of the girls from Pulse are playing this series, so having connections should prove helpful on court.”\n\nWhatever transpires for Ellie in October, her rise through the ranks are sure to see her don the England jersey at some point in the future, however, all in Bedford will be keeping their fingers crossed for October.\n\nEngland have already beaten Uganda this year; securing a semi-final spot in the Commonwealth Games with a 56-35 win against the African side before losing to Australia in the last four.\n\nTickets to see the Vitality Roses in action against Uganda are still available from the England Netball website.",

    "‘I watch people for signs’: the project finding and treating Uganda’s diabetic children": "On a night bus out of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, a 12-year-old child was constantly asking her uncle for water. She drank so much that finally she wet herself. Dankan Onzima, on his way home from a conference, was sitting behind the girl.\n\n“I felt bad and touched with what was happening to her,” Onzima says. “I had to wait until my destination, but they were going beyond my stop, so I asked the driver to give me two minutes to talk to the caretaker of the child and the driver allowed.”\n\nHe asked the girl’s uncle to take her to the diabetes clinic at Arua regional referral hospital, in northern Uganda, where Onzima works as a “warrior coordinator”, helping children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) – or warriors, as the hospital refers to them – get treatment and learn to use an insulin pen.\n\nQuick Guide A common condition Show The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world. NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon. NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated. Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high. In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined. 'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses. Tracy McVeigh, editor Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAs Onzima suspected, the girl had T1D and is now receiving free insulin and has a glucometer to keep track of her blood glucose levels.\n\n“Now I am happy that the child is under treatment,” says Onzima. “I closely monitor people around me for any ignored signs and symptoms of T1D.”\n\nOnzima, 24, was diagnosed at the Arua clinic in 2015 – a day he calls “the happiest moment of my life” – after months of not understanding what was wrong. At one point, typhoid and malaria were suspected. It left him feeling “lost, alone and scared, urinating all the time, scared to be outside my house just in case I urinate on myself, losing weight”.\n\nAlthough Onzima now has to carry a glucometer and insulin flex pen, the treatment meant he could pursue his education – he is now in his final year at Uganda’s Muni University.\n\nNurse Jeofrey Ojilong with a young patient at a camp in Lira, Uganda. Photograph: Oscar Ntege/Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe Arua clinic is among 31 facilities across Uganda participating in a new scheme helping T1D patients, spearheaded by the Sonia Nabeta Foundation (SNF). The foundation uses Uganda’s network of motorcycle taxis, or boda-bodas, to deliver insulin and other supplies to patients in the most remote areas.\n\nThe Covid pandemic and lockdown exacerbated the vulnerabilities of low-income children with T1D, making it impossible for some to access medication.\n\n“In Uganda, the lockdown comprised of a public transportation ban and a 2pm curfew for cargo deliveries. Uganda [had] the world’s longest school lockdown and some of the most stringent Covid restrictions,” says Vivian Nabeta, SNF’s founder.\n\n“In normal circumstances, children from low-income households face difficulties accessing essential supplies from their healthcare centres. Our data has revealed that children sometimes travel up to 5.5 hours round trip to get to and from the clinic for essential supplies, with the major part of the trip on foot.”\n\nOnzima said the use of boda-bodas has bridged the distribution gap, and transformed “how the warriors manage their sugar levels”.\n\n“With home visits, we get to see the warrior in his or her home, see the food he or she eats, see the family and understand better how the warrior is living and how we can help,” he says.\n\nWarrior coordinators Dankan Onzima and Mustapha Abdallah at the diabetes clinic in Arua. Photograph: Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe SNF was set up in 2016 after Nabeta’s sister, Sonia, died due to hypoglycemia, a T1D complication. Initially, she began organising four-day peer-to-peer education camps, and helped with scholarships for primary school students, before launching the boda-boda project last year, reaching 2,000 children.\n\nMore than 420 million people across the globe have diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Heath Organization. A chronic and metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood sugar, diabetes is responsible for about 1.5 million global deaths a year.\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form, is often linked to lifestyle choices, whileT1D is a genetic condition often developed during childhood in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself.\n\n“In Africa, children with T1D face suboptimal outcomes and premature deaths due to a variety of reasons, including lack of access to essential medical supplies and – perhaps most importantly – the failure to address the social determinants of health, including factors like poverty, psychosocial barriers, education,” Nabeta says. Only four paediatric endocrinologists operate across Uganda.\n\n“Our work has illustrated that it is not enough to provide insulin, syringes and a glucometer if the child is surrounded by abject poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy and other barriers towards good clinical outcomes. It has illustrated that addressing the social determinants of health and psychosocial barriers is paramount,” says Nabeta.\n\nShe said children have died from a hypoglycemic attack simply because families did not have any sugary item at home to stop it, while in other households distrust over modern medication has to be overcome.\n\nOne 17-year-old died, despite being on the SNF programme, because his family took his insulin away, resorting to “traditional medicine or going off to prayer crusades hoping the child will be healed”.\n\nProssy Lanyero, a teenage T1D patient at Lacor hospital clinic in Gulu, gets drugs through the boda-boda project. “Transport used to be a very big problem because I am a good distance away from the clinic,” she says.\n\n“I used to have a hard time following my appointment date. I used to ask the nurse to give me insulin for two or three months, but it would go bad because I have no refrigerator to properly store the insulin. I would use the bad insulin anyway because of transport problems,” she says.\n\n“In the past my family used to carry most of the burden of my care and I would feel bad but I feel that some of the weight has been lifted so now they can focus on my other needs too.”\n\nLucy Akwero, the mother of a 14-year-old T1D patient in Amuru, says her family struggled to find money for hospital travel – and her son even stopped going to school because it.\n\n“We were always anxious and worried, and my son was sad and hopeless,” she says. “Sometimes I would even sell our own food when it is approaching my son’s clinic appointment day. We do not have to worry about clinic appointments any more, my son now speaks good English, he is confident and happy.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",
    "Uganda condemns EU resolution slamming oil pipeline": "By 2025, Uganda will have its oil coming out of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) as planned. Those were the comments of president Yoweri Museveni, who reaffirmed his determination to have the project completed.\n\nHis reaction came Friday following a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament urging the international community \"to exert maximum pressure on Ugandan and Tanzanian authorities, as well as the project promoters and stakeholders,\" to stop oil activities around Lake Albert.\n\nUganda is estimated to have recoverable oil reserves of at least 1.4 billion barrels. In February, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and TotalEnergies said that the total investment would be more than $10 billion. They have partnered with the Uganda National Oil Company, and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation.\n\nThe national assembly issued a statement asserting Uganda’s sovereignty and condemning the EU parliament’s resolution. \"The resolution is based on misinformation and deliberate misrepresentation of key facts on environment and human rights protection. It represents the highest level on neo-colonialism and imperialism against the sovereignty of Uganda and Tanzania,\" Thomas Tayebwa, the deputy speaker of the assembly said.\n\nKampala says oil wealth can lift millions. When environmental NGOs like Friends of the Earth evaluated that over 100,000 people will lose land to make way for the project.\n\nUnfair compensation\n\nCompensation was also an issue. If Ugandan civil society had already voiced that their disclosed compensation was not fair, the EU resolution doubled down. The EU Parliament said that some landowners \"had their homes destroyed to facilitate the construction of access roads or the processing plant, others have had all or part of their land requisitioned and have lost the free use of their properties and thus their means of subsistence, without prior payment of fair and adequate compensation; whereas the compensation paid is often far too low to allow farmers whose land has been expropriated to buy comparable land on which to continue farming [...]\".\n\nThey also called for the authorities to \"compensate promptly, fairly, and adequately, as provided for in the Ugandan Constitution and as promised by the companies\", \"those evicted or denied access to their land\" and \"people [who] lost property and land\".\n\nThe text also expressed its \"grave concern about the human rights violations in Uganda and Tanzania linked to investments in fossil-fuel projects, including the wrongful imprisonment of human rights defenders, the arbitrary suspension of NGOs, arbitrary prison sentences\".\n\nMuseveni said TotalEnergies had assured him that the pipeline — which would link oil fields in western Uganda to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga in Tanzania — would proceed. But, he warned on Twitter that \"if the French energy group was to choose to listen to the EU Parliament, Uganda shall find another partner.\"",

    "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development": "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development\n\nKasese, Kaberole, Uganda (source: CleanSource Energy Partners)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 5 Sep 2022\n\nThe Government of Uganda has signed an MOU with ASKA Group for the development of a geothermal power project at Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District.\n\nThe Government of Uganda, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Canada-based ASKA Infrastructure Development (ASKA Group) for a potential geothermal power project in Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District. Work on this project is expected to proceed over the next 18 months and will be funded completely by the Canadian government and other international credit development agencies.\n\nKatwe-Kikorongo had already been previously recognized as one of the major potential geothermal areas in Western Uganda. Uganda has estimated geothermal resources of up to 1,500 MW from 24 areas in the Ugandan Rift System.\n\nMinister of State for Energy Hon. Okaasai Opolot pointed out the geothermal potential of Uganda particularly because of its location along the East Africa Rift Valley. This point was supported by ASKA Group President Kamaal Samji, who mentioned the presence of steam in the ground in places like Kasese.\n\nEnergy Ministry Permanent Secretary Eng. Irene Batebe noted that ASKA will be expected to conduct feasibility studies as part of the project. The work will also include securing the required licenses and permits. However, Batebe assured that the Ministry will help in supporting this process by providing all the necessary information or facilitating the authorization process if needed.\n\nDuring the meeting between ASKA Group and the Ministry, Okaasai mentioned that power generation companies in Uganda can now independently generate, transmit, and distribute power to the end-user. This makes investments in the country’s power sector attractive while also empowering the population who rely on power to have stable and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThe project is also expected to generate jobs for Ugandans. East Africa Project Liaison Salim Janmohamed assured the Minister that there will only be a maximum of 10 experts involved in the project and the rest of the employees will be locally hired and trained to meet international standards.\n\n“As climate is changing, we need to take a proactive role to diversify to clean energy. The project will provide clean energy for Uganda,” said ASKA Group CEO Dinu Samji, further stating that the project is in line with the global transition towards clean energy.\n\nSource: Uganda Update",
    "Uganda pays first installment of $325m war reparations to DRC": "The International Court of Justice asked Uganda to pay reparations for its troops’ occupation of DRC back in the 1990s.\n\nUganda has paid $65m in the first instalment of the $325m it was ordered to pay the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as compensation for losses caused by wars in the 1990s when Ugandan troops occupied Congolese territory.\n\n“It’s true we have paid $65m as the first instalment,” finance ministry spokesman Apollo Munghinda said on Monday. The payment was made on September 1, he added.\n\nThe DRC government’s spokesman, Patrick Muyaya, confirmed to Reuters news agency that the first of the five instalments had been received.\n\nIn a case first brought against Uganda in 1999, DRC asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to compel Uganda to pay it $11bn as reparations for the deaths, looting and general economic damage caused by Uganda’s military occupation of parts of DRC in the 1990s.\n\nAfter lengthy proceedings, the ICJ, United Nations’ highest court, ruled in 2005 that Uganda had violated international law by occupying parts of eastern DRC and supporting other armed groups during a conflict that raged from 1998 to 2003.\n\nThe court, which deals with disputes between states and whose rulings are final and cannot be appealed, ordered the two parties to negotiate reparations. In 2015, however, the DRC told the court that the talks had stalled.\n\nThe ICJ judges finally ruled in February this year that Uganda should pay $325m in five yearly instalments of $65m, starting in September this year.\n\nThe ICJ broke down the compensation into different categories of damages. It assessed $225m for “loss of life and other damage to persons” that included rape, conscription of child soldiers and the displacement of up to 500,000 people.\n\nUgandan soldiers who had been fighting rebels in DRC for the previous three years crossed back into Uganda at the Mpondwe border point on October 15, 2001.\n\nThe court assessed another $40m for damage to property and $60m for damage to natural resources, including the plundering of gold, diamonds, timber and other goods by Ugandan forces or rebels they supported.",
    "Uganda, Kinshasa extend military operation in eastern DR Congo": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have announced an extension of their joint military cooperation that saw the two countries’ armies launch an offensive against the Allied Democratic Forces rebels holed up in eastern DRC.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), the extension was signed Thursday by the defence ministers of both countries in the DRC capital of Kinshasa.\n\n“Uganda and DRC jointly extend operations in eastern DRC following a joint ministerial review meeting of ministers of Defence of both countries in Kinshasa. The ministers also approved Standard Operating Procedures for handling ADF combatants who defect or surrender,” the statement reads in part.\n\nAccording to UPDF deputy spokesperson Col Deo Akiiki, the new extension will span two months as have the previous ones since the start of the operation.\n\n“The ongoing operations are normally reviewed after every two months by CDFs who then make recommendations to ministers of Defence,” he said.\n\nThe statement adds that the ministers reviewed the current situation in eastern DRC and ongoing joint operation code named Shuja, following the third meeting of Chiefs of Defence Forces that happened recently in Kampala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUganda’s technical team was led by Maj Gen Dick Prit Olum, while FARDC was represented by Chief of General Staff Gen Célestin Mbala.\n\nIn November last year, the UPDF and their Congolese counterparts the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC) launched a joint offensive against the ADF rebels.\n\nKampala sought Kinshasa’s permission to pursue the rebels, accusing them of orchestrating several assassinations of government officials, suicide bombings and recruiting of Ugandans to their ranks.\n\nThe ADF has been an anti-Uganda terrorist group since mid-1990s, but recently established links with the Islamic States of Syria and Iraq (ISIS).\n\nThe United Nations says the group is responsible for about 200 killings and displacement of 40,000 people in DRC from the 155 attacks they carried out in 2020 alone.\n\nThe joint operation is currently in its third phase, according to Maj Peter Mugisa, the spokesperson of the UPDF mountain brigade. This third phase involves chasing down fleeing insurgents who fled when officers of the joint military operation bombarded their hideouts.\n\nThis phase also includes securing communities, and recruiting and training local defence units that are left behind to thwart possible attacks from the rebels.\n\n“For the past one month, we have been pursuing these rebels to wherever they have been running and we are still doing exactly that,” Mugisa said.",
    "Unlocking press freedom in Uganda: What must be done": "In 2018, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) global press freedom index placed Uganda 125th out of 180 nations—a grim rank the country held for three consecutive years.\n\nBy 2022, the East African nation of more than 44 million people had nosedived seven places as practitioners in Uganda’s fourth pillar of democracy continued to be threatened with a record overt and covert forms of repression from State actors.\n\nNow, the nation’s status of independent journalism falls far away from RSF’s description of free press. RSF defines media freedom as “the effective possibility for journalists, as individuals and as groups, to select, produce and disseminate news and information in the public interest, independently from political, economic, legal and social interference, and without threats to their physical and mental safety.”\n\nReturn to democratic path\n\nWith Uganda’s media freedom shrinking, her journalism has found a grim position contrary to the suggestion of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who postulates that “history teaches, but has no pupils.”\n\nIn this case, a pupil of Uganda’s media historiography, fourth-year journalism and communication student at Makerere University, Ms Belinda Birungi, is “extremely scared to go missing once admitted into media practice.”\n\n“I am fearful of police and army brutality. Besides, they’re many grey areas in our Constitution that can be used against you,” says the 22-year-old Ugandan.\n\nEndless crackdowns on media houses have subdued the likes of Ms Birungi to self-censorship.\n\n“Security forces have snatched our courage to present the wrongs of society… I mean the courage to write objectively,” said Ms Birungi, who was interning at the country’s leading independent newspaper, Daily Monitor, at the time of this publication.\n\nBetween coming to terms with a brutal state capture of the media and surviving, Ms Birungi “prefers other things to becoming part of over 40 journalists killed globally every year.”\n\nIn reply to Ms Birungi’s concerns, the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, underscores that “harassment and criminal sanctions are dangerous to journalism.”\n\nShe adds that one way of dealing with this is to ensure “cases of journalists should be handled as civil wrongs like in most liberal societies.”\n\nAlthough enshrined under Articles 29 and 41 of the Ugandan Constitution, repeated violation of press freedoms, profoundly by security forces, has raised questions over what appears to be a crisis of legitimacy.\n\nBut Kezaabu, who also leads the Uganda Pornography Control Committee at the Ethics and Integrity Ministry, says “the laws in place are sufficient and don’t require a constitutional rewrite.”\n\n“We should use the laws to tighten where security has made inroads, but there are things that we don’t talk about that are maybe an error of compromised journalists,” she says, adding, “Journalists must abide by accepted ethos for their freedom’s sake.”\n\nKezaabu, however, admits that interpretation or application of the law against journalists may be one-sided to suit the wishes of its enforcers or the jury.\n\n“There’s need to return the country to a democratic path to safeguard human freedom, including the one of expression,” she urges.\n\nFurther, Kezaabu acknowledges that use of anti-terrorism laws and a litany of other decrees against free speech are a clear loop of claw-back clauses in the Constitution.\n\n“It is incumbent upon media houses and journalists to know when not to overstep their mandate to avoid clashing with authorities by, for instance, promoting nudity,” she advises.\n\nArriving at a similar argument, Aga Khan University School of Media and Communications graduate lecturer Alex Taremwa “believes without social responsibility to audiences, the media lose the values that make their duty to society important.”\n\nMr Taremwa argues that breaching the universally known media mandate and standards may instantly birth the horrors that have defined the industry in the eyes of individuals like Ms Birungi.\n\nNew business models\n\nOne of the other challenges press freedom in Uganda faces is that there are more than 200 radio stations and more than 30 televisions in Uganda. The number is impressive. At least superficially. Nearly 70 percent of these stations are, however, owned by either deep state or legislators, according to an African Centre for Media Excellence 2022 survey.\n\n“They control the broadcast narrative and that breaks journalism’s will to mirror society,” observes 2019 BBC Komla Dumar award-winning investigative journalist Solomon Sserwanja.\n\nTo evade the proprietor censorship oriented by political and commercial interests, Mr Sserwanja moots alternative business models to run media operations.\n\n“…for instance, media houses can go after full subscription and run away from advertisers whose commercial advertising interests may force media houses to filter serious stories,” he told this publication on September 6.\n\nFair pay for journalists\n\nThe ability for journalists to report freely is also hampered, for many reasons, by the poor pay journalists are given. In Uganda, pay cheques of journalists have steadied below $200 (about Shs760,000) per month amid lack of newsroom investment by media moguls.\n\nAt least each senior editor contacted from five different (both) state and private media houses reasons that “equipping reporters is an essentiality for free press in a digital evolution.”\n\nFor 25-year-old Soft Power News journalist and digital assistant Muhamadi Byemboijana, “press freedom starts internally with employers ensuring fair pay for journalists.”\n\nHe adds: “Some press corps are battered because the tormentors have no respect for their low paying profession.”\n\nIn addition to that, because of the poor pay, many journalists will take bribes to manage the cost of living. A Ugandan journalist, who preferred anonymity, on September 7 confessed to accepting a “small bribe to kill a story.”\n\n“I killed a match fixing story involving the national cricket team because I felt unprotected, including by the media house I work for. Eventually, I accepted pay from the sports fixers,” the television sports scribe said in an interview.\n\nThis is why fair pay, although it might be a difficult subject to talk about, must be looked into to allow journalists do their work well. Mr Taremwa, in agreement of this, states that “like any other [human] right, good pay definitely increases the quality of freedom-enjoyment and eliminates the threat of bribery or blackmail, which endangers one’s journalistic autonomy.”\n\nCivic engagement\n\nAnother challenge to press freedom is the fact that the audiences for whom they write may not be critically aware of the role of the media.\n\nOver the last two decades, several media houses have emerged in almost all Ugandan regions—usually with screaming headlines critical of the State, signalling the possibility that media freedom has made some gains to be preserved.\n\nHowever, by 2013, an absolute militaristic approach under the Museveni presidency had outpaced his classical conservative National Resistance Army (NRA) post-guerilla war promise of a “free press” in 1986.\n\n“The public cannot say it enjoys freedom if information is being hidden from them. To move our press freedom higher than like 65 percent, awareness should be created in the public domain regarding the fundamental importance of journalism,” Kezaabu says.\n\nTo protect what he describes as his endangered freedom on duty, Mbale City-based Step FM talk show host Eric Mwasame, 30, wants “journalism recognised as a fundamental pillar of development.”\n\n“Society, especially politicians, take us as people who fight governments or mere antagonists, which is untrue. That should change,” Mr Mwasame says.\n\nSimilarly, Kampala City resident Peninah Rukundo singles out “civic engagement as a crucial enabler of free speech.”\n\nWhile the challenges to press freedom remain, some of these solutions can begin to pave the way for a media that is able to do its job robustly, which in turn provides the nation a good service.\n\nForming associations\n\nFor many professions, associations help push their agenda and enable them to have a listening ear from the powers that be. In the case of the media, however, a tiny sliver of Uganda’s hundreds of journalists subscribe to press associations that largely exist only in name in a complex political environment. This has discouraged many from joining them.\n\n“I want to know what these associations are doing for journalism by their actions and then I’d join them,” freelance journalist Daniel Emukule, 39, reacts when asked why he’s not conformist to any press association.\n\nWorryingly also, the near absence of Fourth Estate unions—as tens of journalists are continuously persecuted—has compelled at least eight out of 10 reporters interviewed by this newspaper on September 7 to describe existing press associations as “state-linked and inoperative.”\n\nForming strong and respected media unions and, or associations would, therefore, provide much needed support.\n\n“In areas where relative press freedom exists, working associations are vocal against injustices targeting journalists and that’s why vibrant ones are essential for press freedom,” the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, emphasises.\n\nMr Sserwanja, 35, who left his job at a top media house in Uganda to become chief executive officer at the African Institute for Investigative Journalism (AIIJ), holds that the country needs more such establishments that protect threatened media practitioners.\n\n“All of us (stakeholders) have a role to play to better journalism in this country. The future of journalism relies on collaborations by entities that lead conversations against media repression,” he says.",

    "Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda force France to deal with them like partners and not former colonies": "The Scramble for Africa is a term used for the events that happened during the period between 1881 and 1914. In this short period of time the Western European powers colonized most of Africa. Europeans controlled a mere 10 percent of Africa by 1970 and by 1914 they controlled roughly 90 percent of Africa with Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and Liberia remaining independent. Although France later invaded Ethiopia and captured it for 5 years (1936 to 1941).\n\nThe question here is why we are talking about the Scramble for Africa?\n\nIts answer lies in recent talks hosted by France on Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) relations.\n\nMacron hosts talks on DRC and Rwanda tensions\n\nRecently President Emmanuel Macron hosted talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi amid tensions between the two East-African neighbors regarding rebel problems on their common border.\n\nOn the sidelines of UNGA at Newyork, Macron hosted this meeting to solve the problem of M23 rebels which are wreaking havoc in Democratic Republic of Congo. The President of DRC has also denounced at tha UNGA that the M23 rebels are backed by Rwanda. He also asked the UN to support the African-led mediation.\n\n#RDC_Rwanda_France #UNGA77 I 21.09.2022 #NewYork\n\nCommuniqué conjoint de la Rencontre trilatérale #RDC #Rwanda #France\n\nA l’initiative du Président Emmanuel Macron, les Présidents Félix Tshisekedi, et Paul Kagame, se sont entretenus ce mercredi 21/09/22 à New York. pic.twitter.com/f6fmDmiMoP — Présidence RDC 🇨🇩 (@Presidence_RDC) September 21, 2022\n\nThe state-owned France 24 quoted the French Presidency as saying; The three leaders together “noted their concerns about the resurgence of violence in the east of the DRC,”\n\nUganda and Tanzania oil pipeline and its strategic importance\n\nThe focal point here is the controversial East-African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) which will be the largest heated oil pipeline in the world when constructed. The $10 billion project includes French energy giant TotalEnergies, Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) and Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and other minority shareholders as well. The project includes transportation of oil from Lake Albert to Tanzanian port city.\n\nThe oil will be drilled from the Lake Albert basin on the border of Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo which was first found by a British oil company Tullow Oil in 2006. In April 2020, Tullow oil sold its stake to TotalEnergies and it took almost two years for the French multinational to secure investors for the project.\n\nNear Lake Albert the project developers will together construct oil wells, a crude oil refining plant, underground oil pipelines and other infrastructure in the districts of Nwoya and Bullisa for domestic oil utilization.\n\nThe stakeholders in the EACOP include TotalEnergies (62%), UNOC (15%), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation TPDC (15%) and CNOOC (8%).\n\nAs per the claims by the investors the EACOP will generate approximately 14,000 direct and 45,000 indirect jobs during the construction and production phases with $1.7 billion worth of business creation for the local contractors.\n\n(Extraction and transportation of oil through EACOP, Source: Global oil and Gas exit list)\n\nThe West which together (EU and USA) accounts for 32% of greenhouse emissions as compared to Africa which is 3.8% is today despising African countries for constructing oil pipelines citing Environmental concerns. The IMF recently suggested the African countries to slow down on macroeconomic reforms, which can be summed up as suggesting the African nations to “stay poor forever”.\n\nAnd when the whole West altogether is after Africa scrambling for its resources, Tanzania and Uganda together chose France to give its project’s construction responsibilities. They both effectively forced France to come to the table as equal partner and not as high-handed master. African nations such as Tanzania know that France in general and EU in particular are in dire need of energy and are taking full advantage of the ongoing EU and Russia sanction-energy powerplay.\n\nFrance forced to recognise African countries as Equal Partners\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the EU is struggling with an energy crisis in the aftermath of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The energy crisis is so severe that the EU has to resort to burning wood to meet its energy demands. But France’s strategic move to invite the Presidents of DRC and Rwanda for lunch on the sidelines of UNGA is to secure its foothold in the region. France acting as a mediator in resolving the conflict between the DRC and Rwanda will help it secure its energy needs, whether they are oil or gas.\n\nAll these turn of events have proven the point that gone are the days in which the borders of African countries were decided in European capitals. This move of Macron can set an example for other European powers that they have to get out of their colonial slumber and start treating African countries as equal partners and not as the subjects of former colonies.\n\nStaying in Africa is not easy\n\nIt is a well-documented phenomenon that in today’s Africa, no power can stay if the people of Africa are not in its support. The non-state actors and other disturbing elements in most of the countries make it impossible for any foreign power to even establish its presence. China tried to gain a foothold on Africa by using its cheque-book diplomacy but failed miserably. It is estimated that China spent $148 billion between 2000 and 2018 in loans to African countries which has made it the biggest bilateral lender in Africa. Despite spending almost 150 billion dollars China failed to gather support in the African continent.\n\nLearning from the past mistakes of European powers and recent blunders of the Chinese, France has come up with a solid plan which includes treating the African countries with respect and not like masters. Still the European powers which sanction countries on the drop of a hat, need to learn the lesson that if they keep African countries as former colonies, the African nations will never come on their side.",
    "Milton Keynes woman forced to flee Uganda by Idi Amin 50 years ago tells her inspirational success story": "In August 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, the leader of Uganda, gave the order that all Asian people living in Uganda had 90 days to leave the country.\n\nThis triggered the massive movement of more than 60,000 Ugandan Asians, who sought refuge in countries all over the world.\n\nMany held British passports and almost half of the displaced population came to the UK over the months that followed to start new lives, leaving behind their homes, businesses and livelihoods.\n\nDil, pictured with her daughter, now lives happily in Milton Keynes\n\nOne of these was Dil Dossa, who arrived at Stanstead airport with her family on November 2 1972. She was just four years old and the only possessions she and her family had were the clothes on their backs.\n\n\"Idi Amin provided a 90-day notice. This created panic and confusion for everyone who was affected. For those who classed Uganda as their home, they were left feeling stateless and homeless with no idea of what the future would hold for them,” she said.\n\n\"For my family, Uganda had been home for us for nearly four generations and we were entrepreneurs. We’d arrived from Gujarat, India in the late 1800’s by the British Empire.”\n\n“My grandfather, who had served in the British Army, was given UK citizenship.

Dil is child kneeling on the floor between her parents\n\nFrom the airport, Dil’s family was taken to Army barracks in Somerset, where they stayed for three months until they found a place to resettle.

As siblings we were encouraged to speak English in the house. as the UK had given us a second chance to restart our lives,” recalls Dil.\n\nBoth her parents were East African born, as were their parents before them, she said.\n\n“Like many in the 1970s we experienced some racism, but on the whole many people who understood our journey helped us integrate into this society.”\n\nDil worked hard at school and in 1988 she moved to Milton Keynes. Here, she was highly successful in setting up a career in IT and now runs her own two local companies, an IT Consultancy and a coaching and mentoring business.\n\n\"I do class MK as my new home and have seen it grown over the past 24 years,” she said.\n\nLast week, the death of the Queen was particularly poignant for Dil, who lives with her daughter.\n\n“As the world evolves and changes we still see conflicts occurring on the planet. It was Her Majesty the Queen, together with her government, who provided us with refuge, homes, clothes, and jobs for us to restart our life - something we will never forget.\n\n“My parents raised us to respect the monarchy and government. As we mark the 50-year anniversary of the expulsion from Uganda it is yet another moment in history as we have now lost HRM The Queen.”\n\nOne of Dil’s treasured memories is a newspaper cutting from the Bury Times in February 1973, showing a photo of her with her parents and three siblings.\n\n\"I’m the one sitting on the floor between mum and dad with the horrible haircut!” she says.\n\nThe newspaper quotes the family as being “impressed by the friendly attitude of the local people”.\n\nDil’s father, Abdul, told the reporter: “Everyone has been very nice to us and Bury seems a nice place to live although it has been very cold.”\n\nA national commemorative event will take place in London on 18 September 2022, 50 years after the first evacuation flight from Uganda landed at Stansted airport.",

    "Whatever happened to the teens who endured the world's longest COVID school closure?": "Whatever happened to the teens who endured the world's longest COVID school closure?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nAbout This Series Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite Goats and Soda stories to see \"whatever happened to ...\"\n\nIn January 2022, Uganda ended the longest pandemic school lockdown in the world. As the country's roughly 15 million school-going children were summoned back to class, we spoke with six youths from poor families in one of the largest slums in Kampala, the capital city. The teens shared their feelings about returning to school after almost two years and their dreams for their future. For some, family hardships meant they couldn't afford the school fees that would enable them to return. Now, eight months since the reopening, we returned to their community of Kamwokya and were able to reach five of the six teens we profiled to learn how they are faring.\n\nThere are definitely happy stories among the teens we'd interviewed early this year.\n\nKusemerwa Jonathan Henry, age 16, is a busy kid – enrolled in school but still running the small business he started during the pandemic. With some financial help from his dad, he opened a fruit and vegetable stand that is going strong. By a Kamwokya roadside, Henry sorts fresh mud-covered Irish potatoes. \"I continue to balance my school term and work. So, it's been easy to do both,\" he says. The next term in Uganda starts on September 5, and once class is in session, he'll work at the stall after school. \"Even though there was a lot to cover, I've picked up real fast. I've been studying hard.\"\n\nBabilinda George, Henry's father, can't hide his pride for his son's efforts. The teen has already saved enough to pay for the next term's full tuition, he says. George only has to contribute a little bit for supplies and extras. \"He makes my life easy.\"\n\nBut the matter of school fees has been an obstacle. At Kololo Senior Secondary School , which several of the teens attend, tuition, supplies and uniforms cost roughly $135 for each of the three school year terms.\n\nAnd global events have contributed to a bumpy back-to-school for several of our Kamwokya teens. Once the Ukraine war began, Uganda's fuel prices shot up and in turn affected prices of food and everyday essentials. So school fees were out of reach for some of the teens' families. In some cases the students we interviewed have not been able to start school – or risk being sent home if their families made an initial payment but haven't been able to cover all the costs.\n\nMary Goretti Nakabugo, the executive director of Uwezo Uganda, a nonprofit organization working to promote equitable quality education, says that many parents are struggling to make ends meet. \"For some of them, it might be a choice between survival and sending back children to school.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nKisakye Melissa, now age 15, is one of the teenagers who has yet to return to a classroom since the reopening of school. Her mother earns money by handwashing clothes for locals. During the shutdown, Melissa helped. But they didn't earn enough money for the tuition due when schools reopened. And as 2022 wore on, fewer people dropped off laundry, so Melissa had nothing to do. Her mother sent to a nearby village to help her grandmother with daily tasks.\n\nAfter reading about Melissa's family in the February article that NPR published, African Girls Can, a nonprofit organization training women entrepreneurs in Uganda and elsewhere, hoped to sponsor Melissa. But the organization only supports secondary school students, and Melissa has yet to complete primary education. At age 15, she's only in the equivalent of roughly grade five. She must complete grade seven before entering high school.\n\n\"I feel bad and it scares me that if I ever get the chance to return to school, I will be too old. Children will laugh at me,\" Melissa says. However, she now has reason to hope that scenario won't come true. Her mother went to Sharp Primary School in Kamwokya and asked whether the school would accept tuition payments \"in small bits,\" she says. It was this possibility of returning to school that brought Melissa back from her grandmother's village to Kamwokya. The school agreed to the arrangement, and so finally, she will go back to class at the start of the September term.\n\nNakabugo hopes other schools prove as flexible: \"We are not saying that schools should not charge but they should accept installments. Because parents also need to know that schools cannot run without money.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nNaigaga Rebecca Mercy's parents came up with some tuition money but ended up short of what was needed for her full tuition and supplies. \"Even if the balance is just 1 cent, they will send you home,\" says the 14-year-old. In August, \"I was sent back home just a few days before the final term examinations,\" she explains.\n\nMercy was ultimately able to sit for some exams but not others. Schools sometimes make this kind of allowance to encourage families to pay off their remaining balance. Mercy's father earns a monthly salary as a factory worker, but it isn't enough for rent, tuition and other basics. This month, Mercy says her father must prioritize rent, which means that her school will not receive the expected deposit at the start of the September term. \"When school reopens, we are given one month before we are sent home,\" she says. She is determined to do \"whatever it takes\" to become a doctor or lawyer. \"I like school. I have to achieve my dream.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nTusiime Agnes's parents also were not able to pay fees in full. They paid only half tuition, which was enough for the now 15-year-old Agnes to return but not enough for the school to provide lunch. It's footwear that is most worrisome for this upcoming term, though. The school requires black leather dress shoes, \"which I don't have,\" she says. \"If you wear anything else, you are stopped right at the gate.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nJoel Joseph is also worried about staying in school for the next semester. His single mother's small grocery shop was just shut down. \"The owner of the place she was renting sold it out and she had to leave. So, money is going to be a problem.\"\n\nDuring the lockdown, Joseph rented a small partition within a shop in order to sell clothes, but he says he had to close the business down because he doesn't have time for it when school is in session.\n\nHowever, at least for the moment, the 17-year-old feels that he is on track to pursue a career as a mechanical engineer specializing in robotics. At his school's science fair, he submitted two entries — a toy missile launcher vehicle and a bag that can charge a mobile phone on the go. \"When the judges made their choice,\" he says proudly, \"I won the title 'Mr. Creative.' \"\n\nHalima Athumani is a digital and broadcast journalist based in Kampala, Uganda.

    "Uganda parliament considers organ transplant revolution": "The Ugandan Parliament is considering a bill that would make it possible for the first time to perform organ transplants in this East African country. A small revolution that would transform the lives of thousands of people waiting for surgery.\n\nIf the legislation is approved, Uganda will join African countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, and Kenya, which already have the regulations and health facilities in place to allow organ transplants to take place in their countries.\n\nIndia and Turkey are currently the most popular destinations for Ugandan kidney patients. Only close relatives are allowed to be donors and travel must be approved by the Uganda Medical Council - to avoid organ trafficking or people being forced to offer their organs.\n\nIf Parliament approves the new measure, the process should be simpler and the cost of surgery and recovery could be reduced to about $8,000 instead of $30,000 for a transplant abroad.\n\nProponents of the measure say Uganda needs special legislation to create a safe framework, subject to strict regulation, to ensure there is no abuse. Among them is Dr. Kharya, from the Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy in India. According to him, Uganda already has a good base in terms of a blood bank and laboratories.\n\nThe proposal calls for the creation of a national waiting list of organ recipients and the establishment of specialized transplant centers throughout the country. An operating theatre has already been set up at the main national hospital in Mulago, Kampala.\n\nOrgan banks will also be established for those who wish to donate, not just kidneys.",

    "Nearly 100,000 refugee arrivals in Uganda face a silent emergency, enormous needs": "Refugees shown returning home to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the Nyakabande transit centre in Kisoro, Uganda, where many remain to see how the situation unfolds. © UNHCR/Esther Ruth Mbabazi\n\nAmid surging humanitarian needs for 96,000 refugees who have fled to Uganda so far this year, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and partners urgently require US$68 million for life-saving assistance and services.\n\nAs refugees from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continue to flee violence and seek safety in Uganda, the humanitarian response is being stretched to breaking point.\n\nIn an inter-agency appeal, being revised from April, which covered an initial period of three months, UNHCR and 41 partners – including six UN agencies, 25 international and 10 national non-governmental organizations – are seeking funds through the end of the year to support up to 150,000 refugees, as arrivals continue.\n\nAt the start of 2022, Uganda was already hosting over 1.5 million refugees, making it one of the most important refugee host countries in the world and the largest on the African continent.\n\nUganda is also a global leader in promoting peaceful coexistence and refugee settlement among host communities. Refugees are provided with plots of land for housing and cultivation. Refugees and host communities access the same health facilities, and their children attend schools together.\n\nImportant gains in refugee self-reliance and economic inclusion are now at risk due to severe underfunding for UNHCR's operations in the country.\n\nBy the end of August, UNHCR had received just 38 per cent of its 2022 funding requirement of US$343.4 million to respond to the needs of refugees in Uganda, as determined at the start of this year.\n\nThe funding gap has strained UNHCR's capacity to provide critical support, including basic humanitarian assistance, child protection services, civil registration, and livelihood opportunities.\n\nRefugees are seeing a sharp reduction in support for income-generating activities, including for agricultural inputs that are critical to cultivating allocated land.\n\nChildren, especially girls, face a high risk of dropping out of school as UNHCR will be unable to pay teachers’ salaries, and already crowded classrooms will increase in size. With no more funding to procure soap and hygiene kits for women and girls, their health and access to education will be negatively affected. UNHCR cannot afford to purchase new stocks of medicines for health centres, while progress in reducing child and maternal mortality will regress, and infant malnutrition will increase.\n\nUNHCR and its partners need urgent financial contributions to meet the urgent needs of new refugee arrivals in Uganda, to upgrade the reception capacity and basic infrastructure of refugee settlements and prioritize the relocation of refugees to more suitable facilities.\n\nKisoro, in southwest Uganda, has received most new arrivals from the DRC. At the Nyakabande transit centre, refugees – overwhelmingly women and children – face substandard and crowded conditions which expose them to risks, including gender-based violence.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:",
    "Nyege Nyege to go ahead despite Ugandan MPs concerns it “promotes immorality”": "Nyege Nyege, a well-known dance music festival in Uganda, will continue later this month despite pleas from some Ugandan MPs to cancel it.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Ugandan Prime Minister Robina Nabbanja said the Nyege Nyege festival will continue to take place next week but under \"strict guidelines\".\n\nThis comes after an MP announced that the festival had been \"stopped\" earlier this week, according to the official Twitter account of the Ugandan parliament. It was referred to as \"a breeding ground for sexual immorality\" by one MP, Sarah Opendi.\n\nRead this next: Nyege Nyege is a genuine, experimental African utopia at the source of the Nile\n\n\n\n\"It's going to attract all kinds of people from all over the world, bringing all kinds of actions that are unAfrican and non-Ugandan into our community,” Opendi said in parliament, according to CNN, accusing the festival of “recruiting” young people to LGBTQ+ spaces.\n\nMartin Mugarra, the Minister of Tourism, pleaded with colleagues to view the event as a \"hub of tourism,\" but he was ignored.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Nabbanja said that the festival would go on as normal. She told Ugandan publication Daily Monitor: “The event will take place. It's an event that attracts thousands and thousands of tourists across the globe and, therefore, cancellation would be challenging. We also have to think about the economy.\"\n\nHowever, this decision was made under the conditions that the festival would have to take place under certain restrictions.\n\n\"A number of resolutions have been reached,\" she said. \"One of them is to harmonize with the arm of parliament to see that this event takes place with guidelines that will restrict those that are coming to celebrate to behave in a manner that is acceptable by Ugandan culture.\"\n\nRead this next: Meet the Nyege Nyege festival team\n\n\n\nNyege Nyege and the conservative politics and views held by some in Uganda have clashed before. Former ethics and integrity minister Simon Lokodo, who died in 2018, attempted to have the festival banned for encouraging \"deviant sexual behaviours\" - his request was denied by Parliament.\n\nWhile the “restrictions” that the 2022 edition must operate under have still not been clarified in full, the Nyege Nyege Twitter account tweeted: \"Just don't come naked. Come in good spirit. Come to discover. Come to commune. Come to celebrate. Come to play. Come to dance. Come for the food. Come for the vibe. Come for the fashion, the friends, the falls and the stalls, just DON'T come naked.\"",
    "Turkish charities open orphanage in Uganda": "An orphanage for 200 children, built with technical assistance from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) and financial assistance from Türkiye's Çare Foundation was opened Sunday with a ceremony in the Ugandan capital Kampala. The orphanage will provide Ugandan orphans with a secure learning environment and cozy accommodation.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony, Turkish Ambassador to Uganda Fikret Kerem Alp said: \"Türkiye displays true brotherhood in good and bad times. The Turkish government has identified child welfare as one of the areas where we can help. (Türkiye's) Maarif Foundation visited Uganda and held talks with the government on the provision of education services to Uganda. We hope this will be achieved.\"\n\nThe orphanage center includes classroom blocks, an administrative center, an assembly and exhibition building, play fields, parks, a large green space and a mosque. \"This Orphanage is proof that Türkiye cares for and treats the suffering and disadvantaged people in Uganda, particularly the children, who are often left to go on the streets when their parents die,\" Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo, Uganda's deputy grand mufti (Muslim cleric) said. Ssemambo conveyed his gratitude to TIKA for carrying out projects in the country.\n\nFounded in January 1992 under the Foreign Ministry, the TIKA grew to be at the forefront of Türkiye's development aid efforts. In the three decades since its inception, TIKA has carried out more than 30,000 projects in 170 countries. The state-run aid agency's operations have covered a wide range of areas, from education to agriculture, to access to clean water and restorations. It has boosted its presence worldwide, from 12 offices in 2002 to 62 today, according to the agency.",

In their resolution, MEPs highlight, in particular the forcible deportation of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to Russia, as well as Russia’s abhorrent practices in so-called ‘filtration camps’, where families are separated and those who are deemed ‘unreliable’ disappear.\n\nMEPs call on Russia to fully abide by its obligations under international law and immediately cease the forced deportation and forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians to Russia and the Russian-occupied territories. They also demand an end to all forced transfers of children, as well as any inter-country adoptions of children transferred from within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders.\n\nWhile noting that a forcible transfer is a war crime and a potential crime against humanity, MEPs demand the Russian government repeals all legislation facilitating the adoption of Ukrainian children.\n\nThe text was adopted by show of hands.

(15.09.2022)\n\nThe violations of human rights in Uganda and Tanzania linked to investments in fossil fuels projects\n\nParliament expresses grave concern about arrests, of intimidation and judicial harassment against human rights defenders and NGOs working in the oil and gas sector in Uganda, and calls on the authorities to immediately release anyone arrested arbitrarily.\n\nMEPs say more than 100,000 people are at imminent risk of displacement due to the EACOP project, with inefficient guarantees of adequate compensation. They ask authorities to adequately compensate people for lost property and land. Parliament also demands the Ugandan authorities allow unhindered access to the zone covered by the project for civil society organizations, independent journalists, international observers and investigative researchers.\n\nRelatedly, MEPs urge TotalEnergies to study the feasibility of an alternative route for the project to better protect sensitive ecosystems and the water resources of Uganda and Tanzania, and limit the impact on the watersheds in the African Great Lakes region.\n\nParliament also expresses its concern about the growing economic influence of China and Russia, in particular in the energy sector; and in this regard is concerned by the interest of Uganda’s authorities in developing a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by show of hands.

MEPs point in particular to the arbitrary arrest of Bishop Rolando Álvarez, and call for his and others’ immediate and unconditional release and the annulment of all legal proceedings against them.\n\nNicaragua’s judicial system lacks independence, according to MEPs, and the law is used as a tool to criminalise the exercise of civil and political rights. Parliament is concerned about the 206 political prisoners in the country, deplores the arbitrary closure of another hundred NGOs, and condemns the banning of opposition political parties.\n\nMEPs strongly urge Nicaragua to repeal legislation that unduly restricts the country’s civic and democratic space and they ask the EU to continue supporting civil society organizations there. Parliament wants the EU and the UN Security Council to open a formal investigation into Nicaragua and its president, Daniel Ortega, for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by 538 votes in favour, 16 against with 28 abstentions.

    "Aid groups, authorities coordinate efforts to intensify refugee vaccination in Uganda": "Jean Kalenga recalls with visible dejection the day he packed a few of his family belongings and left his village in Rutshuru, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Thirty-seven-year-old Jean and his wife Neema (31), together with their three children Michelle (10), Emmanuel (8) and Blaise (4), fled for safety following civil strife that rocked eastern DRC earlier this year.\n\nOne of the largest refugee-hosting countries in the world, Uganda is making remarkable gains in ensuring that not only its own citizens, but also its refugee population is vaccinated against various diseases.\n\nHis family is one of thousands displaced after fighting broke out between the Congolese government and the “March 23 Movement”, known as the M23 rebels. The family are now tented up at the Nyakabende refugee camp, located in Kisoro District in southern Uganda, which serves as a transit camp for arriving and returning refugees and is host to more than 20,000 refugees from DRC.\n\n“Initially we were relieved that we were finally in a safe place, but, later, we realised we were at enormous risk of contracting infectious diseases like COVID-19 and cholera because the sanitation situation here isn’t very pleasant. I worried deeply for my children. We sought vaccination but were turned back because we possess refugee IDs,” laments Kalenga.\n\nUganda hosts more than 1.5 million refugees, who constitute 3.3% of the country’s population and come from various countries in the region, including Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and DRC. Despite being one of the largest refugee-hosting countries in the world, Uganda is making remarkable gains in ensuring that not only its own citizens, but also its refugee population is vaccinated against various diseases.\n\nJean Pierre Amudu, another Congolese refugee and community leader who arrived in Uganda from the DRC in 2012, tells journalist Evelyn Lirri, “When we received complaints from refugees that they were being denied vaccines, we went to speak to the health workers and realised some were just unaware of the prevailing policy. The refugees are supposed to access the vaccines.”\n\nAnnet Dusabe, the assistant District Health Officer in charge of maternal child health and vaccination in Kisoro, acknowledges that Uganda’s refugee policy to relax administrative barriers such as the need to produce an ID to access vaccines has seen a sharp increase in vaccination numbers. According to her, in July 2022 about 500 refugee children were vaccinated against polio and measles, up from the previous monthly average of 120.\n\nThis initiative is also backed by the COVAX Humanitarian Buffer, with Gavi as the main funder and supported by UNHCR and UNICEF. The buffer ensures that people in humanitarian settings and conflict areas that can’t be reached by government COVID-19 vaccination campaigns can still access COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“Our goal is to ensure we vaccinate as many refugees as possible, although vaccine shortages have been our biggest obstacle,” Dusabe explains, further noting that an aggressive vaccination drive against cholera started in April 2022 after 30,000 doses of cholera vaccines were delivered, and has so far reached 7,000 out of more than 17,000 refugees in the camp.\n\n“We are happy our government is making progressive refugee policies such as the 2006 Refugee Act,, through which we have been able to include refugees in our national vaccination plan,” says Uganda’s Health Minister Dr Jane Ruth Aceng.\n\nTargeted vaccination campaigns\n\nFrench is the official language of DRC, with other primary languages being Lingala, Kiswahili, Kikongo and Tshiluba, so health workers in Nyakabende have been running targeted vaccination campaign programmes in a language that refugees understand by using interpreters to counter vaccine resistance and communicate other health messages.\n\n“To help them easily understand how vaccines work we, for instance, created an illustration that depicts a stranger suddenly entering your house. You then react by fighting him, until you realise he came to train you how to fight a bigger real imminent enemy coming to harm you. That’s how antibodies work.”\n\n“We had to look inwards to get volunteer interpreters – that is, amongst the refugees themselves. There are those that have been here for a while and can speak most Congolese languages as well as our primary languages here, namely Luganda and English. They have been such great resources for us,” explains Dusabe.\n\nSeveral kilometres away from Nyakabende is the Kyaka II Refugee Settlement, in Kyegegwa District. Health officials operating in the settlement here hope to vaccinate at least 56,600 adults under the Humanitarian Buffer programme, according to Daphne Namusoke, a Senior Nursing Officer in charge of immunisation in the district.\n\nBut she also notes that this wouldn’t be achieved without getting innovative and creative with the messages, simplifying them for all to understand in order for the refugees to voluntarily turn up for the jabs.\n\n“To help them easily understand how vaccines work we, for instance, created an illustration that depicts a stranger suddenly entering your house. You then react by fighting him, until you realise he came to train you how to fight a bigger real imminent enemy coming to harm you. That’s how antibodies work,” Namusoke says.\n\nMany refugees are also doing all it would take to preserve life. At the Itambabiniga Refugee Settlement, 31-year-old pregnant mother Neema Kabirigi, having just received her second COVID-19 jab, says, “My first one (jab) was not a problem, but for the second I was scared because I was pregnant and thought the vaccine could affect my baby. When I saw another woman with a pregnancy bigger than mine get the vaccine, my courage was inspired and I went to get my jab. I am fine.”\n\nReligious leaders in these refugee settlements are also amplifying vaccination messages from the pulpit. Pastor Jean Paul Karimunzira, head of Pentecostal Fathers in Nakivale Settlement admits that at first he was spreading toxic anti-vaccination messages.\n\n“I preached against vaccination. I was telling my ‘flock’ that vaccination was an attempt by the Congolese and Ugandan governments to kill refugees if they didn’t return home. But one health worker changed my perception for good when she showed me pictures of the Ugandan president and other public figures taking the jab. My wife and I took the jab in full view of our congregation and since then, we have been convincing them to get vaccinated,” explains Pastor Karimunzira.",

    "Who are the Abayudaya Jewish community in Uganda?": "This Rosh Hashanah, World Jewish Relief is shining a light on the Abayudaya Jewish community of Uganda. With your help, the charity will continue its 6-year long engagement with local NGO Jewish Response Uganda (JRU), whom they helped establish in 2016.\n\nTogether, we can help Jewish families in Uganda out of the intergenerational cycle of poverty, because kol Yisrael aravim zeh l’zeh, all Jews are responsible for one another.\n\nWhat should you know about Uganda’s Jewish community?\n\n1. History\n\n2. Agricultural Livelihoods\n\n3. World Jewish Relief's TransFARMation Programme\n\n4. Amos' Story\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n1. History\n\nIn eastern Uganda, the Abayudaya Jewish community has been practicing Judaism for over 100 years. Their name has its roots in the Luganda word for ‘people of Judah’. Established in 1919 when a local chieftain began to study the tenets of Judaism, the Abayudaya community developed over time in the predominantly Christian and Muslim society. They became deeply connected to Jewish traditional and global Jewish peoplehood.\n\nThe Abayudaya set up their first Yeshiva in 1920 and the first synagogue in 1923. They began to thrive. But in 1971 Ugandan leader Idi Amin came to power and banned Jewish practice. Many were forced to convert to other religions. A core group of 300 Jews remained committed to their religion, practicing in secret.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the community numbered about 3,000. Today this number is closer to 2,000. They are spread across eastern Uganda, living amongst their non-Jewish neighbours. The largest group is based in Nabugoye, where there is a synagogue and a Jewish primary and secondary school.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n2. Agricultural Livelihoods\n\nThe region where many Abayudaya Jews are based in eastern Uganda is almost a 5-hour drive from Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Surrounded by mountains and waterfalls, it is a region that tourists visit to hike and explore.\n\nThe climate and terrain are perfect for growing high value crops. Yet, for most local farmers even growing enough to feed their families is a challenge. Many farmers have not had access to training, to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to yield high value crops and make a profit from their land. Some cannot afford essentials like seeds or fertilisers. And for others, even owning farmland is a far-off dream.\n\nAgainst this backdrop many Jewish men, women and children are trapped in the cycle of intergenerational poverty and face an uncertain future. That’s where World Jewish Relief comes in.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n3. Our TransFARMation Programme\n\nWorld Jewish Relief believes that the solution to breaking the cycle of poverty within the Ugandan Jewish community lies in the hands of educated, committed farmers. They helped establish local partner JRU and together in 2017, launched their TransFARMation programme.\n\nThe aim is simple: to help Jewish families in Uganda lift themselves out of poverty through commercial farming, so their entire community can thrive. The programme staff work with the most vulnerable community members, helping them to rent fertile land, buy seeds for lucrative crops like watermelon, peppers, and onions, and become skilled at using modern agricultural techniques. They are taught financial management, so they can plan for the long term. They no longer rely on handouts. Theirs futures are in their own hands.\n\n94% of participants on TransFARMation complete the programme, and some earn more than £1,000 per season, the equivalent of a primary school headteacher’s salary.\n\nAmos is just one Jewish community member who, with the help of TransFARMation, has turned his family’s life around.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n4. Amos' Story\n\nAs a child, Amos dreamed of being a doctor and healing the sick. But having left school early because his parents couldn’t afford the fees, Amos worked as a bricklayer earning just pennies for his hard work. He went home exhausted every day.\n\nAmos’ 11 year old son, Sinyana Moses, was born with a condition that means he needs nutritious food, regular hospital visits and physiotherapy to stay strong. But on his bricklayer’s salary Amos couldn’t afford to feed him properly, let alone pay for his medical care. He watched his son get weaker, unable to keep up with his siblings.\n\nWhen Amos joined TransFARMation our staff helped him to develop his land, teaching him modern irrigation methods and how best to fertilise his soil. He learned to yield lucrative pepper, watermelon and onion harvests, as well as the importance of financial planning and accessing local markets.\n\nAmos’ hard work began to pay off and his confidence grew. He began to harvest his crops, which he sold for more than he could’ve imagined. He said:\n\nThere was never enough food before, but now we can eat whatever we want and share food with the community. My children go to school. And I can finally afford to take Sinyana Moses to the clinic for treatment and pay for his physical therapy and medication.\n\nBut the most important thing is the change in my mindset. Before the programme we relied on handouts and had to beg our neighbours for help. Now I know I can change things myself.\n\nSinyana Moses is healthier than he’s ever been. He loves charging around with his brothers and sisters and singing songs at the top of his voice. He wants to run his own business one day. His future looks bright.\n\nHelp Jewish community members in Uganda to thrive this Rosh Hashanah, by visiting www.worldjewishrelief.org/roshhashanah.",

For this reason, meeting their people’s needs while reducing emissions will look completely different in Africa.\n\nThe traditional wisdom that hydrocarbons constitute the worst “dirty energy” solution is inaccurate. In Uganda, where basic energy needs are often met via tree cutting, improving access to energy from fossil fuels would reduce carbon impacts.\n\nAfrica’s role in global carbon emissions is minuscule. Environment, Health, Safety and Security Director for the Petroleum Authority of Uganda, Dr. Joseph Kobusheshe, points out that Africa, the second most populous continent and home to about 20 per cent of the world’s population, is responsible for just 3 per cent of the global CO2 emissions.\n\nAs a country, Uganda suffers from energy poverty. In the absence of a large industrial sector and universal electricity access, most of the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by deforestation.\n\nIn the decade between 2005 and 2015, the country’s carbon emissions nearly doubled from 53 to 90mT, says Dr. Kobusheshe, and forest degradation and deforestation were mostly responsible for the increase.\n\nAccording to the 2019 Uganda First Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Uganda’s Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector are responsible for 86 per cent of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For this reason, Uganda’s most effective approach to lowering its carbon emissions is to focus on using traditional wood-fired cooking stoves. Interventions by the Ministry of Water and Environment are looking to achieve a 25 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 by replacing conventional cooking stoves with improved stoves.\n\nInterestingly, Dr. Kobusheshe says further reductions will be achieved by developing the country’s oil and gas resources to produce liquified petroleum gas (LPG).\n\n“Production of LPG from the country’s oil and gas resources and its use both in the country and in the region will significantly reduce dependency on wood fuel, which is responsible for massive deforestation in Uganda,” says Dr Kobusheshe.\n\nTo increase the use of LPG, the Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), is promoting the uptake of LPG to replace firewood and has launched an initiative to distribute one million LPG cylinders and accessories in the next five years. The Minister of Energy and Mineral Development, Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu launched the distribution of free LPG cylinders and accessories in July 2022.\n\nThe reliance on wood fuel underscores the massive underdevelopment and energy poverty faced by Uganda and many other African nations.\n\nWhen commercial quantities of oil and gas resources were confirmed in Uganda in 2006, the country embraced an opportunity to resolve and lift its people and economy out of this underdevelopment trap.\n\nUganda is planning to commercialize its oil and gas resources in two avenues: the development of a 60,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Hoima and a 219,000-barrels-per-day capacity. Uganda intends to commercialize its oil and gas resources through two avenues: gas resources emanating from the Tilenga and Kingfisher projects. They produce an estimated total of 1.4 billion barrels of oil. The East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), as it is known, will also export oil to international markets.\n\nThe project has drawn vociferous protests from environmentalist groups, including one which disrupted the TotalEnergies AGM in Paris earlier this year.\n\nThe Government of Uganda, however, insists on its right to commercialize its energy assets for the benefit of its people while following the most stringent environmental standards available.\n\n“EACOP is one of the avenues by which Uganda plans to commercialize its oil and gas resources,” says Clovice Bright Irumba, Director for Exploration, Petroleum Authority of Uganda, before going on to ask the question, “Is the world ready for a full stop to the exploration and development of fossil fuels?”\n\nIrumba concludes that the answer is no. He quotes figures from the BP Energy Outlook for 2022, where for net-zero carbon scenarios, the average annual investment in renewables is projected at US$500-US$800 billion, while pre-Covid-19 average annual investment in solar and wind energy ranged between US$250 and US$300 Billion.\n\n“The world is still far from closing that gap by 2050,” says Irumba.\n\nIrene Bateebe, the Permanent Secretary of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, says developing countries need to be treated differently and fairly when it comes to matters of the energy transition. “We cannot be put at the same scale as the developed countries. It is unrealistic for anyone to expect an African state to leapfrog from using biomass to advanced renewable technologies.”\n\n“In Uganda, 80 per cent of the population uses firewood. We should be allowed to transit in recognition of where we are today. For us, it is about fairness regarding access to electricity and other energy sources and equity,” says Bateebe.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only exacerbated the situation. Clearly understanding this, global oil and gas firms have expanded development projects across the planet.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s National Oil Company announced in May 2022 three new oil discoveries estimated at over 650 million barrels. Equinor has announced a new Barents Sea oil discovery. The UK’s North Sea Transition Authority has identified 33 new oil and gas projects targeting the production of 1.3 billion barrels. President Biden has issued a slew of oil drilling permits in the United States but still faces an energy crisis.\n\nThe global agreement appears that upstream fossil fuel development is vital to meeting the planet’s energy needs. Pipelines are also the accepted means of doing so.\n\nAl Jazeera recently reported that at least 2,381 oil and gas pipelines were operating worldwide across 162 countries. Of these, the USA has the longest network of pipelines – 91 067km for oil and 333 366km for gas – followed by Russia, Canada and China.\n\nThe proposed EACOP pipeline would cover a stretch of 1 433km – around 0.1% of the world’s pipeline network.\n\nPipelines are an accepted method of transporting the hydrocarbons that are still needed to meet the world’s energy needs. Strenuous safety and environmental standards now protect communities and minimize the climate and other operations of the extraction.\n\nUganda’s upstream proposes minimizing environmental impact by drilling up to 15 wells from a single well pad and equipping buried pipelines with leak detectors and valves to shut down in case of abnormalities automatically. No flaring or venting of oil or gas would be permitted during normal operations. Overall, the projects fall within the category of “low emission.\"\n\n“Government has put in place a robust policy, legal and institutional framework, together with a monitoring and compliance enforcement framework to ensure oil and gas activities co-exist with the environment and social wellbeing of communities,” writes Dr. Kobusheshe.\n\nPerhaps ironically, the oil and gas industry appear to be part of the solution to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in Uganda. While the EACOP project has drawn the ire of environmentalists, the country remains committed to unlocking the same hydrocarbon bounty that serves the needs of other countries. Many emerging African energy players discern this spirit of responsible energy sovereignty. The sector convenes in October at Africa Oil Week.\n\n“Until renewables become more efficient, reliable, and affordable to provide the needed energy security, the world is not yet ready to stop the exploration and development of fossil fuels,” said Dr. Kobusheshe.",
    "Ugandan media reflects on covering Queen Elizabeth’s death": "As the world mourns the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Ugandan media has been at the forefront of telling her story.\n\nMany local television and radio stations have had to interrupt normal broadcasting in order to relay events happening in the United Kingdom to their local audiences.\n\nUganda's government newspaper, the New Vision, has been carrying front-page stories remembering the Queens' visit to the country.\n\n\"It was a shock to us but we got on as you know in the media when something happens you immediately prepare yourself and offer the audience what you think would be beneficial to our audience here, so we jumped on the story and because of the historical links we have with Britain, a lot of our people follow the news about the monarchy, about the UK government, about what's happening in Britain - a lot of our people follow that,\" said Felix Osike, the Deputy Editor in Chief, New Vision Uganda.\n\nThere have also been mixed reactions from the public after the death of the monarch, owing to the historical background of the two countries and the bitter legacy of colonialism.\n\n\"Of course now here, among the young people, especially in the newsroom they are cognizant of the fact that well as she has been a great queen there also some dark things to consider especially the slavery and the colonialism,\" said Joyce Nakato, a news reporter and NTV Uganda broadcaster.",
