    "Senegal ferry disaster town remembers 20 years after 1,900 drowned": "Twenty years after Le Joola ferry sank, the Senegalese town where half of the nearly 1,900 dead lived will on Monday hold commemorations for a \"wound that never heals\".\n\nWhen news spread that the vessel had capsized on the night of September 26, 2002, no one in the southern city could believe it.\n\n\"It was unthinkable,\" said Nouha Cisse, who was head teacher at a secondary school in Ziguinchor that lost 150 pupils to the tragedy.\n\nA total of 1,863 people drowned or were lost -- surpassing the Titanic toll of more than 1,500 some 90 years earlier.\n\nLe Joola sailed into a storm off the coast of The Gambia on the way from Ziguinchor to the capital Dakar.\n\nThe ferry played a major role in the town in the isolated Casamance enclave, providing a lifeline to Dakar and transporting agricultural produce as well as tourists.\n\nThe Casamance, almost separated from the rest of Senegal by the tiny state of The Gambia, had since 1982 been wracked by a separatist rebellion. September 2002 saw a surge in attacks.\n\nOn September 26, more than 1,928 people officially crowded onto the ferry, which had a capacity of 536 passengers.\n\nVictims' associations say more than 2,000 passengers from more than a dozen countries died, and only 65 survived.\n\nWith crowds gathering at the port the morning after, the prime minister announced Le Joola had capsized.\n\n\"After that, it was unbearable in Ziguinchor,\" recalled Ibrahima Gassama, a journalist who covered the disaster for Sud FM radio.\n\n\"No one could console anyone. The gendarmes cordoned off the area because some people were threatening to throw themselves into the sea.\n\n\"They had lost everything,\" Gassama said.\n\n\"It really was a catastrophe,\" said 65-year-old Khadidiatou Diop, who lost her mother.\n\n\"In this house one person died, in that house another death, across the road one dead. It was like that all over Ziguinchor.\"\n\nFor Gassama, \"It's a wound that never heals.\n\n\"I don't think it ever can because the subsequent behaviour over the handling of the catastrophe was a second shipwreck.\"\n\nHe noted the rescue effort that only happened the next day and the official \"lies\", denying the high death toll.\n\nTwo decades on, many questions remain unanswered.\n\nThe causes of the incident have never been fully established, despite a Senegalese government inquiry and a French probe launched because of the deaths of 18 French citizens.\n\nEngine failure, a navigational error, bad weather, poor maintenance and overcrowding -- or a combination -- were likely to blame.\n\nSenegal closed the case in 2003 after concluding an investigation that blamed the captain, lost in the catastrophe.\n\nFrench courts also dismissed a years-long probe, which found evidence against seven Senegalese officials, concluding that Paris did not have jurisdiction.\n\nSenegalese and French victims' associations want the raising of the wreck of Le Joola, which sunk to a depth of some 20 metres (60 feet) and is thought to hold many bodies.\n\nThey also want a memorial erected. One was promised five years ago but the site is still nowhere near ready in Ziguinchor in time for Monday's anniversary.\n\nSenegalese victims' relatives have been compensated but President Macky Sall has never attended the annual anniversary remembrance.\n\nIn the town on the banks of the Casamance river, as at every anniversary of the sinking, \"everyone will gather to pray together\", noted Diop.\n\n\"But for those of us affected by this, it's the same every day. From 2002 till today, there has not been a day when I haven't thought about the boat,\" she said.",
    "Internationals: Koulibaly helps Senegal to friendly victory": "Kalidou Koulibaly played the full 90 minutes as Senegal defeated Bolivia 2-0 in France on Saturday evening.\n\nThe Chelsea defender, a summer signing from Napoli, was at the heart of the Lions of Teranga’s defence as they overcame a gallant Bolivia side at the Stade de Source in Orleans thanks to goals from Boulaye Dia and a Sadio Mane penalty.\n\nKoulibaly looked assured in defence, dealing with any Bolivian attack with ease and playing his part by stepping out into midfield on occasions.\n\nEdouard Mendy, a team-mate of Koulibaly’s for both club and country, was absent from the fixture through injury.\n\nSenegal’s next game is on Tuesday, when they face Iran in another friendly ahead of the upcoming World Cup. That fixture will be hosted in Austria.\n\nElsewhere, there were Nations League defeats for Cesar Azpilicueta and Armando Broja for Spain and Albania respectively.\n\nAzpi started at right-back for Spain as they took on Switzerland in Zaragoza, before being replaced by Carlos Soler in the final moments as La Roja suffered a first home defeat in 22 matches.\n\nManuel Akanji handed Switzerland a first-half lead before Jordi Alba equalised for Spain five minutes before the hour but moments later the visitors restored parity, courtesy of a Eric Garcia own goal.\n\nDenis Zakaria, a recent loan signing from Juventus, came on as a substitute in the 68th minute to help Switzerland to victory.\n\nIt means Portugal leapfrog Spain to top spot in their Nations League group with Tuesday’s clash between the pair set to be a winner-takes-all affair to qualify for next year’s Nations League finals.\n\nMeanwhile there was heartbreak for Broja and Albania in Tel Aviv, as Tai Baribo netted an injury-time winner for Israel.\n\nShon Weissman handed the hosts the lead a minute into the second half before an 88th minute equaliser from Myrto Uzani looked to have grabbed Albania a share of the spoils, before Baribo’s late intervention.\n\nBroja played the full 90 minutes for the Eagles in Israel.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, in the younger age groups, Lewis Hall played 90 minutes as England U-19s defeated Georgia 6-0 to make it two wins from two in their UEFA European Championship qualification campaign.\n\nWhile in the Under-20 ranks, Carney Chukwuemeka and Harvey Vale both featured in England’s 2-1 win over Morocco.

    "Senegal: African Development Bank provides €29 million for development of road networks in 6 communes": "The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group has approved a €28.88 million loan for improvements to the road and transport network linking six Senegalese municipalities. The loan was approved on 20 September 2022.\n\nThe financing will be sourced from savings from the Senegal Cities Modernisation Programme.\n\nThe funds will support the construction of 28 kilometers of urban roads in asphalt concrete, paving stones and concrete. These works will complement earlier project achievements including the construction of 45.4 kilometers of asphalt roads, 21.6 kilometers of paved roads and the rehabilitation of 11.2 kilometers of asphalt roads.\n\nThe target areas are Yeumbel Nord (Dakar suburbs), Keur Massar and Guédiawaye (Dakar region), Thiès (West), Kaolack (Centre-West) and Saint-Louis (North-West).\n\nThe financing will also be used for drainage, public lighting, and the construction or repair of cabins that can be used as restaurants and sheds. An empowerment centre will also be set up to advance women’s and youth employment. Under the initiative, local authorities will receive training in geographic information systems, database management, planning, investment programming and procurement.\n\nThe programme is expected to improve the competitiveness of the beneficiary cities, which will be able to undertake planned growth. The support to Senegal's first Cities Modernisation Programme demonstrates the Bank's renewed approach to supporting the development of urban areas. This approach, which combines investment in infrastructure and institutional capacity building, is all the more important as it focuses on medium-sized and peripheral cities, thus contributing to regional rebalancing.\n\nLaunched in 2017 to boost decentralisation and drive Senegal’s economic and social development in the country, the first Cities Modernisation Programme received €114.34 million in financing from the African Development Bank. It covers 13 municipalities in the country: Diourbel, Kaolack, Kolda, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Tambacounda, Thiès, Ziguinchor, Guediawaye, Keur Massar, Yeumbeul and Mbour.",

    "Here’s a list of demands from Senegal’s Macky Sall at UNGA 2022 — Quartz Africa Weekly — Quartz": "This story was published on our Quartz Africa Weekly newsletter, News and culture from around the continent .\n\nHi Quartz Africa readers,\n\nSenegal’s president and chair of the African Union, Macky Sall, gave a vibrant speech at this year’s United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. He sent a direct message to his fellow world leaders: Africa does not want to be the battleground for a proxy war between nations on opposing sides of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of the burden of history,” said Sall, who has become the loudest African voice advocating for an equal seat for the continent at crucial decision-making tables. Rather than be the stage for another Cold War, Africa wants to be a “pole of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis.”\n\n\n\nSall’s remarks come within the last fortnight of reflection on Africa’s place in the world, following the passing of the last British monarch to have colonial subjects on the continent.\n\n\n\nIn the decades since the drastic dilution of the British Empire, the postcolonial world shepherded by the United Nations has prioritized so-called world powers at its highest decision making levels. The UN’s security council is the prime example: its five permanent member countries, none African, hold powers of veto that affect how UN bodies intervene on the continent’s critical peace and security matters.\n\n\n\nSall reminded his colleagues that Africa wants to change this, citing the Ezulwini Consensus where African leaders demanded two permanent seats on the security council.\n\n\n\nSall’s demands at UNGA for Africa’s equality should be seen as him upholding the UN to its stated purpose.\n\n\n\n“We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences, because the United Nations system, born out of the ashes of war, can only win the support of all on the basis of shared ideals, not local values erected as universal norms.” —Alexander Onukwue, west Africa correspondent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories this week\n\nTwo dozen African leaders graced Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral.

But there’s further yet to go, if you ask Moky Makura, the executive director of Africa NoFilter (ANF). The organization, which began as a project under the Ford Foundation and became its own entity in 2019, aims to “support the development of nuanced and contemporary stories that shift stereotypical and harmful narratives within and about Africa.”\n\n\n\nSince then, ANF has raised $6 million from mega funders like Ford and Bloomberg to support its work, and gives out $1 million a year in grants to storytellers, many of them first-time recipients.\n\n\n\nThe organization also funds innovative research on how to shift narratives, such as examining how the media covers the continent, and launched bird, Africa’s first digital story agency. You’ll spot some of those stories on Quartz Africa. “The world is ready for lighter, uplifting stories that reflect this dynamic continent,” says Makura. “It’s up to us, Africa’s media, to deliver them.”\n\n\n\nCheck out Quartz Africa’s Innovators 2021 list, which showcases the pioneering work being done by Makura and other female African innovators.\n\n\n\nDealmaker\n\nJulaya, a payments provider for businesses in Côte d’Ivoire, raised $5 million in a round led by SpeedInvest, an early-stage European investor. It’s a follow-on funding round to the $2 million the startup raised in July last year. Within the period, it has grown from processing $1.5 million monthly to $7.5 million. Other investors in this round include EQ2 Ventures, Kibo Ventures, Orange Ventures, and Senegalese soccer goalkeeper Édouard Mendy.\n\nRemedial Health, a Nigerian startup that helps pharmacies buy products from manufacturers, raised $4.4 million in a follow-on round to the $1 million it raised in February this year. Tencent, and Y Combinator are among the investors in this round that was led by Global Ventures. The year-old startup says it has grown sixfold in seven months, thanks partly to a buy-now-pay-later option for pharmacies to order products.\n\n\n\nQuartz Gems\n\nThe way you draw a circle says a lot about you\n\nImage copyright: Nikhil Sonnad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November of 2016, Google released an online game called Quick, Draw!, in which users have 20 seconds to draw from prompts like “camel” and “washing machine.” You shouldn’t be too too surprised to learn that the game is fun, yes, but its real aim was to use sketches to teach algorithms how humans draw.\n\nWe did some analysis on the public database from Quick, Draw! that suggested the way we draw a simple circle is linked to geography and cultural upbringing, deep-rooted in hundreds of years of written language, and significant in developmental psychology and trends in education today.\n\nCurious?

    "Landmark Lawsuit Filed Against Senegal Fish Meal Factory": "A Senegalese fisherman’s collective is suing the owners of a fish meal factory, which they say has polluted their village and destroyed their livelihoods. The lawsuit is the first of its kind and could set a precedent for other communities fighting against fish factories.\n\nSome 40 people assembled outside the courthouse in Thies, Senegal, on Thursday chanting protest slogans and holding banners that called for the closure of the factory in the town of Cayar.\n\nThe event marked what they had hoped would be the first day of legal proceedings between the Touba Protéine Marine fish meal factory and the fishermen’s Taxawu Cayar Collective. However, the case was postponed to October 6.\n\n“For any outsider who comes to Cayar, all they’d have to do is breathe to understand the difficulties we’re facing,” said Alle Sy, a member of the fisherman’s collective. “People have fallen ill, seriously ill. Our life is too hard now. We know we won’t be alone in this fight.”\n\nThe factory has also significantly decreased the value of their land, he added.\n\nThe Touba Protéine Marine factory, formerly known as Barna Senegal, is one of at least a half dozen fish meal factories that operate in the West African country.\n\nFish meal is dried, ground-up fish that is used as fertilizer or animal feed. According to the environmental group Greenpeace, the Touba factory has dumped increasing and illegal levels of heavy metals into Cayar’s land and water.\n\nCritics say fish meal factories have contributed to rising food insecurity throughout the region. They say the factories take fish that would otherwise be consumed locally and export them as fish meal to European and Asian markets, where it’s used to feed farm animals.\n\nBut Talla Gueye, the communications officer for the Touba factory, said the factory was established at a time when there was a surplus of fish being left on the beach.\n\nHe also refuted claims that the factory had polluted Cayar’s water.\n\n“The director and many of the workers live next to the factory, and no one has been diagnosed with illnesses due to the impacts of the factory,” he said. “The people of Cayar want this factory to stay because it creates a lot of employment.”\n\nDemba Bathily is the lawyer for the fisherman’s collective. He said the factory has been operating under the guise of bringing jobs and development to Cayar, when in reality, it only brings illness.\n\n“Today, it is social and economic rights that are being violated. It is the right to a clean environment that is being violated,” Bathily said. “And we want this to set an example — we want communities to understand that it is possible to stand up and fight for their rights.”\n\nMembers of Cayar’s fishermen collective said they plan to gather even more supporters and return to the courthouse in full force for next month’s meeting.",
    "Senegal President Macky Sall appoints first PM since 2019": "Amadou Ba’s appointment re-establishes the position of prime minister following its abolition in April 2019.\n\nSenegalese President Macky Sall has reinstated the post of prime minister, appointing a former economy minister to the job two months after a tense legislative election in which Sall’s ruling coalition lost its comfortable majority.\n\nAmadou Ba, a 61-year-old taxation specialist who has also served as foreign minister, was named as the West African country’s prime minister, a statement from the presidency said on Saturday.\n\nBa’s appointment re-establishes the position of prime minister in the West African country following its abolition in April 2019.\n\nIn a speech to the nation broadcast on Friday, Sall said the new prime minister would be responsible for addressing the rising cost of living.\n\n“Measures to reduce the cost of living and support employment and entrepreneurship for young people, the fight against floods and costly rents will remain the highest of priorities for me,” Sall said.\n\nBa echoed these sentiments during his first speech after the president’s secretary-general read out the decree.\n\n“The major priorities that the president has outlined include improving household purchasing power, taming inflation, security, housing, vocational training, employment and entrepreneurship,” Ba said on national television after a meeting with Sall on Saturday.\n\nThe full government is expected to be appointed later on Saturday.\n\nEarlier this week, Senegal’s security forces were called to secure a voting process in parliament and hold back opposition members of parliament who tried to disrupt the election of a new president of the national assembly. The assembly was convening for the first time since July’s election.\n\nSall came to power in 2012 after unseating longtime President Abdoulaye Wade. He was elected again in 2019 on promises of large-scale infrastructure expansion as the country is set to start producing oil and natural gas next year.\n\nBut much of his second term has been marked by economic hardship – partly stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and global fallout linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPolitical tensions have boiled over Sall’s refusal to publicly rule out a third-term presidential bid in 2024.\n\nViolent protests erupted in Senegal last year when Ousmane Sonko, Sall’s main opponent who came third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested on rape charges which he denied.\n\nSonko was released but many protesters saw his arrest as an attempt by Sall to remove a prominent rival and clear his path for a third term bid.",
    "Senegal leads way on women legislators but challenges ahead": "Senegal will break new ground Monday as West Africa's largest-ever proportion of women MPs take their seats in a newly elected legislature, stirring hopes of change in a country where patriarchal laws and attitudes are entrenched.\n\nMore than 44 percent of seats in Senegal's next National Assembly will be held by women -- the biggest share of any country in the region.\n\nBut hopes for dramatic progress on issues ranging from reproductive rights to domestic violence also have to be balanced with political reality.\n\nAminata Toure, a former prime minister and incoming MP for President Macky Sall's APR party, cautioned that in politics, female pioneers always encounter resistance and suspicion.\n\n\"You're much more scrutinised... they don't forgive you for any mistakes\", she told AFP. \"I think all women in power would tell you the same.\"\n\nSeventy-three out of 165 parliamentary seats will be held by women following elections in July across Senegal, widely viewed as a beacon of democracy and stability in a region marked by conflict and military rule.\n\nThe country ranks fourth in Africa and 18th in the world for gender parity in parliament, ahead of Switzerland, France, Britain and the US, according to the Geneva-based organisation the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\nOutside of Senegal, only 15 of 111 elected or appointed parliamentary or ministerial positions that opened in West Africa and the Sahel between December and June were filled by women, a UN report has said.\n\nSenegal's high share is explained by a 2010 law requiring \"absolute gender parity\" in all elective institutions, with candidate lists alternating between men and women.\n\nThe latest tally of legislators is two more than previously, and the highest ever under the parity rules.\n\nThe law \"allows women to have a say on the national budget, express the concerns and needs of women in parliament and show society that women are equally qualified,\" said Toure.\n\nWomen \"can bring another culture of governing\".\n\nCandidate lists are often topped by men and, when they are odd-numbered, tend to have one more man than woman, which explains why female representation remains below 50 percent, a National Assembly spokeswoman said.\n\n- Incremental change -\n\nActivists point to a mountain of tasks in a country that ranks a lowly 130th out of 189 states on a UN gender equality index.\n\nBut efforts to fix them under the new assembly are likely to be incremental.\n\nRape was only criminalized in 2020, and national laws have yet to fully implement the Maputo Protocol, an African Union initiative to widen abortion access that Senegal ratified in 2005.\n\nIt obliges state parties to allow abortion in cases of rape and incest, among others.\n\nBut in Senegal, abortion is only permitted to save a pregnant woman's life, said Aissatou Ywa of Task Force, an alliance of civil society and medical associations campaigning for rape and incest to be included.\n\nIn 2020, one-quarter of the female prison population had been jailed for abortion-related crimes, according to the NGO Africa Check, quoting data provided by Senegal's penitentiary administrators.\n\nOther campaign groups are pushing for legal changes that would raise the age of marriage for girls to 18 from 16. The legal age of marriage is already 18 for men.\n\n\"It should be raised to 18 for girls to enable them to continue school and be on the same footing, in terms of rights, as boys\", said Maimouna Yade, head of the women's organization JGEN.\n\nCampaigners are also pushing to allow mothers to have the same parental authority under the law as fathers.\n\n\"There are so many things to do,\" said Mame Diarra Fam, an incoming MP for the opposition Senegalese Democratic Party.\n\nShe highlighted violence against women, education for girls and access to health, following a string of headline-making tragedies in maternity clinics over the last 18 months.\n\n- Test ahead -\n\nAdvocates and MPs credit the parity law for several success stories.\n\nIn 2013, parliament enacted a law allowing Senegalese women married to foreigners to pass their nationality onto their children, a right that was already permitted for Senegalese men.\n\nToure had introduced the bill as justice minister.\n\nAnother breakthrough was legislation criminalizing rape -- a law \"largely pushed\" by female MPs, said Yade.\n\nWhether women's rising numbers in parliament translates into executive clout will soon face a key test.\n\nSall will be scrutinized to see if he names a woman to the role of prime minister, a position that he had abolished in 2019 under the country's presidential system.\n\nSenegal's first woman prime minister was Mame Madior Boye, who served from 2001 to 2002. She was followed by Toure, in office from 2013 to 2014.\n\nAnother issue is how many women Sall will name to ministerial jobs. Toure is among those wanting parity to be extended to the cabinet and even to the private sector.\n\nCivil society groups meanwhile are campaigning hard for a female speaker of the assembly, a role never held by a woman.\n\n\"We really want a woman leading the 2022-2027 parliament\", said Coumba Gueye, executive secretary of the Association of Senegalese Women Lawyers. \"If we have a woman, a lot of things can be changed.\"",

Assessment reports by volunteers reveal that this situation caused a lot of damage in the mentioned areas, resulting in the destruction of 170 houses and the displacement of 1,396 families who were accommodated in schools or hosted by neighbours in challenging living conditions. Some 317 families were not relocated and are still living in their flooded houses.

    "Senegal’s pink lake threatened by flood after heavy rains": "Senegal, like other countries in the West and Central Africa region, has recorded above-normal rainfall in recent weeks that has unleashed destructive floods\n\nAfter days of torrential rain, salt miner Moussa Diare could only watch in despair as flood waters breached a meters-wide gap on the banks of Senegal’s Pink Lake and washed away thousands of dollars worth of salt mounds he had gathered.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve seen this. I lost a lot of money with my salt that has been washed and dissolved by the water,” Diare said on Tuesday.\n\nSenegal, like other countries in the West and Central Africa region, has recorded above-normal rainfall in recent weeks that has unleashed destructive floods after poor drainage systems failed.\n\nThe lake, separated by a strip of dunes from the Atlantic Ocean, is situated approximately 35 kilometres (20 miles) from Senegal’s capital Dakar. It is one of the country’s most-visited sites and is under consideration as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nOfficially known as Lake Retba, it derives its pinkish hue from an alga that produces the coloured pigment, and like the Dead Sea, is also known for its high salt content.\n\nDiare is one of more than 3,000 people who earn a living from the lake, including hundreds of divers who manually rake salt from the bottom of the lake, producing about 38,000 tonnes annually. The salt is used for cooking and exported around the region.\n\nAs persistent rains drenched Senegal, with approximately 126 millimetres (five inches) recorded during one spell over the past weekend, according to the Water and Sanitation Ministry, drainage systems and retention reservoirs were quickly overwhelmed and channelled flood waters towards the lake.\n\nAccording to Senegal’s civil aviation and meteorological agency, rainfall above 50mm (1.9 inches) in the country is considered “extreme”.\n\nAs the flows reached the lake, the water level rose, washing away dozens of salt mounds, said Babacar Ba, another miner who was trying to save his remaining mounds.\n\nAbdoulaye Faty, a hydrologist and lecturer at Dakar’s Cheikh Anta Diop University, told the Reuters news agency that rising water levels in surrounding plateaux naturally pooled into the low-lying lake.\n\nBecause the lake has received abundant flood water, it could have an effect on its salt content and colour, he added.\n\nWith a month to go before the end of Senegal’s June – October rainy season, other businesses around the lake, including restaurants and flat-bottom boat operators, who take tourists on tours of the lake, are counting their losses and worried about the future.\n\n“What appealed to visitors was the feeling of floating on the surface of the lake because of its salt content. Currently, no one can float here,” said Abdou Seye Dieng who runs a campsite on the shores.\n\nThe government has activated a national plan to help communities hit by perennial floods, and a mission from the Water and Sanitation Ministry is expected to visit the lake soon.",

    "Senegal - African Development Fund Replenishment Meeting: Delegates visit rice fields and interact with beneficiaries of projects financed by the Fund": "On Thursday, 15 September 2022, the farmers of the Baboulaye Valley in western Senegal welcomed special visitors. Delegates from the African Development Fund (ADF), the African Development Bank Group's concessional lending arm for the continent’s low-income countries, visited this agricultural plain in Diofior province, 150 km from the capital, Dakar.\n\nDelegates representing the Fund's development partners visited the rice fields in the Baboulaye Valley and engaged in lively discussion with the farmers and other beneficiaries of projects the Fund has financed.\n\nThe visit formed part of African Development Fund (ADF-16) replenishment meetings taking place in Dakar from the 15th to the 17th of September.\n\nLocated in the Sine Saloum, one of Senegal’s richest agricultural regions, much of the arable land in the Baboulaye valley nonetheless used to have a highly saline water table, which deprived the rural population of a primary source of subsistence.\n\nOn their way to meet farmers, delegates from the African Development Fund witnessed the results achieved in the fight against salt encroachment.\n\nAs their vehicles rolled along the nearly one-kilometer-long anti-salt dam, the visitors were struck by the lush green rice plots stretching as far as the eye could see. As a result of the separation of the salt strip from the farmlands, these soils, it was explained, had been entirely abandoned by farmers, depressed at not being able to work on them.\n\nYounoussa Mballo, coordinator of the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel, was the guide for the day. He explained the huge efforts that had been undertaken, with the help of partners such as the National Agency for Agricultural and Rural Consultancy, the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research, and the relevant government agencies, to reclaim these lands and anchor the farmers on the land. The African Development Fund financed the program.\n\n\"Before this Baboulaye Valley project, agricultural yields were around one tonne per hectare,\" he said. \"Following its implementation in 2011, it has increased to 3 tonnes per hectare and even 5 tonnes in some areas.\" The partnership with the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research has made it possible to develop the high-yielding ISRIZ10 rice variety that can adapt to salty soil.\"\n\nVeronika Baumgartner Putz, the Fund's delegate for Austria, said she was pleased \"to see what has been achieved on the ground and to see how the financing by the African Development Fund has been spent. Good partnerships and better project quality at entry help to build the sustainability of projects for the beneficiaries,\" she said.\n\nDelegates from China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States were also on the trip.\n\nFor Marie-Laure Akin-Olugbade, The Africa Development Bank’s Acting Vice President for Regional Development, Integration and Business Delivery, the field trip was an important moment in the relationship between the Bank Group, partners, and beneficiaries.\n\nA few hours later, the convoy entered the town of Diofior, for an exhibition of project beneficiaries’ goods, including rice, honey, local juices, textiles, flour products, handicrafts, and even solar-powered photovoltaic fiber equipment.\n\nThe provincial mayor, Youssou Diom and members of his municipal council and local farmers received the guests. \"Thanks to the efforts that have been made , 1,500 hectares of land are currently available for the population. This is an important step towards food self-sufficiency in our municipality,\" Diom said.\n\n\"The Baboulaye valley has become our granary,\" said Babou Gningue, a farmer who met the Fund delegates. \"The reclaimed land is now available for rainfed rice cultivation with a management system that allows for water retention for about three months,\" he explained.\n\nThe African Development Fund provides low-income African countries with grants, concessional loans, guarantees, and technical assistance. The aim is to reduce poverty and establish sustainable and inclusive development.",
    "What is Senegal’s best World Cup performance? Past records explored": "Senegal produced their best performance at a World Cup yet 20 years ago. Now, the West African nation will go to Qatar 2022 looking to better their result in Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga have only taken to the global stage on two occasions previously. But they will go to the first Fifa tournament held in the Middle East as the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions. Senegal won their first AFCON title in February at the 16th attempt.\n\nSenegal has often lived in the shadows of their West African rivals Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana. Yet Aliou Cisse now boasts a squad brimming with stars like Bayern Munich’s Sadio Mane, Kalidou Koulibaly of Chelsea, Watford ace Ismaila Sarr and Idrissa Gueye of Everton.\n\nPhoto by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn fact, Senegal earned a bye to the second round of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) qualifying route for the 2022 Qatar World Cup as the top-ranked African nation. Fifa had the Lions of Teranga 20th globally with Nigeria 33rd, Ghana 50th and Ivory Coast 57th.\n\nHow many times has Senegal qualified for the Fifa World Cup?\n\nCisse’s squad showed why they were the top-ranked African nation in the second round of the CAF qualifying campaign. Senegal secured the top spot in Group H with five wins and a draw. Their unbeaten run then led to pipping Egypt on penalties for a place at Qatar 2022.\n\nPhoto by SEYLLOU/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThis year’s tournament will also mark the first time that Senegal has played at successive World Cups. The Lions of Teranga first appeared at a Fifa event in 2002 in Japan and South Korea. But they would not return to the global stage before the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nIncluding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Senegal has attempted to reach 13 editions of the Fifa tournament. They also initially entered the qualifying stages for the 1966 and 1990 editions, but the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) withdrew its entry for those years.\n\nSo, the 1970 World Cup in Mexico was the first tournament that Senegal committed to try and qualify for. But it took them another 32 years before reaching a finals of the Fifa event. They did not submit an entry at any stage for any edition played between 1930 and 1962.\n\nWhat is Senegal’s best World Cup performance so far?\n\nSenegal would register their best performance at a World Cup yet in their maiden outing in 2002. The Lions of Teranga took to the global stage in Japan and South Korea and reached the quarter-finals. But they could not repeat their successes next time out at Russia 2018.\n\nCisse’s squad exited the last World Cup after the group stage by virtue of fair play points. They and Japan had identical records of one win, one draw, one defeat, four goals scored and four goals conceded. But the Samurai Blue had received fewer cautions than Senegal.\n\nSenegal were within a quarter of an hour of following Group H winners Colombia into the knockout stages in 2018. Jan Bednarek had Poland in front against Japan in their tie. But a late strike from Yerry Mina was enough for Los Cafeteros to beat the Lions of Teranga 1-0.\n\nNow, Senegal will head to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup hoping to register their new best performance at a Fifa tournament. Cisse’s side will face the Netherlands on November 21, the host nation on November 25 and round off Group A against Ecuador on November 29.\n\nPhoto credit should read JACQUES DEMARTHON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHow did Senegal reach the quarter-finals in Japan and South Korea?\n\nSenegal finished as runners-up to Denmark in Group A at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. They started the competition by stunning the defending champions France at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. Les Bleus also arrived in Asia as the No.1 ranked Fifa nation.\n\nPapa Bouba Diop scored the only goal in Seoul to kick off the 2002 edition. The fixture also served as the curtain raiser, with Fifa allocating the opening game to the defending World Cup holders from 1974 to 2002. The host nations have played in the first game since 2006.\n\nSenegal would follow up beating France by claiming a 1-1 draw with Denmark at the Daegu World Cup Stadium. Salif Diao scored his side’s equaliser in the 52nd minute after Jon Dahl Tomasson hit a first-half penalty. But the midfielder would later earn a second yellow card.\n\nIt meant Diao missed Senegal’s final Group A tie against Uruguay at the Suwon World Cup Stadium. But fortunately for the midfielder, it took La Celeste until the 88th minute to pull level and could not find a winner after a first-half Khalilou Fadiga penalty and a Diop brace.\n\nPhoto credit should read DAMIEN MEYER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn reward for advancing to the knockout stages at their first World Cup, Senegal earned a Round of 16 trip to the Big Eye Stadium in Oita to face Sweden. Yet Henrik Larsson put any hopes of a quarter-final place at risk when the Blagult legend scored after only 11 minutes.\n\nHenri Camara would come up with the goods to draw the Lions of Teranga level later on in the first-half. And it was the 99-cap striker, who had assisted twice in the 3-3 draw against Uruguay, who delivered 14 minutes into sudden death extra-time from Pape Thiaw’s pass.\n\nSenegal would take their quarter-final against Turkey to sudden death extra-time, as well, after a goalless stalemate through 90 minutes. But Ilhan Mansiz found the breakthrough for the Crescent Stars just four minutes after the restart to end the Lions of Teranga’s run.\n\nCisse will, no doubt, hope he can follow in Bruno Metsu’s shoes and see Senegal register a new best performance at a World Cup when they arrive in Qatar for the 2022 tournament.\n\nShow all\n\nIn other news, 'What did I learn': Arnold sends his Australia squad warning for World Cup",
    "Senegal's president: Africa not breeding ground for new Cold War": "African nations reject the West's attempt to impose its political will on them.\n\nSenegal's President Macky Sall. (Reuters)\n\nSince the start of of the war in Ukraine, NATO and countries led by Washington have been pressuring African countries to condone sanctions on Russia, condemn the latter, and isolate Moscow from the rest of the world. In this context, Africa has become a battleground for influence between world powers, which has led to heightened tensions on the continent.\n\nRead more: Ramaphosa, Biden talk after S. Africa abstained from UN Russia vote\n\nSpeaking to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday, Senegal's President Macky Sall asserted that Africa “does not want to be the breeding ground of a new Cold War.\n\n“I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of the burden of history; that it does not want to be the breeding ground of a new Cold War, but rather a pole of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis,\" Sall said.\n\n“We call for a de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine as well as for a negotiated solution to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict,'' he added.\n\nAlthough Washington has been attempting to pressure African nations into picking sides since February, that sort of pressure dates back way before the recent war, to the 2014 coup in Ukraine which was directed by US-backed forces.\n\nIn 2020, African nations imported $12.6 billion worth of Russian goods, including a crucial 30% of its total grain imports, fertilizers, and petroleum products. Commodities, however, have increased in prices due to the war and sanctions, which have exacerbated global inflation.\n\nRead more: Senegal: Russia economic isolation causing food insecurity in Africa\n\nLast week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa stressed that a new draft bill that Washington is looking into implementing would punish the entire continent of Africa. Rather than the sanctions being targeted toward Russia's activities in Ukraine, they're directed toward Russia's activities in Africa.\n\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Africa, attempting to persuade Pretoria to ditch the neutral stance toward the conflict. However, Naledi Pandor, South Africa's foreign minister, affirmed that “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine.”\n\nRead more: South Africa never forgets: Why Cape Town won't support Ukraine\n\nPandor proposed a diplomatic solution, that the United Nations should lead a diplomatic initiative between Russia and Ukraine to bring the conflict to a halt.\n\nMajor African countries like the Central African Republic and Mali have been growing frustrated with Western aid, and have been switching to Moscow instead. Western media has been acting aggressively, slamming African nations by accusing them of reeling in mercenaries and committing war crimes.\n\nSall told the UNGA that Africa is “a continent determined to work with all of its partners'' to address its needs, which include access to the basic necessities of modern life, such as electricity, medical care, and running water.\n\nThe West lost Africa through 'Cold War-esque' policies, liberalism\n\nThe West lost Africa through \"Cold War-esque\" policies on the continent, through forcing the liberal civilizational standards, in addition to US policies that have used Africa as a \"backyard\" to counter Russian and Chinese presence with no consideration for the welfare and interest of the African peoples, according to a Foreign Policy article in May.\n\nA Congress debate took place in April over a bill Washington would use to \"counter the malign influence and activities\" of Russia in Africa. The article draws on journalists' conclusions that US foreign policy, to a large extent, is fueled by geopolitical concerns and rivalry in Africa, mainly against Russia and China. The prosperity of Africans, on the other hand, falls irrelevant. The bill is just one of many others, and it has sparked fears of an escalation of a \"new Cold War\" among African observers.\n\nThe bill requires the regular identification of African governments and officials \"that have facilitated payments and other prohibited activities that benefit US-sanctioned individuals and entities tied to Russia.\" This could have punishing implications, such as sanctions against African nations choosing to buy Russian energy.\n\nRead next: Russia calls on Africa to demand lifting of anti-Moscow sanctions\n\nAttempts at imposing liberal systems of governance, furthermore, have also failed the continent, according to Ghanaian historian Samuel Adu-Gyamfi. Liberalism entails liberal capitalism, which has sunken the continent into severe poverty and debt. In Adu-Gyamfi's perception, the IMF and the World Bank have led to dire developmental setbacks in African countries. Many imported policies have hurt development, such as \"lockdowns, travel bans and vaccine mandates—pushed on Africa by Western-dominated institutions,\" as written in NewsAfrica.\n\nFrance, however, has been facing the reckoning of its colonial legacy - in Mali, Algeria, and beyond. Recently, Mali has taken the decision to expel French military presence from its land, particularly after finding mass graves near a French military post. After nine years of French military presence in Mali, which made the country suffer in the name of \"fighting terrorism,\" Paris received major backlash in addition to frustration and accusations of drone attacks and the murder of civilians.\n\nAll in all, the African continent is fed up with the West's projection of alliances and rivalry on them, taking the carrot and the stick foreign policy approach to sovereign decision-making. For decades, in Washington's foreign policy toward Africa, as FP columnist Howard French wrote, \"America’s concern with containing the spread of Chinese or Soviet influence overrode considerations of governance and democracy.\"",
    "Senegal: Civil society and human right defenders mobilize for a transparent election": "“As a human rights defender, it is important that we can help mobilise young people to become more involved in defending their civil and political rights,” said Jaly Badiane, a Senegalese human rights activist and blogger.\n\nBadiane was part of Senegal Vote, a “civi-tech” initiative that combined citizen engagement and the use of ICT to encourage participation in the country’s recent election especially among younger people. The initiative was led by Wa Mbedmi (“those in the street” in Wolof”) a non-profit entity created to contribute to the emergence of a participatory citizenship.\n\n\"As an associative and non-partisan entity, the Wa Mbedmi Association, which, works daily to promote the emergence of a citizen who is interested in public life, challenges those in power and engages in collaborative and community dynamics,” Badiane said. \"The goal of our citizen initiative is to make all relevant electoral information understandable, in a language that is accessible to a large number of citizen voters.”\n\nIndeed, in order to guarantee the fairness of the 2022 legislative election Senegal, human rights defenders, as well as members of civil society groups worked tirelessly to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections. One of those was the Women's Watch Platform for Peace and Security called Ëtu Jamm (Peace Space in Wolof), an election monitoring group composed of 50 Senegalese and pan-African women's civil society organisations, and coordinated by the NGO Femmes Africa Solidarité (FAS).",
    "Senegal: Rise in censorship and crackdown on expression": "ARTICLE 19 is deeply concerned by the crackdown on expression we have witnessed in Senegal in recent months. We call on the Senegalese authorities to repeal any laws criminalising protected speech and to release those detained for exercising their right to freedom of expression.\n\nOver the past few months, ARTICLE 19 has documented a number of attacks and infringements on the right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 10 June, 2022, Abdou Bara Dolly, a member of parliament, was arrested following critical remarks he made against President Macky Sall during a demonstration by the two coalitions of the opposition (Yewi Askan and Wallu) in Dakar. He was charged and placed under a detention order for the offences of insulting the head of state (article 80 of the penal code), dissemination of false news (article 255 of the penal code and defamation (article 258 du code penal). After almost a month in detention, Abdou Bara Dolly was finally granted provisional freedom on 8 July 2022 He remains at the disposal of the court for his trial.\n\nOn 3 August 2022, Pape Ibra Guèye, also known as Papito Kara, a social media activist, was arrested for the offence of disseminating false news, and for deletion, modification, fabrication and use of computer data to publish headlines from media outlets and newspapers before they were made public by the outlets. Press groups filed a complaint after the headlines were published on social media. He remains in detention.\n\nA few days later, activist Outmane Diagne was arrested and detained for spreading false news, and for deleting and modifying newspaper data. This happened after he shared the front pages of satirical newspapers on his Facebook page, along with 3 smiley face emojis.

The chilling and deterrent effect of these practices on activists, civil society organisations, the media, and others encourages self-censorship. The fundamental values of democracy and freedoms that the country has taken years to acquire must be preserved,” said David Diaz-Jogeix, Senior Director of Programmes at ARTICLE 19.\n\nARTICLE 19 reminds the Senegalese authorities of their obligation under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that ‘everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.\n\nARTICLE 19 further reminds the Senegalese authorities that restrictions on freedom of expression are permissible only if they comply strictly with the three-part test established under Article 19(3) of the ICCPR. They must meet the requirement of legality (which requires that the legal basis for the restriction be clear, accessible and predictable), pursue a legitimate aim, and be necessary and proportionate to achieving that aim.\n\nIn particular, the criminalisation of protected expression such as satire, criticism towards the State or public officials constitutes a violation of Article 19. In addition, the principle of proportionality mandates that criminalisation of speech always be an exceptional and last resort and that restrictions on the right to freedom of expression ‘must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve their protective function’ (Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 34, paragraph 34).\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nMaateuw Mbaye, Program Assistant, ARTICLE 19 Senegal/West Africa Email: [email protected] T: +221785958337\n\nAissata Diallo Dieng, Office Manager, ARTICLE 19 Senegal/West Africa Email: [email protected] T:+221338690322\n\nSenegal is ranked 50 out of 161 countries in the 2022 Global Expression Report – ARTICLE 19’s annual review of the state of freedom of expression and the right to information around the world.",

Mane – who left Liverpool in the summer after he scored 120 goals in 269 appearances - started brightly for Bayer Munich as he scored in four straight games at the beginning of the season.\n\nHowever, he is yet to find the back of the net for the Bavarians in their last six matches. The former Southampton forward has scored five goals in 11 matches in all competitions, but only three have come in the Bundesliga.\n\nHe has been mostly utilized as a centre-forward and at times on the left wing, and Lahm questions these positional changes for Mane.\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN SAID: \"Mane’s qualities are out of question,\" Lahm said, as quoted by Liverpool Echo. \"But it’s crucial that roles must be clearly assigned.\n\n\"I don’t see that at the moment. I currently don’t understand how the roles are defined. Everyone has to know what they have to do on the pitch.\"\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: In Bayern Munich’s 4-2-3-1 formation, Mane has mostly operated as a centre-forward and the only time he was not deployed as such was during the Uefa Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\nThen he took up a left-sided role, which he played most of the time when he was at Liverpool.\n\nMane’s recent struggles in Germany are a general reflection of the club; Bayern have now gone four matches without a win in the Bundesliga.\n\nLahm’s concerns come after Dietmar Hamann claimed Mane has not been integrated at Bayern.\n\nWHAT IS NEXT FOR MANE: Currently, he is with Senegal during the Fifa international break friendlies. He scored - his 34th goal for his country and his first goal since August - as Teranga Lions defeated Bolivia 2-0 in their first friendly.\n\nThey are set to face Iran on Tuesday in another pre-World Cup test match.

The EU’s energy commissioner dropped into Dakar earlier in the year.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda visited Senegal and fellow African hydrocarbons producers Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire in early September to discuss the energy crisis among other topics – Poland’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal has already received its first shipment of Nigerian LNG and is keen to secure future supply.\n\nSall, for his part, has been playing up Europe as a destination for LNG, noting that Senegal’s position at the western extremity of Africa puts it just a few days’ shipping time from European markets, while also suggesting there would be competition from Asian buyers.\n\nRelated article\n\nSall’s strategy pays off\n\nThis keen interest highlights the shrewdness of Sall’s decision to prioritise easier-to-fund and faster-to-build offshore hydrocarbon export developments over more costly large-scale projects with more onshore facilities and more early-stage gas going to the domestic market.\n\nBy agreeing to deals that kept the upfront operational and financial costs and risks to levels deemed acceptable for international oil companies (IOCs), Senegal is now on course to be a gas exporter by 2023, with enough production to serve markets abroad and at home for decades if demand holds up.\n\nThat would be just eight years after commercial gas reserves were discovered in Senegalese waters – a fast turnaround in the context of African hydrocarbons projects. The norm on the continent is years of delays to projects due to financial disagreements and political uncertainties, especially in states such as Senegal with no track record of oil and gas production.\n\nSenegal’s history of political and economic stability and good international relations along with Sall’s background as a geological engineer with hands-on experience of the hydrocarbons industry have all played their part in smoothing the way for gas development.\n\nRelated article\n\nFirst gas production due in 2023\n\nSenegal’s first exports will come from reserves straddling the maritime border with Mauritania in deep water. These are being developed on behalf of both countries by BP and its partner Kosmos Energy in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin (GTA) project, the product of successful cooperation between two politically, culturally and economically distinct neighbouring countries.\n\nFor Phase 1 of the project, BP is using a 2.5m tonnes/year floating LNG production facility, which is fed by pipeline from a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) over the field. Most of this output will go for export. The field has an estimated gas production potential of around 15 trillion cubic feet – enough for at least 30 years of production, according to BP.\n\nDespite Covid-related construction delays for the FPSO, which is being built by Cosco in China under contract to Technip, first production is still expected by end-2023.\n\nA final investment decision on developing Phase 2 of the project is due before the end of 2022. The concept for that has yet to be finalised, but it could be another similar-sized floating LNG (FLNG) project.\n\nRelated article\n\nSenegal also has another commercial find further south, entirely in its own waters, called Yakaar-Teranga, which is also being developed by BP and Kosmos. This find is estimated to hold around 20 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nIt is with Yakaar-Teranga that the economic boost for Senegal beyond the impact of export revenues will kick in. President Sall has said around half of production from the development would go to the domestic market as feedstock for power stations, fertiliser and ammonia plants and other industries, with the rest going for export.\n\nA final investment decision for Yakaar-Teranga is also expected in the next few months with production possible by 2024, potentially using a similar set up of FPSO and FLNG vessel as deployed at GTA, with the addition of a gas pipeline to shore to serve domestic customers.\n\nIn addition to the gas developments, Senegal is also set to become an oil producer. Australia’s Woodside is due to start production in 2023 from a 100,000 barrels/day FPSO on the Sangomar field, 100km offshore from the capital Dakar. A second phase of that project, which is likely to be of a similar size and cost around $2.5bn, is planned, though no development timetable has been published yet.\n\nRelated article\n\nFuture challenges\n\nWhile the short-term prospects for hydrocarbons exports are positive, due to the impact of the Ukraine war on global supply, the risk remains that that freshly discovered reserves in Senegal and elsewhere may be not be exploited to their full potential if global fossil fuel demand falls in the next 10-20 years.\n\nSall, who is the current chairperson of the African Union under a rotating system, is one of several African leaders calling for natural gas to be regarded as a legitimate transition fuel for African nations.\n\nDespite the progress with Senegal’s hydrocarbon’s projects and a buoyant global energy market for producers, it hasn’t been plain sailing for Sall at home. The government has been criticised by international non-governmental organisations and opposition parties for a lack of transparency in drawing up some oil and gas contracts with foreign firms in the past.\n\nSall’s ruling coalition is less popular at the polls than it was, winning only a narrow victory in legislative elections in August 2022, against a backdrop of economic adversity for many Senegalese due to the impact of the Covid pandemic and high fuel prices, as well as accusations that opposition politicians are being muzzled.\n\nThere is also concern that Sall has yet to rule out standing for a third time in presidential elections in 2024, despite a two-term limit under the existing constitution. However, the risk of losing, given the opposition’s growing electoral strength, may yet deter him, according to regional analysts.\n\nBut whoever is president after the next election should have access to the country’s first oil and gas revenues to bolster opportunities for economic growth.",

    "From using broken boards to chasing Paris 2024: Meet Senegal’s top surfer Cherif Fall": "The towering Cherif Fall is a giant in the ocean.\n\nStanding at nearly two metres in height, the Senegalese surfer is fervently riding waves as he seeks his big break – becoming the first sub-Saharan African to qualify for the Olympics. His mission is to get a spot for Paris 2024.\n\nA dream that was nurtured by broken surfboards left behind by tourists on the wave-rich ocean banks near his home in Dakar.\n\nFall took up the sport at age 11 against his parents' wishes and has risen to become a nine-time national surfing champion.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who looks up to his friend and hero Italo Ferrera, leads a crop of talented surfers from the West African nation who are inspiring youngsters and driving the sport’s popularity.\n\n“I learnt how to surf using broken surf boards that surfers, mainly tourists who came surfing, would leave on the beach. That’s how I learned to surf,” Fall said in an interview with Olympics.com from California where had a training stint.\n\nCherif will represent Senegal at the 2022 ISA World Surfing Games in Huntington Beach, California, between 16 - 24 September.\n\n2022 ISA World Surfing Games: Preview, schedule, key athletes and how to watch\n\nSenegalese surfer Cherif Fall (Photo by Nicole Sweet) Picture by Credit: Nicole Sweet\n\nCherif Fall: The making of a Senegalese pro surfer\n\nGrowing up near one of Dakar’s several fishing villages along the Senegalese coastline, Fall would spend most of his days on the ocean banks.\n\nWhenever he went swimming with his friends, he noticed planks of broken surf boards left behind by tourists. He decided to play around with them chasing waves, and he got hooked.\n\n“My family lived close to the beach in Dakar, and after school, I always went to the beach to swim. And sometimes my mum would take me with her when she was going to clean the fish at the beach.”\n\nHis decision to pursue this sport looked unusual in a country where young boys are mainly engaged in football, wrestling or basketball. Cherif's parents were also reluctant to allow their son take up surfing.\n\n“I began surfing with the broken boards with my brother, but he stopped. However I kept on, though it was difficult concentrating in school once I picked surfing. Training affected my studies and I didn’t get good results in school. I remember saying I wanted to be a pro-surfer and be one of the best in Dakar…it made my dad a little bit mad,” he recalled.\n\n“But I kept on as my goal was to learn surfing. My dad even bought me my first board… I was so excited when he did this. Then I went on to win my first contest in 2013. Since then, I have been the national champion.”\n\nThe wave-rich setting helped hone Fall’s surfing skills and now he proudly leads the new generation of Senegalese surfers, enjoying the momentum of the swells as the vibrant city looks to host the Youth Olympics Games in 2026.\n\nSenegal is blessed with a variety of surf hotspots with powerful waves along the sweeping 724km coastline on the North Atlantic Ocean: Yoff, Les Almadies and N’gor Island in Dakar are some of the popular surf breaks.\n\nYoung surfers in Dakar, Senegal: (Photo by Nicole Sweet) Picture by USA TODAY Sports\n\nCherif Fall: Constantly battling to to survive rough waves off the ocean\n\nThe 25-year-old has since stepped up a gear managing to compete around the world, proving the naysayers wrong. He no longer struggles with equipment, and he even boasts a new sponsor, Billabong, a brand that supports several leading pro-surfers.\n\nFall made his international debut at the Airwalk pro junior in France in 2015 and has since represented his west African nation in several competitions in Europe and the U.S., and most importantly he made sure the green-red-yellow-flag flew at the ISA World Games.\n\nBut it is not always easy working your way up as a surfer from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n“A surfer in Senegal cannot always count on government support. They mainly support us when we go to represent the country at major events like the World Championships or the World Surfing Games. But they don’t support us to other events which are necessary for our build-up.\n\n“I think this is one reason why it’s hard to find African surfers competing in many events. We need not only government support, but we also need visas to travel to most of the events in Europe or USA, and sometimes they only inform us at the last minute that they are not going to grant us visas.”\n\nFall constantly finds himself fighting tirelessly for resources and opportunities, concerns that easily discourage other talented upcoming surfers in Africa.\n\n“People now know Surf Senegal because of me and a few others, as we compete in contests in Europe, Japan, France…but we are not many. There’s like two black surfers, there is me and Michael February from South Africa.”\n\nDespite the difficulties, Dakar remains the centre of Senegalese surf culture.\n\nThe sport is growing across age groups and the small achievements of experienced surfers like Fall have been a huge boost.\n\n“Most people in Senegal know me,” he admits, elaborating on his motivation to not only become the best surfers out of his nation. His ultimate goal - he says - is to have youngsters fall in love with the sport.\n\n“Now so many kids come to do surfing because they see me doing surfing. As a Muslim country we don’t drink (alcohol) and so surfing is a good past time. The kids watch me, and they see my building my profile from surfing. They see me traveling, competing with the best surfers in the world.\n\n“It is the dream for all these kids who see me surfing… and that's why I am always positive and wanting to go up and learn more. When I see kids (surfing) it’s enough to keep me motivated because they appreciate what I'm doing.”\n\nOlympic champ Italo Ferreira's visit to Dakar inspiring a new generation of surfers\n\nThe Senegalese surfing scene got additional visibilty with when Ferreira, the newly crowned gold medallist from surfing’s Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, visited the capital last season (2021) and sampled theTeranga waves.\n\n“It was unbelievable when Italo with the help of Billabong came to Senegal. It was good for me, my country, and all the kids learning surfing and all those teaching surfing here. Now in Senegal when the kids look for the top surfers to follow they watch Italo.”\n\nThe Brazilian’s visit also fueled Fall’s ambitions.\n\nHe begins the chase at the ISA World Surfing Games in California, the first stop in Olympic qualification for the Paris Games.\n\n“My dream is to qualify for the Olympics and the World Tour before the end of my career. These are the two things I want most and I am working hard to make it happen,” the 25-year-old said as he explained his desire to face Olympic-class challenge at Paris 2024 in Teahupo’o.\n\n“The Olympics has been my goal for a long time. The last time I went to El Salvador, and I was chasing qualification and I didn’t qualify, I felt so sad. I was the surf champion in Senegal and couldn't qualify, I cried. Now I am trying to push more and work hard.\n\n“We have so many good surfers in Senegal and it’s possible for us to qualify (more than one) for the Olympics. The only thing we need is to go and surf more outside of Senegal, where there are more pro-suffers and we compete with them and learn from them. We need to ride other waves (outside of Senegal), ride other stronger waves, and also see how other surfers ride those waves.”\n\nCheriff Fall training at the Huntington Beach Pie in California. Picture by nicole sweet\n\nThe towering athlete is blazing the trail in the local surfing scene and having an impact on the youngsters.\n\nFall is also brimming with talent to back up his passion: he is a powerful ripper with an outstanding big air reverse.\n\n“I'm different from all the surfers in the world. All the time I do big air reverse. I’m tall and most of the surfers in the world aren’t so tall. It’s different when a surfer is tall. It’s like a surfer is as big as the waves.”\n\nBut it’s not just about chasing the swells but the power he gets from the ocean.\n\n“I have so much love for surfing. Surfing gives me motivation even for life…nothing is easy in life. When you achieve your surfing goals, (it feels like) everything is going to be easy.\"",
