Power and water cuts are common. Anti-army protests have rocked the streets since a coup a year ago.\n\nFollowing the military takeover, which toppled a civilian-led government that had promised a new economic dawn, the number of those leaving has accelerated, travel agents and migrants say.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEgypt, already home to a Sudanese community estimated at 4 million, offers few of the lucrative jobs that Sudanese migrants have traditionally sought in the Gulf, but it is an easier and often more familiar destination.\n\nAnd while some do travel onward on treacherous Mediterranean trips to Europe, Egypt has notable advantages.\n\nYoung Sudanese can travel there cheaply and hunt for work, while families seek healthcare, education for their children and a stable life.\n\n\"All us young people want to build a future, but you can't do that here,\" said Munzir Mohamed, a 21-year-old trying to book a bus trip to Egypt at one of the travel agencies.\n\nThe owner of a Khartoum bus company said as many as 30 buses were taking around 1,500 passengers to Egypt from Sudan daily, which he said was up 50% from last year, despite sharp ticket price increases. Two travel agents estimated the number of young men seeking to make the journey had doubled in the last year.\n\nThere are no publicly available figures to show recent migration trends from Sudan to Egypt. But an Egyptian diplomat said numbers travelling had been on the rise since 2019, when an uprising led to the overthrow of former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.\n\n\"Movement of Sudanese people into Egypt has been increasing ... gradually and proportional to the deterioration of the situation in Sudan,\" he said.\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nIn al-Souq al-Arabi, labourers, electricians, and others who would typically be at building sites idle away the time drinking tea and playing board games while they wait for work.\n\n\"We used to hope for five minutes to take a seat. Now I'm sat here all day,\" said the owner of one hardware store still operating in the market.\n\nMuch of the paltry income that shopkeepers and stall-holders can still make goes to higher taxes, dues, and license fees introduced by a government that lost billions in external economic support after the coup, they say.\n\nThe finance minister, Jibril Ibrahim, said on Sunday the country would rely on its own internal resources for a second year to fund the budget, despite the government struggling to provide basic services.\n\nTaxes and fees have risen by 400% or more in some instances, business owners say.\n\n1/6 People wait for the a before leaving to Egypt in Khartoum, Sudan September 24, 2022.

But they have a community to lean on, and can earn more than at home.\n\n\"My whole family in Sudan worked and we still weren't making much, and it would all go towards food,\" said 23-year-old Malaz Abbakar, who moved to Egypt two years ago.\n\nNow, she says, she's able to send her family up to 120,000 Sudanese pounds ($208) per month working as a babysitter.\n\nStores selling Sudanese foods have cropped up in Cairo, private schools advertise Egyptian branches on billboards in Khartoum, and many travel to Egypt for healthcare that's become expensive or unavailable back home.\n\nFor some, like 23-year-old Adam from war-stricken Darfur, Egypt is a stopover before the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe.\n\n\"It's dangerous but it's better to risk it and have a good life than to suffer in poverty and hopelessness,\" he said as he queued for a visa at the Egyptian consulate in Khartoum, along with dozens of other would-be migrants.\n\n($1 = 578.00 Sudanese pounds)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nAdditional reporting by Eltayeb Siddig and Hadeer Mahmoud; writing by Nafisa Eltahir; editing by Aidan Lewis and Frank Jack Daniel\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "The Egyptian economy is a time bomb waiting to explode": "Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait has told Bloomberg said that his country will not get a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) until after one or two months. The current alternative for Egypt is to resort to countries such as China and Japan to get a \"soft loan\".\n\nLast month, Reuters published an analysis of the troubled economic situation in Sri Lanka, after it had been declared to be bankrupt; the fleeing of the now former president; and the people's storming of the presidential palace. The analysis confirmed Sri Lanka's need for a new loan from the IMF as a temporary solution, but it would not get it before heading to countries such as China and Japan to get soft loans.\n\nIn the past few months, the Sri Lankan scenario has become a nightmare for the Egyptian regime and its troubled media, since the images of popular anger, the storming of the presidential palace and pursuit of officials in the streets have rung alarm bells in Egypt. The regime of Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has drowned the country with foreign debt, putting Egypt among the worst countries in the world for issuing sovereign debt, according to a report by S&P Global Ratings.\n\nIndeed, estimates by Egyptian economic experts place the total Egyptian public debt at 130 per cent of the country's GDP. This is very similar to the equivalent figures in Sri Lanka — where it is 140 per cent — which prompted the IMF to demand Sri Lanka's new government to reduce it to less than 100 per cent before it will grant new loans.\n\nOPINION: The Egyptian economy is in danger and people cannot eat, says ex-media CEO\n\nThe real problem facing the Egyptian regime now is having to go again to a country like China to get soft loans. China adopts a hidden loan policy in such situations. It does not declare the details of such loans except within government data. The system works by taking over sovereign assets in debtor countries in return for setting a concessional rescheduling of the debts. This is what Beijing did in Sri Lanka, where it took control of its main port on the Indian Ocean after the government failed to repay the $307 million construction loan.\n\nThe same thing was repeated in Zambia, where China took over the main hydroelectric power station and 60 per cent of Zambia's state radio station. Likewise, China is now planning to take over the port of Mombasa after Kenya failed to repay its debt to Beijing.\n\nDomestically, the Egyptian regime is trying to promote the narrative that the world is suffering from severe economic crises due to Russia's war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic. In theory, this may sound reasonable, but the reality is that the regime has not provided any real relief and support to citizens as many other countries have done over the past two years. On the contrary, the Egyptian Ministry of Finance announced that it has collected about a trillion Egyptian pounds from taxpayers, which is equivalent to 70 per cent of the state budget. Before that, the ministry also announced that the total money transfers from Egyptians living abroad amounted to $31 billion, an amount higher than the revenues of both the Suez Canal and the tourism sector this year.\n\nREAD: Egypt's ready-made garment exports up 35%\n\nSomewhat disastrously, Maait has said that the state will use these funds to pay off its debts due by the end of this year. This reflects a general policy adopted by the regime, where a similar thing was said by the Minister of Transport, Kamel Al-Wazir, on television last month; the government will raise the price of train and metro tickets to pay its outstanding debts.\n\nDuring my own television programme, I asked the audience about their debts, and within a few minutes the production team received details of nearly one million Egyptian pounds owed by just twenty citizens in different professions. They are trapped in a vicious cycle of endless debt.\n\nThe Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics published official figures last year showing that over 50 per cent of Egyptian families resort to debt to cover their daily needs. Another report published by the Arab Barometer Network affirmed that Egypt was the top among Arab countries, with 80 per cent, where citizens have no money to buy food when their monthly income runs out. The report also showed that Egypt occupies first place in the Arab world in terms of citizens' concerns about not being able to buy enough food and drink.\n\nWith such devastating statistics, the Egyptian economy is a time bomb waiting to explode under Al-Sisi and his regime. When it happens, it won't be due to a political or ideological movement; it will be an angry popular explosion by citizens seeking a way of out poverty and hunger.\n\nOPINION: A former Egyptian presidential candidate fears for his life after cyberattacks\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",

    "Egyptian cleric revered by Muslim Brotherhood dies at 96": "Youssef al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian cleric seen as the spiritual leader of the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood, has died at the age of 96\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- Youssef al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian cleric who was seen as the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and became the Islamist “voice of revolution” during the popular uprisings around the Arab world more than a decade ago, died Monday at the age of 96.\n\nAl-Qaradawi, whose death was reported on his official website, was central in shaping the Brotherhood’s ideology in the 1990s and 2000s of using democratic means to achieve their goal of Islamic rule in Egypt and other nations. His critics accused him — and the Brotherhood — of hiding extremism behind moderate rhetoric.\n\nThat ideology was tested on the ground in the Arab Spring revolts of 2011, when Egypt’s longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak was ousted — and ended disastrously.\n\nThe Brotherhood came to power in subsequent elections, the freest ever held in Egypt. But Brotherhood moves fueled opponents’ fears that the group aimed to monopolize power. After giant protests, the army ousted the Brotherhood in 2013 and crushed it in a bloody crackdown. The ensuing rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has been criticized by rights groups as more autocratic than Mubarak’s.\n\nAl-Qaradawi died in the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar, where he had been living in exile for decades and was supported by the ruling family. In 2013, he was tried and sentenced to death in absentia in Egypt.\n\nAl-Qaradawi’s high point came in February 2011, days after Mubarak’s ouster. He made a triumphant return to Egypt and gave a speech to a gigantic crowd in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the anti-Mubarak protests.\n\n“The revolution is not over until we have a new Egypt,” he said, calling for a purging of Mubarak-era corruption and urging Copts and Muslims to remain united as they had been during protests.\n\nIt was a speech that avoided strong shows of Islamist or Brotherhood rhetoric. Still, many secular pro-democracy advocates saw his appearance in the square as symbolizing Islamists’ moves to dominate the uprising and claim it in their own name.\n\nAl-Qaradawi had been in the public eye since the 1990s as a pioneer among Muslim clerics of using then-newly emerging satellite TV to project their voice regionwide.\n\nHe had a popular talk show on the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera network called “Shariah and Life,” in which he took calls from across the Muslim world and offered advice on everything from mundane aspects of daily life to controversial political issues. He presented himself as an international, independent alternative to leading Muslim clerics in Arab countries who were usually dominated by their governments — though critics accused him of being a tool of Qatar.\n\nHe supported suicide bombings and other attacks by Palestinians against Israel. He also voiced support for the Iraqi insurgency against the U.S. presence in Iraq after the 2003 invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nHe had strongly criticized the U.S.-led invasion, calling on all Muslim nations at the time to prepare to fight the Americans there “if the Iraqis fail to drive them out.”\n\n“By opening our ports, our airports and our land, we are participating in the war,” al-Qaradawi said in a pointed critique of U.S.-allied Arab governments. “We will be cursed by history because we have helped the Americans.” Notably, Qatar hosts American troops and now serves as the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command.\n\nBut al-Qaradawi described his own thought as “al-wasatiya,” meaning a middle path — conservative but not rigid or extremist, as he depicted it. That earned him many admirers across the Arab and Islamic world, even among some liberals.\n\nHe was sharply critical of Arab regimes but said he opposed violence in overthrowing them, to distinguish himself from radical organizations like al-Qaida — though he was often reluctant to outright condemn militant groups.\n\nThroughout, he was close to the Brotherhood.\n\nAl-Qaradawi was born on Sept. 9, 1926 in a small village in Egypt’s Nile Delta. He studied at Egypt’s Al-Azhar University, the leading center of Sunni Muslim scholarship, and became involved with the Brotherhood.\n\nHe fled to Qatar in the early 1960s, when then-president Gamal Abdel Nasser waged a fierce crackdown on the group. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2005 published by WikiLeaks said Qatar, a strong backer of the Brotherhood, gave al-Qaradawi “substantial properties\" and income.\n\nWhen the wave of “Arab Spring” protests began in late 2010 in Tunisia and intensified in 2011, al-Qaradawi threw his support behind them, criticizing clerics who called for obedience to rulers.\n\nHe raised controversy by calling for the killing of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and by backing NATO’s intervention in Libya in 2011 in support of rebels. Gadhafi was eventually ousted and killed.\n\nAl-Qaradawi also painted the civil war in Syria in starkly sectarian terms, despite his past call for better Sunni-Shiite relations. In a 2013 speech, he said Shiites — Iran and Hezbollah backing President Bashar Assad — were waging a “war against Islam and the Sunnah.” He urged “all those capable of Jihad and fighting” to travel to Syria — seen as encouraging young Muslims to join militant groups in Syria.\n\nIn Egypt, al-Qaradawi threw his weight fully behind the Brotherhood-led government, headed by a veteran of the group, Mohammed Morsi. He called Morsi’s election “a victory for the revolution” and said he would achieve “justice, freedom and human dignity.”\n\nAs opposition to Morsi and the Brotherhood swelled, he said protests against them were forbidden, insisting Morsi was the “legitimate” ruler and that the people should obey him. Al-Qaradawi's son, Abdel-Rahman, criticized his backing of Morsi.\n\nThe military’s ouster of the government was followed by a crackdown in which hundreds of Brotherhood members were killed and thousands arrested.\n\nEgypt banned the Brotherhood as a terrorist group. Ahmed Mussa, a prominent pro-government TV host, called al-Qaradawi “the biggest inciter of terrorism” and blamed him for attacks inside Egypt. Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates included al-Qaradawi on a list of dozens of organizations and individuals sanctioned for alleged terrorism in 2017 as part of a diplomatic dispute with Qatar.\n\n———\n\nKrauss reported from Ottawa, Ontario; Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.",
    "Egypt: Human rights crisis deepens one year after national human rights strategy launched": "Authorities in Egypt have shown no genuine will to acknowledge, let alone address, the country’s deep-rooted human rights crisis despite launching a National Human Rights Strategy one year ago. Instead, they have continued to stifle freedoms and commit crimes under international law in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), said Amnesty International today.\n\nIn a new report “Disconnected from Reality”: Egypt’s National Human Rights Strategy covers up human rights crisis, Amnesty International presents a detailed analysis of the strategy in light of the human rights situation on the ground, revealing how authorities have used it as a propaganda tool to conceal ever growing repression of any form of dissent ahead of COP27 in November 2022.\n\n“Egyptian authorities have created the National Human Rights Strategy as a shiny cover-up to their unrelenting violations of human rights, thinking they would fool the world ahead of COP27. But the grim reality of their notorious human rights record cannot be rebranded in a PR stunt,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.\n\n“The international community must not be deceived by Egypt’s attempts to conceal the magnitude of the human rights crisis in the country. It must instead put pressure on the Egyptian authorities in public and in private, to take meaningful steps to end the cycle of abuse and impunity, starting by releasing the thousands of critics and opponents arbitrarily detained in Egyptian jails, easing their grip of civil society and allowing peaceful protests.”\n\nAmnesty International’s new report is based on extensive documentation of patterns of human rights violations committed in Egypt since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power, as well as information gathered since the launch of the National Human Rights Strategy (NHRS) from multiple sources, including victims, witnesses, human rights defenders and lawyers. The organization also reviewed official documents, audio-visual evidence, and reports by UN bodies among others. Findings and recommendations were shared with the Egyptian authorities on 7 September 2022.\n\n©Andeel, licensed from the first publisher Mada Masr Illustration depicting the surrealism of Egypt’s cover-up of human rights crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nA misleading picture\n\nSince the launch of the NHRS, the Egyptian authorities have repeatedly referred to it in public and in private meetings with other governments as evidence of their commitment to human rights. The five-year strategy was drafted by the government without any consultation with independent human rights organizations or public engagement and presented a deeply misleading picture of the human rights crisis in Egypt. It absolves the authorities of any responsibility by blaming security threats, economic challenges and Egyptian citizens themselves for “failing to understand” and exercise their rights.\n\nThe strategy lauds the constitutional and legal framework, while ignoring the authorities’ introduction and application of a series of repressive laws that effectively criminalize or severely restrict the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. These laws further eroded guarantees of fair trial, and entrenched impunity for security and military forces.\n\nThe strategy also ignores the authorities’ dismal record since July 2013 of cracking down on dissent, with thousands still arbitrarily detained or unjustly prosecuted. In the past two years alone, dozens have died in prison following deliberate denial of healthcare and detention in cruel and inhuman conditions.\n\nIn recent months, in a positive but very limited step, dozens of prisoners of conscience and others held for political reasons have been released. However, the authorities continue to arbitrarily arrest scores of other critics and opponents, while many of those released are banned from travel.\n\nSince 2013, authorities have also censored hundreds of websites, raided and closed independent media outlets and detained dozens of journalists for expressing critical views or simply doing their jobs.\n\nThe NHRS praises the State’s commitment to “the principles of equality and non-discrimination” and lists some initiatives by official bodies. Amnesty International has found that authorities continue to subject men, women and children to human rights violations on the basis of their sex, gender identity, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.\n\n“No strategy will protect our right to freedom of expression or achieve peaceful coexistence of people unless it frees all the people who are imprisoned because of their opinion, because of ideas they expressed and because they had a different narrative than that imposed by the State,” said prominent human rights activist Mona Seif to Amnesty International. Her brother Alaa Abdelfattah has been arbitrarily imprisoned for the majority of Egyptian President Abel Fattah al-Sisi’s rule.\n\nThe NHRS overplays the government’s self-declared achievements on socio-economic rights that are in sharp contrast not only with the authorities’ failure to progressively realize these rights, but also with their unrelenting attacks on those expressing their socio-economic grievances, including workers, medical professionals and residents of informal settlements.\n\nOverall, the NHRS also overstates constitutional and legal guarantees but fails to explain how these are not in line with Egypt’s international obligations or how they are widely flouted in practice. It completely overlooks patterns of ongoing or past human rights violations and ignores the role of security forces, prosecutors and judges, in committing or facilitating human rights violations.\n\nAmnesty International welcomes some of the NHRS modest recommendations, presented as “target results”, including the review of crimes punishable by the death penalty and alternatives to pretrial detention as well as the introduction of comprehensive legislation to combat violence against women. However, overall its “target results” don’t begin to address the scale of the human rights and impunity crisis in the country. Meaningful advancement of human rights in Egypt must start with authorities releasing the thousands of people arbitrarily detained for peacefully exercising their human rights. All politically motivated criminal investigations against human rights defenders must be closed and all travel bans, asset freezes and other restrictions must be lifted. Criminal investigations into crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by security forces must be initiated, with the view to bringing those responsible to justice. These include unlawful killings of hundreds of protestors and extrajudicial executions, torture, and enforced disappearances.\n\n“President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi must acknowledge the depth of the human rights crisis, for which his government is responsible, and take concrete action to resolve it. Given the depth of the human rights and impunity crisis and lack of political will to reverse course, the international community must support efforts to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism on the human rights situation in Egypt at the UN Human Rights Council,” said Agnès Callamard.\n\nBackground\n\nEgypt is set to host the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh in November. Environmental and human rights groups have raised concerns about limiting protests to “designated areas” and the ability of the Egyptian civil society to meaningfully participate without fear of reprisals.",
    "Egypt celebrates 200 years of decoding ancient hieroglyphs": "A rubbing of Rosetta Stone Photo: VCG\n\nMarking the decoding of ancient hieroglyphs and the founding of Egyptology 200 years ago, a series of events are being organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC) in Cairo wrapped up its two-day program last weekend for teaching children about the Ancient Egyptian language via sculpture and buff paints workshops.Sama Ahmad, a 10-year-old student from Egypt, joined the interactive classes and portrayed some symbols of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the formal writing system used in ancient Egypt.\"I was happy to learn about old letters and to listen to information about the Rosetta Stone,\" she said while showing a paper carrying her name in the ancient language.The ministry also launched a social media campaign to explain hieroglyphs as well as to display artifacts that are key to understanding ancient Egyptian civilization under the titles \"Ancient Egyptian language,\" and \"Learn about treasures in your province.\"The Rosetta Stone is one of the main keys that helped to decipher the ancient Egyptian language and is the genesis of Egyptology.On display at the British Museum, the granodiorite block was discovered in 1799 in the Nile delta town of Rosetta (Rashid in Arabic) by the occupying French forces. Later it fell into the hands of British officials and was sent to London.On September 27, 1822, French scholar Jean-Francois Champollion was able to unravel the mystery of the stone and read the ancient Egyptian signs correctly after decades of attempts by scholars and researchers.The stone dates back to 196 BC, when the syndicate of Egyptian priests gave a congratulatory speech to King Ptolemy V for assuming the throne of Egypt, thanking him for exempting all Egyptian temples from taxes due to a low flood.Now the replica of the stone is fixed at the entrance lobby of the NMEC, which is inscribed in three languages: hieroglyphic, demotic and ancient Greek.\"Visitors coming from the gate of the museum can spot it from a far distance till approaching it and reading the label underneath,\" said Sayed Fadel, supervisor of scenario display of the NMEC.The 200 anniversary of the creation of Egyptology is a good occasion for displaying the block, added Fadel, as he further stressed \"thanks to decoding the stone, we managed to read texts, paintings and inscriptions on Egyptian temples that narrate the old history of Egypt.\"He explained that the stone exhibited in London is one of six others that were placed in front of main Egyptian temples, but the other five have not been discovered yet.Emili Jones, a 32-year-old tourist from Canada, was curious about the stone. She told the Xinhua News Agency that \"the stone is a treasure of knowledge for exploring and digging into the mysterious history of Ancient Egypt.\"Xinhua",

Current challenges, he continued, threaten the very notion of nation-states, leading to a lack of respect, and the weakening of State entities, which allows non-State terrorists to control the destiny of nations.\n\nSupport for global food security\n\nThe food crisis faced by Africa, claimed Mr. Selim, is the consequences of many years in which there has been a failure to hit the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to hunger and food security.\n\nWith one in five Africans at risk of hunger, and the Continent a net importer of food, declared Mr. Selim, the crisis needs to be addressed through an international strategy that tackles its root causes.\n\nSolutions include the implementation of sustainable farming and food systems that meet the needs of people in food importing African countries whose products, he declared, must allowed to be a part of the global supply chain without hindrance.\n\nMr. Selim offered Egypt’s support in the creation of an international hub in the country, for the storing, supplying, and trading of grain, to guarantee global food security.\n\nDeveloping countries ‘most deserving of our support’\n\nTurning to the climate crisis, Mr. Selim noted that Egypt will take on the presidency of the COP27 UN Climate Conference, which will be held in the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh this November.\n\nHe appealed to all members of the international community to act on the pledges and commitments of support for developing countries, to cope with the devastation impacts of the emergency. “They are the most deserving of our support,” he said.\n\nThe Minister looked forward to the Conference reaching outcomes that will contribute to a reduction in emissions, and enhanced mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage commitments. He reminded the audience that finance for adaptation needs to be doubled, that the $100 billion promised for climate finance annually must be duly delivered, and that there must be a just transition to renewable energy.\n\nThe implementation of the 2015 Paris climate accord would demonstrate, said Mr. Selim, that climate action remains an important priority on the global scene, despite the challenges facing the world.\n\nNile ‘always part of Egypt’s history’\n\nOn water security, Mr. Selim described the issue as one of those challenges, especially for Middle East and African countries. Many of those countries, he explained, are dry and arid, but the grave human suffering resulting from water shortages, he claimed, is often due to a lack of respect for international law, with some countries monopolizing water resources, to the detriment of nations downstream.\n\nWith regards to the Nile, Mr. Selima declared that, whilst Egypt recognizes the right of the Ethiopian people to development, this will never mean that the country lets go of the right of Egyptians to the river’s water, which has, he said, always been part of Egypt’s history.\n\nA legally binding agreement regarding the functioning of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam must be reached, said the Minister, in line with an agreement reached by Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan in 2015, and a 2021 Security Council resolution. He called on all three States to respect their obligations in deeds, not word.\n\n",
    "Cabinet denies sale of Egyptian ports to foreign parties": "The Cabinet Media Center on Monday reported rumors spread online regarding the sale of Egyptian ports to foreign parties.\n\nThe media center contacted the Ministry of Transport which completely denied the news, the center said in a statement.\n\nEgyptian ports will remain fully owned by the state and subject to Egyptian sovereignty, the statement added.\n\nThe establishment and development of the projects of the Ministry of Transport, including maritime transport projects at seaports, are carried out by national Egyptian companies, with the help of foreign expertise in the field of superstructure such as as modern equipment, information technology, and management and operating systems, the statement said.\n\nThe ministry uses specialized operators, and seeks to attract international shipping lines to settle its business in Egypt.\n\nIt manages some terminals in ports for a specified period, after which all the superstructure provided by the investor goes to the state, as is currently happening in the ports of Alexandria, Dekheila, Damietta, Safaga and Ain Sukhna, according to the statement.\n\nThe state retains the ownership of the infrastructure and all assets such as facilities, docks, stations, equipment and mobile units.\n\nThe government seeks to attract more foreign investments in developing Egyptian ports under a reform plan to turn Egypt into a global hub for trade and logistics and to keep pace with modern global trends in maritime transport.",
    "18 Egypt doctors died of exhaustion since start of 2022": "As many as 18 doctors have died in Egypt due to long working hours and exhaustion this year, the Egyptian Medical Syndicate has said.\n\nThe body explained that at least two doctors died each month, compared to three deaths in 2018, eleven in 2019, seven deaths in 2020, and ten in 2021, noting that the deaths are not related to COVID-19 infections.\n\nThe Office of the General Syndicate of Physicians has warned that doctors feel compelled to work longer hours as a result of shortages of staff in some hospitals and low salaries which force them to work in more than one hospital or medical facility to earn a decent living.\n\nREAD: The Egyptian economy is a time bomb waiting to explode",
    "Egypt’s mysteries, surprises provide powerful pull": "When Richard Redding was a child, he said, he would drive his mother crazy by going out in the woods and bringing back bones he would find in the wild.\n\nIn many ways, Redding remains that young boy collecting bones, but instead of the woods, he does much of his work in the history-rich and largely mysterious land of Egypt.\n\nRedding, associate research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, has spent nearly every winter for about 30 years in Egypt, where he and colleague Mark Lehner operate the largest dig at the Great Pyramid through the nonprofit Ancient Egyptian Research Association.\n\n“Every time I go there I learn something new,” Redding said. “It’s just a constant puzzle. You’re working with one of the world’s biggest jigsaw puzzles. That’s why I keep getting drawn back there.”\n\nRichard Redding, associate research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, is shown at the Valley Temple of Menkaure in Egypt. Redding has spent nearly every winter in the country for about 30 years uncovering the mysteries of the Old Kingdom. (Photo by Sayed Salah)\n\nRedding first discovered a love for archaeology as an undergraduate chemistry major at U-M. He took an archaeology course, which he enjoyed, and his professor encouraged him to go to the Museum of Anthropology to further explore the field.\n\nThere he found a drawer full of animal bones from an archaeological site.\n\n“There weren’t that many people who were interested in these archaeological faunal remains, so I just took off from there,” he said. “Just looking at the drawer and saying, ‘Wow, this is it.’”\n\nRedding took to the field immediately. Before his senior year, he worked for nine months in Iran before coming back to U-M to complete his degree in geology, anthropology and biological sciences.\n\nHe had planned to complete his Ph.D. thesis in Iran, but the Iranian revolution of 1979 changed that.\n\n“In 1981, a colleague of mine, who was also in Iran, asked me if I wanted to go to Egypt with him,” he said. “I went there, and it was a really nice project near the Fayyum Desert.”\n\nHe basically never left, and it’s not the allure of the pyramids, tombs and monuments that brings him back. He’s primarily interested in evolutionary ecology and how animals and people interacted in the Old Kingdom, commonly referred to as the Age of the Pyramids from about 2700-2200 B.C.\n\nDigging for and examining bones to learn more about that interaction takes him back to that drawer at the anthropology museum.\n\n“We end up with big bags of fragmented and smashed-to-crap bone,” he said. “You go through it and identify what you can. Over the years you pick up the ability, and when you see it over and over again you can identify what bone it is and what animal it came from.”\n\nHis primary focus since the late 1980s has been at Kom el-Hisn, a Nile Delta site noted for being the first one excavated where people lived in the Old Kingdom. This production site provided important detail in understanding how that ancient economy functioned.\n\nNot long after first breaking ground at Kom el-Hisn, Lehner invited Redding to join him in the shadows of the pyramids of Giza to help uncover a site where people lived in the region. They discovered Heit el-Ghurab, a worker’s village about the size of 10 football fields.\n\nClick on this map of the Heit el-Ghurab site to view what Richard Redding and colleague Mark Lehner have uncovered.\n\n“It’s got barracks, bakeries, sites for preparing copper, a corral for animals,” he said. “They would have 6,000 people a year living on this site, and their total job was constructing the pyramids.”\n\nThirty years later, Redding and Lehner continue to shed light on the many mysteries surrounding ancient Egypt. One of his three ongoing projects has drawn the attention of National Geographic, which has featured Redding and his work many times over the years.\n\nIn Heit el-Ghurab, Redding and Lehner have unearthed a portion of the Royal Administrative Building, which they believe to be an old palace. They were only able to uncover it up to the boundaries of a soccer field that had been constructed atop the ancient structure. After lengthy negotiations, the Ministry of Youth and Sport turned the soccer field over to the Ministry of Antiquities, allowing Redding and Lehner to continue their work.\n\n“We haven’t excavated it all, but we’ve uncovered it to the top of the walls and mapped it,” he said. “It would be great if it were a palace.”\n\nThat type of uncertainty and mystery captivates Redding, who shares his passion for the region with U-M alumni he leads on tours each winter he’s there. Most visitors are content to stare at the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, but Redding encourages them to take in everything.\n\nNOMINATE A SPOTLIGHT The weekly Spotlight features faculty and staff members at the university. To nominate a candidate, email the Record staff at urecord@umich.edu.\n\n“I always start out at the pyramids because they’re totally awed by them,” he said. “But then I tell them, ‘Look around you.’ There are tons of tombs, and I take them down to our site usually.\n\n“There are all these big stone monuments, but it’s almost like the ocean. You see the top of it and you’re just amazed by the vastness of it, but what goes on underneath is just phenomenal.”\n\nRedding is heading back to Egypt in October for about two months to continue to unearth the Heit el-Ghurab site with National Geographic crews alongside. And it’s pretty likely he’ll make a discovery he did not expect.\n\n“There’s just so much going on there, it’s phenomenal to just walk around,” he said. “Whenever I’m there, I always take one or two days and just walk and there’s always something new and surprising.\n\n“My wife keeps saying, ‘You’re never retiring.’ I’ll just keep going until I can’t anymore.”\n\nQ&A\n\nWhat memorable moment in the workplace stands out?\n\nMy thesis defense in 1981.\n\nWhat can’t you live without?\n\nFieldwork.\n\nName your favorite spot on campus.\n\nThe collection of large rock specimens in front of 1100 North University.

    "Egypt’s leader meets with Sudan’s military ruler in Cairo": "President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt has met with Sudan’s leader in Cairo for talks that focused on ties between the two neighbors\n\nCAIRO -- President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt on Saturday met with Sudan’s leader in Cairo for talks that focused on ties between the two neighbors, officials said.\n\nEl-Sissi welcomed Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of Sudan’s ruling sovereign council, at the Cairo international airport. The Sudanese leader stopped in Cairo on his way home from New York where he addressed the U.N. General Assembly on the political stalemate in his county following a military coup he led nearly a year ago.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Egyptian presidency, the two leaders held talks in the Itihadiya presidential palace. The statement offered only generalities about bilateral ties including trade, economic and military cooperation.\n\nThey also discussed regional topics including Ethiopia’s controversial, unfinished dam on the Nile River’s main tributary. Egypt and Sudan want an international agreement to govern how much water Ethiopia releases downstream, especially in a multi-year drought, fearing their critical water shares might be affected.\n\nSudan and Egypt have deepened ties since the ouster of former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 amid a public uprising against his nearly three-decade of rule. The two nations signed an agreement to strengthen military cooperation in March 2021.\n\nEgypt, however, fears ongoing political turmoil could destabilize its southern neighbor. The turmoil has worsened following the military coup in October last year. The military takeover removed a Western-backed, civilian-led government and upended Sudan’s short-lived transition to democratic rule.\n\nAfter months of deadlock and U.N.-brokered talks between the military and pro-democracy groups, Burhan announced the military’s withdrawal from the talks with civilians, to allow political parties to form a transitional government.\n\nThe pro-democracy movement, which includes dozens of political parties and protest groups, have yet to agree among themselves on a transitional government, which prompted Burhan to blame them for the gridlock.",

A total of 12 teachers will take up posts as Chinese language instructors after the training.",
    "Egypt, Tanzania push ahead on Julius Nyerere dam project": "September 25, 2022\n\nCAIRO — A consortium of Egyptian companies building the Julius Nyerere dam in Tanzania has completed pouring the concrete for the main dam. Egypt’s Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities Assem el-Gazzar announced the progress Aug. 28 during his visit to Dar es Salaam.\n\nGazzar was leading an Egyptian delegation that included Egypt’s ambassador to Tanzania Mohamed Abu al-Wafa and a number of other officials. They first met with Tanzanian Minister of Energy January Makamba, who praised Egypt and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for their interest in the project.\n\nGazzar stressed that Sisi has a great deal of interest in the dam, saying he believes it will greatly contribute to Tanzania's development.\n\nThe project has faced various obstacles since it was launched in late 2018.\n\nMohammed Soliman, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, told Al-Monitor, “Egypt aspires to emerge as an alternative model for Africa. Egypt is a rising actor on the continent in sectors including infrastructure, pharma, logistics, aviation and defense.” He went on, “Owing to its success in Tanzania, Cairo is gradually becoming a reliable partner for other African nations such as Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.”\n\nIn December 2018, an Egyptian joint venture that includes Arab Contractors and El Sewedy Electric Company signed a $2.9 billion contract in Dar es Salaam to build the Julius Nyerere dam and the hydropower station attached to it to generate power and control flooding on the Rufiji River. The station is expected to generate 6,307 megawatt-hours per year.\n\nDuring his Aug. 28 visit to the dam site, Gazzar explained that construction of the dam's gates is currently underway and that the Egyptian joint venture has completed connection with the Tanzanian national electrical grid.\n\n“We have come a long way in implementing the project,” project director Ayman Attia said in televised statements on Aug. 29. “We have finished building half of the dam’s body, and work is currently underway to install the gates. Once the parts for the electric turbines supplied from abroad arrive, they will be installed,” Attia explained.\n\nHe said that the project conveys a message to other African countries that Egyptian companies are capable of implementing such huge projects. He added, “It conveys another message to Africans: that the Egyptian companies … also train African citizens. We are Africans and we work with our African brothers; this is a privilege for us.” He noted that 11,000 of the project's 12,000 workers are Tanzanian.\n\nThe dam project had been planned to be completed at the end of this year, but its opening was postponed until 2024 due to a number of challenges, including disruptions in the delivery of vital building materials due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Tanzanian government is determined to finish the project as soon as possible and begin exporting electricity to neighboring countries.\n\nOn a field tour to the dam site on Aug. 9, Makamba announced, “By July 2022 the project was 67.18% complete, compared to 37.4% between December 2018 and June 2021.”\n\nAmani al-Taweel, director of the Africa program at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, told Al-Monitor that Egypt is seeking to promptly finish the construction of the dam after postponing it so as to portray itself as a successful builder of dams and prove that it is not against development, as Ethiopia claims.\n\nSince 2011, Ethiopia has been building a massive dam on the Blue Nile, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, with the aim of producing 5,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year that could be sold to neighboring countries in the Nile Basin.\n\nMoatamer Amin, a researcher in international relations at the British University in Egypt, told Al-Monitor in reference to Ethiopia that “Egypt is helping East and Central African countries generate electricity and be self-sufficient to prevent any competitors from exporting electricity to these countries.”\n\nHe added that the Tanzanian dam project is part of a long-term Egyptian strategy of linking its interests with the Nile Basin countries in Central and East Africa through building and maintaining dams and a larger project to create a navigation lane linking Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea via the Nile River.\n\nAmin said, “Egypt is seeking to form an African group of Nile Basin countries that would serve as a unified bloc.”\n\nSince Sisi came to power in 2014, Egypt has worked to regain the influence it had lost in the Nile Basin region, bolster its image and protect its water interests in the face of the GERD project. Egypt and Sudan have been engaged in negotiations with Ethiopia for more than a decade now on the operation and filling of the GERD, which Egypt considers a threat to its water security.\n\nNegotiations between the three countries have been deadlocked since they failed to reach an agreement during the last round of talks held in Kinshasa in April 2021.\n\nIn mid-August, Ethiopia announced the completion of the third-stage filling of the GERD reservoir while ignoring Egypt and Sudan's repeated demands that the filling of the dam be halted until a legally binding agreement is reached.\n\nOn Aug. 29, Ethiopian Ambassador to Khartoum Yebeltal Amiru announced that his country was ready to resume negotiations on the GERD under the auspices of the African Union, but Taweel said, “The Ethiopian discourse lacks any real content capable of tempting Egypt and Sudan to resume negotiations.”\n\n“At a time when the Egyptian position is plagued with uncertainty, President Sisi always states that Egypt’s waters are safe and that no one can approach them. However, he always falls short of explaining the mechanisms to protect this water. This issue seems restricted to Egyptian decision-making circles,” she went on.\n\nSolima said, “Given the Ukraine war and the rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Nile dispute is not a priority for global powers. And at this point, and without international mediation, the likelihood of a water-sharing agreement is low.”",
    "Egypt to establish largest organ transplant centre in the Middle East, Africa": "President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi directed the government on Monday to establish the largest organ transplant centre in the Middle East and Africa in Cairo, in cooperation with international companies.\n\nThis organ transplant centre will include an automated database for transplants, patients and donors, Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said.\n\nEl-Sisi’s directives came in a meeting with Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar following up on efforts to develop the country’s healthcare system.\n\nThe centre will be located in Cairo’s new integrated medical city, which is being developed on the premises of the Nasser Medical Institute.\n\nInaugurated July 1987 in Cairo under the health ministry, the Nasser Medical Institute provides low-cost or free healthcare to more than 450,000 people annually.\n\nDuring the meeting, Abdel-Ghaffar also reviewed the progress on developing the Nasser Institute Hospital located in the medical city, which has a capacity of 1,200 intensive care beds and 45 operating rooms.\n\nAbdel-Ghaffar also detailed the establishment of the new Om El-Masryeen Hospital, with a capacity of 400 beds, which will provide services to about three million people.\n\nThis hospital will be the main hospital for receiving road accident victims in Giza governorate and its suburbs.\n\nMoreover, El-Sisi directed the officials to accelerate the establishment of strategic pharmaceuticals warehouses nationwide to cover the needs of current and future need of medical and pharmaceutical supplies.\n\nThese pharmaceuticals warehouses shall be established in accordance with international standards, using the latest technology, the statement said, adding that the pandemic demonstrated the need to boost pharmaceutical production across the continent.\n\nFurthermore, the statement said that El-Sisi directed the government to accelerate the application of financial incentives for medical personnel and the nighttime operation of clinics.\n\nPart of the clinics' revenues will be allocated to doctors and medical staff in a move meant to provide additional incomes for medical personnel to reward their efforts, El-Sisi added.\n\nRecently, the healthcare sector has been witnessing a major exodus of skilled personnel.\n\nFrom 2019 through March 2022, more than 11,500 doctors resigned from the Egyptian public health sector, the Egyptian Medical Syndicate (EMS) said in a report issued in April 2022.\n\nAccording to the same report, the average salary of a resident doctor is EGP 3,700 per month (under $190) and the pension of a public sector doctor after 35 years is estimated at EGP 2,300 per month (under $120).\n\nEarlier this year the EMS praised President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi’s directive to increase the monthly allowances given to medical professionals by 75 percent at a total cost of EGP 2.25 billion, as part of government efforts to support members of the healthcare sector amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\nSearch Keywords:\n\nShort link:\n\n",
    "These 4 Laws in Egypt Must Change: Activists": "These 4 Laws in Egypt Must Change: Activists\n\nActivism has proven to help amend laws in Egypt, from child marriage to animal rights. Other campaigns, however, are far more socially contentious – some, like atheism and sexual orientations, are considered culturally inappropriate. Nevertheless, activists continue to campaign for a change in certain controversial laws in Egypt.\n\nWith the government’s recent launch of its new National Human Rights Strategy in September 2021, and with a large number of activists being pardoned from prison, activists will be aiming to step up their efforts in the coming period.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHING UNSIGHTLY LOCATIONS AND MEDIA EQUIPMENT\n\nUp until July 2022, people were unofficially not permitted to photograph or film any public spaces in Egypt without prior approval from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.\n\nThis has now changed, following an approved draft law issued by former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Khaled El-Enany, as announced in an exclusive interview with talk show host Amr Adeeb.\n\nThe Ministry’s recent decision comes shortly after American food blogger Sonny Side, stated on his YouTube food and travel channel, ‘Best Ever Food Review Show’, that “Egypt is one of worst places for filmmakers”. He added that Egyptian security personnel mistreated him while filming Egyptian dishes, warned him to not film in unsightly locations, confiscated their cameras, and shut their filming down.\n\nSide’s last video regarding his trip to Egypt, shot after leaving the country, was an open criticism and formal request for more lenient laws towards capturing footage in Egypt. Side’s open call for change was posted prior to the amended law.\n\nEl-Enany publicly cautioned photography enthusiasts that this amendment does not protect against documenting Egypt’s unsightly locations – this includes ugly scenes, like littered areas, government buildings, informal settlements, and security officials.\n\nThese complexes include buildings and sites belonging to the Armed Forces or Egyptian Police, ministry buildings, legislative councils, other governmental facilities, and any other sovereign and security authorities.\n\nUnder the new law, permits are still required for those with professional media equipment, drones, and underwater cameras. The penalty for flying an unauthorized drone ranges from one to seven years. If deemed a terrorist tool, that sentence can extend to life imprisonment.\n\nBLASPHEMY: ATHEISM AND RELIGIOUS MANIPULATION\n\nAtheism is yet another crime not explicitly cited in the penal code—still, some Egyptians have been imprisoned after publicly declaring their atheism on the basis of proselytizing.\n\nIn the transitional presidential period between Mohamed Morsi and Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, sparked by the 2013 uprising, a group of Egyptian atheist activists attempted to normalize the existence of non-believers within Egyptian society – a matter that is often fervently opposed by a predominantly religious society.\n\nAhmed Harqan, an openly atheist Egyptian, was one of the first few atheists to feature in televised debates about atheist rights shortly after Al-Sisi’s first election victory. He later survived an alleged premeditated mob attack in 2014, was arrested on the grounds of allegedly defaming Islam on television, and permanently left the country in 2020.\n\nLegal action taken against atheism often relies on Article 98 of the penal code, informally known as the Blasphemy Law, which stipulates that any person that exploits or condemns Egypt’s religions can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nIn September 2021, in a live press event for Egypt’s new National Human Rights Strategy, Al-Sisi publicly addressed the possibility of Egypt openly accepting atheists.\n\n“I respect nonbelievers. If someone tells me [they are] neither Muslim nor Christian nor a Jew or that he or she does not believe in religion, I would tell them, you are free to choose,” Al-Sisi explained.\n\nAl-Sisi followed his statement by questioning if religious Egyptians will be willing to accept their existence, and highlighting the difference between accepting atheism and accepting religious defamation.\n\nOn the other side of the religious spectrum, that same article of law criminalizes the exploitation and distortion of religion, including by religious figures.\n\nMost recently, in June 2022, popular television cleric Mabrouk Attia was referred to investigations following remarks that blamed Nayera Ashraf, a femicide victim, for her own murder – citing her lack of veil and choice of dress as the reason behind her murder.\n\nLGBTQ+ AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\nEgypt’s legal codes do not explicitly mention members of the LGBTQ+ community, nor do they explicitly criminalize homosexuality.\n\nYet there have been a number of instances where members of the LGBTQ+ community have been arrested. In 2017, following a controversial, rainbow-flag-laden performance by Lebanese band Mashrou’ Leila, Egyptian authorities were quick to arrest those who seemed to support the LGBTQ+ community, in addition to banning the band from playing in Egypt indefinitely.\n\nThe question remains: what makes these acts criminal if not directly mentioned in Egypt’s criminal code?\n\nEgypt’s Law 10/1961, commonly known as the Debauchery Law, has been used to apply criminal action toward ‘homosexual activity’. While the law was initially intended to criminalize prostitution, its application has sometimes been extended to crack down on ‘sexual activity’.\n\n“Whoever employs, persuades or induces a person, be they male or female, with the intention of committing debauchery or prostitution and this is by means of deception, force, threats, abuse of authority or other means of coercion, the punishment is imprisonment for a period not less than one year and not more than five years,” reads Article 2, Section A of the law.\n\nThere are, however, variances in rights between different members LGBTQ+ community.

    "Monday Briefing: Amid growing Gulf investment, Egypt tries to maintain a tricky economic balancing act": "Contents:\n\nAmid growing Gulf investment, Egypt tries to maintain a tricky economic balancing act\n\nMirette F. Mabrouk\n\nSenior Fellow and Founding Director of the Egypt program\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi’s visit to Qatar last week bore almost immediate fruit; three MoUs were signed, including one between the respective sovereign wealth funds.\n\nWhile Egypt needs FDI, there are worries that outside investors may wind up controlling vital sections of the economy.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi made his first visit to Qatar during his time in office last week, following Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s visit to Cairo at the end of June. According to the Qatar News Agency, the visits heralded “a new era of relations between the two countries.”\n\nThose relations had been tense since the removal of former President Mohamed Morsi by the military, after massive demonstrations against him and the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Following one diplomatic spat after another, in 2017, Egypt joined Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain in boycotting Qatar. That boycott was lifted in early 2021, and the countries have been taking increasingly energetic steps forward since.\n\nLast week’s meeting in Qatar bore almost immediate fruit; three memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, including one between the respective sovereign wealth funds. And on Saturday, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly met with Sheikh Faisal bin Thani Al Thani, the chief of Asia-Pacific and Africa investments at Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. Egypt is particularly keen to maximize its tourism development potential and during the meeting, Madbouly presented Al Thani with a plan to develop the area west of Alamein. According to Masrawy, Al Thani indicated that Qatar was interested in exploring investment in both existing structures and developing new ones.\n\nA day later, Egypt’s transport minister, Kamel el-Wazir, and Abu Bakr Kondial of Maha Capital Partners, an investment arm of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, signed an MoU to develop and upgrade the vital Port Said Port container terminal.\n\nLast May, el-Wazir had announced a plan to merge multiple ports into one company to be offered on the Egyptian Stock Exchange, according to Mada Masr, including Ain Sokhna, Damietta, Alexandria, East Port Said, Safaga, and Adabiya.\n\nThere’s been a lot of interest in Egypt’s ports and the crucial Red Sea trade passageway. And Egypt is even keener on capitalizing on this attention. The country’s economy has been battered mercilessly; still struggling with the fallout from the pandemic, it was in poor shape to withstand the disastrous effects of the war in Ukraine. Hot money behaved the way it always does during periods of global instability, as foreign investors in the bond market fled for more stable developed markets, taking vital foreign currency with them. That global instability meant spiking prices, increasing the demand for scarcer foreign currency. To put one final boot in, much of the country’s rising debt is nearing maturity, placing even more of a squeeze on its foreign currency resources.\n\nThe influx of Gulf money — Saudi, Emirati, and now Qatari — has been seen as a lifeline for Egypt’s battered economy. That’s indisputable. However, that money is being referred to as loans and handouts, which is far from the case. Whereas in previous years the Gulf countries had placed generous deposits in Egypt’s Central Bank, helping to prop up the economy, they are now making investments; and like any investor, they will naturally require a return on their money. While Egypt needs foreign direct investment, there are worries that outside investors may wind up controlling vital sections of the economy. The Qataris have expressed interest in Port Said, and the Emirati firm Abu Dhabi Ports won a tender to manage Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea. According to Mada Masr, the security implications have now been presented to Egyptian President Sisi.\n\nAll new investment carries an opportunity cost. Having foreign firms manage ports means relinquishing a measure of control, and expanding tourist developments means keeping a close eye on the environmental strain and potential damage that development might do to natural resources. It’s a tricky balancing act.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @mmabrouk\n\nIn Iraq, expect more talks, possible new violence\n\nRobert S. Ford\n\nSenior Fellow\n\nThe standoff between Shi’a Islamist groups will resume in earnest this week, with the Sadrist Movement on one side and the Coordination Framework, which is itself split, on the other.\n\nElements of a deal are visible, but there are plenty of details that can derail everything — and there is a real risk of renewed violence.\n\nThe standoff between Shi’a Islamist groups in Baghdad over the naming of a new government continues, and political maneuvering, which had slowed last week during the Shi’a religious pilgrimage of Arba’een, will resume in earnest this week. On one side of the ongoing dispute, the movement of populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr insists that the existing parliament, elected in October 2021, be dissolved and that the current interim government oversee new elections. Confronting the Sadrists is the Coordination Framework (CF), a coalition of Shi’a parties that is itself split, as one Iraqi analyst explained on Sept. 18, between hawks and doves. The CF hawks, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, want the existing parliament to convene promptly to choose a new president and a new prime minister with a new government enjoying full authority to run the country. The doves in the CF prefer to bring along the Sadrists by cutting a deal on a new government whose key role would be overseeing new elections.\n\nMedia reports over the weekend said a delegation that includes doves from the CF as well as representatives from Sunni Arab and Kurdish parties will call on Sadr in Najaf. It is not yet clear whether he is prepared to compromise on issues such as who would head a new cabinet and what its mandate would be. There are hints in the Iraqi media that the CF doves and their Sunni Arab and Kurdish colleagues would accept a compromise prime minister. Other sweeteners can also be thrown into the negotiating mix, including seats in a new cabinet and changes to the commission that would oversee the new election. Another crucial element to resolve the standoff is an agreement between feuding Kurdish parties over the new president since the other political groupings likely would ratify a unified Kurdish choice if there is also an advance agreement on a prime minister.\n\nElements of a deal are visible, but there are plenty of details that can derail everything. Hawks in the CF have not promised to compromise. One hawk told an Iraqi news service on Sept. 18 that the upcoming visit to Najaf was the “last chance” to bring Sadr along. While they can sharply disagree, Iraqi political leaders rarely resort to violence before they first plunge into long — sometimes seemingly interminable — discussions. If the hawks lose patience and push hard to reconvene the parliament to approve a new government, the risk of new Sadrist street action and renewed violence between Sadrist militias and militias loyal to the hawks is very possible.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @fordrs58\n\nDespite recent speculation, the prospects for Turkish-Syrian rapprochement remain distant\n\nCharles Lister\n\nSenior Fellow, Director of Syria and Countering Terrorism & Extremism programs\n\nThough almost entirely unacknowledged, Syrian intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk has met several times with his counterparts from a number of regional adversarial states throughout the crisis.\n\nSpeculation about Ankara and Damascus reaching a modus vivendi may be partially driven by Russian narratives and in part by the Turkish government’s pre-election considerations.\n\nSpeculation continues to surround Turkey’s Syria policy following weeks of reporting around public comments in August by senior Turkish officials and more recent claims, citing unnamed sources, that Turkey’s intelligence chief held several meetings with his Syrian counterpart, both in Ankara and Damascus. While secret contacts between security leaders are not entirely new, the reported intensity of these meetings and the alleged facilitating role played by Russia does mark a change. Still, there remains no sign that the vast chasm between the two decade-long opponents is narrowing, suggesting a more nuanced reality may be at play.\n\nThough almost entirely unacknowledged, Syrian intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk has met several times with his counterparts from a number of regional adversarial states throughout the Syrian crisis. In all likelihood, Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) chief, Hakan Fidan, met with Mamlouk to discuss or negotiate the situation in northern and northeastern Syria, where both parties would like to see the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakened, if not ultimately crippled. It is also quite likely that Fidan has been scoping out the framework for any future rapprochement between Turkey and Syria — but in so doing, he will not be faced with any realistic path forward, for the obstacles remain insurmountable.\n\nSince the fall of Aleppo in 2016 (which Turkey directly facilitated), Ankara’s Syria policy has been guided overwhelmingly by counterterrorism and border security concerns. For now at least, there is no sign that Damascus or Moscow are willing to greenlight any further Turkish incursion (Turkey’s immediate ask), while the likelihood that Ankara will relinquish the vast stretch of territory it occupies across northern Syria (Syria’s primary demand) remains inconceivable.\n\nOn border security, Turkey is acutely aware of the more than 4.5 million Syrians currently residing within that unstable Turkish-influenced northwestern zone, all of whom refuse to even consider returning to regime-controlled areas. On top of that, Turkey continues to host at least 3.5 million Syrian refugees, who retain the same complete aversion to regime rule. And to add to that pressure against normalization, Turkey is also the central guarantor of at least 50,000 armed opposition fighters and more than 10,000 militants within the jihadist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. Any Turkish re-embrace of Bashar al-Assad’s regime would catalyze a worst-case series of threats to Turkey’s national security, the effects of which would likely kill off any chance of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s re-election next year.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Assad’s regime displays no sign whatsoever of softening its hostile stance toward Turkey — with state media and senior officials continuing to label Turkey a “war criminal” state, “occupying” Syrian territory at the behest of “terrorists.” Behind the scenes however, there is little reason not to engage delicately on intelligence levels and every motivation to allow a public narrative to continue that suggests Damascus’s most significant state challenger may be considering re-engagement.\n\nUltimately, the roots of the recent speculation are more likely to lie, in part, in Russia’s desire to create an impression of foreign policy achievement amidst a pitiful war in Ukraine. A further source may be Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which needs to assuage and align on the surface with concerns expressed by some of its domestic voting base and supporters of its rival parties’ hostility to Syrian refugees and Turkey’s spending and investments in northern Syria. Turning policy activities driven more by optics into reality will be nigh on impossible for Russia and highly dangerous for Turkey.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @Charles_Lister\n\nRomania, France, and the UAE push to expand Ukrainian food export options in the Black Sea\n\nIulia-Sabina Joja\n\nDirector, Frontier Europe Initiative; Project Director, Afghanistan Watch\n\nLast week, France and Romania signed an agreement focused on improving transit options for Ukrainian grain exports via Romania’s land, sea, and internal waters.\n\nDubai-based company DP World is building a new terminal at the Romanian port of Constanța, which has been overloaded since Russia’s full-scale re-invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which blocked maritime exports of Ukrainian grain, created a food crisis across the developing world by acutely increasing prices and heightening widespread fears of shortages. In August, Turkey and the United Nations brokered a deal that assured the safety of grain export ships leaving Ukraine’s northwestern Black Sea ports. But this arrangement only managed to partially alleviate the crisis: Much of Ukraine’s grain remained blocked and the regional infrastructure experienced heavy congestion. Under the pressure of war and thanks to Romanian leadership, however, critical developments are taking place, aimed at improving Black Sea infrastructure to aid the export of Ukrainian food products to developing countries, including in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). In particular, governmental pledges from France and private investments from the United Arab Emirates are now contributing to the brisk expansion of transport infrastructure at the border between Romania and Ukraine.\n\nLast week, France and Romania signed an agreement focused on improving transit options via land, sea, and internal waters, in the Danube River Delta and along Romania’s Black Sea coast. The bilateral deal is comprehensive and promises short-term improvements as well as medium-term investment planning — encompassing the Danube-Sulina canal, the Danube port of Galati (less than 10 miles from the Ukrainian border), the Black Sea port of Constanța, and land border points — all with an eye toward facilitating increased grain shipments. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale re-invasion of Ukraine in late February, Romanian transport facilities have been critical to enabling at least some Ukrainian grain exports; but the transport infrastructure has been overloaded. Along with Ukraine, Romania is itself one of the world’s largest exporters of agricultural products. But if Romania, in cooperation with France, can secure sufficient medium-term investments, this should help to address future food crises in MENA and the rest of the developing world.\n\nThe other recent infrastructure development aimed at facilitating grain exports from the Black Sea region involves DP World, an international logistics firm and port operator based in Dubai. In the works since June, DP World will build a new terminal for the Romanian port of Constanța, which has been overloaded since Russia invaded its neighbor earlier this year. To be finalized next summer, the new terminal will help Romania handle more exports, both of its own products as well as of Ukrainian ones, thus highlighting the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for global transport and supply chains.\n\nFollow on Twitter: @IuliJo\n\nThe US throws the Afghan financial system a lifeline\n\nMarvin G. Weinbaum\n\nDirector, Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies\n\nThe Switzerland-based Afghan Fund is designed principally as a means to aid the Afghan people without benefiting a sanctioned Taliban government.\n\nThe monetary windfall, as large as it is, cannot by itself revive the Afghan economy. But it should contribute substantially to stabilizing it.\n\nAn Afghanistan deep in humanitarian and economic crisis found some relief last week with the announcement by the Biden administration that $3.5 billion of the $7 billion in frozen Afghan central bank reserves in the U.S. would be released to a newly created fund. The Switzerland-based Afghan Fund is designed principally as a means to aid the Afghan people without benefiting a sanctioned Taliban government. This new instrument is expected, among other tasks, to manage targeted disbursements to cover debt payments, purchase critical imports, improve eligibility for international development aid, and print new currency, acting in effect much as a state’s central bank would. The direct recapitalization of the current government’s central bank was ruled out after U.S. representatives failed in negotiations with the Taliban to come to an agreement on the necessary safeguards to ensure that technocrats running the bank could be shielded from political interference.\n\nMany of the details about the Afghan Fund’s operations remain unclear or have yet to be worked out. Complicated issues include how it will relate to other financial institutions, such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund, and whether it will be able to interact with other countries’ central banks. (The Basel-based Bank for International Settlements is slated to provide the Fund with financial services and assist in implementing policies, but it will not be involved in decision making.) How smoothly the board of trustees designated to manage the Fund will function is also an open question. The board, which will consist of two Afghans, a U.S. official, and a Swiss representative (and possibly additional members), will require unanimity in making decisions. Could this seriously impede the ability of the trustees to reach agreements? Might their work be complicated by the fact that while both named Afghan trustees have distinguished careers in banking, like practically all once-prominent public figures in the previous two-decade-long republic, they also come with political baggage?\n\nThe Kabul regime has announced its objections to the creation of a Switzerland-based trust in which it will have no input. The Taliban express concern that the new funds may be used to support humanitarian programs rather than directly strengthen the country’s financial system. The government still hopes to recover the remaining $3.5 billion in U.S.-held assets as well as the $2 billion in European banks. The final disposition of the U.S.-retained funds remains uncertain. They will likely be tied up for the foreseeable future in U.S. courts as the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks pursue their claims to the frozen reserves.\n\nThe monetary windfall, as large as it is, cannot by itself revive the Afghan economy. But it should contribute substantially to stabilizing it. If the Fund succeeds in steadying the economy and in lessening the current crises, the ruling Taliban’s staying power will almost inevitably be strengthened. But this may be a necessary price to pay for averting the collapse of the economy and the resulting toll it would take on the wellbeing of the Afghan people.\n\n﻿Shizah Kashif, a research assistant to Marvin G.

The forum was organized by the Arab Water Council with support from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Environment. Senior representatives from 30 countries attended. The forum’s purpose was to discuss the impacts of climate change as well as the adaptation and mitigation measures that could be utilized to address those impacts across multiple sectors and themes, including water and food security, carbon emissions controls, alternative forms of clean and renewable energy, and environmental preservation and protection.\n\nLast week’s forum provided another opportunity to get a better sense of Egypt’s priorities for the U.N. Climate Change Conference (27th Conference of the Parties, COP27), which the country will host on Nov. 6-18. In Cairo, comments from Egyptian senior officials and experts confirmed, and in some cases elucidated, what will be the high-priority issues for Egypt at this year’s climate conference.\n\nEmphasizing adaptation, not just mitigation: While highlighting that shifting to renewable sources of energy has become a priority for the Arab world (as a means to reduce carbon emissions), Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry also recognized the urgency of adaptation as a necessary function to deal with the effects of climate change.\n\nWater scarcity is a top concern: The new minister of water resources and irrigation, Hani Sewilam, stressed how impacts to water supply due to climate change cascade into shortages of drinking water as well as volumes required for agricultural use and industrial production. In addition, he elaborated on Egypt’s particular vulnerability when it comes to water resources — with added emphasis on its extreme dependance on the Nile — while emphasizing the need for more water infrastructure (desalination and treatment plants) and inter-country cooperation.\n\nDiversifying climate financing and investments: The push for more adaptation, especially for water and food security, creates a greater urgency for more efficient climate funding mechanisms. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the United Nations’ high-level climate change champion for Egypt, advocated for broadening climate investments in adaptation and the water and energy sectors, specifically highlighting projects beyond just reducing carbon emissions. In that same vein, he also urged less reliance on carbon markets and green bonds for financing, not just on borrowing.\n\nEgypt remains committed to putting African concerns to the forefront at COP27 and to representing the continent’s interests at the conference. All of these key issues have one aspect in common: They are the most pressing challenges for almost all developing countries. As such, the biggest expectations for COP27 will be whether the high-level gathering can deliver progress in areas that can increase climate resilience for the most vulnerable nations.\n\nPhoto by AMIRI DIWAN OF THE STATE OF QATAR/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images",

The authority’s focus was on solar energy and wind energy, and then extended to include biomass energy.\n\nThe strategy of the electricity sector in Egypt depends on the diversity of energy sources with the expansion of the use of renewable energy, in addition to encouraging investors to establish projects to produce electricity from renewable sources, in addition to stimulating the industrial sector to engage in the manufacture and localization of renewable energy technology.\n\nThe renewable energy strategy adopted by the country aims to increase the percentage of energy generated from renewable energy to 42 percent in 2030, in which solar and wind energy contribute the largest share of renewable energy sources, with the participation of nuclear energy by 3 percent, and thermal plants by 55 percent, by 2035 according to the annual report of the NREA’s annual report for 2020.\n\nThe report emphasized that the industry sector contributes about 17 percent of the GDP, and is one of the sectors that consumes the most different energy sources, as this sector comes in second place after the electricity sector with regard to the consumption of petroleum products and natural gas.\n\nIt is also noted that the fertilizer industry has acquired the largest share (about 35 percent) of the total energy consumption, and the iron and steel industry comes in second place (about 13 percent) and in the third place is the cement industry (about 6 percent), which means more gas emissions and global warming.\n\nTherefore, Egypt seeks to implement renewable energy projects in general and the project of using solar energy in particular in the industrial sector, especially in the food, textile, and chemical sectors that consume the most thermal energy in manufacturing.",

    "Egypt: Government Undermining Environmental Groups": "Click to expand Image (RL) Annalena Baerbock (Alliance 90/The Greens), Federal Foreign Minister, and Sameh Shoukry, Foreign Minister of Egypt, photographed as part of the Petersberg climate dialogue at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin, July 19, 2022. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue serves as a preparation for the UN Climate Change Conference, which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in 2022. © Florian Gaertner/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images\n\n(Beirut) – The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups’ ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, and field work essential to protecting the country’s natural environment, Human Rights Watch said today. These restrictions violate the rights to freedom of assembly and association and threaten Egypt’s ability to uphold its environmental and climate action commitments, as Egypt hosts the COP27 climate summit in November 2022.\n\n“The Egyptian government has imposed arbitrary funding, research, and registration obstacles that have debilitated local environmental groups, forcing some activists into exile and others to steer clear of important work,” said Richard Pearshouse, environment director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should immediately lift its onerous restrictions on independent nongovernmental organizations, including environmental groups.”\n\nIn June, Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 activists, academics, scientists, and journalists working on environmental issues in Egypt. All have been involved in promoting, advocating for, and working on climate action in some capacity. Some currently work for nongovernmental groups. Others who did stopped for safety or security reasons or left the country. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons. Six other people declined to be interviewed, variously citing security concerns or that government restrictions had forced them to stop their environmental work.\n\nThose interviewed described a sharp reduction in the space for independent environment and climate work since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government took office in 2014. They described harassment and intimidation tactics, including arrests and difficulties travelling, creating a general atmosphere of fear. These experiences mirror similar tactics pursued by Egyptian authorities against independent local and international groups more generally since 2014 as part of a relentless crackdown on civil society.\n\nAt the same time, some people described a recent expansion of official tolerance for environmental activities that are easily reconciled with government priorities and not perceived as critical of the government. An emerging cohort of these environmental groups are working mostly within technical domains such as trash collection, recycling, renewable energy, food security, and climate finance. Increasingly, “the government adopts radical discourse when it comes to the Global North and its contribution to climate change and carbon emissions, just because this intersects with their interests, like the need for more funds,” one person said.\n\nBut staff members of critical human rights and environmental groups said they are wary of publicly engaging at COP27 because of fears of reprisals. “The security apparatus will probably now more than ever before focus on environmental civil society in Egypt,” an activist outside the country said. “When COP ends, they might start looking and see who is doing what, who got funds from where, for example.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that the most sensitive environmental issues are those that point out the government’s failure to protect people’s rights against damage caused by corporate interests, including issues relating to water security, industrial pollution, and environmental harm from real estate, tourism development, and agribusiness.\n\nActivists also said that the environmental impact of Egypt’s vast and opaque military business activity, such as destructive forms of quarrying, water bottling plants, and some cement factories are particularly sensitive, as are “national” infrastructure projects such as a new administrative capital, many of which are associated with the president’s office or the military.\n\n“[These national infrastructure projects are] a red line,” one person said. “I can’t work on this.”\n\nSeveral people said their organizations, widely regarded as the leading ones in Egypt, have been weakened severely by government restrictions and a pervasive sense of fear and uncertainty. This leaves them unable to fulfill the “watchdog” role on abuses of government power.\n\n“They’re so paralyzed by the possibility of what could happen that they do nothing,” one veteran Cairo activist said.\n\nRestrictions on receiving funding has affected many environmental groups. Several laws since 2014, including a 2014 amendment to the penal code as well as the old and new law on nongovernmental groups, arbitrarily restrict grants and donations from foreign and national sources. Increasingly since 2014, the government has prosecuted dozens of independent human rights and civil society organizations, some of them doing environmental work, for receiving foreign funds, and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on leading activists. Such prosecutions have had a chilling impact on these groups.\n\nSeveral people said their groups have faced substantial difficulties registering as nongovernmental groups. All activists interviewed said they have increasingly refrained from doing essential field research, both because they fear that they or the people they interview will be arrested and because it has become almost impossible to attain research permits, which typically involve one or multiple security agencies’ approval.\n\nIn February 2020, seven United Nations experts who reviewed these repressive laws and others said that they “view the totality of these legislative enactments, and their inter-related and cumulative effects, as having collective and corrosive effects on the promotion and protection of human rights.”\n\nThe government repression has forced dozens of Egypt’s leading civil society activists and groups, including those working on environmental and human rights issues, to leave the country, or downscale or quit their activism. A number of foreign human rights and environmental organizations have closed their Egypt offices since 2014. “We haven’t even thought of protesting [these days],” said one environmental activist. Another said that: “Before 2011 the space was not so closed [as it is today]. Now it is very dangerous.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch sent questions about the situation of environmental groups to Egyptian authorities on August 23 but has received no response. Egyptian authorities should urgently halt the campaign of repression against independent civil society groups, including bringing an end to years-long prosecutions, asset freezes, and travel bans against human rights and environmental groups and their staff members. The government should drastically amend the 2019 law on nongovernmental groups in accordance with its constitution and international obligations to protect freedom of association. The government should also unblock all news and human rights websites.\n\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and other governments involved in COP27 negotiations should work with the Egyptian government to provide space for diverse civil society participation at the climate talks. This includes ensuring that premises are inclusive and accessible to all, and that observers, including groups critical of the government, have access to registration, negotiations, and are able to protest and express their positions freely. The Secretariat should also develop human rights criteria that countries hosting future COPs must commit to meeting as part of the host agreement.\n\nIt is fundamental for the Egyptian authorities to deliver visas on time for the COP27 participants and end all their unlawful surveillance and intimidation tactics.\n\n“The world needs more climate activism, not less, and there can be no such effective activism when the government treats civic groups as a threat, not an asset” Pearshouse said. “The UN Framework Convention member states and the Secretariat should press the Egyptian government to make sure environmental groups feel it is safe to engage in and beyond the COP”.\n\nFor additional details about restrictions, please see below.\n\nHarassment of Egyptian Environmental Groups\n\nMany environmental activists described a pattern of harassment by state authorities. Some have received threatening phone calls at times when they have been perceived as criticizing the government when pursuing advocacy objectives related to their environmental work. “Some of my partners in the public sector received phone calls from their bosses telling them to find someone else to work with,” said an environmental advocate who has since stopped some of their work because of such threats.\n\nOthers described being repeatedly held up for security checks and questioning at Cairo airport upon leaving or arriving, and sometimes prevented from leaving the country. One person described the harassment of their partners in the Egyptians Against Coal campaign, a popular but ultimately unsuccessful movement that emerged in response to the government’s drive to reintroduce coal to power cement factories from 2013.\n\n“We had some prominent people who showed up on TV to speak against coal, but suddenly they started to quit the campaign,” one person said. “One was harassed by security at the airport, so he quit.”\n\nAmong local environmental groups, security summonses are common which also target residents and victims of environmental pollution. Three advocates mentioned that security agencies threatened residents who interacted with them in one campaign with terrorism-related charges. Human Rights Watch is not including the details of the case to avoid identifying them.\n\nIn recent months and years, the Egyptian authorities have removed some of the last stretches of inner city green belt in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities for urban projects that apparently involved little to no consultations with residents or civil society groups. An activist said that organizing around such an important issue was difficult because of repression, even though Cairo is among the most polluted and least green cities in the world.\n\nFunding Challenges\n\nMany interviewees described government restrictions on receiving funding as their most debilitating obstacle. Egyptian and Egypt-based businesses and business-owners offer no or limited funding for any work perceived to be critical of the government to avoid reprisals targeting their investments. Egyptian civil society groups, including environmental groups, have historically had to seek foreign sources of finance, such as European and North American foundations and governments.\n\nIn 2014, President al-Sisi amended, by decree, the penal code to punish with life in prison or death sentence anyone requesting, receiving, or assisting the transfer of funds, whether from foreign sources or local organizations, with the aim of doing work that harms a “national interest” or the country’s independence or undermining public security or safety. This amendment, together with years-long prosecution of groups for receiving foreign funds, as well as new restrictions and complex processes introduced through the nongovernmental organization law of 2017 and the updated one of 2019, all have struck independent organizations, including environment groups, and their operations particularly hard.\n\nThese laws impose a range of other severe restrictions and surveillance including giving the government, led by security services, the authority to “inspect” organizations’ work at any time and without necessarily specifying the grounds. As one person described it, the government has presented nongovernmental groups “in the media and the popular culture as recipients of foreign funds and therefore agents of foreign agendas.”\n\nAn environmental advocate with a Cairo-based organization who said their organization used to cooperate in several projects with international donors and institutions stopped doing so because those international actors “allocate their resources away from Egypt because of the repression.”\n\nEven when Egyptian environmental groups do secure funding, often by working with embassies or international institutions in Cairo, they remain captive to hostile, bureaucratic, and/or arbitrary government decision-making.\n\nIn one instance, a well-known organization was cleared to receive money from abroad, but the Social Solidarity Ministry, the government body responsible for overseeing the registration and work of nongovernmental groups, held up the funds, “until three months before the end of the project,” one of the activists involved said. “[As a consequence], they did the project in a very bad way.” Other people said the ministry has sometimes given permission for foreign transfers, only for the security services to block their distribution for unexplained and impossible-to-undo reasons.\n\nRegistration Problems\n\nMany Egyptian environmental groups have been restricted by the difficulty, or, in some cases, the impossibility of securing status as nongovernmental groups. Two people said that they were unaware of any environmental organization publicly criticizing the government that have successfully registered in recent years.\n\nTo operate legally, civil society organizations must be registered with the Social Solidarity Ministry and undertake complex registration processes introduced by the 2019 nongovernmental organization law. The process sometimes requires hundreds of pages of documents, that interviewees said leaves many organizations no longer clear on how to go about it. “I spent a year and a half trying to figure out how we could register,” one interviewee said. “But this is over. I dropped it.”\n\nOthers have been unofficially warned off when sounding out personal contacts within government about the possibility of legalizing their status. The implication is often that the group stood no chance of success and its members risked greater scrutiny by even trying.\n\nIn these circumstances, organizations have often only been able to work under the radar, which naturally limits their scope, and/or by avoiding vital but overly sensitive topics. Alternately, independent Egyptian environmental groups have sometimes found that the only way to do work is to partner with organizations that frequently support and defend government policies and narratives.\n\nAs with funding, even initial green lights are no guarantee of smooth sailing. The authorities can freeze, or threaten to freeze, the registrations of organizations that they perceive to have crossed red lines, as they did to a few groups that supported Egyptians Against Coal. “The Social Solidarity Ministry harassed them by suddenly checking their documents,” an environmental activist said. “The check lasted for five months, [during which] their ability to work decreased.”\n\nResearch Obstacles\n\nEven if a group is registered, a broad array of extra permits must be secured to conduct fieldwork, collect samples, import equipment, and more. Interviewees said that multiple ministries and security agencies must all sign off on these requests, particularly those related to research in isolated or border areas, such as the Halayeb Triangle, much of the Sinai Peninsula, and almost all of the Western Desert, which is facing significant environmental issues.\n\nEgyptian laws have a very broad definition of border areas in some places encompassing hundreds of kilometers before the actual international border. The 2019 nongovernmental organization law requires governmental approval before groups publish the results of any studies or surveys and prohibits any work deemed to be of “political” nature (without explaining what is meant by political).\n\nThe 2019 law also prohibits “any activity that requires a license from a government body” without obtaining the license from the relevant body. For example, the mere act of taking photographs in a street or public area is prohibited without a license when involving even quasi-professional equipment such as lightening or reflection tools. Photography in or near any government building is prohibited without permits from “the relevant body.”\n\nGiven the laboriousness of the process, the scrutiny that these applications can invite, and their low chances of success, increasingly few bother to apply for research permits. “There is a lot of work that you don’t engage in because you simply know you won’t get permits,” said one former staff member of an environmental group who requested that his location be redacted.\n\nAs constraints have intensified, most interviewees say that they have had to rein in or abandon research altogether. One prominent Egyptian environmental group disbanded its research unit because it became impossible to work in the field. Another prominent Egyptian environmental group now only does environment-related “desk work.”’ Yet another Egyptian environmental group has shut down and a legal organization that previously worked on environmental themes has significantly downscaled its operations.\n\nAnother obstacle to independent research is the severe limitation on access to information. Egyptian authorities have since 2017 blocked access to roughly 700 websites, including the remaining few independent platforms for news media and human rights websites left in the country. Authorities also blocked thousands of websites and texting and calling apps temporarily during events that witnessed large protests such as during 2019 street protests. Such massive censorship, coupled with systematic arrests and prosecutions of journalists, have severely restricted access to information and reporting around topics deemed prohibited by the government including environmental issues.\n\nEnvironmental Activism at COP27 and Beyond\n\nIn April and May 2019, a group of African activists reported a range of abuses when Egypt hosted the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, also in Sharm el-Sheikh, where COP will be held. Scores of participants reported that the authorities delayed or prevented them from obtaining visas or delayed delivering the badges needed to attend the official summit. Many said they were physically followed and spied on and some reported being physically abused by Egyptian security agents. They also described how hotels did not allow them to rent meeting rooms, citing “security instructions.”\n\nDespite the general atmosphere of government restrictions, some activists said the COP27 conference was a positive opportunity for Egypt. They hope that it will help raise climate awareness and encourage more funding for climate action across the region.\n\nIn the lead up to COP27, some people said there appears to be an increasing acceptance of advocacy and action around climate justice, climate adaptation, and loss and damage in the context of global climate negotiations, which are mostly “safe,” and welcome territory, as they are not threatening to Egyptian authorities and in line with the state’s vision of itself as a champion of poor, climate-battered countries.\n\nSeveral informed sources said that the Egyptian authorities, through the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs, have in recent closed meetings asked several Egyptian groups to participate in the COP27 events, mostly around “welcome” topics. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat told Human Rights Watch in an email that one-off admission to attend COP27, outside the usual process to be accredited, was granted for over 30 Egyptian groups, all “endorsed” through the Egyptian government. Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the UNFCCC on August 22 asking about the process and criteria for these one-off admissions but has not received a response.\n\nActivists also report a relative ease of interaction with parts of the government. Senior officials at the Environment Ministry “are accessible and communicative,” one interviewee said. In recent months, that official-to-environmentalist contact appears to have expanded beyond the environment ministry. Egyptian authorities organizing COP27 have sounded out some activists on Egypt’s environmental priorities at the conference and even recruited a few of them to assist with preparation.\n\nSome also said that they see COP as an opportunity to bolster international awareness of the political context in which COP is taking place, not least because of its central role in hobbling Egyptian environmental activism. “There can be no improvement in the environmental situation without improvement in freedom of expression and the overall human rights situation,” one person said.",
    "Visions of Egypt review – how can this show be so devoid of ancient wonder?": "Visions of Egypt is a blockbuster having a breakdown. It argues that modern racism towards Egypt began with the Battle of Actium in 31BC when Octavian defeated Mark Antony and his lover Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt, and annexed it. The Romans looted Egypt’s art, “demonised” its queen, and “laid the groundwork for western perceptions … that still persist today”.\n\nBut to claim that ancient Rome still influences perceptions of Egypt is just bad history. It ignores the complexities, changes and contradictions of such a huge stretch of time. Anyway, why don’t they start with ancient Greece, which borrowed Egypt’s art in Kouroi statues, while Herodotus saw it as a mysterious, exotic other? By lumping 2,000 years into one unbroken wall of western prejudice, this show kills the art it conspicuously fails to love. Surely it’s obvious that when, say, Andy Warhol portrayed Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra and Kenneth Williams mugged it up in Carry On Cleo they were saying something about the 1960s, not the first century BC? Not that they’re in this show, which instead slops together some Victorian art and so-so contemporary work to make its tenuous point about Cleopatra.\n\nPastime in Ancient Egypt by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1864. Photograph: Walter White/Harris Museum & Art Gallery\n\nThere are some gems here but they all kick against the exhibition’s thesis. A Roman-era depiction of the emperor Diocletian worshipping a mummified bull dressed as a pharaoh shows the cultures interacting. And a Roman portrait of a boy that was placed on his mummy shows creative mixing of Egyptian ritual and Roman artistic realism.\n\nThe Romantic architect Sir John Soane is one of the Egyptomaniacs who elude the show’s simplicities. In a design from his architectural office, he makes plain why he prefers the “sublime” art of Egypt to European classicism. Simply by juxtaposing St Paul’s and the Great Pyramid in an architectural drawing, Soane shows how the majesty of the ancient Egyptian structure dwarfs Wren’s cathedral.\n\nCanopic jar by Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, c 1790. Photograph: Kevin Percival/Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nYet Soane’s intoxicated studies of Egyptian architecture are shown in a dry little alcove, shoehorned into a very abstract “context” of the growth of European imperialism. Across the corridor is one of the world’s strangest books, the enormous Description of Egypt, which Napoleon commissioned from the team of academics he took with him when he invaded what was then part of the Ottoman empire in 1798. Napoleon wasn’t yet an emperor but was already thinking imperialistically – and with a Romantic sense of history. “From the top of those pyramids, 40 centuries are contemplating you,” he told his troops.\n\nThe devil is in the detail. If this show explored such stories in depth it would have much more to say about the entanglement of archaeology and empire than it manages with its inchoate rage. The cultural theorist Edward Said argued in his book Orientalism that Napoleon’s cultural project constructed the “orient” as something to be “known” and hence controlled by European empires. If only this exhibition followed his subtle analysis. There’s a ridiculous expression of Victorian orientalism here: a painting by Edwin Long called The Gods and Their Makers that shows women anachronistically in a harem making the little Shabti figures found in Egyptian tombs. This is pure Victorian fantasy - including a black servant attending the strikingly pale “Egyptian” women.\n\nEgyptian Head Disappearing into Descending Clouds by David Hockney, 1961. Photograph: © York Museums Trust (York Art Gallery)\n\nThe vulgarity of this painting matches the bandaged horror stories of Bram Stoker and Arthur Conan Doyle, as archaeology inspired ever more lurid images of Egypt. There’s no stranger example of western Egyptomania than Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, a cinema built as an over the top recreation of an Egyptian temple in 1922, the year Tutankhamun’s tomb was found by Howard Carter. Why isn’t Hollywood properly covered? The mummy horror genre is barely touched on, with an early edition of Arthur Conan Doyle’s tale Lot 249 and a slightly silly video by Sara Sallam called You Died Again on Screen. “Two hundred years of theatre and cinema have cemented mummies as figures of horror and evil in western popular culture,” says the caption chidingly.\n\nYet ironically the archaeologist Howard Carter, often vilified as a colonial Indiana Jones, is revealed here as a sensitive artist. His 1908 watercolour of a hoopoe perching in a tomb, apparently protected by a wall painting of a vulture goddess, expresses a passion and awe for ancient Egypt that’s just a breath away from worshipping its gods. This exhibition wants us to stop our love affair with this lost world but it can’t.",

    "Good vs. Evil: Are There Two North Coasts in Egypt?": "Good vs. Evil: Are There Two North Coasts in Egypt?\n\nTo many Egyptians, summer means sahel. But what exactly does sahel mean?\n\nScattered on Egypt’s northern coastline, the resorts and compounds that lie between the cities of Alexandria and Marsa Matrouh are referred to as sahel (Arabic for coast), and for the past three decades, they have provided the perfect seaside respite for thousands upon thousands of Egypt’s middle and high income families.\n\nUntil recently, sahel could be summed up as the following: a place to let one’s hair down, swim, play games, eat simple food, and make up for any family time lost to the pace of city life. But this definition has begun to change. Or rather, a new face of sahel has emerged, creating along with it a new definition that now coexists, perhaps a little awkwardly, with the old one.\n\nNewer, trendier developments began to appear about halfway between Marsa Matrouh and Alexandria, and they came with a different identity, aesthetic, price point, and target audience. And while both sahels are bursting at the seams during the summertime, some began to feel as though this new side was diluting the real meaning of sahel.\n\nThe subtle tension between the two worlds of sahel became more tangible in the summer of 2020, when a series of internet memes coined terms to distinguish these two worlds: ‘el sahel el tayeb’ (‘good sahel’), and ‘el sahel el sherrir’ (‘evil sahel’). Though it is difficult to trace back the origins of the joke, or identify who first made it, the terminology spread like wildfire on social media, and has by now become a common phrase understood by the majority of the people who frequent Egypt’s north coast.\n\nWhile it is clear that ‘el sahel el tayeb’ refers to the traditional sahel and ‘el sahel el sherrir’ refers to the newer, trendier side of it, we asked the readers of Egyptian Streets if they can tell us what distinguishes the two in their opinion.\n\nHere is what they said:\n\nWhere you are\n\nOne of the rough rules of thumb sahel-goers have developed to distinguish ‘good sahel’ from ‘evil sahel’ is the location. When asked, most of our readers identified Marina, a once massively popular compound about 150 kilometers west of Alexandria, as the last point of ‘good sahel’. Everything further west was more likely to be considered ‘evil’.\n\nIn the past, Marina itself was the closest thing to what is now considered ‘evil’ as it was the ultimate hotspot for parties and social gatherings. However with time, its trendiness faded, and it became a no-man’s land that neither fully belongs to ‘good sahel’ nor to ‘evil sahel’. Public policy student Zeineldin Elkhabiry tells Egyptian Streets that, in his view, Marina acts as a “buffer” between the two.\n\n“Once you finish Marina, it’s sherrir. Marina is the Black Gates,” adds PeaceCake co-Founder Marwan Imam, making a reference to The Lord of the Rings.\n\nHow you get in\n\nLocation may be an indicator, but it is not always an entirely reliable one, as there are pockets of what is considered ‘good sahel’ hidden beyond Marina, in addition to the few dozen kilometers of coastline before Marsa Matrouh that are not home to new and trendy developments.\n\nWhat several readers did identify, however, is that compounds lumped into the ‘evil sahel’ category tend to be far more gatekept – and they meant that quite literally. The gates of the resorts and compounds that are considered ‘evil’ have far tighter security and more demanding entry requirements.\n\nYomna Elshobaky, who works as an account manager at a tech company tells Egyptian Streets that to enjoy ‘evil sahel’, there is a need to “drive miles and miles to enjoy a small spot on the beach after getting codes to enter and making reservations everywhere to secure a spot.”\n\nThis does not apply in so-called ‘good sahel’, where telling the security guards at the gates the number of the chalet you’re heading to is usually more than enough to get you inside.\n\nWhat you do and how much it costs you\n\nThough Twitter and Facebook gave space for more nuanced answers, readers on Instagram gave a nearly unanimous response on the key difference between the two sahels: the cost.\n\nWhile owning or renting a chalet or apartment is only accessible to middle and high income families regardless what part of sahel you are in, the ranges vary dramatically, as does the cost of everything you do while you are there.\n\nRestaurant and coffee house chains that are popular in Cairo are present in parts of ‘evil sahel’, but to their prices, the so-called sahel-tax is added: the price of the same drink from the same chain can vary differently from Cairo to sahel. Even the simple foods and activities associated with the old-school ‘good sahel’ are more expensive if they are found in the newer sahel. For instance if it costs you EGP 30 to buy feteer (a quintessentially Egyptian filled pastry) in ‘good sahel’, it could easily cost you three or four times that amount on the other side.\n\nIn a few parts of new sahel, the beaches themselves require an entry fee, something that does not exist in any part of old-school sahel. One of the most popular compounds has even built a yacht marina lined with high end restaurants and brand name shops.\n\nUniversity administrator Heba Mohamed tells Egyptian Streets that this also applies to children’s activities. Sahel has long since been the highlight of children’s years, and while traditionally this has always been due to the simple activities made available to them by the beach, there are now far more complex and pricy activities according to Mohamed, and she says that it has become more difficult for parents to provide their children with an enjoyable experience.\n\nComparing the cost of the same good or service in the two sahels does not fully capture the difference in cost alone, as many of our readers alluded to. Even were the feteer and the round at the billiards table priced identically, spending time in ‘evil sahel’ is far more reliant on consumption.\n\nThere is simply far more to attend, eat, drink, and buy there. While in a old-school sahel compound, as reader Lina Gado tells us, you may find a feteer and zalabya vendor, a cafeteria with a few games, a bike rental spot, and a small supermarket, a compound in the trendier sahel has multiple party venues, coffee shops, eateries, and home decor shops – even high end jewelers, clothing, and cosmetics shops.\n\nNot long before the summer, the TikTok account BubbleBurst, students at the American University in Cairo asked other students how much they spend in a day in Sahel. The lowest number mentioned was EGP 1000 (50 USD), while the highest was over EGP 10000 (USD 500).\n\n“I pay in dollars,” says one student in the video. In old-school sahel, a vacationer would be hard put to find anything to spend more than EGP 100 (USD 5) on.\n\nWhat you wear\n\nA beachside vacation needs the right swimwear, and that is another point of difference readers mentioned. Alia Soliman, who works in gender and development, tells Egyptian Streets that in evil sahel, you will only very rarely find hijab-friendly swimsuits, often referred to as burkinis. Often, women wearing such swimwear will receive funny looks from their fellow vacationers.\n\nOn the other hand, Soliman says that it is also very likely for a woman in a bikini to feel uncomfortable at a pool or beach in ‘good sahel’ as she will likely not be surrounded by others wearing the same style.\n\nDress code differences are not exclusively related to swimwear either. There appeared to be a general consensus amongst readers that the degree of effort put into outfit choices is another significant differentiator. While in old-school sahel people tend to wear what is comfortable and easy, many said that they feel pressured to dress in fancier, more coordinated and thoughtfully put-together outfits in the newer sahel. And outfit repeaters are heavily discouraged.\n\n“If you’re in a place where girls have a different slipper [for every] outfit, you’ve gone too far,” jokes computer engineer Rania Tarek.\n\nWhere you stand among peers\n\nIf there are so many complaints about the so-called ‘evil sahel‘, why then is it that it is still packed with people every single weekend from June until August? One of the most common themes named by our readers was that this was the result of peer pressure.\n\nArt history student Hagar Adam noted the element of social media. In the summer, the social media accounts of thousands of Egyptians are flooded with photographs and stories of them enjoying the most extravagant activities and parties in sahel, and it has begun to be seen as a sort of rite of passage. Something to be ‘in’ on.\n\nAdditionally, the ability to get into some of these locations has come to serve as a status symbol to many, and some find themselves feeling that asserting oneself as a member of this crowd is also a tool to prove oneself socially.\n\nComputer engineer Rofayda Karam argues that the newer sahel is a symptom of a growing tendency among Egyptians to focus on appearances. Showing peers that one is able to afford a certain lifestyle, a certain car, certain clothes, is one of the reasons this version of sahel is as popular as it is today.\n\n“[You know you’re in ‘evil’ sahel when people have a twang in their Arabic and the children speak English.” says marketer Ali Khaled, alluding to a tendency among some Egyptians to communicate with their children in English to appear well-off.\n\nWhat you make of it\n\nWhile Laila Fouad, who works in finance and economics, believes that the newer developments in sahel are built with poor use of the space and land they are in, she does not really buy into the tension between the two sahels.\n\n“Does someone want to be seen drinking their avocado super-smoothie by the beach in the morning and eating sushi at night, with access to a million types of [outings] where [they] will run into people they know,” asks Fouad. “Or do [they] want to just chill and go to the beach?”\n\n“I feel like you can do either wherever you are so this poses the question of why is this ‘beef’ there to begin with, or why is it a dichotomy of evil [or good] per se.”\n\nProfessor of journalism at the American University in Cairo, Nadine El Sayed and Egyptian Streets’ own Farah Rafik agree with Fouad, and generally argue that the peer pressure does not impose itself as many seem to argue that it does.\n\n“You want to party all night and wear make up to the beach and call it el sahel el sherrir pressure, that’s on you,” El Sayed says. “I mean you can be wherever you are on the coast and have the sherir or tayeb experience; nobody is forcing anybody to sleep in or wear lipstick.”\n\nRafik echoes this by saying that while in terms of location she usually finds herself in what is considered el sahel el sherrir, but she is always living the tayeb life.\n\n“[It’s] not about the location for me, its about what I can make out of it,” Rafik says. “So long as I am able to have good feteer, a place to swim, and a house to chill in, I’m good!”\n\nThere are also other readers who were not afraid to admit that they enjoy both kinds of sahel and that it simply depends on one’s mood. While sometimes what a vacationer is looking for is a relaxed, quiet, and inexpensive getaway from the social expectations of the city, the same vacationer might occasionally enjoy a more high-end gathering with friends, only with the added element of Egypt’s incomparable Mediterranean beaches.\n\nSubscribe to the Egyptian Streets’ weekly newsletter!

    "Not enough to declare intentions on two state solution, says Egypt’s foreign minister": "September 24, 2022\n\nNEW YORK — “It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s speech at the UN General Assembly calling for a two-state solution.\n\n“I recognize that Prime Minister Lapid has publicly indicated his support of a two-state solution,” said Shoukry in an exclusive interview with Al-Monitor.\n\n“This is something that we have constantly advocated in our discussions both with the Israeli government, and our partners in the European Union and the United States, and we hope that the solution will be fulfilled. We recognize of course that in Israel there are upcoming elections, and the necessity to await the electoral process and the composition of a new Israeli government. We hope that that government will endorse the two-state solution and effectively reinitiate negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and implement them,” he said.\n\n“It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions,” added Shoukry. “More than three decades after Oslo, the vision of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, living side by side in security and peace with Israel, has not been achieved. And I can understand the disappointment that was conveyed in President Abbas’ speech for exactly the same reason.”\n\nShoukry also discussed the stalled diplomacy on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, saying that Egypt has been “somewhat dismayed” by the lack of diplomatic progress.\n\n“There is an understanding of the dangers of the current situation,” he said, adding that “Egypt seeks a ‘cooperative relationship’ based on specific legal commitments to protect the rights of the downstream countries,” referring to Egypt and Sudan.\n\nEgypt will continue to monitor the situation, he added, given its impact on the livelihood of 140 million Egyptians and Sudanese.\n\n“We will do everything possible to protect our interests,” Shoukry said.\n\nShoukry spoke at length about Egypt’s role as host of this year’s Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP27, which will be held Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\n“The science has been warning us for years now about the consequences” of climate change, said Shoukry, who serves as president-designate for COP27, adding that the “existential nature” of the climate threat “can only be dealt with in collaboration and cooperation among all the parties.”\n\nShoukry also discussed Egypt’s emergence as an energy hub, including green energy and renewables, noting that Egypt has the largest wind farm in the world. Egypt has plans to connect its electricity grid with Europe, expanding on existing connectivity networks with Sudan and Jordan.\n\nAsked about Egypt’s message on the Russian war on Ukraine, the foreign minister said that “there has to be efforts exerted on both sides to encourage a political and diplomatic solution,” adding that Egypt and “a large number of countries from the south have suffered dramatically from the consequences” of COVID-19, and the food, economic and energy crises resulting from the war in Ukraine.\n\nShoukry described the US-Egyptian relationship as multifaceted, noting that it has been beneficial to both countries, and that both sides have recognized that value of the strategic partnership.\n\nWith regard to human rights, Shoukry said these issues will be addressed in the context of Egyptian law, and that the Egyptian people will be the “final judge” of the country’s progress.\n\n“We will continue to implement our national human rights strategy,” said Shoukry, “and to deal with these issues within the context of the political dialogue that has been initiated, and the general conditions in Egypt.”\n\n“We all have room to improve our application of the principles, values and standards of human rights,” said Shoukry.\n\nA transcript of the interview, lightly edited for clarity, follows:\n\nAl-Monitor: Egypt is hosting COP27 [UN Climate Change Conference], putting a spotlight on both Egypt’s climate policy and leadership role in Africa. Tell us about your meetings this week, and your expectations for COP27.\n\nShoukry: I've been having extensive meetings not only here, but in most of the venues that I've attended.\n\nAnd the bilateral discussions that I've had, and the visits to various capitals, my capacity as president designate [of COP27] have been discussing, and promoting, the importance that we build on what we have achieved in Paris and Glasgow, and must address this scope with the implementation COP in Paris and Glasgow.\n\nWe agreed on the road map, and it's time now that we fulfill the commitments that were made fully and at scale, and to move ahead with our ambitions.\n\nWe've been encouraging all to present their revised NDCs, and we are hopeful that this COP will continue to build trust between developing and developed nations, and fulfill the ambitions to effectively deal with climate change.\n\nThe science has been warning us for years now about the consequences, and I think even the current state of events, with the flooding, and temperatures, and cyclones, and the devastating effect they have had, this all really highlights the existential nature of the climate threat, and can only be dealt with in collaboration and cooperation among all the parties.\n\nAl-Monitor: A quick follow up, at a business dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, you said that Egypt is seeking to become a regional energy hub, focusing on clean and sustainable energy, shifting from fossil fuels. … How does that fit with your COP27 agenda?\n\nShoukry: Well, we have recognized early on the benefits of renewable energy, that it is one of the drivers of our economic development, and our potential because of the abundance of solar energy, wind energy to take full advantage of it, and to be able to export large amounts of it.\n\nThis also includes electricity, and green energy to produce green hydrogen, which is also considered an important source of energy for the future.\n\nWe have revised our expectations and our targets for our energy mix from 30% up to 42% by 2035, which is quite a considerable achievement that we hope to follow up with the expansion of our abilities in the solar field and wind.\n\nCurrently, we have the largest wind farm in the world, and are further expanding our wind capacities, but we are also in discussions with the European Union and with our partners in Greece for connectivity, to be able to connect Egypt and its power grid to the European power grid.\n\nWe currently already have connectivity with Sudan [and] with Jordan, and hope to expand that I think also to Saudi Arabia. Hopefully we will be able to, as we expand our capabilities, take advantage of that resource economically, but also provide our partners in the region the ability of interconnectivity and inter-reliance.\n\nAl-Monitor: In your meetings this week you have stressed the need to resume negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam [GERD] as soon as possible to reach a binding agreement on filling and operating the dam in a way that would serve the interests of all parties involved and preserve Egypt’s rights to the Nile water — that the status quo is a source of instability. Please bring us up to date on where diplomacy stands, and whether you have been getting traction in your talks this week.\n\nShoukry: I believe there's as understanding of the dangers that are associated with obstruction of the Blue Nile or managing, whether it's the Grant Ethiopian Renaissance dam, or any other construction in a manner that is not consistent with international law, and with the best practices that govern transboundary water.\n\nI think we have always been advocating a cooperative relationship, but also one where there are specific legal commitments that guarantee both the optimum operation and utilization of the dam, and at the same time takes into account the interests and rights of the downstream riparian countries.\n\nWe have been in negotiations over this last decade, we have done so bilaterally, we have done so under the auspices and help of our partners, the United States, where we agreed politically and technically to a comprehensive agreement that was equitable and fair and where both sides made the necessary compromise. But unfortunately our Ethiopian partners did not sign that agreement whereas we did initially.\n\nSubsequently, we have negotiated under the auspices of the African Union, under two chairmen — President Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Tshisekedi of the Congo — and have had exploratory discussions and contexts of an informal nature that unfortunately have not resulted in any progress.\n\nSo we are somewhat dismayed, but we, I think, have also registered our objection at the [United Nations] Security Council on two occasions.\n\nAnd on this third occasion, where Ethiopia has undertaken unilateral action to fill the dam in contravention to the 2015 Declaration of Principles that had stipulated that Ethiopia would not undertake to fill or operate the dam without an agreement, we have again indicated that the statement issued, that we would be monitoring the situation. We called upon Ethiopia to undertake the filling and operations in a responsible manner; if they do so, we will hopefully continue to monitor.\n\nIf they deal with it irresponsibly, and affect the livelihoods of 140 million Egyptians and Sudanese, then I'm sure we will do everything possible to protect our interests.\n\nAl-Monitor: Has the situation in Tigray complicated your diplomacy on the Nile Dam issue?\n\nShoukry: Well, that's a question maybe you should pose to our Ethiopian brothers. We have always isolated the negotiations from any extraneous political circumstances either in Egypt or in Ethiopia. I would hope that there would be a recognition of the importance of this issue in its own right, so that it is given the necessary attention from other Ethiopian brothers, irrespective of other issues that they might be dealing with.\n\nAl-Monitor: The Ukraine war has been top of the agenda this week in New York. Egypt’s economy has taken a hit because of the war. What is your message on Russia and Ukraine?\n\nShoukry: We are interested that this crisis be resolved diplomatically, that there will be a cessation of military activity so as to relieve the impact —whether in terms of destruction or on civilian populations — and that there have to be efforts exerted on both sides to encourage a political and diplomatic solution.\n\nWe have certainly also — along with a large number of countries of the south — suffered dramatically from the consequences after two years of COVID-19, but we were able to continue to grow.\n\nWe were again affected by the Ukrainian crisis in food security, rising costs of fuel and the pressures they have put on our budgets.\n\nBut the seriousness of the food security issue has to be recognized, and I believe is recognized at the international level. We hope that the mechanisms in place to both the food corridor that was agreed to by the United Nations should be expanded — there should be more transparency in the distribution mechanisms — and other mechanisms that can be put in place by the international community to take advantage of surpluses in food production across the globe should be implemented.\n\nThis is a serious issue for many of the developing countries, and I think it needs, again, cooperation at the international level to be able to offset what could be a source of instability that will have ramifications far beyond national borders.\n\nAl-Monitor: Just this year, Egypt again played a key role, and it's diplomacy to defuse tension between Israel, and this time it's Islamic Jihad, but the situation in the West Bank seems to be getting worse, and this week we saw the speeches first by Israeli Prime Minister Lapid calling for a two-state solution, and then President Abbas' speech today saying that not enough attention has been given to the issue, and he doesn't have an interlocutor in Israel. Where does Egypt stand on the issue? What is your reaction to both the Lapid speech and the Abbas speech today?\n\nShoukry: I recognize that Prime Minister Lapid has publicly indicated his support of a two-state solution. This is something that we have constantly advocated in our discussions both with the Israeli government and our partners in the European Union and the United States, and we hope that the solution will be fulfilled. We recognize of course that in Israel there are upcoming elections, and the necessity to await the electoral process and the composition of a new Israeli government.\n\nWe hope that that government will endorse the two-state solution and effectively reinitiate negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and implement them. It’s not enough to declare one’s intentions.\n\nMore than three decades after Oslo, the vision of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, living side by side in security and peace with Israel, has not been achieved.\n\nAnd I can understand the disappointment that was conveyed in President Abbas’ speech for exactly the same reason.\n\nAl-Monitor: Regarding US-Egypt relations, the Biden administration is again withholding $130 million of $300 million in conditioned aid for human rights concerns; $75 million was released because of the release of political prisoners recently in Egypt. But human rights remains top of mind among many members of Congress, as well as human rights and civil society organizations. Can you comment on your response to another decision to condition aid, and the overall situation regarding human rights in Egypt when you hear these charges about political prisoners, crackdown on the press and others?\n\nShoukry: First of all, I think the Egyptian-US relationship is multifaceted and has been beneficial to both sides and continues to be upheld by both sides.\n\nSo we have on many occasions indicated our belief, and the value of the strategic nature of this relationship continues to advance the various areas of cooperation that are beneficial both to our development and ability to meet the challenges within our region, and to also benefit the United States.\n\nWe are always conveying our appreciation for the amount of support we have received from the United States, support that has also benefited the United States in Egypt's ability to meet the challenges of the region, and to cooperate and synergize the United States and US forces, as was demonstrated on various occasions when the need arose that we should act together in terms of the convergence of our policies’ and objectives’ conditionality.\n\nRegarding the decision on the part of the United States Congress, we will continue to address the issues of human rights from the perspective of our commitment to enhancing and promoting the human rights of our citizens, our children and grandchildren, and we do so within the conditions that are prevalent and within the confines of the laws and regulations that have been issued through a legislative process.\n\nWe will continue to evaluate our own progress in these issues, and the Egyptian people will be the final judge of the degree of the fulfillment of their aspirations.\n\nCertainly we have made progress, and will continue to implement our national human rights strategy, and to deal with these issues within the context of the political dialogue that has been initiated, and the general conditions in Egypt, whether in terms of the political, economic, cultural conditions that govern any countries, application of rights and liberty.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is it fair to say, because the National Commission on Human Rights and the dialogue, which you began last year, are two major initiatives by the government to deal with human rights — does the government recognize that these are issues to be addressed, and that those two initiatives are taken as priorities to show progress?\n\nShoukry: Egypt is no different from any other government. I think any other government that would deny that there is room for improvement in the areas of human rights would call to doubt its sincerity in applying itself effectively in this area. I don't want to comment on others, but I believe that we all have room to improve our application of the principles, values and standards of human rights.",

    "UN Human Rights Council 51: UK statement for the Item 4 General Debate": "Thank you, Mr President,\n\nThe former High Commissioner’s report found that possible crimes against humanity have taken place in Xinjiang, China. It found evidence that Muslim women are being forcibly sterilised. That Uyghurs are not allowed to practice their religion or speak their own language. That people are being detained and tortured– merely because they belong to a minority group. We cannot ignore such severe and systematic breaches of human rights. This Council must not, cannot, stay silent.\n\nWe have oft spoken in this Chamber of Putin’s flouting of international law through his military aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe sham referendums currently being held in Ukraine can have neither legal effect nor legitimacy. Russia can’t change the borders of another sovereign state. It’s a clear breach of the UN Charter.\n\nWe have also repeatedly heard the harrowing reports of Russia’s violations of human rights in Ukraine, including of those subjected to Russia’s so-called filtration operations. Aggression overseas is accompanied by repression at home as those brave Russians who dare to speak out against Putin’s war are detained in their thousands.\n\nMr President,\n\nThe death of Mahsa Amini in Iran, following her arrest, has shocked the world. We call on Iran to carry out independent, transparent investigations into her death and the excessive violence used against subsequent protests.\n\nIn Ethiopia it is crucial that the truce is reinstated and that peace talks begin to avoid a repeat of the atrocities including extrajudicial killings and sexual violence seen earlier in this conflict.\n\nFinally, ahead of COP 27 - we urge Egypt to ensure that independent civil society, human rights defenders, and the media can operate freely. The success of the conference - as we saw in Glasgow - depends on vibrant civil society participation.\n\nThank you",

    "Egypt’s Foreign Policy Under Al-Sisi and Its Relationship with Saudi Arabia": "Egypt’s foreign policy after the Arab Spring\n\nIn the context of the Arab Spring, where popular uprisings brought down various regimes in the Middle East, the fall of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was the most spectacular in the region.\n\nMuhammad Mursi, from the Muslim Brotherhood party, was elected as the first civilian president of Egypt in June 2012. Yet his short year in office did not bring about a radical shift in Egypt’s foreign policy, due to the effort to avoid provoking counterproductive reactions under the new government. Despite this, certain nuances Mursi introduced revealed a moderate commitment to reshaping some features of Egyptian foreign policy. In contrast to the close ties between Hosni Mubarak’s regime and Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey became preferred allies, as they supported the revolution and the subsequent political transition, with Doha providing $8 billion in economic aid.\n\nOn the one hand, the new post-revolutionary government was keen to show its willingness to play a responsible role in international affairs, maintaining the peace agreements with Israel, and thus securing its annual $1.5 billion in aid from Washington. In addition to this, Mursi was the first Egyptian president to travel to Tehran after 33 years, to participate in the 16th Non-Aligned Summit in August 2012, signaling a moderate attempt to balance the relationship with Iran. On the other hand, one of his first steps was to open Egypt’s border with Gaza to bring relief to its inhabitants, showing the usefulness of his good communication with Hamas in Gaza, in stark contrast with the Mubarak regime. It helped the US achieve a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in November 2012.\n\nAl-Sisi’s arrival and the reconfiguration of Egyptian foreign policy\n\nThe reforms undertaken by the new government, coupled with various internal disputes concerning the new constitution put forward by the Muslim Brotherhood, led to a coup led by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Under the new regime headed by al-Sisi, the link with Saudi Arabia was not only re-established but was intended to create a huge political and economic dependency.\n\nThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia, along with the UAE and Kuwait, provided Cairo with $12 billion in economic aid, rising to $42 billion in the following years. Among the reasons why these Petro monarchies were interested in supporting the new al-Sisi government, it is relevant to mention the fact that they shared a common interest in putting an end to Arab Spring governments in the region and opposing the Muslim Brotherhood, declared to be a terrorist movement. In payment for their support, Riyadh demanded unwavering subservience to Saudi leadership and its regional objectives.\n\nEgypt under al-Sisi has shown its allegiance to Saudi Arabia by joining the boycott of Qatar initiated in June 2017, as well as by transferring sovereignty over the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia. Likewise, concerning Libya, which has been without a stable unified government since the fall of Gaddafi in 2011, Egypt is one of the main supporters of General Khalifa Haftar, who has installed a self-proclaimed government in Tobruk against the government in Tripoli, which is supported by Qatar and includes the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood. For Cairo, along with the UAE, the elimination of the Muslim Brotherhood is a priority governing both its domestic and foreign policy.\n\nEgypt’s growing dependence on Riyadh and its impact on its quest for regional leadership\n\nThe heavy dependence of Egypt’s current foreign policy on Arab financial help constrains the nation’s leadership in the region. Besides, there is a need to maintain unwavering US support for Egypt, which remains strongly dependent on his alliance and cooperation with the two main allies of the US in the Middle East: Israel and Saudi Arabia. This is also coupled with the cooperation between Riyadh and Cairo on the Palestinian dossier, of great value to Israel, as well as the common interest in curbing Iran’s growing influence in Sudan and Eritrea.\n\nNonetheless, the points of friction are multiplying. Egypt supported maintaining the regime of Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir, who was subjected to an intense wave of protests calling for his ouster in December 2018, whereas Saudi Arabia and the UAE backed the idea of resolving the crisis by seeking a reliable successor to al-Bashir, such as Sudanese intelligence chief Salah Gosh. That solution would allow Riyadh to continue to peacefully deploy its influence in the Horn of Africa.In conclusion, Egypt’s dilemma in its vacillating foreign policy lies in its aspiration for leadership and its limited capacity to develop it. Egypt has lost its historical potential for leadership, but it has also lost the capacity to come up with the kind of initiative that could restore it. This is a source of frustration widely felt in a nation with a strong nationalist sentiment. The current regime under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, while trying to maintain an image of leadership in an instrumental sense, with a view to confirming its legitimacy, is too afflicted by its evident weakness and dependence to be able to decisively influence events in the Arabian region.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.",
    "EBRD and donors support electric transport provider in Egypt": "Investment to enable Abou Ghaly Motor’s purchase of 250 greener vehicles\n\nNew fleet to demonstrate benefits of e-mobility in Egypt and help reduce CO 2 emissions\n\nUK grant through HIPCA and EU guarantee to support environmentally friendlier modes of transport\n\nThe EBRD and donors are enabling Abou Ghaly Motors (AGM), a leading transport provider in Egypt, to purchase 250 range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) for its taxi services, in a boost for the development of the country’s e-mobility sector.\n\nA loan of EGP 187.4 million (equivalent of about €10 million) from the EBRD is being complemented by an investment grant of €3 million from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) through the High-Impact Partnership on Climate Action (HIPCA; also supported by Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the TaiwanICDF). The European Union’s EFSD (European Fund for Sustainable Development), the financing arm of the EU External Investment Plan promoting investment in Africa and the EU Neighbourhood, is providing a first-loss guarantee for the EBRD loan.\n\nAGM’s new fleet will support the company’s expansion along a greener pathway and promote an environmentally friendlier mode of transport in Egypt as the new vehicles will be able to convert liquid fuel into electric energy during their journeys, thereby reducing emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants.\n\nElectric mobility is expected to grow significantly in Egypt over the next few years, opening up new economic and employment opportunities across the country. AGM’s investment activities will be accompanied by training to improve skills in the maintenance and repair of the vehicles, further encouraging the development of the e-mobility sector.\n\n“New and electric transport solutions are key to building a greener economy and improving air quality in cities,” explained Nandita Parshad, EBRD Managing Director, Sustainable Infrastructure Group. “I am pleased that our investment – backed by our partners and donors from the EU and FCDO – will showcase the benefits of e-mobility and provide a more efficient, safer and inclusive option for transport. It is also in line with the objective of Egypt's Presidency of COP27 to move from pledges to implementation.”\n\nMohamed Abou Ghaly, Board Member of AGM, said: “As a leading mobility solutions provider in Egypt, we are delighted to continue our long-term partnership with the EBRD, strengthening our growth plans and accelerating the development of the green mobility sector in Egypt. With Egypt proudly hosting COP27 in November 2022, we are delighted to support our country’s efforts towards sustainable growth through this electric cabs deal, together with our partners LEVC (London Electric Vehicle Company) and the EBRD.”\n\nQudsi Rasheed, the UK Embassy’s Chargé d’Affaires, said: “E-mobility is a core part of Egypt’s green transition but also essential to delivering an ambitious COP27. The UK is committed to supporting both of these aims. I am delighted that the UK is contributing to this pioneering Egyptian e-vehicle fleet through our partnership with the EBRD and hope to see further exciting announcements in the future.”\n\nHenrike Trautmann, EU Director for the Neighbourhood South at DG NEAR, said: “The EU continues to support the green agenda in Egypt. The guarantee support to the EBRD investment will significantly contribute to promoting sustainable mobility and reducing pollution in the country.”\n\nEgypt is a founding member of the EBRD. Since the start of its operations there in 2012, the Bank has invested more than €9.8 billion in 152 projects in the country."
