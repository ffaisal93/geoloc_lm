    "Gold sourcing and Switzerland in focus at the Human Rights Council": "Melting point: four of the world's biggest gold refineries call Switzerland home. Keystone / Pat Roque\n\nAs the latest session of the Human Rights Council got underway at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva, illegally-mined gold came up in multiple discussions, with the role of importers, including Switzerland, being cited in UN findings.\n\nThis content was published on September 26, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPaula Dupraz-Dobias Paula Dupraz-Dobias is an award-winning Geneva-based journalist covering environment, business, international organizations, humanitarian crises and Latin America.\n\nLast week, a special rapporteur investigating the use of mercury in small-scale gold mining and a UN fact-finding mission on Venezuela presented separate reports to the council on the impact of gold mining on many communities and the environment, particularly in the Amazon basin.\n\nUN investigators cited human rights abuses such as sexual exploitation of women and children, mercury poisoning and child labour affecting communities where illegal gold production occurs, and pointed the finger at the responsibility of countries buying the metal.\n\nThe reports said global buyers such as Switzerland – through which roughly two-thirds of global trade transits – need to ensure that human rights are respected throughout supply chains.\n\nInsatiable demand and a lack of due diligence\n\n“This is a serious issue,” Marcos Orellana, the UN’s special rapporteur on toxic substances, who investigated human rights abuses in small-scale mining, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “In the coming months and years, we can expect further scrutiny by human rights mechanisms of the gold sector and of countries where refiners are located, including Switzerland.”\n\nSwitzerland is the top global importer of gold, having purchased CHF90 billion ($92.3 billion) of the metal in 2021. Four of the biggest refineries globally are located in Switzerland, two of which are foreign-owned.\n\nIn 2020, the Reuters news agency estimated that three of the top refiners – Valcambi, Argor-Heraeus and PAMP – refined roughly 1,500 tonnes of gold annually.\n\nOrellana described to the Human Rights Council last Tuesday how pregnant women in Indigenous communities living downstream from gold mining in the Bolivian jungle had high mercury blood levels due to consumption of contaminated fish, while sexual abuse and violence was prevalent in mining areas. The reportExternal link describes how even on Pacific islands, thousands of kilometres from gold mines, elevated levels of mercury were found in residents, due to global contamination in oceans.\n\nAccording to the UN, some 10 to 15 million people were directly employed in small-scale gold mining globally in 2017, including roughly a million children and 4.5 million women.\n\nMercury, which is used to separate the gold from other substances, is a highly toxic heavy metal, that bio-accumulates in living beings and can cause permanent damage in humans including neurological disorders, reproductive disorders and death.\n\n“The use of mercury is propelled by the insatiable demand for gold by financial markets and jewelers in the wealthiest countries,” Orellana told the Human Rights Council assembly. “Refineries in industrial countries which buy the gold lack adequate mechanisms for due diligence to address the human rights abuses associated with mercury and small-scale gold mining.” The report singled out by name Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which in 2020 topped the Alpine nation in terms of gold imports.\n\nSpeaking to SWI by phone after his exposé, he said that Switzerland needed to do more.\n\n“Switzerland… does not have an adequate traceability system that would require refineries to know where the gold came from and how it was mined,” Orellana said. “The traceability system that Switzerland has ends with the intermediary country. This gap is exploited by criminal syndicates and drug cartels that traffic in mercury and gold.”\n\n“While the gold industry profits, human rights suffer,” he added.\n\nIn Peru’s southeastern Madre de Dios region, SWI previously reportedExternal link how nearly 1,000 square kilometres of rainforest had been lost, as illegal miners sold their gold to buyers, including allegedly in Switzerland, willing to turn a blind eye.\n\nFollowing Orellana’s presentation to the council, more than 40 countries participated in an interactive dialogue on measures needed to reduce human rights abuses in small-scale mining. The Swiss mission was not one of them.\n\nPaola Ceresetti, a spokesperson for the mission, later responded to SWI’s request to comment following the publication of the report. “In Switzerland, the gold trade is controlled by one of the strictest legislations in the world. The law on the regulation of precious metals and money laundering in particular aim to ensure that gold handled by refiners does not originate from fraudulent sources,” she wrote in an email.\n\nVenezuela’s gold abyss\n\nAccording to another related report to the Human Rights Council, armed violence between sindicatos – criminal groups controlling mines – as well as labour and sexual exploitation, and horrific punishments through arbitrary justice, are rife in Venezuela’s gold mining region. The area known as the Arco Minero was created specifically to mine resources as the country’s economy slid, with the hope that it would attract foreign investment. Residents as well as miners were often “caught in a crossfire of violence in the struggle to control gold,” Francisco Cox, a member of the fact-finding mission told journalists.\n\nThe report will be presented in session today to the Human Rights Council.\n\nCox said non-state actors, such as the sindicatos, as well as authorities, including military and civilian leaders, which hold financial interests in mining operations, were responsible for killings, extorsion, corporal punishment and gender-based violence.\n\nWhile official data is sparse and lacking in transparency, various reports estimate that between 70-90% of gold sourced from the mining region is illegally produced, Cox said.\n\nThe Venezuela report recommended that countries importing gold adopt measures to prevent gold laundering as well as money laundering from the gold sourced in Venezuela’s mining regions.\n\nOfficial Swiss data shows that the country stopped importing gold directly from Venezuela in 2016. But since then, there has been concern that gold could wind up in Switzerland after transiting through other countries.\n\nVenezuela’s mission to the UN in Geneva did not respond to a request by SWI to comment on allegations of collusion and involvement of authorities in the gold trade.\n\nTransparency on trial\n\nAs pressure mounts on importers of gold to ensure cleaner sourcing, Swiss refiners recently responded by pledging to remove all gold originating in Indigenous lands from their supply chains. In 2020, Japanese-owned Neuchâtel-based Metalor said it was halting purchases from artisanal mines.\n\nSwiss data nonetheless show that large volumes of gold are imported from non-producing countries, including in the Middle East and Europe, begging the question of where the gold originates.\n\nMany are pushing for answers.\n\nThe Society for Threatened Peoples, a Bern-based NGO, is awaiting a decision in the coming months from the Supreme Court, following its request submitted in 2018 to the federal customs authority to publish files relating to the exact origin of gold imported into the country, arguing that was is in the public interest to know. STP has long investigated illegal gold production in the Amazon and its links to Swiss refiners.\n\nEdited by Virginie Mangin\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

    "How are RVs and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?": "Webinar: How are residual values and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?\n\nRead next More collaboration needed across automotive industry to hit climate goals\n\nPaired with supply-chain disruptions and ongoing component shortages, the energy crisis and rising costs of living are impacting automotive markets across Europe. Even Switzerland – one of the world’s most stable vehicle markets – cannot escape these latest developments. So, how are the country’s used and new-car markets holding up and how are residual values (RVs) developing?\n\nThis and other questions were addressed by Eurotax Switzerland (part of the Autovista Group) in its latest webinar, Automotive Trends in Switzerland. Robert Madas (regional head of valuations, Austria, Poland, Switzerland) was joined by Hans-Peter Annen (head of valuations, Switzerland) and Patrick Schneider (deputy valuations and quality manager, Switzerland) to analyse recent market traits.\n\nOne key development is the rising prices of new passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. As Annen explained, list prices are going up for a number of reasons; there are real price increases and also a change in the model mix. New vehicles are also becoming more connected and carry the latest technology, including advanced-driver assistance systems. Additionally, electrification is having an impact on list prices as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) tend to be more expensive than their fossil fuel-based counterparts.\n\nDevelopment of list prices for passenger cars, Switzerland, 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nAs is well known, 2019 was the last ‘normal’ year for the automotive industry. New-car registrations have seen steep declines since COVID-19 disrupted markets in 2020 and 2021. While some had hoped for a recovery in 2022, the war in Ukraine is fuelling further uncertainty. Switzerland is less reliant on Russian gas than neighbouring Germany, with inflation being significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe, but a sense of disillusion remains.\n\nThere are ongoing concerns that the current energy crisis could negatively impact the further development of electromobility. The Swiss automotive industry association Auto-Schweiz said this month that in the short term, the country’s power supply for the coming winter must be secured ‘through effective measures on the production side and through sensible savings on the consumption side.’\n\nThe body emphasised that in the medium to long term, the nation should push ahead with the expansion of low-CO 2 domestic electricity production to become as independent as possible, and also to power EVs. The association monitors new-car registrations in Switzerland, which have seen further declines this year.\n\nImprovement not in sight\n\n‘Since 2020, we have recorded historically low new-car registrations. In 2022, too, new-car registrations have so far lagged behind the unsatisfactory levels of the two previous years. An improvement is not in sight under these conditions,’ said Annen.\n\nNew-car registrations have dropped by 30% from January to August this year, compared to the same period in 2019. The share of new petrol and diesel passenger cars continues to shrink while BEVs, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have grown significantly in the past three years. Their combined market share has reached almost 49% so far this year. Meanwhile, LCV registrations are significantly down in 2022 – the second time since the pandemic hit, Annen cautioned.\n\nMaking up ground\n\nFewer vehicles on the new-car market mean fewer cars on the used-car market, which started to recover in 2021, nudging up 1.1% year on year. However, things are different in 2022. During the first half of the year, 390,649 cars changed ownership compared to 426,971 during the same period in the prior year, marking a notable decline.\n\nChanges of ownership for passenger cars, Switzerland, January-June 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\n‘This confirms that the low number of new-car registrations since 2020 has had a negative impact on changes of ownership, as there is simply no new supply,’ said Schneider. But is it all doom and gloom?\n\n‘Hybrids, battery-electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrids are continuing to make up ground and can gain market share. In the passenger-car segment, offers have recovered somewhat and offer days have increased again,’ added Schneider.\n\nUsed LCVs have not quite reached the same level during the first half of 2022 compared to 2021 but are still above levels seen in 2020. Motorhomes in particular have gained market share, with Schneider saying that the supply of second-hand LCVs has been stable for months, albeit at a low level.\n\nHigher RVs expected in 2022\n\nMadas highlighted some residual-values trends. ‘By the end of 2022, we expect higher residual values for all fuel types,’ he said.\n\nFor 36-month-old vehicles, Madas is anticipating a year-on-year rise of 11%. He noted that RVs of young BEVs, ranging from 12-36 months, have seen a particular increase. Among 12-month-old cars, BEVs even take first place in terms of RV retention, with a retail value of 82.3% on average. Apart from BEVs, RVs of older cars, those exceeding four to five years of age, as well as diesel cars, have seen the steepest rise.\n\nRV trends in Switzerland since January 2020\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nDemand has remained relatively stable so far and supply is inching up, too, despite long delivery times and fewer new cars entering the market. However, as the demand side starts to weaken already, pressure on RVs is to be expected.\n\nOffer prices continued to rise during the first six months of 2022 but are now stabilising. On average, prices are up 16% compared to February 2020. Looking further ahead, however, RVs are projected to decline slightly in 2023.\n\nFind the full slide deck for the presentation (in German) below.

    "OPCW Director-General visits Switzerland": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands—16 September 2022—The Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ambassador Fernando Arias, travelled to Switzerland from 11 to 13 September to visit the Spiez Laboratory and meet with Swiss senior officials.\n\nAt the Spiez Laboratory, the OPCW Director-General delivered a keynote speech at the opening of the Spiez CONVERGENCE Conference.

    "Switzerland ski holiday: Enjoy a safari on top of the world": "It was the absolute stillness and slowly emerging stars that took my breath away as we watched the sun gradually disappear behind the mountain peaks of Nendaz. Around 30 minutes before, my group had snowshoed up a winding piste alongside a trickling stream, and snow-covered trees. There are few moments in life as peaceful and calm as sitting on a mountain top as the sun descends, with barely another person in sight.\n\nMy group had climbed the mountain with the help of our guide Stephane Biner, who told us to try and walk normally with the oversized plastic blocks strapped to our shoes, but within a few steps, the strange objects felt almost normal.\n\nWe feasted on local white wine, carrots and tomatoes while the raclette - also made at a local farm - was cooked over a mini bonfire.To finish the banquet we were treated to homemade Genepi -Switzerland’s renowned, and pretty strong, spirit.\n\nThis was one of many rare and utterly enjoyable experiences during my ski safari trip to Switzerland’s 4 Vallees- the country’s largest resort that connects the ski resorts of Verbier, La Tzoumaz, Nendaz , Veysonnaz and Thyon-Les Collons . The concept of ski safari is still relatively new, but tourists are enjoying the chance to ski between resorts and taste two hotels/chalets and holiday experiences for the price of one, the safari is booming in popularity. It works by guests checking into one chalet for a few days, then on the second or third day skiing across the resort to a new hotel where their luggage has been helpfully taken for them.\n\n(Image: Copyright © www.emo-photo.com)\n\nWe started our adventures in Nendaz which boasts a mixture of blue, red, black and even yellow runs - like blacks but more hilly, aka moguls. This area isn’t as well-known as its neighbour Veriber, but its beauty is you get a share of the 400km of slopes but you’re not in the thick of the crowds. I was amazed at how empty each slope was, despite the stunning views and plenty of snow at the mountain’s tops. We spent our morning reaching the area’s highest peak, Mont-Fort (3,330m). It was easy to ski to, with lots of nice wide runs and few chair and button lifts. Those who want an extra thrill aside from skiing can zoom down this piste on the country’s largest - and fastest - zip wire, peaking at speeds of 130KM per hour. Sadly, our itinerary didn’t include a whizz down the wire so after taking in the stunning vista we put our skis back on and headed back down the mountain. From there you can also enter the resort’s famed ‘Freeride Routes’; a network of un-pisted off-piste runs with lift access. We stuck to the pistes, cruising between chairlifts until we reached the infamous Tortin yellow run, which by 3pm saw probably the highest moguls of the day. A border on our chairlift warned it was best in the morning, and as I wobbled down between hills I decided he was right.\n\nThere was a handy free ski shuttle bus that ferried us back to Nendaz where the Aprei bar, Edelweiss, was already pumping remixed Europop from an open-air DJ stand. Aperol Spritzs were being served faster than it took people to get down the Mont-Fort zip wire and we could have happily stayed there until closing time, But, alas, our heated outdoor swimming pool at our Hotel Nendaz 4 Vallees & Spa only stayed open until 8pm so after a few drinks, we submerged ourselves in the steaming water and watched the sun climb behind the mountains once again. As well as a large outdoor pool, the spa boasted several saunas, a salt pool and a hot tub. And despite being a large hotel, the saunas were practically empty as I lay back and let my aching muscle enjoy some much-needed rest. Our rooms had individual balconies that looked over the Alps, rainforest showers and double beds with crisp white linen sheets.\n\n(Image: Copyright © www.emo-photo.com)\n\nBeing surrounded by farms and vineyards, it came as no surprise that Nendaz’s restaurants were a perfect spot for foodies. Local cuisine was deliciously fresh, and the chefs were happy to experiment with both local and exotic dishes. We ate at Hiver, which served racks of lambs, grilled rib-eye steaks, a large array of salads and even a vegan curry. Local Swiss wine filled the drink menu, both red and white.\n\nThe next day we skied over to Veysonnaz, making our way down a world championship run, which experts can glide down in less than two minutes. There were lots of curving forest runs offering more breathtaking vistas, and again the slopes felt mainly ours.\n\nWe lunched at the historic Les Chottes at 2,200 - a former milking hut that still displays plenty of quaint equipment that adds a unique charm and an atmosphere to the experience. It also had a quirky ice tunnel you walk through before reaching the balcony. Most of the year, this dining marvel even has a hot tub for skiers who want to fully refresh before hitting the slopes again.\n\nAfter skiing around 100KM we made our way down the gondola to Hotel Chatel Royal in Veysonnaz. This accommodation had incredible views over Rhône Valley and a big outdoor hubtub where you can enjoy the vista in peace. The village itself was filled with rustic traditional wooden buildings and was a lot quieter than its neighbour Nendaz.\n\nWe dined at our chalet which offered an array of local meats, vegetables and breads that you could eat as much as you like in a buffet-style dining experience.\n\nNendaz has two distinct ski-pass offers. Beginners can purchase a cheaper pass that cover the Printze Sector (Nendaz, Veysonnaz, Thyon/Les Collons and Siviez), where there are 50 lifts. The second ski-pass offer is the full 4 Valleys ticket. This adds in the Mont-Fort glacier, Verbier, La Tzoumaz and Bruson.\n\n(Image: Copyright © www.emo-photo.com)\n\nThe nearest station to the 4 Vallées is Sion which has good links to both Zurich and Geneva. We took the train to Geneva using a Swiss Travel Pass that offers unlimited travel on consecutive days using the country’s buses or trains. So we first took a local bus down the winding mountains before arriving at Sion but the journey with seamless, with lots of services running throughout the day. Trains in Switzerland always seem to run (to the precise second), and are impressively spacious compared to the UK’s. During our trip back to the airport we passed the country’s famous Geneva lake where the blue waters melted into the clear sky and an array of interesting houses flash by the window - from the very old to the very new.\n\nThere are direct flights from Geneva to Bristol, and several a day to London. From Heathrow you can also fly to Zurich, which we did on our outwards bound flight. The airline offers free Swiss chocolate, so you can sample the delights the country has to offer before you land. SWISS Airlines offers more than 160 weekly flights from London Heathrow, London City, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and London Gatwick (seasonal) to Zurich or Geneva. And one-way fares start from around £76 to Zurich and from £54 to Geneva. By the time we landed back in England, with bags full of Swiss chocolate and wine, I experienced a twinge of sadness to see the UK’s flat, green landscape returning compared to the magical snow-capped mountains I had called my home for the week in Nendaz. Switzerland boasts unparalleled vistas, and impressive skiing and is also a foodies heaven - definitely worth a trip if you are looking for a new resort to explore.\n\nFACT BOX INFORMATION – SUMMER 2022\n\nSwitzerland Tourism\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on Switzerland, visit MySwitzerland.com , phone the Switzerland Travel Centre on 00800 100 200 30 (international freephone or e-mail info.uk@myswitzerland.com.

    "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful": "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful\n\nWinter view of Les Bains de Lavey, Switzerland (source: Les Bains de Lavey)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 26 Sep 2022\n\nFlowrate of the drilled well at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland will not enough to support the planned geothermal power plant. The rig will now move to the next planned site at Vinzel.\n\nIn a blow to geothermal development ambitions in the Canton of Vaud, the developer of the geothermal project in Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland reports flow rates of the well drilled are insufficient for a successful implementation of a planned geothermal power plant. The project has been temporarily suspended as the rig moves to the next drilling site in Vinzel, another prospective site identified by a previous seismic survey campaign.\n\nWe had previously reported on the progress of the drilling for the Lavey-les-Bains project by the Alpine Geothermal Power Production (AGEPP). Drilling through the hard gneiss was a challenge that the team was able to overcome, and some planned logging measurements had to be cancelled. The temperatures that were measured at the bottom of the well exceeded expectations, but there was not enough flow to sustain geothermal power production.\n\n“We would clearly have liked better efficiency, but that is part of the random nature of geothermal energy. At least this experience taught us quite a few things about our basement. Moreover, we have other geothermal projects to come, notably in Vinzel and Montagny-près-Yverdon.” said Vaud State Councilor Vassilis Venizelos.\n\n“Ultimately, the goal is to produce a fifth of the canton’s heating needs with geothermal energy. To achieve this, however, we must increase the means allocated to our knowledge of the soil. In the canton of Vaud, we know that we have interesting geothermal potential. It remains to develop it. In a general way, ” said Venizelos.\n\nData collected from the well will prove to be valuable in characterizing the subsurface of the region. The securing of the well has been completed and the site will soon be restored.\n\nFor Geothermie Suisse, the umbrella organization for the geothermal industry in Switzerland, the outcome of the Lavey-les-Bains project proves that the risk association with exploration of the subsurface must not be carried by the business or individual developers. As Switzerland has no oil, gas, or mining tradition, there is very little information on its subsurface. Thus, the risk of failure in geothermal is higher than other renewable energies. To obtain equal treatment, the geological risk must be fully borne by the Conferederation.\n\nBenoît Valley, full professor at the Institute of Hydrogeology and Geothermal Energy at the University of Neuchâtel, advises that the geothermal industry must persevere despite the failure at Lavey-les-Bains. “Ideally, we should persevere, since we know that in Lavey, there is water.

    "UK has been ‘outsourcing’ assisted dying to Switzerland, Dignitas claims": "The Dignitas organisation has said it is “fully supportive” of plans to legalise assisted dying in Scotland, as it accused UK politicians of “outsourcing this issue” to Switzerland where it has helped hundreds of UK residents end their lives.\n\nThe not-for-profit organisation, which provides physician-assisted suicide, complained the legal situation on this in the UK was “inadequate and incoherent”.\n\nWith Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur now bidding to change the law in Scotland to permit assisted dying under certain circumstances, Dignitas said his Bill was an “important step forward”.\n\nHowever, it still had some “criticism” of Mr McArthur’s proposals – which have now obtained sufficient support from MSPs for a Bill to be brought forward at Holyrood.\n\nA total of 32 MSPs at Holyrood have now given their support to his Bill, with Mr McArthur noting this was “well exceeding the 18 signatures needed” for a member’s Bill.\n\nHowever, Dignitas said that “for many years, the UK has been outsourcing the issue of assisted dying to Switzerland, thus knowingly violating citizens’ human rights to have this choice at home”.\n\nIn its response to the consultation on Mr McArthur’s Assisted Dying for\n\nTerminally Ill Adults (Scotland), Dignitas added that the UK has “so far failed to legislate outright for its own citizens despite the fact that a clear majority of the public has been requesting for this for many years”.\n\nIt said: “With this, close to 500 UK residents, including 16 of Scotland, have been forced to leave their home just because they wished to have legal assisted dying, which they were able to access at Dignitas.”\n\nEarlier this month, I lodged my final proposals for a Bill to change the law on assisted dying in 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. I’ve been delighted by the cross-party support from MSPs, with 32 members signed up so far — well exceeding the 18 signatures needed to bring forward a Bill in @ScotParl. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/SdaYTnQl8u — Liam McArthur MSP (@Liam4Orkney) September 22, 2022\n\nThe legislation being proposed by Mr McArthur would require two doctors to sign off on the patient being terminally ill, as well as having the mental capacity to make the decision and ensuring they are not being coerced.\n\nThe doctors would also ensure the patient was aware of all palliative and hospice care options available, while the patient would be asked to sign a written declaration of their intentions followed by a period of reflection, and administer the life-ending drugs themselves.\n\nHowever, Dignitas argued that this period of reflection could prolong people’s suffering.\n\nIn its submission as part of the Bill consultation it said: “The experience of Dignitas derived from having conducted over 3,200 PSAS (physician-supported assisted/accompanied suicides) is that, generally, people who contemplate end-of-life-choices make up their mind as part of their ‘personal life philosophy’ long before they would face a health situation in which they would get in touch with Dignitas to request PSAS.\n\n“Any timeframe – 30, 14 days, or shorter – leads to possibly prolonging the suffering.”\n\nWhile it said requiring two doctors involved in the process “may be seen as a safeguard” they said that this “adds an unnecessary hurdle that consumes time which a rapidly declining individual may have little left of”.\n\nAnd it added: “To only allow access to assisted dying for individuals who are terminally ill (as defined in the consultation document) is to discriminate against individuals who suffer from health conditions that are, by medical opinion, not ‘progressive’ and ‘reasonably expected to cause death’.”",

    "Becoming a Black woman in Switzerland": "For Rachel M’Bon, being Swiss has meant almost daily finding a way to prove belonging.\n\nWhen she was a teenager, M’Bon once had three police officers overpower her and arrest her when she entered the building that she was working in all because they were convinced she had broken in, all because she is Black.\n\n“I was born in Switzerland,” the filmmaker said. “Many times I have found myself at the police station because I did not have my papers with me, while my friends just went home. Because they were not Black.”\n\nDespite being born and raised in Switzerland, as a woman of African descent, M’Bon said she has never really been able to fit in. And because of the country’s legacy of neutrality, many Swiss people, and indeed others around the globe, deny the possibility of Swiss racism or discrimination, she added.\n\n“The image of perfection of Switzerland must be deconstructed because it excludes the possibility of speaking about the people who are discriminated against and also denies the possibility of fighting against this history,” M’Bon said. “It is very hard to fight against racism when there is a generalised denial about the phenomenon.”\n\nM’Bon wanted to show this discrimination and how it affected not just her life but other Black women across the country. The filmmaker created Becoming a Black Woman, a documentary that shows the micro aggressions and larger discriminations that Black women living in Switzerland have faced.\n\n“I wanted to find a subtle way so [Black women’s] voices were heard and to reveal to Swiss citizens and those abroad what is going on here, because more often than not there, is the perception that the issues of racism only pertain to other countries,” she said.\n\n“Switzerland, miraculously, has avoided this issue to the extent that it does not have a colonial past,” M’Bon continued. “[This movie] has also the objective of showing that Switzerland is no stranger to racism, quite the opposite.”\n\nThe film shows stories of Black women who suffer and fight against racism and discrimination. It also shows how their struggle to find themselves and come to terms with their identity in a society that makes them very aware of their “otherness”.\n\n“[It’s women] who are always at the end of the chain, [depicting only women] was a way of redressing a general neglect of women’s voices”, explained M’Bon.\n\nUN Human Rights report on racial justice and equality, released on July 2021, establishes a four-point agenda to end systemic racism and human rights violations against Africans and people of African descent. It calls on States to stop denying racism and start dismantling it; end impunity and build trust; listen to people of African descent, their concerns and also the solutions they bring to the table; and confront past legacies, taking special measures, and delivering reparatory justice.\n\nM’Bon said the film has started to make a difference. Various screenings of Becoming a Black Woman have attracted diverse audiences, including white young men who after having watched the film later told M’Bon that now they perceived Black women differently and they wanted to learn how they could become allies and fight against their own biases.\n\n“Some of them have become aware of the absurdity of their behaviour. That’s what I wanted to depict through the film, that in the end, what is important is that we are all human beings,” M’Bon said.\n\nThe Learn, Speak Up, and Act! Campaign, launched by UN Human Rights on July 2022 is a global call for concrete action against racism, discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. The challenges posed by these problems are not new, and neither are the solutions. What is needed is action – by governments, institutions, groups, and individuals, particularly young people.\n\n“We cannot have a George Floyd every week so that people react,” M’Bon said. “So it is important to have these campaigns. For me, it is key to reach young people and raise awareness amongst them, because they are the adults of tomorrow. It is also important that politicians take a clear stance. One must be able to infiltrate power and daily life with messages and information, and little by little develop strategies that will help people realise that everybody would win if we find solutions that allow a whole society to live in equality.”\n\nA special screening of Becoming a Black Woman by Rachel M’Bon and Juliana Fanjul, will take place on September 20 at 18:30 at Cinerama Empire, Rue de Carouge 71, in Geneva, as part of Ciné ONU.\n\nAfter the screening, there will be a discussion on “Dismantling systemic racism – Learn, Speak Up and Act!” with Rachel M’Bon, Mona Rishmawi, Chief of Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch at UN Human Rights, and Yvonne Apiyo Brändle-Amolo, Swiss Parliamentarian, intercultural mediator, film producer, and feminist artist-activist. The entrance is free.",

She stated that the event is an excellent platform to bring together potential business partners from Switzerland and Türkiye.\n\n“Türkiye is Switzerland's 24th largest trading partner worldwide. Switzerland is among the world's leading countries for direct investments abroad. As Swiss Business Hub Türkiye, we are an important contact point for both Turkish and Swiss companies; our main mission is to support the business development of SMEs from Switzerland and Liechtenstein in Türkiye,” Öztürk said.\n\nArpat Şenocak, head of the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Türkiye, talked about the relations between the two countries. “Business relations become stronger when partners have deep knowledge of each other. In this context, Swiss Days Istanbul 2022 is a unique forum to promote a business not only based on economic parameters, but also through arts, culture, gastronomic diplomacy, and green policies.\n\n“Building on a long history of successful partnerships between both countries, Türkiye can certainly benefit strongly from synergies in areas such as education, sustainable finance, and technology,” Şenocak said.",

The selection of priorities for the second phase will take place in 2024.\n\nThe Swiss migration funds, which amount to CHF200 million ($203 million) in total, are intended to support specific EU member states most affected by migration flows. Switzerland will pay Greece CHF40 million and Cyprus CHF10 million. An additional CHF20 million is planned for Italy, although the agreement is still under discussion.\n\nThe funds can be used for various activities including strengthening asylum procedures, infrastructure, voluntary returns, and integration measures. The credit also includes a rapid response fund of CHF25 million for use in crisis situations resulting from a sudden and large-scale influx of migrants. This fund was used for the first time in the context of the Ukraine war.\n\nThe agreements are expected to be signed by the end of 2022.

    "Switzerland picks site near German border for nuclear waste storage": "Swiss authorities have selected a site in northern Switzerland not far from the German border to host a deep geological storage repository for radioactive waste.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of searching for the best way to store its radioactive waste, Switzerland is gearing up for its “project of the century”, entailing burying spent nuclear fuel deep underground in clay.\n\nThe organisation in charge of handling the country’s radioactive waste said on Saturday it had decided that the Nördlich Lägern region was the best of three sites it had been considering for the underground storage facility.\n\nOfficials “chose Nördlich Lägern as the safest site for a deep geological repository,” Felix Glauser, a spokesperson for the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Nagra), told AFP in an email, confirming a report by the Swiss news agency Keystone-ATS.\n\n“Extensive investigations have shown that Nördlich Lägern is the most suitable site and has the largest safety reserves,” he added.\n\nNagra has informed the local population directly and is expected to present its proposal to the Swiss government on Monday, Keystone-ATS reported.\n\nThe Swiss government is not due to make the final decision until 2029, but that is unlikely to be the last word as the issue would probably go to a referendum under Switzerland’s direct democracy system.\n\nSwiss nuclear power plants have been pumping out radioactive waste for more than half a century. After the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station in Japan, Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power gradually: its reactors can continue for as long as they remain safe.\n\nFor now, the waste is being stored in an intermediary depot in Würenlingen, 9.3 miles (15km) from the German border.\n\nWith the new facility, Switzerland hopes to join an elite club of countries closing in on deep geological storage. So far only Finland has built a site, in granite. Sweden gave the green light in January to build its own site for burying spent nuclear fuel in granite. France also has plans to store radioactive waste underground in clay.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Travel: A grand tour of Italy and Switzerland in the footsteps of Lord Byron": "SO there I was, starved of travel for two dreadful pandemic years, and desperate to see the world again. I’d only travelled in Britain during the great plague, and even then circumspectly.\n\nThis year I wanted freedom and a summer of adventure. I didn’t just want to sit by a pool in the Med, chilling out with cocktails and books – I wanted to really see the world, and, importantly, do my bit for the Scottish economy too if I could.\n\nSo, I found the perfect solution: a grand tour around the Italian lakes and Swiss Alps – à la Lord Byron – with a home-grown bespoke tour operator.\n\nThe Edinburgh company Rabbie’s fixed me up with a six-day jaunt, complete with personal driver and guide – and I may have had the best holiday of my life. The tour set off from Milan, so we built a weekend in that beautiful, cool renaissance city onto either side of our holiday.\n\nMy wife and I were in the safe and charming hands of Christina, our guide, and Giancarlo, our driver.\n\nBoth were effortlessly knowledgeable, great company and – crucially – there to ensure that a rather complex journey through the most beautiful landscapes in Europe went without a glitch. Planning? Not for me. That was their job. I just had to enjoy myself.\n\nDay one saw us head to Lake Como. If you haven’t seen the Italian lakes, they’re breathtaking, framed by mountains, and with water as clear as the sky is blue. We lunched in the quaint little town of Lenno, then wended our way to Lugano, and took the funicular up the mountainside to view the frescos of the Church of Santa Maria degli Angioli. The night was spent in the Swiss town of Locarno at the tip of Lake Maggiore.\n\nThe hotel was a gem – family-owned, filled with unique local art and smart devices, and with staff who’d do pretty much anything for you.\n\nWe had some of the best meals of the tour here – ossobuco with the local polenta, as we were in the Italian part of Switzerland, and gnocchi with wild boar.\n\nHalf the fun of Switzerland is that you’ll find yourself in the French part one day, and the German or Italian the next. So if you’ve a smattering of languages and enjoy trying them out, this is a delight for a pass-muster linguist.\n\nDay two and we’re in Stresa. If you’ve been to Nice then you’ll feel instantly at home. It’s the Riviera in all its beauty. The highlight here was a boat journey to the Isola Bella – a tiny island in the bay replete with its own medieval castle and elegant topiaried gardens.\n\nWatch out for the creepy puppets in the castle basement if you go – for fans of the weird, they’re not to be missed. For lunch, try a picnic in the beautiful gardens of nearby Varese, home of the playwright Dario Fo.\n\nIncidentally, this tour was almost designed for literary aficionados, as nearly every town on the itinerary is connected to some outstanding writer.\n\nOn the morning of day three, we headed up into the Alps, through the Simplon Pass – a wild and rugged part of the world, where Napoleon marched his Grande Armée into Italy, as you’ll note from the statue of his imperial eagle still perched on the rocks. This has been a key staging post for European travellers since the Stone Age.\n\nWe hopped off our coach and took the train to car-free Zermatt at the foot of the Matterhorn, on a perfect summer’s afternoon.\n\nIf a Hollywood producer demanded a picture-postcard Swiss village, then Zermatt is what the set designer would create. Watch out if you fancy an ice cream to cool down, though, as it’ll come with a double shot of schnapps poured over the top, so I was a little sleepy during the trip to Lausanne.\n\nWe spent two nights in this elegant city on the banks of Lake Geneva at a rather swish hotel which served the best Negronis I’d had since Milan.\n\nDay four probably stood out for me as the highlight of the trip. After a little visit to the artisans who make the famous cheese, we travelled to Gruyères, where the air smelt of thyme and lavender.\n\nThis town was even prettier, even more quaint, than Zermatt. For fans of the weird, take a trip to the nearby HR Giger museum, dedicated to the latter-day Hieronymus Bosch most famous for designing the space monster in Ridley Scott’s Alien. Be warned – it really is for adults only, though.\n\nLunch that day was in glammed up Gstaad – home to the jet-set. We went the full Swiss: rösti potatoes with ham, fried eggs and cheese, then raclette cheese, followed by cheese fondue (Switzerland really is for cheese freaks) and plenty of wine. Swiss whites are a revelation. We need to start importing.\n\nLater, we explored Chillon Castle near Montreux. I reached full literary nerd mode when I found Lord Byron’s signature etched into the dungeon walls. The castle inspired one of his most famous poems, the Prisoner of Chillon.\n\nDay five was a hymn to nature. We travelled to the towns of Lauterbrunnen and Mürren at the top of Europe – where the Eiger touches the sky – and had lunch with a vista of glaciers before us, and paragliders dangling in the sky hundreds of metres beneath our feet.\n\nWhat we saw here was so beautiful, fellow travellers actually cried at the majesty of the mountains. I wasn’t too far behind, if I’m honest. If I could, I’d live here forever.\n\nWe spent the night in Interlaken – a town literally between two lakes, nestled in the mountains.\n\nGo to the old town here and try some great traditional Swiss food as the milky rivers run past your restaurant terrace, filled with the rich silt of glacial melt-waters.\n\nFinally, we journeyed into William Tell country and the town of Aldorf – don’t miss the local cakes – and made our way through the rolling beauty of the Unesco Biosphere at Entlebuch, before a goodbye evening in pretty Bellinzona.\n\nThen back to Milan for some down time before our journey home. The adventure may be over but the magic remains.\n\nTravel Facts\n\nRABBIE’S Travel began as a one-man outfit in 1993 owned and run by Robin Worsnop who took adventurers around Scotland. Today, the company drips with awards, has a fleet of nearly 100 luxury tour coaches and operates across Britain and Ireland, as well as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland.\n\nJust this summer, Piper, the leading specialist investors in consumer brands, injected a hefty £7million in Rabbie’s, as it’s a market-leader in off-the-beaten track tours.\n\nThe tours can take up to 16 people, but on our trip there was just seven, plus the guide and driver. Everyone had plenty of space and privacy. Make friends if you want, or keep to yourself. It’s up to you.\n\nCrucially, in these turbulent times for the travel industry, tours will still depart even if just one person books - so you’re guaranteed an unmissable adventure.

    "Switzerland to destroy 10 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 jab": "GENEVA: Switzerland will need to destroy 10.3 million doses of Moderna's vaccine against COVID-19, after they expired this week, the health ministry said on Saturday (Sep 24).\n\nThe ministry said it had no choice but to eliminate the jabs after the doses expired last Wednesday, according to Keystone-ATS.\n\nIt told the news agency that 2.5 million of the doses were being stored at a Swiss army logistics base and 7.8 million were in an external storage depot in Belgium.\n\nThe ministry confirmed an initial report on Swiss news site Beobachter, which estimated that the doses set for destruction were worth around 280 million Swiss francs (US$285 million).",
    "Switzerland implements further EU sanctions to align itself with the EU": "On 31 August 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided on the implementation of further EU sanctions (namely the remaining measures of the seventh sanctions package), revising the Ordinance on Measures connected with the Situation in Ukraine (the “Ordinance“) accordingly. These amendments render the Swiss sanctions again in line with the EU sanctions, including on already previously adopted but not yet implemented measures. The amended Ordinance entered into force on 31 August 2022 at 18:00 CET.\n\nIn summary, these latest amendments, the most relevant of which are summarized below, include:\n\nAdjustments to various exemptions;\n\nClarifications of various provisions;\n\nSignificant changes to the deposit restrictions; and\n\nNew public procurement related bans.\n\nDual-use Goods and Goods for Military and Technological Enforcement\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of dual-use goods (Article 4 of the Ordinance) and of goods for military and technological enforcement (Article 5 of the Ordinance), and the provision of related services, for goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security was removed.\n\nInstead, goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security may henceforth merely be exceptionally licensed by SECO, and for civilian purposes or civilian end-users only.\n\nGoods for Industrial Strengthening\n\nUnder the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of goods for industrial strengthening and the provision of related services (Article 11a of the Ordinance), an exceptional license may be granted by SECO only if necessary for:\n\nmedical or pharmaceutical purposes with a non-military end use; humanitarian or evacuation purposes; or the exclusive use by Switzerland to meet its maintenance obligations in areas subject to a long-term lease agreement between Switzerland and the Russian Federation.\n\nLuxury Goods\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of luxury goods listed in Annex 18 (Article 14b of the Ordinance) was extended to jewellery and gold owned and carried by individuals leaving Switzerland destined for private use and not for sale.\n\nThere were also minor amendments to the Annex on luxury goods (Annex 18).\n\nAsset Freeze\n\nAt last, Article 15 of the Ordinance was amended to reflect standard Swiss sanctions language for asset freezes (e.g. as under the Belarus sanctions ordinance) and thus now expressly requires the freezing of funds and economic resources owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by:\n\nindividuals, entities and organizations listed in Annex 8; individuals, entities and organizations acting on behalf of or on the instructions of the individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraph a.; entities and organizations owned or controlled by individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraphs a. or b.\n\nDeposits and Crypto-Assets\n\nAfter months of back and forth between the EU and Switzerland on whether or not to apply a “look-through” approach under the deposit restrictions in their respective FAQs, the EU had caught Switzerland by surprise when introducing a “look-through” concept in its Regulation. Switzerland now aligned and amended not only Article 20 of the Ordinance but also its FAQ accordingly. Therefore, the deposit restrictions have been extended to banks, companies or organizations established outside Switzerland or the EEA in which more than fifty percent of the shares are held directly or indirectly by Russian nationals or individuals resident in Russia.\n\nThe amendment also removed the exemption to the restrictions for deposits and crypto-assets used for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between Switzerland, the EEA and Russia.

    "Explainer: how Switzerland is dealing with rising prices": "Inflation disproportionately affects the lowest income households © Keystone / Gaetan Bally\n\nAlthough inflation remains relatively low in Switzerland (3.5%), rising prices for energy and certain basic consumer goods risk exerting a major impact on Swiss households. A look at how inflation is affecting Switzerland.\n\nThis content was published on September 22, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPauline Turuban My specialty is telling stories, and decoding what happens in Switzerland and the world from accumulated data and statistics. An expatriate in Switzerland for several years, I have also worked as a multimedia journalist for the Swiss national broadcaster.\n\nWhy is Switzerland less affected by inflation than other countries?\n\nSupply problems linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and the strong recovery in global demand following the health crisis have caused energy and commodity prices to soar globally. The war in Ukraine has made the situation worse. The upward trend is clearly a global phenomenon and therefore that also affects Switzerland.\n\nThe Alpine country nonetheless managed to contain inflation compared to other countries. The overall consumer price index rose by 3.5% over one year in Switzerland, versus 10% in the European Union and over 8% in the United States.\n\nExternal Content\n\nEnergy prices increased in Switzerland by 28% and food prices by 2%, against 38% and 10.6% in the eurozone.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe current strength of the Swiss franc acts as a buffer.\n\n“The euro has lost almost 10 cents against the franc since the start of the year, which means that imported goods are a lot cheaper,” explains Mathieu GrobétyExternal link, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Around one-quarter of all products consumed in Switzerland are affected.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe economics expert adds that energy prices in Switzerland are slightly less concerned by international fluctuations than for other countries, due to a regulated market where part of the pricing is fixed in advance and to a larger share of renewable energy produced by Alpine dams.\n\nMathieu Grobéty, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Fabrice Ducrest / UNIL\n\nThe location of non-EU member Switzerland, in the heart of Europe surrounded by eurozone countries, and concerns about large numbers of Swiss regularly crossing the border to neighbouring countries for cheaper offers, have also played a role, according to Grobéty. Swiss food distributors have not immediately passed on higher global costs to dissuade Swiss consumers from making their purchases abroad. But Mathieu Grobéty still expects inflation to “catch up [to other countries] by the end of the year and then to slow down from the start of 2023”.\n\nHow is inflation visible in Switzerland ?\n\nThe prices of many basic goods and supplies, such as energy, have risen over the past 12 months. For example, the price of heating oil, used by around 40% of Swiss households, has almost doubled, and gas has jumped by nearly 60%.\n\nElectricity prices are usually announced every year at the end of August. An average rise of 27% is expected for 2023, with large differences depending on where you live ‒ in Switzerland the electricity network is managed locally with around 600 suppliers. Some municipalities will receive record increases, such as Saint-Prex in canton Vaud, where the commune’s electricity bill is set to rise by 1,600% from CHF70,000 to CHF1.3 million.\n\nBasic food items, such as cooking oil or pasta, are about 10% more expensive in Switzerland. And price increases for such things are starting to have an impact on household budgets. According to the Federal Statistical OfficeExternal link (OFS), each Swiss household spent an average of CHF535 on food every month during the first quarter of 2020, compared to CHF586 during the second quarter of 2022. During this period, the average share of income spent on food rose from 5.5% to 6%.\n\nExternal Content\n\nAnother major expense for Swiss residents that is not included in the consumer price index is compulsory health insurance. Experts say health insurance premiums should rise by 5-10% in 2023 ‒ while they fell by 0.2% in 2022 and increased by 0.5% in 2021.\n\nWages have so far not followed the upward trend. In 2021, a slight decline in salaries on top of inflation caused employees to lose 0.8% of their purchasing power, according to OFSExternal link. Figures for 2022 are not yet available.\n\nCan the Swiss endure price increases?\n\nSwiss salaries are, on average, higher than in most other countries. The share of monthly income spent on food and energy is lower in Switzerland than elsewhere, explains Mathieu Grobéty. “In Switzerland, they represent 20% of the average monthly basket, versus 30% in the eurozone,” he says.\n\nBut inflation has a disproportionate impact on low-income households and on people who spend much of their monthly budget on energy.\n\n“Inflation acts like a tax,” Grobéty says. “Overnight, some households see their income cut by over 3.5%, as they consume a greater share of products whose prices have increased the most.”\n\nWhat measures exist to safeguard purchasing power, and are they effective?\n\nAs prices have soared, several countries have adopted emergency measures. These include discounts on fuel and rent and energy price caps. In France pensions and the salaries of civil servants and certain social benefits have been re-evaluated, while in Germany officials have introduced vouchers to spend on energy or transport subsidies.\n\n“All non-targeted measures taken by governments to maintain purchasing power, such as fuel discounts, can be counterproductive,” says Grobéty. “They will stimulate demand. But central banks are trying to reduce demand to contain inflationary pressures.”\n\nGrobéty believes energy vouchers can also have a perverse effect.\n\n“Higher prices are a very effective way of bringing about changes in behaviour to achieve climate goals,” he comments.\n\nHe says the ideal way would be to target the small groups of people who need help via tax deductions, subsidies or vouchers - provided they can be spent on things other than energy.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Switzerland?\n\nThe ball is now in the Swiss parliament’s court. A special parliamentary session is planned for September 21 and 26 to debate various proposals, mainly from left-wing and centre-right parties.\n\nParliamentarians will be examining whether to urgently adapt pensions to compensate for rising prices and to increase the federal subsidies towards health insurance premiums for low-income households. A temporary “energy allowance” for the most-vulnerable households, and a “federal voucher” for middle-classes will also be discussed.\n\nParliamentarians from the conservative-right Swiss People’s Party oppose such measures, which they say are too expensive. Instead, they advocate tax relief as well as the abolition of taxes on heating oil and ending the rental value tax for pensioners.\n\nSo far, the Federal Council has refused to intervene and opposes all proposals made. The majority of the seven cabinet ministers believes that inflation is bearable, as economic growth continues and unemployment is historically low [at 2%]. It also believes that some of the proposed measures are too broad and could be counterproductive and costly for federal finances.\n\n(Translated from French by Simon Bradley)\n\nArticles in this story A global stress test for freedom of expression\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

    "On environmental issues, the city-country divide in Switzerland is smaller than often assumed": "Switzerland. Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nWe like to perpetuate the idea of a divide in the attitudes of city dwellers and country people as part of debates on the environment, but it's simply not the reality, explains Thomas Bernauer. In fact, there is little evidence of a fundamental urban-rural disconnect in Swiss environmental policy.\n\nOn one side, we have the conservative country people. They go full throttle in their car, but when comes to the climate and biodiversity, they step on the brake. On the other side, we have the left-green city dwellers; preachers of climate action while remaining the biggest fans of flying. People often take advantage of these city-countryside clichés as a way of explaining the debate surrounding environmental policy and polling. They promote the image of a deep societal divide between rural objectors (who would rather protect their own interests than the environment) and the sanctimonious urbanites (who demand a green revolution, but do little to contribute towards it).\n\nThis environmental policy gap recently became extremely prominent with the introduction of the CO 2 law and the drinking water and pesticide initiative. Opinion polls and the media have also identified a divide in the forthcoming initiative against factory farming, with the rural population against and the urban population in favor of the proposed action.\n\nWhat truth is there to this (supposed) city-countryside eco-divide? The issue is complex and I will start by saying that I find such rhetoric misleading since there is very little empirical evidence for this contradiction. But first things first.\n\nNot so different after all\n\nMy research group as part of the Swiss Environment Panel used surveys and voting results to investigate whether there is an environmental policy divide between rural and urban populations.\n\nSwiss Environmental Panel\n\nWorking with the Federal Office for the Environment, researchers from ETH Zurich have surveyed several thousands randomly selected people in Switzerland about their attitudes to various environmental policy issues and their behavior twice a year since 2018. More on the Swiss Environmental Panel and a report on city-countryside differences is available here.\n\nOur survey data shows that almost no relevant differences exist between settlement areas in terms of environment-related attitudes and behavior. Of course, attitudes towards environmental issues are much less pronounced in extremely rural places than in larger cities. People surveyed in the countryside also tend to own and drive cars more and eat more meat, while those in the city tend to fly more. Overall, however, environment-related attitudes and behavior patterns are very similar—there is practically no evidence of a city-countryside divide.\n\nIsolated differences at the ballot box\n\nBy contrast, we have seen a slight differentiation in voting behavior in national votes on environmental issues since 2010—but only between extremely rural regions and highly urbanized areas. However, with an average deviation of no more than eight percent till 2020 (12% from 2020 to 2021) between both settlement area types at the extreme ends of the spectrum, it is a stretch to claim a fundamental chasm between city and countryside.\n\nIf we consider the last 20 years and include all nine area types, the difference between city and countryside is small and, rather surprisingly, even slightly smaller than is the case for all national votes together.\n\nThat said, recently there have been certain initiatives relating directly to agriculture or fossil fuels that have resulted in wildly different voting behavior between city and countryside. These include the Swiss hunting law, which saw a difference of 18.9%, the CO 2 law (17.8%), the drinking water initiative (15.4%) and the pesticide initiative (14.5%).\n\nHowever, to conclude from this that urban and rural populations are polarized on environmental issues in Switzerland is, in my opinion, based on the voting behavior of the past 20 years and the survey data collected by the Swiss Environmental Panel since 2018, speculative and largely false.\n\nExplore further In cities, a higher income means more protection against noise pollution",
    "With A ‘Done Deal’ In Switzerland, The F-35 Is Pushing Europe’s Fighter Makers Off Their Own Territory": "A U.S. Air Force F-35A soars over the Swiss Alps during the Air2030 fighter replacement evaluation. Armasuisse\n\nThe Swiss government’s signature on a final purchase contract for the F-35 and the withdrawal of a public referendum on the purchase of 36 of the jets this week signal a William Tell-esque bullseye for Lockheed Martin LMT and a real blow to Europe’s fighter aircraft manufacturers.\n\nOn Monday the Swiss Federal Armaments Office (Armasuisse) confirmed the final agreement for its $6.2 billion acquisition of 36 F-35A Lightning IIs in spite of an ongoing initiative to force a referendum on the specific choice of F-35. The initiative had gathered enough signatures to trigger a public vote but was withdrawn Tuesday in a surprise move by its organizers.\n\nExplaining the withdrawal, supporters of the ‘Stop F-35A’ initiative said a nationwide vote would be meaningless as it could not change the course of the deal. Co-president of the Social Democrat party for the Canton of Zurich, Priska Seiler Graf, told Swiss public broadcaster SRF, “We are withdrawing the initiative with a heavy heart. We do not want to offer a pseudo vote where voters can’t have a real say in the actual purchase decision.”\n\nBarring possible long-shot legal challenges it appears the Swiss F-35 buy is a fait accompli and a galvanizing win for the F-35 in one of the European countries once viewed as least likely to consider it. But the reality is that most all significant Continental powers from Poland in the east to Norway in the northwest have bought F-35s. Pending purchases by Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic further fill in the map. Add in the nearby U.K. and it’s fair to say that Europe is “F-35 country.”\n\nThe latest news is obviously further fuel to Lockheed Martin, which has said it expects that more than 550 F-35s will be stationed in Europe by 2030. That may not be all.\n\nIn August, Spanish newspaper El País, reported that Spain’s Air Force leadership has recommended buying up to 80 F-35s as a near-term option to replace its aging F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers alongside an existing purchase of additional Eurofighter Typhoons.\n\nWith the retirement of Spanish Hornets and Harriers this decade rapidly approaching and delays and political infighting within the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Aircraft System (FCAS), Spain’s military leadership acknowledges the obvious; Lockheed’s Lightning II has become NATO’s “de facto” fighter, the only 5th-generation aircraft currently available.\n\nSpain’s government was quick to brush aside El Pais’ report, asserting that it has no budget to enter into any other aircraft project in addition to FCAS. “We ruled out entering into the F-35 project. Our investment commitment is in the FCAS,” a Spanish Defense Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nBut recent reports of conflict over the workshare, direction and development of the 5th-gen fighter that FCAS is supposed to produce, do not bode well for its realization in anything short of 15 years in the future, if that. During that span the F-35 should be available and, despite its cost and shortcomings, improving.\n\nThe Swiss government’s selection of the F-35 hinged on its lower projected lifetime cost than the 4th and 4.5-generation competitors it was up against, including Dassault’s Rafale and Eurofighter’s Typhoon. The F-35’s interoperability with other NATO air and ground forces has been a strong selling point that on the surface would apply only peripherally to theoretically neutral, non-NATO member Switzerland.\n\nThe Swiss Left-wing coalition that successfully gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum ... [+] on the choice of the F-35 as the Swiss Air Force' next fighter ultimately dropped its effort after Armasuisse formally committed Switzerland to a final contract. (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut a history of Swiss Air Force tactical training in the U.S. has been bolstered by recent history - the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even with its strong financial ties to Russia and decades of cordial welcome to Russian oligarchs, Switzerland was as rattled by Putin’s drive for Kyiv as its EU neighbors.\n\n“Putin is unquestionably the best salesman for Western defense equipment of all time. He’s also been amazing at getting neutral countries to either join NATO or just buy NATO standard equipment,” says Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nOthers have pointed out that Russia’s cruel adventurism merely gave an additional boost to the re-capitalization of European fighter fleets already underway from 3rd and 4th to 5th generation aircraft. With Europe’s indigenous efforts late to the party, including the U.K.-Italy Tempest program, the F-35 has been able to fill the void.\n\n“For European defense producers, this [Swiss] development accelerates what they’ve known for some time – their [fighter sales] hopes depend on the Mideast and India and other Indian Ocean clients,” Aboulafia affirms. “With big sales to the UAE UAE and Egypt and India, that’s been fine for Dassault. Can Britain and its partners rise to the challenge with Typhoon and/or Tempest? Will Saudi Arabia come through with a second [Eurofighter] tranche? All of this matters more now, with Europe (aside from Greece) out of reach.”\n\nGreece’s well known financial constraints may preclude an F-35 buy but the country nonetheless made a formal request to procure 20 F-35As by 2028, and Lockheed Martin acknowledged that conversations are ongoing between the company and Greek officials. Athens has also ordered 24 Rafales from Dassault but if its financial picture improves and America-Turkey relations remain strained, it may well turn to Lockheed for further aircraft.\n\nPortugal, a current F-16 operator, may be a minor target for Dassault or Eurofighter given its economy and lackadaisical approach to re-investing in its air force. But Switzerland’s example has shown that Lockheed’s stealth fighter is able to effectively show up and sell itself in unexpected places. It has, for all intents and purposes pushed European fighter makers out of their own territory for at least the next couple decades.\n\nCommander of the Swiss Air Force Major General Peter Merz gestures in front of a F-35 A Lightning II ...

    "Switzerland power to team time trial mixed relay gold at World Championships": "Switzerland raced to rainbow jersey glory in the mixed relay team time trial at the World Championships on Wednesday, becoming the third different winners in the three editions of the event.\n\nThe male Swiss trio of Stefan Küng, Mauro Schmid, and Stefan Bissegger was the fastest of the men's squads on the course in Wollongong, Australia, with Elise Chabbey, Marlen Reusser, and Nicole Koller following with another good time. They pipped Italy by just three seconds, with Australia coming in third.\n\nSwitzerland set a time of 33-47 over the 28.2km course, at an average speed of 50.084km/h, with Italy three seconds behind, and Australia a further 35 seconds behind that.\n\nThe Netherlands, heavy favourites after winning in 2019 and coming second in 2021, and with Annemiek van Vleuten and Mathieu van der Poel in the team, could only manage fifth, 52 seconds down. Bauke Mollema had a mechanical early on and then Van Vleuten crashed heavily, which left them with two riders - Riejanne Markus and Ellen van Dijk - on the female leg.\n\nEach team competed over the 14.1km course, with the three men racing first in a team time trial, followed by the three women.\n\nThe first team down the start ramp was Tahiti, with the UCI World Cycling Centre and Ukraine going faster, before Australia set a fastest time, 34-25, that would stick around for most of the event.\n\nLuke Plapp, Luke Durbridge, and Michael Matthews went fastest for the male trio, before Alexandra Manly, Sarah Roy, and Georgia Baker went fastest for the women too, which left them four minutes faster than Ukraine.\n\nThe course clearly favoured those teams which were stacked full of rouleurs, with the Swiss men all riders that have done well in time trials recently; both Küng and Bissegger finished in the top five of the elite time trial on Sunday. Meanwhile, Reusser has finished on the podium of the individual time trial three times in her short career so far, including third on Sunday.\n\nIt was Küng and Reusser who set the pace for their respective gender trios, while allowing the group to remain intact through the ride, a key part of TTTs.\n\n“Our strategy was to start strong and finish strong,” Reusser explained. “We wanted to go only so hard so that we could all finish together.”\n\nItaly, the Netherlands and defending champions Germany were still to come, but failed to quite pip the Swiss to the rainbow stripes.\n\nFilippo Ganna, Edoardo Affini, and Matteo Sobrero put in a solid effort for the men's half of the Azzuri's effort, but it was Vittoria Guazzini, Elisa Longo Borghini, and Elena Cecchini who took the race close with a storming ride, but it was not enough.\n\nThe Netherlands' ride was full of drama, first with Mollema having a mechanical, and then Van Vleuten crashed heavily just after leaving the start ramp. While Markus and Van Dijk put in a brave ride, one woman down, it was not enough to challenge the podium. Germany came last, and shorn of the recently-retired Lisa Brennauer, did not look the same power as last year, so victory went to their southern neighbours.\n\n“It’s amazing to win,” Küng said. “We are a small country, but we’re a big nation in time trials.

    "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation": "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation Henrique Schneider\n\nWhile the prosperous nation of 9 million people has seemingly low inflation, monetary policy mistakes have eroded purchasing power and clouded its economic future.\n\nA cafe terrace surrounded by residential apartment buildings in the old town district of Geneva, Switzerland on August 3, 2022. The overvalued Swiss residential real estate market is at risk of a large and abrupt price correction if interest rates rise quickly, according to Switzerland’s central bank. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Lax monetary policy failed to weaken the currency or prevent deflation\n\nNegative interest rates reduced the value of pension fund assets\n\nBest-case scenario: A short recession that corrects inflated prices\n\nSwitzerland has a reputation for responsible fiscal and monetary policies. The reported inflation rate of 3.4 percent in June 2022 seems to corroborate this image, especially when compared with 8.6 percent in the eurozone and 9.1 percent in the United States. The problem with this picture is: It is wrong.\n\nThe Swiss reality is, instead, marked by an ultra-lax monetary policy and a decrease in purchasing power since 2015. The Swiss situation serves as a case study for the many faces of inflation, a multifaceted phenomenon barely captured by inflation rates.\n\nInflation denotes an increase in the money supply not supported by an increase in the production of goods and services. Increasing money supply without real collateral just makes the bank’s balance sheets unjustifiably larger. This leads to a loss of purchasing power.\n\nThis loss, however, does not occur uniformly throughout the economy. Prices of some goods may increase faster than others, leading to a greater disparity in the relative prices of goods. Also, the increase of prices is just one manifestation of the loss of purchasing power, alongside skyrocketing valuations of real estate or exchange-traded securities and negative interest rates.\n\nIn other words, looking at the consumer price index as a proxy for inflation does not convey the entire picture. Inflation, the bloating of the money supply, shows itself in different ways in different sectors of the economy.\n\nSwitzerland’s bubble\n\nIn a bid to consciously weaken the Swiss franc, the Swiss Central Bank engaged in a prolonged phase of easy monetary policy. In January 2010, the Swiss Monetary Base Aggregate was about 87,000 million francs. By January 2020, it was around 589,000 million, peaking at approximately 757,000 in April 2022, with only a slight decline since then. In 12 years, the monetary base expanded 8.7 times.\n\nThis unprecedented bloat was initially championed on so-called technical grounds. The central bank, seen as committed to price stability, wanted to fight impending deflation. (One might ask, why? Deflation, the gain in purchasing power, can be economically viable. But this is a question for a different paper.) Increasingly, the bank’s true aims became clearer. Weakening the Swiss franc was a political move by a politically motivated central bank aiming at helping exporters through devaluation. Since the onset of this policy in 2010, its balance sheet expanded at unprecedented rates. As it proved unsustainable, the central bank decided to change its modus operandi by introducing a negative policy short-term interest rate. In the beginning of 2015, this rate went from 0.25 percent to -0.75 percent. Since then, it has stayed negative. Even after a very modest hike in June 2022, it still is -0.25 percent.\n\n× Facts & figures Swiss becoming less optimistic about the economy In Switzerland, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute economic barometer measures the level of optimism that people who run companies have about the performance of the economy. It fell to 90.1 in July 2022, part of a steady decline from its peak of 143.6 but far higher than its low of 49.6.\n\nFailed goals\n\nNeither of the intended goals was realized. The Swiss franc appreciated against the euro, breaking parity in 2022, and since then becoming slightly more valuable than the European currency. The central bankers wanted to keep the Swiss currency at what they called the “fair” exchange rate of 1.20 franc per euro. Central bankers also failed regarding their other goal. Between 2010 and 2020, the yearly inflation rate measured by the consumer price index was six times negative – in other words, deflationary. In the other six years, it remained below 1 percent, and therefore below the policy band of 1-2 percent.\n\nHousing prices climbed in real terms, making life less affordable.\n\nCentral bankers enlarging the currency supply neither maintained the Swiss franc in its “fair” exchange rate vis-a-vis the euro nor achieved their goal of fighting deflation. But this is only half the story of the Swiss failure. The other half is marked by the sectors in which a tremendous loss of purchasing power occurred – due to the machinations of the central bank.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nAlongside the inflation of the Swiss money supply, the country’s residential house price index went from about 130 points in 2010 to 190 in 2021. This represents an increase of over 46 percent or about 4 percent per year. This is much more than the development of wages, which are, on average, corrected by the consumer price index. The result is that housing prices climbed in real terms. With them, rents and other real estate-related prices made life less affordable, especially for the middle class.\n\nThen, the Swiss Market Index went from around 6,500 points at the beginning of 2010 to about 12,900 at the end of 2021; even after all the turmoil of this year, it is still over 11,100 points. At its highest point, the market for exchange-traded shares almost doubled. It still trades about 70 percent higher than in 2010. In the same period, the Swiss economy grew by some 20 percent. Again, this difference is a sign that the increased monetary base did not enter the real economy, as was hoped for, but remained in financial markets, causing asset price inflation.\n\nThe reason for the seemingly low inflation rate in Switzerland is the failure of central bankers to devaluate the Swiss franc.\n\nA third way in which the central bank’s inflationary policy diffused was via the pension system. One of the main reasons for the Swiss being relatively well-off is the mandatory but defined-contribution system of retirement provision. Currently, the whole system has around 1.3 trillion francs under management. The negative interest rate cut away some of these assets. First, the negative rates were applied to the pension scheme’s liquidity. Second, it lowered the bond market into negative territory as well as reduced the returns of the pension funds. Third, it led many funds to seek risks that were not appropriately remunerated by premiums. Negative interest rates chipped away at least 50 billion francs of the plan contributions.",
    "Why Switzerland Hates You (and Why She Should) ~ The Imaginative Conservative": "Switzerland remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age for a collapsing civilization that should be looking to its example. For those weaned on the open-borders, Leftist humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe.\n\n“When all the world is socialist, Switzerland will have to remain capitalist, so that it can tell us the price of everything.”– Nikita Khrushchev\n\nDuring the great days of my salon monarchism and alpine anarchism while living in street clean Wien, I traveled with the beloved Graf so-and-so by car from the Salzkammergutl to Zurich past many a forlorn castle and mighty monastery to check in on family Schwarzgeld held here and there in attractive old banks run by the same Catholic families two hundred years on. In those days I roomed with an astute German princess whose sister had been part of the July 20 plot against Hitler and I wrote various stories for the Herald Tribune and Wall Street Journal Europe about the post-war confiscation of art and lands of the Austro-Hungarian ancien regime under scurrilous pretexts of EU legal cloak-and-daggerism. Thus, among these friends there prevailed a mentality of seeing oneself orphaned from history and, as a result, ‘The State’ could in no way be trusted—what with socialists, communists and Freimauer types leering at you from behind every foggy Jugendstil street lamp. This attitude included a rather sacrosanct insistence upon guarding one’s wealth, or what remained of it, within ye olde financial secrecy rules of the proud Confederation next door, despite the general trend internationally that the party was truly over by the mid 2000s. I was fascinated by what seemed to be a permanent fin-de-siècle, Stefan Zweig-esque melodrama that anxiously wound its way through the psyche of these characters, all of whom suffered from that very Central European trauma known as Erbsunde. This roughly translates as the inherited psychological state of one’s ancestors; a secular brand of original sin that comes with being at war with the world every sixty years or so and an outlook that regards History, capital-’H’, as a prison through which one entered by many doors, not one of them offering an exit.\n\nIt was this combination of Spenglerian dread mixed with Dr. Mabuse’s prophetic evil grin mixed with the rough splinters of noble pride still stabbing at the Habsburgian heart that compelled these members of a collapsed civilization to cast a hopeful gaze to the arrogant democracy next door—to its love of privacy, its respect for meritocracy, its love of order and cultural continuity. A country that was and remains solid, stable and secretive; a safe haven of I-told-you-so European high standards. That doesn’t need you, want you or care what you think. Today, members of another collapsing civilization should be looking to its example as well.\n\nI now live in northern Italy and my Lugano-born, Milan-raised husband stresses his Lombardian affinities to Switzerland with a rapture as intense as his contempt for gracious and degraded Rome. Many memories of one’s clean, beautiful public hospital room like a private club with gourmet food and tranquil views. Wistful respect for the cultural ministry that will long-lease to you an unclaimed castle if you give it an art collection. Paying for your sandwich with a 500 note and no one blinking an eye. The competing cantons whose modern battles consist of offering businesses lower taxes and better educated workers. The half-dozen private bankers (a special status beyond “bank”) that adhere to the 1934 laws requiring the total personal liability of its partners, high cash reserves and that do not permit speculative investment. The stately national newspaper that is still an objective, high-brow print newspaper. The Sunday laws against noise and work. The thrill of disbelief in being fined for J-walking or cited for using a non-approved color of garbage bag at your apartment building, or of police stopping at someone’s home when the wash is not hung out tidily. Of course, one does not simply “move to Switzerland”: a visa and passport generally take fifteen years, with some notable exceptions, and even then the inhabitants of your county district must vote to approve of your staying there. Ach, Du lieber Himmel!\n\nAnd for those weaned on the open-borders, gauchiste humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe:\n\nIf you enter Switzerland illegally, you are thrown back out, no exceptions. If you manage to slip through illegally and you commit a crime, you must pay for your jail time—the shelter, the food that consumes tax money. How is this paid? Forced labor, dear.\n\nSwitzerland has a zero-tolerance approach to homelessness. There are ‘homeless’, who tend to be of the minority-formerly-called gypsy variety, but they are fined and warned and forced to leave. Last year, Basel announced a program whereby homeless individuals would be given a one way ticket to any other European city and twenty Swiss francs if they promised never to return–at least for four years (This proved very popular). Violators are deported.\n\nBegging on the streets is illegal, for which one is fined hundreds of francs. In Geneva in 2015, a Roma woman, not able to pay several fines for begging that amounted to around 500 CHF, received a sentence of five days in prison in that city. The globalist cabal of the soi-disant European Court of Human Rights demanded that Geneva overturn its decision, maintaining with its brand of looney logic that begging is an expression of ‘human dignity’. The city was told to pay her close to 1000 CHF in ‘damages’. Nonetheless, Swiss law enforcement throughout all the cantons continues to fine begging\n\nIf you are employed and then become unemployed in Switzerland, your name is put in a central database with your qualifications and background in your canton. That canton will then start to send you notifications of job offers commensurate with your work history and education. You are allowed to reject two of these offers. If you reject the third you must leave the country, unless you can prove at once enough wealth to sustain your livelihood for a specified amount of time.\n\nIf you become unemployed in Switzerland, the state will give you, for a short while, welfare benefits. Once you are employed, you must pay the welfare back. No living off of the public trough. If you refuse this you must leave the country.\n\nCorporate taxes are the competitive open-field between the twenty-six cantons. These are federal, cantonal and communal. The federal (national) corporate tax rate is a flat 8%; the cantons determine the rest individually. For all federal, cantonal and communal corporate taxes combined, you are looking at a range of 11.9% to 21.6%. The VAT is one of the lowest in Europe although import and customs duties are high.\n\nThere are very strict Sunday laws. Sunday is considered sacred–not just in religious terms but as a matter of civic respect. You aren’t allowed to mow the grass, you can’t hang laundry, and you cannot recycle your trash. If you are caught sending out the trash on Sunday to one of the centers close to you, you will be fined. If you cannot pay the fine, you can choose the option of a few days in jail.\n\nGood Samaritan laws are still in place. If you see something happen or someone in trouble, the least you are required to do is to call the police. The failure to do so can get you in hot water.\n\nMemo to San Francisco: In an attempt to liberalize the drug laws, the Platzspitz or “Needle Park” in Zurich was an open drugs scene in the 1980s and early 90s when heroin users could inject the drug without being arrested and volunteer doctors supplied the needles. The scene spun horribly out of control with the number of drug-related deaths in Switzerland increasing twelvefold between 1975 and 1992. Authorities shut it down that year, with a heavy gate built across the park.\n\nThat famous healthcare system is expensive and you pay mostly out of pocket, reimbursed later. Even though Switzerland’s healthcare system is universal, there is no free public healthcare. Instead, all residents of Switzerland must pay for their own private health insurance. There is no Medicare. Subsidies are provided in extreme cases (poverty, the infirm) with strict conditions, including the recipient having to pay back those subsidies eventually. Once voluntary, insurance coverage has been compulsory since 1996.\n\nAnd yes–Switzerland still has National Service in the armed forces, where each able-bodied Swiss man has to spend time each year in a training camp that forms part of the military. Soldiers must keep a gun in their home, which is a part of the military framework in readiness for potential conflict\n\nNaturally, things are not perfect. The repeal of its famous neutrality to denounce Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, the climate-change politics, “Davos”, the perennial Socialist politician wanting more central government etc. disappoint. But the country remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age. Since winning their independence in a series of bloody battles against Habsburg Austria in the 14th century and then Burgundy in the 15th century using that famed phalanx fighting style, the Swiss aren’t to be messed with. Machiavelli regarded them as the epitome of efficient soldiers. Rich in brains, poor in natural resources, and with a reputation for discipline, the Swiss were chosen in 1506 to be the protectors of the spiritual leader of the Western world, a role lasting through to this day. And how.\n\nThe Imaginative Conservative applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics—we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.

    "How A Trek Through Switzerland Inspired J.R.R. Tolkien To Create A Magical Middle-Earth": "Staubbach waterfall, Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland getty\n\nI made a plan to journey into Middle Earth to follow in the footsteps of a young J.R.R. Tolkien. “From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains,” he once wrote, “the journey... including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911.”\n\nMy goal was to head southwest, past the sharp snowy peaks glimpsed through misty mountains that overlook Lucerne and the lake town of Interlaken. I would venture into the dark green valley from Lake Thun into the Bernese Oberland area. I would be searching for Elfs and hobbits in hopes that Rivendell would be a place I could rest.\n\nExperts believe that the inspiration for Tolkien’s legendary Middle Earth tomes, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, were all taken from this spectacular region in Switzerland. The Alpine villages are all protected by the famed Jungfrau peak. For years hikers have been visiting these valleys in hopes of recreating the Lord of the Rings experience.\n\nJungfrau peak, at Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland getty\n\nBefore visiting the area I wanted to educate myself more to the background of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973), the former english professor at the University of Oxford, who wrote The Hobbit in 1936, and The Lord of the Rings in 1954. Both of the legendary books were located in the invented world of Middle Earth. But the inspiration for the pre-historic location was inspired from a hiking trip in 1911, when Tolkien was only 19. He trekked through the area as part of a group taking a walking tour in the Swiss Alps. This was the only time he ever visited the majestic area surrounded by its towering mountains and deep valleys, and it stayed with him throughout his life.\n\nTightrope walk between Augstmatthorn and Harder near Interlaken, Bernese Oberland, Switzerland getty\n\nI envisioned wandering through Interlaken at the northern end of the Lauterbrunnen, a gorgeous, deep valley beyond with views of three famous peaks, the Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau. The views of the mountains and Alpine villages were actually mentioned by Tolkien, “I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue.” Lauterbrunnen in fact is mentioned by numerous historians as Tolkien’s inspiration for Rivendell.\n\nHobbit village getty\n\nAlas, the pandemic idled my planned journey to Middle-Earth, but I continued to examine how Rivendell and the Misty Mountains would inspire countless adventurers to trek along to recreate the journey of a young Tolkien.\n\nI spoke with Greg Witt who operates the popular Alpine Wild walking tour company: “For a 19-year-old orphan living in England who had never seen Alpine peaks, towering waterfalls, tumbling glaciers, and deep-cut glacial valleys, Tolkien’s 1911 summer hiking through the Swiss Alps left an indelible impression. Not only the iconic scenery, but the place names, like Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, and Grimsel Pass have a Tolkienesque ring to them.”\n\nHe adds, “The best account of Tolkien’s journey and how it inspired his Middle Earth is Martin Monsch’s book: Switzerland in Tolkien's Middle-Earth: In the footsteps of his adventurous summer journey in 1911-with hiking suggestions. He’s thoroughly documented Tolkien’s route and has uncovered and documented many details I wasn’t aware of.”\n\n“We offer the In the Footsteps of Tolkien tour on demand or for a private group—not as one of our regularly scheduled tours,” he says. “I live in the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Alps, which features many of the settings which inspired Tolkien. I live at the mouth of Lauterbrunnen Valley, a classic glacial valley ringed by 72 waterfalls plunging over thousand-foot cliffs. I drive up the valley at least once a week and every time consider how that scenery shaped Tolkien’s Rivendell. Tolkien also passed by Trümmelbach Falls, a ten-tiered underground waterfall that would have left a powerful impression on any 19-year-old. His journey took him high into the remote upper Lauterbrunnen Valley where he would have been surrounded by dozens of immense glaciers—something he would have never seen in England.”\n\nAuthor William Bundy shared with me the inspiration of the region, “Tolkien’s Middle Earth is drawn from a variety of influences — the green landscapes of England, the homely beauty of Sarehole Mill, and the bleakness of industry, to name a few. Chiefly though, I think, is the incomparable beauty of nature itself, which was on full display as his party made their way through the Swiss Alps, one of the greatest mountain ranges on Earth.”\n\nThe Dingles Near Sarehole near the village of Sarehole. Heritage Images via Getty Images\n\n“The Misty Mountains form the backbone of his own fictional Middle Earth, and it’s little surprise perhaps that such majestic mountains on his own doorstep would form the inspiration for his own Alps,” he continues. “These mountains often test the characters in his most famous novels, traversing them as a kind of test almost; battling dark forces that threaten to overthrow the entire adventure, and often take them down into deeper places where no lights — or hope (seemingly), are to be found.”\n\n“Back then, in 1911, Tolkien was still embarking on a journey of study and language, and his formative experiences in the trenches of World War I would be several years away. These experiences (in my belief) informed much of the darkness in his Middle Earth creation and led to perhaps other aspects of his legendarium being shaped by environmental factors (the coastline of Holderness for instance).”\n\n“The Hobbit’s (Bilbo’s) journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains…is based on my adventures in 1911…” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien Getty Images\n\n“Starting in Interlaken, Tolkien’s group traversed through the landscape to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, a deep valley that many scholars now believe was the direct inspiration for the valley of Rivendell, a place instrumental to events both in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, home of Elrond, and his council, amongst other things. This interest is manifested in the company Alpenwild, which now runs walking tours following in Tolkien’s footsteps, formed by Greg Witt, and informed by the knowledge of Tolkien expert Alex Lewis.”\n\n“I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nAccording to the acclaimed writer John Howe, in his preface for the Martin S. Monsch book on Tolkien, “Some alpine landmarks are cited by Tolkien as inspiration, the most explicit being the Silberhorn, a side peak of the Jungfrau.\n\n“It is a reminder – and a bit of a word of warning – that inspiration does not always follow logic,” says Howe, “It was not the obvious and famous mountain trio of Jungfrau, Eiger and Mönch that inspired Tolkien, but rather a side peak of one of these.”\n\nHobbit entrance to the Greisinger Museum Greisinger Museum\n\nHe adds, “Tolkien did not directly lift sections of landscape from the Swiss Alps and sprinkle them across his far vaster Middle-earth, but took back with him a series of vivid and sublime impressions that may well have resurfaced naturally as he wrote.”\n\nIf you get a chance and want to dig really deep into the land of Hobbits, there is the largest collection of Middle-Earth objects at Greisinger Middle Earth Museum in the village of Jenins. The museum houses Bernd Greisinger's private collection focused on Middle-Earth, the world's largest of its kind consisting mostly of art and literature as well as collectors' items. All of the rooms are designed to make you feel like you are a visitor in Middle-Earth. Through the door of the hobbit hole you get into the museum, with rooms that are mostly most underground.\n\n\"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. Go in peace!” J.R.R. Tolkien",

It's a very strong symbol!\" said Markus Ritter.\n\nThe rösti was traditionally a farmers' dish in rural Switzerland and was eaten at breakfast to prepare the body for the day's physical labour.\n\nNowadays, it has become as much a symbol of Swiss cuisine as a Fondue or Raclette.",

    "Near the Swiss border with Italy, vestiges of the past are set in stone": "Listen 12 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBleary-eyed, I left French-speaking Geneva at daybreak. At lunchtime, I switched trains in Zurich, stammering through my rusty grammar-school-level German. A few hours south through the Saint-Gotthard Massif — at almost 11,000 feet, a once formidable obstacle between northern and southern Europe — and, via the longest railway tunnel in the world, I stepped into a balmy summer afternoon in Ticino, the only Italian-speaking canton in Switzerland.\n\nIn just a few hours spent in the resort town of Locarno, just about six miles from the border with Italy, it was clear that Ticino’s reputation as the sunniest canton was completely warranted. Lush palm trees, dark-green camellia shrubs and pastel-colored facades give it a gentle Mediterranean feel. But that was not what I was seeking. After too much time in New York, I was aching for Alpine meadows, ancient forests and the rural landscape of my Swiss childhood. What I found were vivid traces of an ancient mountain people’s enduring struggle against the rocky backdrop of their lives.\n\nI recently stumbled upon the writings of mountaineer and author Douglas W. Freshfield, who, in 1875, published “Italian Alps: Sketches in the Mountains of Ticino, Lombardy, The Trentino, and Venetia” and wrote, “We feel disposed to cry out with delight before a figure of Michael Angelo or this view in Val Maggia.” Even though I had been to Ticino before, I had never heard of that particular valley. It was enough to send me packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA main artery for the Maggia River, the valley leads from the high summits of the Lepontine Alps to Lake Maggiore below, but it also breaks into more than 10 smaller canyons. The small town of Maggia, about 11 miles north of Locarno and off the main road, seemed to provide the perfect home-base location. Though it’s possible to use the yellow buses that offer public transportation throughout the area, I opted to rent a car and spend a few days exploring the valleys.\n\nYou don’t ease into Val Maggia. One bend in the road, and you plunge into a radically different landscape: Silvery cliffs reach down as if to restrain the flow of emerald-green water rushing about 70 feet below under Ponte Brolla, settling into deep, tranquil pools. Turns out this is the departure point for several hikes and has been the site of a cliff-diving championship.\n\nThe weather shifts fast, and as I drove, nature donned a darker, mysterious robe. Seeming to reflect the ominous clouds, the vertical rock was everywhere: in the towering promontory that frames the valley, in the traditional stone tiles that protect the roofs, in the prehistoric landslides that have marked the history of this land. So much so that its inhabitants have literally carved their lives into the many massive boulders and caves.\n\nIn the hamlet of Cevio Vecchio, I climbed through stone, moss and the odd palm tree toward more than 60 “grotti,” ancient caves carved into the rock. Thanks to a natural system of ventilation, the caves enjoy the right humidity levels to allow the population to use them to store wine, cured meats and local cheeses. Over time, people got into the habit of bringing out tables and sitting in front of the grotti to drink local wine and have a bite to eat. That habit led to the emergence of the present-day grotti, open-air eateries featuring local specialties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Life here was so harsh in those times,” said Flavio Zappa, a historian and guide, over risotto that night, “that starting in the 1850s and until World War I, waves of emigration led generations of men to Australia and California.” Some, like the Lafranchi family of Nicasio Valley Cheese in Marin County, settled there. Others came back and built the many “palazzi dei emigrati,” houses designed on the models encountered overseas. “While away, they sent money to the struggling women and children left behind,” Zappa said, “but the departures of the men created an imbalance of population that would only correct itself a century later.”\n\nThe next day, as if opening the cavern of Ali Baba, Zappa unlocked the heavy wooden door of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a seemingly simple church. Only about 20 minutes on foot from Maggia, it revealed strikingly colorful floor-to-ceiling Renaissance frescoes telling the story of Mary, as well as a whole series of ex-votos commissioned by locals to honor the Madonna.\n\nI had planned to take the cable car all the way to the Robièi area near the Basòdino glacier, but the wind picked up: A storm front was blowing in. Soon the fog hid the peaks, and a torrential downpour sent me back to seek cover at a local cafe. “An end-of-the-world kind of weather,” commented a fellow traveler as she settled into a cozy armchair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy plans did not include staying put, though. I drove back to Ponte Brolla and from there headed west within the Onsernone Valley where, centuries ago, as many as 27 water mills hummed along the river. In the tiny village of Vergeletto, I visited Ilario Garbani, a retired teacher who, in association with the Museum Onsernonese, was working to revive the ancestral tradition of farina bóna, a finely ground roasted corn flour. The storm was just above us, and the furious torrent rushed past the renovated water mill. Here, too, I noted that locals had learned to harness the power of nature to aid their daily lives. At the lovely Ristorante della Posta Russo in nearby Russo, I savored farina bóna ice cream, amaretti and shortbreads, the powder adding a unique, roasted whiff of the past.\n\nIt was time, the next day, to drive north from Maggia toward the mountains. The forest grew thicker on both sides of the road — birches, chestnuts, clusters of pines. To the sound of distant cowbells near the entrance of Val Lavizzara, I stopped in the stunning village of Brontallo, where dark wood and stone chalets — homes to the right and stables to the left — huddled together just below walls of rock.\n\nCowbells gave way to the syncopated rhythm of mallets hitting stone as I proceeded farther toward the summits, where tears of white marble emerged within the gray layers of gneiss above the School of Sculpture in Peccia. The village is also home to the International Sculpture Center, where I met artists from all over the world, selected by an international committee from a wide pool of applicants, now spending several months on an artistic retreat sponsored by the center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore lunch at nearby Grotto Pozzasc, built on the site of an ancient water mill, families bathed and relaxed on the flat stones that dot the turquoise Peccia River. I was too hungry to wait. I ordered the smooth local merlot, which one drinks directly from an individual pitcher, and which paired perfectly with polenta cooked on an open fire and a whole trout poached, then marinated in wine, a method used in the past to conserve the fish. I couldn’t resist the torta di pane, a sweet cake with dried fruits and cinnamon traditionally made with stale bread.\n\nThat afternoon, I drove to the village of Mogno, where, in 1986, an avalanche destroyed many structures, including a 1626 church. Renowned architect Mario Botta, a Ticino native, was asked to build a new San Giovanni Battista church. From the outside, the small building, made of alternate layers of Peccia marble and local granite, resembles a sort of standing cylinder cut diagonally to the sky. Designed to physically resist nature’s force and to represent the ancestral battle between humankind and the mountain, the tiny church reveals the magnitude of its own power inside. In utter silence, daylight filtered through granite arches and the skylights, seemingly bouncing from marble to glass. As decor, only the lone figure of a wooden Jesus hangs over the altar. Stunning.\n\nWalking the next day through Val Bavona and its 12 terre — ancient hamlets and dwellings, most of them still off the electrical grid — brought together the beauty of the rocky landscape and the desperate efforts of the people who attempted to survive there. With high pastures, where many spent the summers with their animals, and the mouth of the powerful waterfalls along the way, I often wondered whether what I saw was nature (a piece of the mountain) or the moss-covered roof of an antique granary.\n\nLater on, I stopped for a guided tour of the fascinating Museum of Valmaggia, itself carved within a massive boulder. Depicting the old way of life in the area, the museum offered a moving testimony to the struggles of the local population. One room was dedicated to the women who, after the departure of the men, were often left to juggle household and farm work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had come to Val Maggia in search of nature, but the discreet valleys revealed much more than beautiful Alpine landscapes. Under the rock, a society had emerged, fought its way through the elements and left us a fascinating piece of Swiss culture.\n\nBigar is a writer based in New York City. Her website is sbigar.com.

On 28.09.2022, a geothermal plant can be visited in the afternoon and in the evening, networking can take place over dinner. Register now and complete your profile to find partners to develop the Swiss geothermal market: www.connect4geothermal.ch\n\nGeothermal energy: local baseload energy\n\nGeothermal energy is a natural baseload energy that can contribute significantly to the energy transition: Provision of heating and cooling, seasonal energy storage, production of electricity. As a CO2-neutral and locally available energy source, it has a double advantage: good for the climate and good for energy independence. Furthermore, the potential of geothermal energy is far from exhausted. There is a slumbering giant under our feet that needs to be awakened.\n\nProviding visibility to geothermal energy, connecting the energy transition actors\n\nOne goal of the forum is to make geothermal energy with its various systems and forms of application more visible and to better integrate this natural and renewable source of energy into the Swiss energy mix. Another aim of the forum is to connect representatives from the authorities, industry and universities at the interfaces between the subsectors in order to accelerate joint action by all actors. These include experts from geology, the energy sector, engineers, spatial planning, the supply chain for geothermal systems, the real estate and site development sector, industry and agro-food businesses, investors. To this end, Geothermie-Suisse enters into partnerships with complementary organisations: aeesuisse, Swisspower, the Swiss Association for Gas, Heat and Water SVGW, the Swiss Association for district heating VFS, the Swiss Association of professionals for heat pumps, Cities of energy.\n\nMultiple added value to accelerate the geothermal development in Switzerland\n\nOn 29.09.2022, realised examples and experiences gained on how geothermal energy can contribute to decarbonisation and Switzerland’s domestic energy supply will be presented and shared in plenary and parallel sessions. In panel discussions experts will debate on the framework conditions and the interaction between the different actors in the energy system to accelerate the integration of geothermal for the energy transition. An exhibition area, networking breaks and targeted 1-to-1 meetings will provide space for personal discussions and connections for the development of the geothermal sector in Switzerland. On the previous day, 28.09.2022, a geothermal plant that supplies an entire neighbourhood with energy can be visited in the afternoon. In the evening, a networking dinner will provide space for informal discussions. Hotel rooms have been pre-booked for the night of Sept. 28-29th and can be booked via the forum internet site.\n\nPersonal profiles for targeted online and onsite networking\n\nParticipation is possible on site as well as online. There will be a simultaneous translation in English, German and French. Registration on the platform www.connect4geothermal.ch will open on August 15th. Participants can create a personal profile and indicate in which field they are active and which services they offer and are looking for. As sooner participants register, as more visibility their profile will get. In the run-up to the Forum, all participants can go through these profiles and request people for personal 1-to-1 meetings on September 29th. They will receive their personal schedule before the Forum. This very efficient and effective networking opportunity was actively used at last year’s Geothermal Forum. Almost 300 participants from 11 countries attended the Forum, 186 of whom participated in 244 1-to-1 meetings. The summary of last year’s Forum, with links to the presentations and video recordings, can be found in the document “Heat from the earth to tackle global warming“.\n\nPosition your company in the upswing geothermal market, become partner of the forum\n\nGeothermal is on the upswing with strong momentum. At the Geothermal Forum, the actors in the energy transition are developing the Swiss market. It is a unique opportunity to position companies and organisations in a sector with great potential.

    "3 Reasons Why Switzerland Could Be The New Silicon Valley": "0 shares Share\n\nTweet\n\nPin\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhen someone mentions Switzerland, it’s typically things like alpine skiing, artisan chocolate, luxury watches and banking that come to mind. Technology is rarely associated with the affluent country, but perhaps it should be.\n\nAccording to dealroom.co, Swiss startups raised a record $3.1 billion in 2021, with the country’s entire startup ecosystem worth around $149 billion (almost four times its value five years previously). Switzerland also has more startups per million inhabitants than the likes of the UK, Germany, France and Spain, and the second-most unicorns per million inhabitants in the whole of Europe (behind Israel). It’s no wonder that the country has attracted more and more foreign workers in recent times, with the number rising by over 9% between 2014 and 2019.\n\nThe pace of growth is substantial, leading to some proclaiming that Switzerland could be the new Silicon Valley. Here are three reasons why Switzerland is placing itself firmly on the map as a global tech hub.\n\n1. High tech salaries\n\nOne reason so many people want to work in Switzerland’s tech industry is the high salaries on offer, something that bodes well for its future prospects too. For example, one study found that the country offered the highest cloud tech salaries in the world, with the average being $133,326, ahead of the US ($114,772) and Australia ($102,423). The story is similar for software developers in Switzerland too, with the average salary being $107,922, above the US ($98,000) and Iceland ($77,720).\n\nAlthough the higher salaries are partly down to Switzerland’s high cost of living, this is countered by its low tax rates, making the country a very appealing prospect for tech workers, whether domestic or foreign.\n\nIt’s also easier than ever to find a tech job in the country with a rise in specialist job websites, whether someone’s looking for a role in software development, SAP or e-finance.\n\n2. An infrastructure primed for success\n\nSwitzerland’s infrastructure has played a massive role in the success of its tech industry. Take its top-ranking research institutions and universities like the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Zurich ETH) and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), for example. Or its array of incubators and accelerators, such as Bluelion, DayOne and VentureKick. These organisations both train up the talent required for tech innovation, and give startups all the tools they need to follow through on their ideas.\n\nWhat’s more, the Swiss government has done lots to remove any barriers to success through measures like tax breaks and reducing bureaucracy via online platforms such as EasyGov.swiss.\n\nIt also invests roughly 3.15% of its GDP into research and development, which is significantly higher than the OECD average of 2.38%, and offers a wide range of work permits for international talent. In regions like Vaud, the majority of business owners are non-Swiss. All of this suggests that the future of the Swiss tech industry will be bright.\n\n3. Huge innovation levels\n\nAnother reason for the Swiss tech scene’s rising stock is its high innovation levels. It was named Europe’s most innovative country in 2021 by the European Commission, while it has also been awarded the most innovative country in the world by the Global Innovation Index (GII) every year since 2011.\n\nOne example of this innovation in practice is Switzerland’s thriving cryptocurrency sector, which has been dubbed Europe’s “crypto valley”. As well as having a fully regulated cryptocurrency and digital securities industry, the country also boasts a digital stock exchange and a nationwide crypto fund (called the Crypto Market Index Fund).\n\nMeanwhile, other examples of innovation include production of leading technologies in areas like artificial intelligence, digital personalised health, robotics and manufacturing. The country is home to an array of globally successful tech businesses too, including the likes of Bitcoin Suisse, Swisscom and ALSO Holding. With all this going on, it’s no wonder that the Swiss tech scene has been compared to Silicon Valley.\n\nWould you like SEO or PR for your business? Contact us here for more information >>",
