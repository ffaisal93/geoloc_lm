    "Thailand to Eliminate Final COVID-19-related Travel Restrictions": "Thailand will drop the last of its remaining pandemic-related travel rules this week as the country ends its nationwide COVID-19 Emergency Decree.\n\nStarting Oct. 1, the Southeast Asian country will no longer require travelers to show proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test to enter, the Tourism Authority of Thailand confirmed toTravel + Leisure. The decision comes as Thailand reclassifies COVID-19 from “a dangerous communicable disease” to “a communicable disease under surveillance.”\n\nThe new rules “further simplifies the ability for all to experience the vibrant culture, cuisine and natural beauty of Amazing Thailand. We’re hopeful that easing the arrival process will encourage travelers to plan their visits, resulting in a resurgence to Thailand’s tourism,” Santi Sawangcharoen, the director of the TAT New York office and acting director of the TAT Toronto office, said in a statement provided to T+L. “The ‘Land of Smiles’ is eager and excited to welcome travelers to experience all the beloved destinations across Thailand just as easily as they used to.”\n\nIn addition to dropping pandemic-era restrictions, Thailand will also extend the time visa-exempt travelers can stay in the country from 30 days to 45 days. Travelers from the United States do not require a visa to enter, according to the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Thailand.\n\nThe new visa rules will be in effect from Oct. 1 through March 31, 2023, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand.\n\nThailand first started welcoming international tourists in July 2021 as part of a Phuket Sandbox program before eventually expanding travel and then once again tightening border restrictions amid the emergence of the omicron variant. Earlier this year, the country brought back a \"Test & Go Thailand Pass\" program, allowing vaccinated international visitors to travel to any part of the country and skip quarantine.\n\nCurrently, travelers must show either proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test taken within 72 hours of traveling to enter the country.\n\nThailand is the latest country to lift restrictions. In July, Australia lifted all remaining pandemic-era rules and nearby New Zealand followed earlier this month. In October, Japan also plans to begin welcoming independent travelers again, while Hong Kong just relaxed travel rules, eliminating its mandatory 3-day hotel quarantine.\n\n\n\n",
    "On the Thai Island of Koh Tao, Can Tourism and the Environment Coexist?": "Mr. Hagen, from Denmark, and his American wife, Rachel Yaseen, took over Evasion, an outdoor sports company, in May after bicycling around the world for three and a half years, and wanting a place to rest. She opened Untamed yoga studio a couple doors down, and they bought three sea-view villas in the hills on the south side of the island to rent out during the high seasons.\n\n“It’s hard to say what’s not to like — there’s a huge variety of good restaurants and it’s affordable; the diving here is so super-easy and chill, and from the villa we can sit in the pool and see the turtles and the sharks,” Mr. Hagen said. “And the hiking here is definitely challenging, because of the steep hills.”\n\nEvasion also offers tubing and wakeboarding, and he’s turning their boat into a solar-powered craft so it gives tourists a quiet ride and doesn’t harm the coral. He also has on order eight electric bicycles, and is in the process of getting their villas powered by solar panels and looking into renting electric motorbikes.\n\nEcoTao, which opened on a steep, forested hill just months before the pandemic cut off tourism in March 2020, is perhaps the island’s only actual eco accommodation, where the 12 bungalows are made of bamboo and teak, most of the power comes from 100 solar panels, and rainwater is collected for showers.\n\nFounder Yves Frangioni, a French entrepreneur and sportsman who moved to the island 16 years ago, believes the eco trend might be starting to catch on with tourists and businesses.\n\n“We opened in December and we are busy always,” he said in a phone interview on his way to France for a couple of months. “I hope that many start like me, because it’s important for the small island, the planet, everything.”\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

    "Prayuth’s Misrule Is Turning Thailand Into a Powder Keg": "With Thailand’s national elections planned for early 2023, the mood among opposition members of parliament and activists—and even members of the pro-military coalition in power—is increasingly sour. Protests have been simmering over recent weeks in Bangkok, and this growing anger is setting the stage for political chaos in the coming months, and possibly a highly problematic election next year.\n\nThais are furious, in part because Prayuth Chan-ocha, the de facto head of the coalition government led by the pro-military Palang Pracharath party, insists he can continue as prime minister, despite a constitutional term limit of eight years. Prayuth has been prime minister since leading the 2014 coup that deposed the last fairly elected Thai government, but he claims his eight-year count should actually start in 2019, when he was elected prime minister in an election that was perhaps free but not fair. The Constitutional Court recently suspended Prayuth as prime minister until a final ruling decides his fate, though he remains defense minister.\n\nHowever, Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan—hated by Thai democracy activists for the critical role he played in the 2014 coup—took over as acting prime minister when Prayuth was suspended on Aug. 24. Prawit’s ascendance is hardly placating opposition forces or doing anything to woo the majority of Thais who will probably vote for an anti-military, pro-democracy party in next year’s elections. And with the courts in Thailand still incredibly loyal to the military and its allies, it’s certainly possible that a judge will rule that Prayuth’s clock should be reset to start 2019, allowing him to run for prime minister again next year.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Prayuth has proven to be a highly ineffective prime minister, even setting aside the term limit controversy. Following the coup and its harsh aftermath, in which pro-democracy protests were violently repressed, he never accepted any semblance of a return to parliamentary democracy—even after his coalition won the 2019 elections. He has also maintained his authoritarian tendencies. He has personally mocked and threatened the media and civil society, and his government has charged at least 200 activists and opposition politicians with various dubious crimes, including lese majeste.\n\nThis shift to increasingly enforcing the country’s draconian lese majeste laws, which make it illegal to defame or even insult the king and other royals, contrasts with the end of former King Bhumibhol Adulyadej’s rule in 2016, when it seemed like the use of these laws was on the decline. Bhumibhol himself—who was beloved in a way the current monarch, King Rama X, is not—had objected to the use of lese majeste at times, saying he was not above criticism. But since succeeding his father, Rama X has sought to expand the monarchy’s political and financial powers in ways that have alarmed many observers.\n\nIn addition, in 2020 the courts—which have historically been highly favorable to ruling pro-military parties—outlawed one of the main opposition parties, Future Forward, on a technicality, and the government has pursued what critics claim are politically motivated charges against some of Future Forward’s key leaders. As a result of Prayuth’s continued autocratic rule, as well as generally poor policy management, anger among the political opposition in Thailand is at a boil.\n\nThe opposition has tried to oust Prayuth with multiple no-confidence votes in parliament, though these have all failed. It has also held anti-government rallies in Bangkok and other cities across the country and launched anti-government campaigns on social media. Intriguingly, given the monarchy’s entrenched social, economic and political role in the country, political discussions on social media, and sometimes even at demonstrations, have in recent years turned to the monarchy’s impact on Thailand and whether its role should be more limited, given the extraordinary powers amassed by the largely disliked Rama X.\n\nThe opposition’s cause has been helped by the fact that, as prime minister, Prayuth has also been a policy disaster. After an initial—and perhaps lucky—year of battling COVID-19 in 2020, the government’s policies have been extremely flawed, in part because it allowed a company linked to the king to be involved in the initial manufacture and rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The economy remains weak—it grew slower than expected in the second quarter of this year—and inflation is badly hurting the Thai baht, a problem shared by many other emerging market currencies. The government has not developed a coherent plan for rebuilding tourism, which was one of the pillars of the Thai economy, in the aftermath of the pandemic. Nor does it have a strategy for keeping talented young Thais—who face a brutal job market, an autocratic environment, years of political conflict with seemingly no end in sight, and a king who is seemingly intent on reestablishing an absolute monarchy—from leaving the country.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, under Prayuth’s leadership, Thailand’s usually skillful diplomats have struggled to come up with any coherent strategy for navigating the increasingly turbulent rivalry between the United States and China, or for dealing with the civil war and failed state in neighboring Myanmar. Even prominent members of Prayuth’s coalition have slammed his horrendous leadership, and Thailand’s regional power and influence has diminished greatly in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition’s ability to mobilize mass support is growing, as demonstrated by the mass rallies it has held and effective social media strategies it has developed. In fact, they now have a real chance to win the elections next year, if the polls are free and fair.\n\nBut that’s something the opposition shouldn’t count on. The ruling pro-military coalition controls the administrative bodies that oversee the election and essentially controls the courts. Many major opposition leaders have already been banned from politics or forced into exile, with dubious charges of corruption and other crimes awaiting them if they return. As happened in 2019, even if the opposition does win a significant number of seats, the government will likely whittle it down by having compliant judges and the election commission overturn some on technicalities. And that’s assuming the election commission doesn’t meddle with the vote count to keep that from being necessary.\n\nIn an attempt to counter this possibility, on several occasions the opposition introduced amendments to disband the upper house of parliament, which was appointed by the junta prior to the 2019 elections and has powers to intervene in the election, and replace it with a more democratic body. These efforts were all defeated, so any controversy over the 2023 election will end up before the Senate, as well as a high court that is sure to favor the pro-military coalition.\n\nThe most likely scenario for next year’s election, then, is one in which the majority of Thais cast their votes for opposition or pro-democracy parties, only to see the Palang Pracharath and its allies, perhaps led by Prayuth, hold onto power through shady maneuvers, both political and judicial.\n\nAfter so many years of frustration across the country, such an outcome could easily ignite the powder keg that currently characterizes Thai politics, not unlike the massive Bangkok protests of 1992, in which the army fired on and killed large numbers of civilians, or the street battles and army massacres of 2010. One can hope for an alternative, but given Thailand’s history, a grim scenario seems more likely.",

    "USTDA Assists Thailand’s Fight Against Cancer": "USTDA Assists Thailand’s Fight Against Cancer\n\nThe U.S. Trade and Development Agency announced it awarded a grant to Thailand’s AMATA Corporation Public Company Limited (AMATA) for a feasibility study to develop a regional oncology center in Chonburi Province. USTDA’s assistance will advance AMATA’s and Thailand’s goal of providing access to world-class cancer treatment to hundreds of thousands of people across the Lower Mekong Region.\n\n“Improving access to quality healthcare is one USTDA’s top priorities in Thailand and other emerging economies around the world,” said Enoh T. Ebong, USTDA’s Director. “This project will offer significant opportunities for U.S. companies to offer the kinds of highly innovative healthcare technologies that the center will require.”\n\nUSTDA’s study will provide AMATA the necessary data and analysis for the phased implementation of a new oncology center that will advance Thailand’s aspiration to be a medical hub in Southeast Asia. The center would be the first part of the broader “Meditown” hub project that AMATA is developing.\n\n“The strong support from USTDA is very timely, as this represents an important milestone toward developing Thailand’s medical and life sciences hub with our strategic partners, namely, the Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Science and Siriraj Hospital of Mahidol University. We look forward to working with world-class oncology center partners from the United States, as well,” said Vikrom Kromadit, Chairman of AMATA.\n\nAMATA Chief Investment Officer, Lena Ng, added: “The hub will provide world-class medical services through international collaboration with industry leaders across key areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and research. The United States has excelled globally as a leader in healthcare and life sciences, especially in gene and cell therapy. This study will catalyze our collaboration with leading U.S. oncology service providers to enhance access to breakthrough treatments for cancer patients in Asia.”\n\nChargé d’Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Gwen Cardno, said: “As the pandemic has shown us, healthcare requires international cooperation at the highest levels, and that’s certainly applicable for cancer treatment. Through USTDA, the U.S. government is proud to work together with Thailand to promote innovative U.S. solutions for cancer treatment to strengthen its health system.”\n\nUSTDA’s assistance to AMATA advances one of the key pillars of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to strengthen global health security through investments in patient-centered health services. It also advances Thailand’s 4.0 scheme to revitalize the country’s eastern seaboard, including Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao provinces.\n\nU.S. businesses interested in submitting proposals for this feasibility study should visit www.ustda.gov/work/bid-on-an-overseas-project.",

Hanlay could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHan Lay was a contestant in Miss Grand International Myanmar 2020 and has used her platform to raise awareness of the struggle for democracy in her country, where the military junta has used brutal violence to crush opposition.\n\nOn stage at a competition in Thailand in 2021, she gave an emotive speech in which she pleaded for the world to “please help Myanmar”. Han Lay struggled to fight back tears as she told the audience that, on that day alone, more than 100 pro-democracy protesters had been killed.\n\n“I am deeply sorry for the people who have lost their lives,” she said.\n\nAnyone in Myanmar who criticises the military regime risks arrest and imprisonment in facilities where reports of mistreatment and torture are common. More than 15,500 people have been arrested since the coup, according to Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma). This includes social media influencers and models, as well as teachers, doctors and elected politicians.\n\nHan Lay appears to have been spending time in Thailand since the coup, but was stopped from entering the country this week after reportedly returning from Vietnam.\n\n“I request to Thai authority from here please help for me and I will refuse to meet with the Myanmar police by using my human right!” she wrote on Facebook on Thursday night. “I reported to UNHCR already too.”\n\nAmnesty International said on Twitter that Thailand must not return Han Lay to her country, where she is well known for having condemned the 2021 coup. “She must be allowed to settle somewhere safe, and Myanmar is not safe for her,” its statement said.\n\nIt added: “Critics of Myanmar’s military have been arbitrarily detained, tortured and killed in detention. These are the real risks faced by anyone who highlights, exposes and documents the appalling human rights abuses since the coup.”\n\nNawit Itsaragrisil, founder of Thailand’s Miss Grand International pageant, who also represents Han Lay, told Reuters she had been stopped by Thai authorities because she was the subject of an Interpol notice.\n\nHowever, Thai authorities said Han Lay had been denied entry due to a problem with her travel documents and that she had not been arrested. There were no plans to deport her at this stage, Tanee Sangrat, a spokesperson for Thailand’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs told media.",
    "A Fresh Start: Myanmar Refugees Find a New Home after Decades in Thailand - Thailand": "Mae Sot, 26 September 2022 – Life in Thailand is all Ah May has known.\n\nA native of the Karen ethnic group in Myanmar, 22-year-old Ah had never set foot in his home country. His mother left for Thailand when she was 19 and had him at a young age.\n\nSince the age of six, Ah has been living in the Umpiem Mai temporary shelter – 12 kilometres from the Myanmar border, in Thailand’s Tak Province. An estimated 10,600* individuals reside in the shelter, predominantly people of Karen ethnicity who fled conflict decades ago.\n\n“Life has been difficult. I never had opportunities, no hope, no identity,” he says about living in limbo. “I receive an allowance of around THB 250 (approximately USD 7)** per month, but it’s not enough with prices of goods increasing. Sometimes, we don’t have enough food.”\n\nLife for Ah is about to change drastically, as he prepares to board a plane for the first time to start afresh in the United States.\n\nAh is one of over 145,000 refugees that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Thailand has assisted since 2004 to resettle to third countries – predominantly the United States, Australia and Canada, but to many others as well.\n\nIOM has been working closely with the Royal Thai Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 1975, when it began assisting nearly half a million Indochinese refugees to start new lives abroad.\n\nRoughly 91,000* remain in nine temporary shelters along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of whom have been residing in the shelters for decades, and 84 per cent of whom are Karen.\n\n“Thanks to the generosity and commitment of receiving countries, resettlement is an important process to support people fleeing persecution,” remarks Francesco Supit, IOM’s Head of Sub-Office in Mae Sot, where a majority of resettlement operations in Thailand is managed.\n\nIn recent years, IOM’s work in Thailand has been focused on facilitating the resettlement of refugees who have lived in temporary shelters for prolonged durations. Many had been accepted by UNHCR up to five years ago.\n\nIn 2021, IOM supported the resettlement of 901 refugees from Thailand – the lowest figure since 2006. “We must remember that resettlement is not a sustainable solution for everyone. There needs to be an enabling environment for many other refugees to return home safely when the time allows or for them to integrate locally,” added Supit.\n\nOnce individuals are accepted for resettlement, IOM receives notifications from receiving countries. Individuals undergo a comprehensive health assessment and pre-departure medical checks to ensure they are fit to travel.\n\n“The process includes complete medical examination and laboratory tests, according to technical instructions from the resettlement country. We provide vaccination, counselling and treatment for pre-departure stabilization, where needed,” explains Dr Poe Sandi Oo, IOM physician.\n\n“The environment and living conditions in the shelters can, unfortunately, lead to adverse health conditions, such as malnutrition, communicable and non-communicable diseases. We need to ensure that refugees can travel in good health.”\n\nOnce refugees are cleared for travel, IOM facilitates travel arrangements.\n\nA day before his flight to the United States, Ah sits next to Maung Maung and Mu Kyong Paw at the IOM premises in Mae Sot.\n\nBoth Maung and Mu fled Myanmar as children, although the exact ages escape them. Now in their mid-20s, they also do not recall where exactly in Myanmar they came from. They met at the Umpiem Mai shelter, got married and now have a seven-year-old child, who has also only ever known life in Thailand.\n\nAll four are partaking in a final pre-departure orientation, during which an experienced trainer takes them through aspects of the life-changing journey they are about to undertake. Since it will be the first time that most, if not all, have been on a plane, the lessons include basics like how to board a plane, fasten one’s seatbelt, use the lavatory, what to do during a layover, and more.\n\nSuch orientation is a critical component of preparing individuals for their new lives abroad – aimed at providing practical information about their new countries and empowering them with the skills and attitudes to succeed abroad.\n\nIn Thailand, IOM runs dedicated, multi-day training programmes for individuals resettling to Australia and Canada.\n\nAlthough the orientation goes a long way in alleviating some of his fears, Ah is not shy to express the challenges he foresees. “I have to learn a new language, get used to a new environment, understand a new transport system. It will take time to adjust.”\n\nAlthough Maung and Mu share the same reservations, they are grateful for the opportunities and choices their son will now have. Their reservations are eased, remembering that Mu’s parents had been resettled to the same town in the United States a year ago and will be at hand to help them settle into their new lives. “Her father works in a pork factory,” says Maung. “I hope I can find a job quickly too. I’ll be satisfied with any job.”\n\nUnfortunately, Maung’s parents remain in Umpiem – as does Ah’s mother. “It was very sad to say goodbye to my mother and friends,” expresses Ah, “but for now, I have to look forward to my future.”\n\nAh hopes to go back to school, earn a degree and find work. When asked what type of work he hopes to get into, he immediately quips: “I want to find a job where I can help others integrate smoothly when they arrive in the United States. I want to be there for others.”\n\nWhile some dread a long-haul flight halfway around the globe, for others, it signifies a lifeline – a path to new beginnings.\n\n*UNHCR* data as of August 2022*\n\n**Residents of the Umpiem Mai temporary shelter receive a monthly food stipend from The Border Consortium, ranging from THB 240 to THB 370 (USD 6 to 10) according to vulnerability criteria.\n\nThis story was written by Miko Alazas, IOM’s Media and Communications Officer in Thailand.",

    "Using Digital Democracy to Energize Thailand": "Thuntee Ruben Sukchotrat, Director of Digital Transformation for the Thai Sang Thai Party, is a digital democracy revolutionary. Sukchotrat sees the income inequality in his nation as a sign that his people have not had a proper voice in setting and implementing public policies. And he believes that building a technology-based future should begin in the nation’s schools.\n\nThe timing for such ‘art of the possible’ thinking is right – The Thai Constitutional Court is debating term limits for its leadership, one that has arguably lost the trust of its citizenry; the Thai economy is in poor shape; and the once disillusioned are slowly sowing the seeds of forming a movement of tangible change.\n\nThe heavy military influence in Thai politics, made semiofficial under the current constitution, is becoming increasingly unpopular with the more liberal, progressive younger generation – a voting bloc courted by the Thai Sang Thai party. But a challenge lies in that younger Thais can be slower to adapt to such seismic societal change envisioned.\n\nSukchotrat however wants to provide citizens with digital tools to gain direct access to government services and what is more, to provide input on government policy. Government bureaucrats, he says, often obfuscate rather than speak plainly to citizens.\n\nHe joined the fledgling political party at its outset to better position himself to promote this vision.\n\nBy accessing the metaverse citizens, Sukchotrat says, ordinary citizens can become more active participants in their governance and ensure that governments both in Thailand and worldwide can better serve their employers (the citizenry). Just as importantly, citizens who believe that their views can impact public policy and performance are incentivized to better inform themselves about public affairs.\n\nIt’s a win-win.\n\n“Having been a fan of ‘efficiency’ since childhood,” he adds, “we have been thinking of ways to reach our goals as quickly as possible, with as few resources as possible, based on the right rules.” Digitalization is the future, he contends, and failure to modernize access to forms, applications, and other ways that people communicate with government wastes time and resources and costs the nation and its people financially.\n\nBut, he cautions, most of the 80 percent of Thais who own smartphones do not yet know how to use them strategically to get ahead in their daily lives and businesses – or to solve their government-related issues. Sukchotrat has been touting a long-term plan to provide that knowledge, political literacy and empowerment if you will, to Thai citizens.\n\nIn his view, the nationwide effort to increase the level of such literacy should begin with teaching young students the principles of using, understanding, and creating technical fluency needed to engage with computers and the Internet. A second step is to create specially designed programs to enable adults to build skills and gain the necessary knowledge to enhance their horizons in the job market.\n\nSukchotrat knows the value of digital literacy from his own experience. After graduating from a Thai university, he spent several years in Texas, earning a Ph.D. in data mining from the University of Texas at Arlington. After working as a researcher for Expedia.com, Sukchotrat returned to Thailand armed with finely honed data mining skills.\n\nBack home, Sukchotrat got a government job helping citizens with tax planning and solutions for tax filing. Then, he began to formulate ideas for using technology to make his government more efficient and less corrupt. Upon leaving government service, he became CEO of Legal Drive Co., Ltd., the owner of iTAX, the leading personal income tax solutions provider in Thailand.\n\nWhen he saw how poorly the Thai government was managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sukchotrat decided to embark on a political career. He lamented delays in vaccinations and vaccines, businesses shutting down due to lack of communications and government support and frankly, watching friends and family dying – “I could not any longer just sit back and watch.”\n\nThe newly formed Thai Sang Thai Party attracted his attention, and party leaders were receptive and quick to put his digital skills to work. His interests in revitalizing the nation by marshalling the skills of the emergent generation aligned with those of both party founder and leader Khunying Sudarat Keyuraphan (formerly the Pheu Thai party’s chief strategist) and Policy Center Director Tidarat Yingcharoen (Tida).\n\nTida says her new party hopes to recruit older Thais as “foundations” to enable the youthful party leaders to bring in a diversity of ideas to better serve the people’s needs and viewpoints. Most bureaucracies (in and out of government) are so hierarchical that they stifle new ideas and the energetic young leaders that could help them reach their full potential.\n\nTida conversely notes that the party, while led by a former prime minister candidate of the nation’s largest political sect, is staffed by a coterie of young, dynamic, collaborative activists with a zeal for equitable treatment for all Thai citizens.\n\nThe ongoing suppression of political parties in Thailand should not stymie Thai Sang Thai, she says.\n\nOne of Sukchotrat’s new initiatives is to unionize the nation’s gig economy workers. He unveiled such a strategy at the Thailand Metaverse Expo 2022 in Bangkok in August. Such innovative thinking is direly needed – Thailand’s GDP growth is now the lowest in the ASEAN, the nation is lacking in investment and cannot compete with nearby countries in exports. And as Thai society ages, there is a growing labor shortage that has impacted small organizations and independent (gig) workers the hardest.\n\nThrough a labor union, Sukchotrat believes, gig workers can raise their incomes, reduce costs, and better utilize technology and innovation to build personal stability. A union structure would enable gig workers to get affordable health insurance, have better access to legal and other services, and protect their independent status and flexibility.\n\nUnion backing could also help them obtain loans and other banking services more readily and at better rates. And the union could offer training for members to improve their job skills and enable younger workers to move up into better jobs over time.\n\nThe gig worker union initiative also dovetails with Thai Sang Thai’s overarching vision for liberating and empowering “small people” who are the foundation of the Thai economy – Yet another example of Sukchotrat’s next-generation vision of rebuilding (and retooling) the nation from the bottom up.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect those of Geopoliticalmonitor.com",
    "Thai drinks you must try while in Thailand": "When it comes to mixing up refreshing drinks, the people in Thailand can get very creative. From milky teas to bright and fruity sips of joy, trying local beverages is an absolute must! Below, we have the top Thai drinks to try when visiting Thailand below.\n\n1. Cha Yen (Thai milk iced tea)\n\nThai tea is perhaps the most popular and tastiest of all Thai drinks. The orange, milky tea is light and refreshing. Moreover, its milk and sweetness goes hand in hand with its aroma, making it the perfect tea to take while you are on the go. Cha Yen is brewed with tea leaves and then mixed with condensed milk. As Thailand’s weather is hot and humid, most prefer to gulp down this drink when it is iced, but you can also enjoy it hot.\n\n2. Oliang (Thai iced coffee)\n\nOliang or Thai iced coffee is similar to Americano but different. Hence, the commonly-used phrase of “same same, but different.” The coffee is mixed with other ingredients that include roasted rice, caramel, and roasted coffee beans. People normally enjoy Oliang cold or iced, however, if you can drink it hot as well. Moreover, if you add milk to Oliang, you can turn it into another local drink called Cafe Boran. The name Cafe Boran translates in English to ancient coffee. This spin-off is quite popular to have at breakfast time, along with porridge and Patongo.\n\n3. Nom Yen (Thai pink milk)\n\nThis eclectic twist on traditional hot milk is absolutely delicious. Furthermore, Thais have figured out how to make this milk more colourful and sweet. With a pink tint, this milk is made with green or red syrup and is popular with younger generations. Moreover, as it has no caffeine, the sweetness serves as a substitute for such caffeinated drinks. To sip this drink like a local, you can pair it with some steamed bread and sweet custard dipping sauce or coconut jam.\n\n4. Chao Kuai ( Grass jelly)\n\nChao Kuai, or grass jelly, can actually be added to many things, such as coconut ice cream for dessert. However, adding it to your choice of drink is possibly the best way to enjoy it. You can find numerous drinks in Thailand with grass jelly inside it, from teas to juices. However, our favourite has to be grass jelly mixed served with crushed ice and water, then sprinkled with brown sugar.\n\n5. Nam Lum Yai (Longan juice)\n\nIn Thailand, longan juice is known as NamLumYai. This juice is light and refreshing. Longan is a seasonal fruit, so the juice isn’t always available on the street all year. However, 7/11 sells a non-fresh version. It is widely recommended to serve the drink over ice for a refreshing drink that contains bits of the actual fruit.\n\nThailand’s local drinks are known the world over for their interesting twists on conventional recipes. From longan juice to pink milk with syrup drinks, trying Thai recipes is a great way to cool off in the hot weather. Moreover, they can be found almost anywhere and for a seriously cheap price!",
    "Thailand News Today | Baht continues surge against strong dollar": "With the US dollar strengthening and Thailand’s struggling economy, economic experts predict the baht to reach 38 to the dollar by the end of this year.\n\nThe head of capital markets research for Kasikorn Bank believes the baht will continue its instability along with the global money markets as a result of domestic and international factors.\n\nWhile the US dollar continues to grow in value against foreign currencies due to the hawkish continued federal fund rate hikes, the Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to boost its benchmark policy rate from 0.75% to 1% in a meeting scheduled for next week. That would pump a little power into the baht and keep it closer to 37 baht to the dollar, but it’s only a temporary fix with the baht expected to drop in value after.\n\nThe news for the Thai currency isn’t all bad though, as K Bank predicts that, as tourism brings in more revenue toward the end of the year, the baht may climb back to 35 against the dollar. And November’s meeting of the MPC is predicted to raise the policy rate again to 1.25% further propping up the baht.\n\nAmonthep Chawla, the head of the research economist office at CIMB Thai Bank, agrees with the analysis, expecting the baht to reach 38 per one US dollar, but predicts an even higher policy rate increase for the bank of Thailand to 1.75%. He believes it will reach 2.5% by the end of 2023.\n\nThe CIMBT official says that the rising policy rate is due to the parallel rising inflation, a problem felt around the world. In Thailand, the inflation rate is estimated to be a 6.2% average by the end of 2022, though it is expected to fall to just 2.6% in 2023.\n\nLike many in the government and private sector in Thailand, CIMBT is also looking toward a strong recovery for the tourism industry to revive Thailand’s economy. As tourists return to the kingdom in higher numbers, inflation should ease as the economy stabilises and the GDP increases, with CIMBT predicting 3.2% GDP growth by the end of the year.\n\n——————-\n\nThailand could be an attractive and realistic option for men fleeing military conscription in Russia after President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to conscript 300,000 civilians into military service in Ukraine.\n\nSeveral European countries such as Lithuania have already closed their doors to Russian citizens, citing widespread support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as the reason for the ban.\n\nRussians are rushing onto flights to countries such as Armenia, Georgia, Montenegro, and Turkey, or basically, anywhere that will let them in without a visa.\n\nThailand and Russia have a bilateral agreement which grants Russians the right to temporarily enter the kingdom without the need for a visa, also known as ‘visa exemption on arrival.’\n\nTo lure tourists into Thailand this High Season, Thailand is extending the maximum stay of visa exemptions on arrival from 30 to 45 days, effective October 1.\n\nThailand is also finally removing all remaining coronavirus-related entry restrictions on October 1, meaning no proof of vaccination history and no negative tests are required to gain entry into the kingdom. Even people who test positive for Covid are allowed in now.\n\nEven before Putin’s announcement, the Thai government had already made plans to boost tourism revenue by turning to the Russian market this winter in a somewhat controversial move.\n\nThailand is welcoming Russians with open arms this High Season and even plans to fly in Russians via chartered flights three times per week. Although, it’s not clear when the service will begin.\n\nAeroflot also plans to resume its direct service between Russia and Phuket on October 31 in time for Thailand’s High Season. However, a month might be far too long a wait for prospective military draftees in Russia.\n\nBefore the war, the Russians contributed vastly to Thailand’s tourism revenue. An increase in Russian arrivals could do wonders for Thailand’s tourism revenue, so the Thai government has no problem with the return of the Russian market.\n\nWhether there are enough flights available to facilitate an influx of Russian arrivals, and whether or not they will be an affordable option, remains uncertain.\n\n————-\n\nPassengers almost fainted from a lack of air after they were stranded when the Airport Rail Link train travelling to Suvarnabhumi Airport on Saturday suffered from power failure.\n\nPassengers were trapped inside for almost four hours, leaving most of the travellers gasping for air, and most reportedly missed their flights.\n\nFour stations, including Hua Mark, Baan Thap Chang, Lat Krabang, and Suvarnbhumi Airport, were closed. Thai media reported that trains No. 1031 to 1034 were stuck on the tracks between Hua Mark and Baan Thap Chang Station for about four hours.\n\nPassengers going to Suvarnabhumi Airport had to find other ways to get to the capital’s main airport such as vans, buses, and taxis, which brought in a new line of complaints, such as long taxi queues.\n\nAn Airport Rail Link security guard made known that the train system broke down at about 2 pm. Most of the train’s passengers were gasping for air because the air-conditioning stopped working.\n\nThe guard added rail staff managed to open the stranded train doors and evacuated customers at about 5.40 pm.\n\nThe Airport Rail Link Facebook page stated there was no fainting or injuries and apologised for what they called an inconvenience. The page failed to state whether the company will pay compensation to passengers affected or to those who missed their flights.\n\nMany Thai netizens complained saying this isn’t the first time the Airport Rail Link caused problems for commuters. Many said the company should learn from its mistakes and improve its service.\n\nThe system failure was still affecting passengers this morning.\n\nAirport Rail Link informed commuters that eight trains were available but the service wouldn’t be fully operational at two stations, Lat Krabang, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. So at the moment, it’s just a rail link, not an “airport” rail link.\n\n————\n\nWho could have seen it coming? With the recent cannabis rush in Thailand, the market has reached an oversupply of too many pots, tanking the price of cannabis, and now farmers are asking the government to regulate its price.\n\nIn many parts of Thailand, the oversupply of cannabis is evident, with new shops on every street corner and cannabis being incorporated into food and drink menus. About a million people were licensed to grow, sell, and consume the plant. That opening flooded the market. Now, the original farmers with government contracts have seen an 80% to 90% reduction in the value of their crops.\n\nNow, in the northern province of Nakhon Phanom, farmers are asking the government to set price regulations for cannabis. Before the legalisation of cannabis in June, special permission was required from universities, medical centres, and hospitals to allow farmers to grow. Cannabis leaves fetched 15,000 baht per kilogramme, while fresh stems sold for about 10,000 baht per kilogramme.\n\nNow the farmers in the northeastern province are mobilising, banding together about 20 similar enterprises that also grow cannabis crops. They plan to make cooperatives have more bargaining power to help them negotiate higher prices.\n\nThe groups are also asking the government to step in and create set pricing for cannabis. They hope to make the heavily oversaturated market profitable again for farmers.\n\nSubscribe or Join our YouTube channel today and become a Thaiger Legend or a Thaiger Cub for behind the scenes footage and other member-only perks.",
    "Thailand roadside bomb kills police officer, injures three others": "Southern Thailand has been the site of a low-level rebellion by Muslim fighters which has resulted in thousands killed.\n\nA Thai policeman was killed, and four others injured when a roadside bomb detonated as their vehicles passed near a hospital in southern Thailand, police said.\n\nA police motorcycle and a patrol truck were travelling together when both were hit by the blast in front of a hospital in Mai Kaen town, Pattani province, on Tuesday night, police captain Wasuwat Kongtuk said on Wednesday.\n\nThe explosion killed an officer on a motorcycle and caused the police truck to veer off the road before crashing into an electrical pole. Three officers in the truck were rushed to the hospital for treatment.\n\nPolice believe the bomb was planted in a rubbish bin in front of the hospital and that it was detonated remotely.\n\nTV footage on Wednesday showed damage to the Mai Kaen hospital exterior and a shrapnel hole in the Mai Kaen Kittiwit school, which was located opposite the hospital. The school was ordered to close for the day.\n\nExplosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers sealed off the area and combed nearby streets for evidence.\n\nSouthern Thailand is in the grip of a low-level rebellion led by Muslim fighters, who have long complained of discrimination by the country’s Buddhist majority.\n\nThe rebels are mostly active in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala and often attack government targets. The southern region bordering Malaysia is heavily policed by Thai security forces and is also culturally distinct having been colonised by Thailand just over a century ago.\n\nLast month, a wave of at least 17 coordinated arson attacks and explosions targeted convenience stores at petrol stations in the provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat leaving seven people suffering minor injuries.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had brought a lull in southern clashes between rebels and the military, but a six-day gun battle in October last year killed six people.\n\nMore than 7,300 people have been killed in Thailand’s southern conflict since 2004, according to the Deep South Watch group, which monitors the violence in southern Thailand.",
    "Airport expansion plans hastened across Thailand": "With High Season approaching and the Thai government predicting big numbers, airport expansion plans are being fast-tracked. One of Thailand’s goals as international travel begins to return in greater numbers is to become a transport hub for Southeast Asia. To help realise the goal and make room for an influx of travellers, facilities are being expanded in both domestic and international airports around the country.\n\nSmaller regional hubs race to expand and increase their capacity for domestic travellers. Krabi Airport in Southern Thailand will herald travellers to popular tourist destinations outside of Phuket. Khon Kaen Airport in the northeast will expand to accommodate more travellers to Isaan. Mae Sot Airport in the west will bring people to the Burmese border. And the new Betong Airport in the Deep South province of Yala will accommodate passengers near the Malaysian border.\n\nBKK\n\nBangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport is a primary focus, hoping to boost its hub status with new development. Expansions hope to allow the airport to accommodate up to 120 million passengers each year. The current capacity for the airport is about 45 million people per year, close to the total number of tourists that entered Thailand in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nThe airport will expand from 51 to 79 gates with the construction of the satellite Terminal 1. That expansion is expected to be finished this year, along with the addition of a third runway. Other upgrades will be completed over the next several years.\n\nA plan for construction next April is expected to add 348,000 square metres to the passenger terminal north. That build is scheduled to start in January and be finished by June 2025. The passenger terminal east will also see an expansion of an extra 66,000 square metres over the next two years. Plans are being studied for the possibility to expand in the west another 66,000 square metres as well.\n\nDMK\n\nThe Airports of Thailand is working with the Department of Airports to expand regional airports in central Thailand as well as three major airports. Aside from Suvarnabhumi Airport, the secondary airport serving the greater Bangkok area, Don Mueang International Airport, will see upgrades. U-Tapao Airport in Rayong, the gateway to Pattaya in Chon Buri, it’s under expansion as well.\n\nDon Mueang plans to accommodate an extra 18 million travellers each year. They can currently handle 30 million passengers per year. Expansion plans call for 12 new gates for flights to park in a third terminal covering 155,000 square metres of space. The design is already finalized and bidding will begin soon for construction contracts.\n\nUTP\n\nU-Tapao Airport is much smaller than its Bangkok counterparts, currently able to host 1.5 million travellers per year. Ambitious expansion plans will construct a second terminal and expand the capacity to five million passengers yearly. That new terminal isn’t expected to open until 2027 though.\n\nAll of these airports under the AoT will work in sync with high-speed rail projects to move people around the area quickly and easily. The plan is part of the Eastern Economic Corridor programme designed to bring investment into the Eastern region of the country.\n\nSOURCE: Bangkok Post\n\nWin a 3-night beachfront stay at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket by taking a short Thaiger Survey HERE!",
    "Far from home, alone: Cambodian students share life in Thailand during the pandemic lockdown": "This article by Seoung Nimol was originally published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand, and an edited version is republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nLiving far away from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cambodian students who came to Thailand to pursue their studies experienced problems stemming from lockdown, lonesomeness, and a sense of loss.\n\nLiving in dormitories without face-to-face engagement and social communication, they felt scared, lonely, and bored under stressful lockdown restrictions. Individuals experienced psychological symptoms.\n\nAccording to a UNICEF-led study in 2020, 7 out of 10 children and young people worldwide reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their mental health. The majority were worried about family household incomes, their studies, and their future education, and employment opportunities.\n\nThai universities were ordered to close in March 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases rose dramatically. It was not until 2022 that universities started to resume on-site teaching.\n\nPich Somaly, a fourth-year agricultural technology major at Burapha University, said once the closure was announced, the silent atmosphere left by Thai students who had returned home was fearsome. That was not an option for her and four other Cambodian students as the borders were closed.\n\nAll of the Thai students had already gone back home. Only a few Cambodian students remained, and it was very quiet in our building. We were scared and worried about getting this disease since we came to study far away from home. These feelings made us think too much and caused stress.\n\nLife was completely changed. She claimed that she always had to consider things carefully before acting, but this was accompanied by emotional distress and worry. She was always so nervous when she went to get food.\n\nIt was hugely challenging to buy food. I was very vulnerable to infection if I went to the market. I stayed in the room for 14 days for quarantine. I was afraid of getting infected because I had not been vaccinated. I was shocked because it is not our home.\n\nMental health issues may also arise from the disease itself, such as grief from loss of life.\n\nMost first-year students believed they would experience a new environment by learning and communicating with people in Thailand.\n\nInstead, they faced a bitter and challenging time adapting to the global crisis. They began their studies with worry, no social interaction and anxiety about the deteriorating COVID-19 situation, which had a significant negative impact on their mental health.\n\nSeun Ung Mengchou, now president of the Khmer Students Association at Thammasat University, said she was still a freshman in 2020 who had just received a scholarship to study in Thailand from her university. At that time, the COVID-19 situation was terrible in Thailand.\n\nHer first experience of living abroad was disrupted by the pandemic and it proved to be very challenging for Mengchou. She claimed that while struggling to stay in their rooms, every Cambodian student felt fear and loneliness, while Thai students could go home to their families.\n\nOur mental health has also been seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis. We didn't have relatives here, and we were anxious about what to do if we became infected. We have been far away from home. Many patients had to stay outside the hospital due to the situation at that time. That was incomprehensible. We felt lonely; we were homesick. We were troubled about our studies and the infection situation.\n\nMost students were forced to sit in their rooms and study online, which was not a good study environment. Students were becoming more stressed, which could reduce productivity at work and poor academic performance.\n\nOnline learning\n\nAll students had to switch to online learning in order to assure their safety. Their learning was impacted since they were unable to adapt quickly to the unexpected changes.\n\nSomaly said that her major was in science and all on-site laboratory sessions were postponed. It was tedious and exhausting for her to spend three hours studying in front of a computer.\n\nBecause we could focus only on the first session, learning online was difficult to follow. We found the virtual classroom to be boring. Only 30 to 40% of what I learned online was truly effective, in my opinion. I only had lessons without a lab that I did not fully understand.\n\nHowever, lab sessions were resumed when the universities reopened at the end of 2021, so it was not a big concern for her major, she said.\n\nAccording to Meng Chou, active participation and intense concentration are both necessary for online learning to be extremely effective. Students were unable to focus, however, because they continued to study in an uncomfortable environment.\n\nPhara Pich Pisey, a student at Thammasat University's Faculty of Architecture, started her first year of study online. Difficulties arose as her major required students to cooperate in group projects for a whole year. Discussions tended to be difficult as they could not convene face-to-face.\n\nShe continued by saying that working in teams and studying online was less effective, stressful, and greatly affected academic performance.\n\nWe had a number of projects to work on, and there was no exam. Our first-year study projects did not get good results because of the online group discussions. Some members did not help, and the quality of the work was not good. It was difficult to learn and discuss, compared to physical classes.\n\nFacilitating COVID-19 vaccination\n\nOn the upside, Cambodian students were facilitated by their universities to receive COVID-19 vaccines, like Thai students.\n\nSomaly and Mengchou said in 2021, they and their Cambodian friends studying in Thailand received assistance from their universities.\n\nSomaly's university also developed a mental health consultation and counselling service for students after observing mental health issues among students throughout the epidemic. After the COVID-19 situation in Thailand improved, and the lockdown measures ended, their lives improved. They were able to go out and interact socially.\n\nAs a result of their experiences, Cambodian students requested that the university set up a mental health team, an international student assistance team to communicate with, support and guide them in any emergency situations that arise in the future.",
    "VIDEO: Floods tear through highway in northeast Thailand": "Dramatic aerial footage of floods in northeast Thailand reveals water hurling through a 30-metre gap in the highway that links Rasi Sali district, Srisaket province to Phon Sai district, Roi Et province.\n\nFloods have turned the surrounding farmland into what looks like a reservoir after several days of heavy rain. As water levels rose, pressure built up and finally burst through the road yesterday at 11am. Travel between the two districts has become impossible.\n\nFarmers are trying to deliver grass to cows that are reportedly stuck on “islands” in the colossal flood. One villager attempting to help cows got swept away by the strong current but was successfully rescued by villagers and officers from Rasi Police Station.\n\nDirector of Srisaket Irrigation Project, Chamras Suanchan, said that remedial action to repair the broken highway is underway.\n\nWeather conditions are only set to get worse in northeast Thailand this week. Tropical Storm Noru, which has been wreaking havoc in the Philippines, is on its way to Thailand.\n\nTyphoon Noru is expected to arrive in Thailand on Wednesday or Thursday.

(Photo: Shopee (Thailand)\n\nE-marketplace company Shopee is pursuing fresh job cuts in Thailand, albeit a low single-digit reduction of its headcount in the country, as part of its efforts to attain profitability and weather economic challenges.\n\nThe move was announced in a town hall meeting on Monday morning, according to a source at Shopee. The source did not give the exact figure of the headcount reduction.\n\nThe source described the approach as the ongoing business restructuring of the e-marketplace.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the layoffs is the current macroeconomic situation, while another is to pave the way for long-term profitability as Shopee pursues self-sufficiency, the source said.\n\nShopee is the e-commerce business arm of Singapore-headquartered internet giant Sea, which is part-owned by Chinese internet firm Tencent Holdings.\n\nShopee is one of Sea’s two major businesses. Another is the Garena gaming unit.\n\nGarena earlier cut jobs in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, due to poor performance in the gaming business.\n\nIn June, Sea laid off 300 employees working for Shopee, online payment service ShopeePay and food delivery arm ShopeeFood in Thailand.\n\nShopee Thailand posted 13.3 billion baht in revenue in 2021, up 129% year-on-year, but saw massive losses of 4.9 billion, worsening by 19.24% year-on-year, according to Creden Data, a data analytics service provider.\n\nAccording to the Businessinsider news website, Forrest Li, founder, chairman and chief executive of Shopee, issued a memo to Shopee employees that outlined cost-cutting measures.\n\n\"Our number one objective for the next 12-18 months is achieving self-sufficiency,\" Li wrote in the memo.\n\nThe company will be restricting employee expenses, capping all flights at the economy level, and executives will temporarily forgo compensation, the memo read.\n\nPawoot Pongvitayapanu, an e-commerce pundit, said Shopee is concentrating more on profitability as investors are concerned about rising inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWith limited financial injections, Shopee cannot aggressively expand its business, he said.\n\nShopee has closed its operations in various countries amid the global economic challenges.\n\nThe E-marketplace market in Thailand is now unlikely to see the kind of cutthroat promotional and discount campaigns that were vigorously pursued in the past, he said.\n\nShopee’s rival Lazada has also focused on profit-making, with better operating results in the past two years, said Mr Pawoot.",

    "Thailand: 2022 Article IV Consultation-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Thailand": "Thailand: 2022 Article IV Consultation-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Thailand\n\nPublication Date:\n\nSeptember 16, 2022\n\nElectronic Access:\n\nFree Download. Use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this PDF file\n\nSummary:\n\nThailand’s economy is recovering from an unprecedented crisis emanating from multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ample policy space has allowed a swift and bold policy response and vaccine rollout has accelerated. However, the recovery is weak and uneven across sectors, with inflation rapidly rising driven by energy prices. Downside risks dominate the outlook, sharpening policy tradeoffs. The pandemic has also brought to the fore the urgency for Thailand to identify new growth drivers to reverse the pre-pandemic trend of declining productivity growth and meet the challenges of the post-pandemic world.",
    "Tourist breaks Singaporean law by consuming cannabis in Thailand": "A Singaporean tourist says she didn’t mean to consume cannabis in Thailand in July. Weed might be legal in the Land of Smiles, but it is still a crime for Singaporeans to consume cannabis at home and abroad.\n\nSueanne said she ate a “very nice bowl of noodles” in Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, that were so delicious that she ordered them again the next day for breakfast.\n\nThe second time she ordered the dish, she noticed a little ganja leaf next to the picture of the dish on the menu. Sueanne enquired with the staff and soon found out that cannabis leaves were boiled into the dish, “like any other vegetable,” she said.\n\nThe woman said she mistook the boiled cannabis for morning glory – or water spinach – known as “kangkung” in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Sueanne said she was glad her children didn’t try the dish.\n\nWhen cannabis was removed from Thailand’s list of illicit narcotics, Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau (CNS) swiftly reminded Singaporeans that consuming cannabis – inside or outside of Singapore’s borders – was a crime.\n\n“(Under) the Misuse of Drugs Act, any Singapore citizen or permanent resident found to have consumed controlled drugs outside Singapore will also be liable for the drug consumption offence.”\n\nSingaporeans convicted of drug consumption may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to 20,000 Singaporean dollars. The CNS said it would investigate any positive urine test result and regularly undertake drug tests at border checkpoints.\n\nThankfully for Sueanne, Singapore’s Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam recently assured worried Singaporean citizens that it is not usually considered an offence if drugs are consumed unwittingly or unknowingly.\n\nSueanne wouldn’t have got “high” from the noodle dish, because the high caused by cannabis comes from the component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Thailand’s laws stipulate that an extract made from cannabis (such as a very nice bowl of noodles) must contain no more than 0.2% THC, which is a very minute amount.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a chance that the cannabis Sueanne consumed could show up in a urine test, which could get her into big trouble back in Singapore. Sueanne didn’t say if she was ever subject to a urine test upon her return home.\n\nThailand is a popular tourist destination for Singaporeans. Earlier this year, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam expressed worries that the accessibility of cannabis in Thailand would pose a challenge to keeping Singapore drug-free.\n\nTo ease the worries of cannabis-fearing tourists, some popular tourist hotspots such as Chatuchak market in Bangkok have put up signs saying cannabis is not allowed on the premises.\n\nSOURCE: New Straits Times\n\nWin a 3-night beachfront stay at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket by taking a short Thaiger Survey HERE!",
    "Thailand: Mock fashion show protester sentenced to two years for ‘insulting the monarchy’": "Responding to the conviction and sentencing to two years’ imprisonment of protester Jatuphon “Niw” Saeung for participating in a mock fashion show in Thailand in October 2020, Amnesty International’s Deputy Secretary General Kyle Ward said:\n\n“The mock fashion show was a satirical take on the political situation of the country – a peaceful public event akin to a street festival with music, food and dancing. Participants should not be punished for participating in a peaceful assembly.\n\n“This sentence, which is at least the 10th conviction for lèse-majesté – or insulting the monarchy – handed down since 2021, is a chilling prelude of what’s to come: a record number of 210 activists and protesters have been charged under Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code since the beginning of overwhelmingly peaceful mass protests in 2020.\n\n“We urge the authorities to immediately drop all charges against those who have merely exercised their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and release those arbitrarily detained.\n\n“With protests picking up again in Thailand, this latest conviction underlines the degree to which Thai authorities continue to repress peaceful dissent.\n\n“Thai authorities are obliged to protect the peaceful exercise of the rights to expression and assembly, but they instead continue to pursue criminal proceedings against demonstrators, many of them young people or even children. These young protesters should be free to express their opinions and participate in discussions in society, and should not face the prospect of unwarranted prison sentences and criminal records.”\n\nBackground\n\nThe Bangkok Criminal Court in Thailand initially sentenced a protester Jatuphon “Niw” Saeung to three years in prison on 12 September 2022 after authorities charged her with insulting the monarchy under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. Under this law, anyone convicted of defaming, insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent may be given a jail term from three to 15 years. The Court reduced her sentence by one-third to two years in prison due to her provision of information to the authorities. In the same case, Niw was also convicted of violating the Public Assembly Act and subjected to a fine of 1,500 THB. The Court later reduced the fine to 1,000 THB. Niw is currently detained at the Central Women’s Correctional Institution in Bangkok while awaiting the Court of Appeal’s decision on her bail request.\n\nUnited Nations human rights experts have repeatedly expressed their concern at the rise in the use of the provision, and how it casts a chilling effect on the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression and assembly. UN experts and other member states have further repeatedly called on the authorities to repeal Article 112 or amend it so that it would be consistent with Thailand’s international human rights obligations.\n\nNiw took part in a satirical fashion show on Silom Road in Bangkok on 29 October 2020. She was accused of imitating and mocking the Thai Queen by wearing a traditional Thai dress.\n\nThe October 2020 demonstration was one of dozens in 2020 and early 2021, when tens and possibly hundreds of thousands predominantly peaceful and young demonstrators, including children, took to the streets to demand political, economic and social reforms in Thailand. Authorities have filed criminal proceedings against more than 1,800 activists, including over 280 children, for participating in protests and expressing their opinions.\n\nSince November 2020, at least 210 people, including 17 children, have been accused of committing lèse majesté, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, with ten convictions handed down from 2021 to 2022, the group said.\n\nAmnesty International does not comment on the nature of speeches deemed in breach of the provision, but urges the authorities to uphold its duty under international law to respect, protect and promote the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression.\n\nThailand is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects the right to freedom of expression under its Article 19 and to peaceful assembly under its Article 21. The UN Human Rights Committee, the treaty body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the ICCPR, has expressed concerns regarding lèse majesté laws. It stated that all public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority, are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition and that criticism of state institutions should not be prohibited. Even if the alleged violation of lèse majesté is seen as a defamation-related offence, the Committee has further stated that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty”.\n\nOther UN member states have continuously made recommendations to abolish the lèse majesté provision in the Criminal Code, for example at the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review of Thailand. The Thai government has to date always rejected these recommendations.",
    "Thailand beats Turkey in 1st round of Women’s World Volleyball Championship": "Thailand beats Turkey in 1st round of Women’s World Volleyball Championship\n\nThe Thai women’s volleyball team overcame Turkey, ranked 6th in the world, in a five-set thriller on Saturday in Pool B at the Women’s World Volleyball Championship at the Gelre Dome in Arnhem, the Netherlands.\n\nOutside hitter Chatchu-On Moksri scored 33 points for the Thai team during the clash with Turkey, who were the favourites to win the match.\n\nThe Turkish team won the first set comfortably 25:17, but the Thai team fought back in the second, with a 31:29 win, thanks to an off-the-block swing from Chatchu-On.\n\nTurkey bounced back to win the third set 25:22, but the Thai squad took the fourth 25:19 and went on to seal the match in the fifth set 15:13.\n\nAbout 60 Thais, who live or work in the Netherlands, Germany and France, were in the crowd to cheer for the Thai national team.\n\nOne of the Thai team’s fans said that she had booked the ticket for the match about a month ago and they had all arranged, via social media, to meet in Arnhem for Saturday’s game.",
    "EU and Thailand signs partnership for collaboration in frontier research": "A new initiative between the European Union and Thailand was launched today to encourage collaboration between leading Thai researchers and European Research Council (ERC) grantees and their teams. This joint scheme is the first of its kind targeting researchers in Thailand. It will promote cooperation between the Thai Programme Management Unit for Human Resources & Institutional Development, Research and Innovation (PMU-B) of the National Higher Education, Science, Research & Innovation Policy Council and the ERC.\n\n\n\nH.E. the European Union Ambassador to Thailand, David Daly, and the Director of PMU-B Prof. Dr. Sompong Klaynongsruang signed the new initiative today at a ceremony in Bangkok.\n\n\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel said: “With the signing of this new initiative, a positive step has been taken to strengthen collaboration between the EU and the ASEAN region in scientific research. It will benefit both sides, with top Thai researchers joining teams led by outstanding scientists funded by the European Research Council.”\n\n\n\nERC President Prof. Maria Leptin, who attended the ceremony remotely, said: “We welcome this new agreement that is fully in line with the ERC’s openness to the world. Excellent science is intrinsically international; encouraging scientific exchange across continents can only benefit us all. This initiative will help ERC grantees to host top talent from Thailand and will facilitate interactions of Thai researchers with international partners. It’s a win-win.”\n\n\n\nProf. Dr. Sompong Klaynongsruang, PMU-B Director, stated: “The European Research Council is internationally recognised as one of the most successful frontier science programmes in the world. We are delighted for the bright young Thai researchers to gain world-class experience working alongside the ERC-funded research teams. We sincerely appreciate the European Commission’s and the ERC’s support and are confident that this initiative will lead to a long-term impactful collaboration between Thailand and the EU in frontier research.”\n\n\n\nThe scheme, formally called administrative arrangement (formerly “implementing arrangement), is open to top researchers supported by PMU-B. It will facilitate their temporary participation in ERC research groups in similar areas of research or on topics of mutual interest. Such single or multiple research visits can be short or long-term. This arrangement forms part of the ERC’s global outreach strategy that aims to make Europe a hub for research talent.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe European Research Council, set up by the European Union in 2007 and marking its 15th anniversary this year, is the premier European funding organisation for excellent frontier research. It funds creative researchers of any nationality and age, to run projects based across Europe. The ERC offers four core grant schemes: Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants, Advanced Grants and Synergy Grants. With its additional Proof of Concept Grant scheme, the ERC helps grantees to bridge the gap between their pioneering research and early phases of its commercialisation.\n\n\n\nTo date, the ERC has funded over 11,000 top researchers at various stages of their careers, and over 80,000 postdoctoral fellows, PhD students and other staff working in their research teams. With grants open to talent of any nationality, the ERC aims to attract top researchers from across the world. So far, two Thai nationals have won ERC funding. The ERC also encourages non-European scientists to join ERC-funded teams. Around 17% of team members are non-European nationals.\n\nAfter the first initiative in 2012 to encourage talent backed by the US National Science Foundation, NSF, to join temporarily ERC teams, other Implementing Arrangements followed with prestigious funding bodies across different continents.\n\n\n\nThe ERC is led by an independent governing body, the Scientific Council. Since 1 November 2021, Maria Leptin is the President of the ERC. The overall ERC budget from 2021 to 2027 is more than €16 billion, as part of the Horizon Europe programme, under the responsibility of the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel.\n\n\n\nERC and non-European researchers\n\nEU international R&I cooperation",
    "Unlikely Biden will make APEC meeting in Thailand": "Thailand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson reported that they are trying to find a way for US President Joe Biden to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ meeting in Bangkok after he made it known it clashes with a family wedding.\n\nThe US President will attend the G20 conference in Bali on November 15 and November 16 but will probably miss the APEC meeting in the Thai capital on November 18 and November 19. In his place, Biden will most likely send Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nFollowing the G20 summit, Biden will return to Washington. The 79 year old had planned to travel to Bangkok for a one-day stopover.\n\nThailand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Tanee Sangrat, announced both parties are looking to find a way for President Biden to attend the meeting but it looks unlikely.\n\nThe APEC meeting is an intergovernmental forum dedicated to promoting free trade and investment, economic growth and development, and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. It operates based on non-binding commitments and open dialogue.\n\nDr PojAramwattananont, Chairman of the APEC CEO Summit 2022 and ABAC Thailand Member, and KasemsitPathomsak, Executive Director of the APEC CEO Summit 2022 and ABAC Thailand Alternate Member, both expressed confidence in terms of the themes, organisation and business insight support for the landmark summit.\n\nDr PojAramwattananont said that the Thai private sector is ready to welcome business leaders to the summit under the theme “Embrace, Engage, Enable.”\n\n“This year’s summit will be the first for prominent economists and business leaders to meet in person. More than 10 leaders from the APEC member\n\neconomies will give keynote speeches on topics that are of high public interest.\n\n“The programme will also include panel discussions among thought leaders and distinguished speakers on the issues that will help chart the direction of the world’s economy. It is a great opportunity for Thailand to play host to the remarkable trade and investment convention.\n\n“The summit will be a chance for the Thai private sector to display to the world our potential, whether in food security, investment, tourism, or finance. For this reason, the business sector is encouraging young entrepreneurs around Thailand to take part in organising the event. This outreach is crucial as the younger generations will play a key role in driving the country’s economy in the future.”\n\nThe last in-person APEC summit was held in Papua New Guinea in 2018. It appears the US has form for a non-attendance by a US President. In 2018, the then US President, Donald Trump, did not attend the meeting either and instead, Vice President Mike Pence represented the US.\n\nSOURCE: Thai PBS\n\nWin a 3-night beachfront stay at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket by taking a short Thaiger Survey HERE!",

    "Thailand pet food market details growing exports": "BANGKOK — With United States pet food manufacturers known globally for superior products, it’s no wonder that exports of these products have grown significantly during the past few years, according to Gina Tumbarello, senior director of international policy and trade for the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA). In Pet Food Processing’s September 2022 edition, Tumbarello detailed the trade opportunities US pet food processors are missing out on within various global regions, including Thailand.\n\n“While Vietnam and Thailand are not currently significant markets for pet food exports, there is growing potential for US pet food manufacturers to compete in these markets,” Tumbarello wrote. “…In Thailand [households owning cats and dogs] grew 22% and 17% respectively, between 2017 and 2021.”\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, US exports of dog and cat food to Thailand grew a mere 4.2% from 2021 to 2022, amassing $8.98 million. Though there is trade potential for US pet food processors in the country, most pet food exports are hindered by Thai tariff rates, which currently sit at 9%.\n\nAs pet ownership in the Indo-Pacific country increases, as well as trends in premiumization and humanization, Thai exports are gaining significant traction as US exports fall behind in the country.\n\nAccording to the Thai Pet Food Trade Association (TPFA), Thailand became the world’s third largest pet food exporter in 2021, exporting a value of more than 65 billion baht ($1.7 billion USD), a 27% increase from 2020. The country’s top exporters include the United States, Japan, Italy, Malaysia and Australia. According to the association, Thai pet food exports have already witnessed significant growth for 2022, increasing 43% within the first seven months.\n\nWith a large agricultural industry, 95% of the raw materials used in Thai pet foods are sourced locally, furthering the country’s production and success in global trade, according to TPFA.\n\n\"Our strengths also derive from the long-standing experiences and reputation in canned tuna production which can be broaden into wet pet food manufacturing,\" said Chanintr Chalisarapong, Ph.D., president of TPFA.\n\nThe country’s top pet food manufacturers include Perfect Companion Group, owner of SmartHeart and Me-O brands; Asian Sea, owner of the Monchou brand; Charoen Pokphand Foods, owner of JerHigh and Jinny brands; and Thai Union, owner of the brand ChangeTer. The growth of pet ownership and consumer demand for more pet nutrition products within the country has also attracted several international companies, including Mars Petcare, Nestle Purina, Pedigree and Tiki Pets.\n\nIn Thailand, pet food consumers are interested in pet food products that boast safety, variety and dietary value, similar to those of human foods. Consumer demand has increased for prescription formulas and functional supplements that target a variety of pet health conditions, like heart, lung and kidney diseases, according to TPFA.\n\n\"The trust in our manufacturers' quality and safety standards from customers, combined with product diversification, innovation and continuous development contribute to Thailand's competitive edge in the global pet food market,\" Chalisarapong said.\n\nWith the global pet food market projected to reach a CAGR of 4.6% from 2022 to 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence, Thailand will likely ramp up its competitiveness in the global market and further its position as a leader in pet food exportation.\n\nFind more articles related to pet food export opportunities and trade.",
    "Agoda: Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Hua Hin cited as top Thailand destinations for international travellers": "\"Explore Thailand\" Campaign to Help Boost Thailand's Reopening\n\nBANGKOK, Sept. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Thailand's borders are now fully open, and travellers from all over the world are heading back in droves to explore its unspoiled beaches and idyllic islands, serene countryside, and the bustle of Bangkok city. Agoda has revealed the top searched Thai destinations as it launches its dedicated Explore Thailand campaign offering great deals on top accommodation throughout Thailand.\n\nBeach resorts dominate the top seven searches, with Koh Chang, Koh Samui, Pattaya, and Phuket completing the top destination list according to Agoda. Find out what all the fuss is about.\n\nBangkok is a bustling metropolis that combines a rich culture and heritage with a hedonistic modern city of skyscrapers, party people and rooftop bars. Nestled in among some of the most well-known hotels in the world, are ancient temples, old markets and local neighbourhoods to explore.\n\nA city that never sleeps, Bangkok truly has something for everyone. From its burgeoning food scene, with street vendors serving delicious Thai staples at all hours, to gourmet restaurants, and its diverse shopping experience, the city is full of incredible experiences. Designer brands jostle for attention in Bangkok's top malls dotted along the Bangkok Train System, while tourists and locals alike flock to markets such as Khlong Ong Ang Walking Street near Chinatown and Chatuchak market. Escape from the toots of the tuk tuks to the Green Lung or newly opened Benjakitti Forest Park and enjoy a slower pace for a while.\n\nChiang Mai in the north has always been a popular spot for backpackers and locals alike, and is growing in recognition from a wider traveler demographic seeking out its temples and slightly cooler climes. There are many majestic temples dotted throughout the city and no visit is complete without a visit to one. Explore Prasat Temple with its Lanna architectural style believed to date back 500 years. While not as famous as other nearby temples, it has interesting and unique features that make this temple worth visiting, such as the entrance panels and pillars that are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in the Lanna style, and the short tunnel that connects the viharn (a prayer hall) to the chedi (pagoda) behind it.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor something closer to nature, Royal Park Rajapruek has more than 200 acres to explore and features tropical flowers and fauna - a World of Insects, a garden of Rare Plants, an Orchid Garden, and Gardens for the King. It also includes authentic Lanna architecture of Ho Kham Luang Royal Pavilion letting visitors revel in traditional northern architecture. Don't worry about getting round all of the 200 acres – there is a free tram service, or bicycle rentals for the more active.\n\nFamous Beaches and Islands\n\nFamed for its bountiful palm edged tropical beaches with white sand and turquoise seas, for beach lovers Thailand doesn't disappoint.\n\nOnly a few hours drive from Bangkok, travellers can explore the Thai Royal family's favoured destination of Hua Hin of the Gulf of Thailand, famed for its Khao Tao Beach – great for kite surfing, and playing in the waves. Head the other way out of the city for a different beach experience visiting Pattaya, renowned for its party scene and easy access to the city.\n\nSlightly further afield but well worth jumping on a plane for, are family favourites Koh Samui and Phuket, and the island of Koh Chang. Havens for beachcombers and those looking to unwind and relax, these islands are home to some of Thailand's most beautiful beaches.\n\nPhuket, the biggest of these islands has a number of long white sandy beaches at Surin, Kamala Bay, and Karon Beach. For those willing to get off the beaten track, Freedom Beach is nestled in the valley between Patong and Karon beaches. A jungle trek or boat ride is the only way to access this unspoiled beach. It stretches 300 meters, featuring clear turquoise sea water against a backdrop of colourful green jungle. The beach is an ideal spot for visitors to swim, sunbathe and snorkel. There is also a restaurant serving simple food and drinks.\n\nFor a little culture and a spectacular view visit The Big Buddha, a 45m high statue made of white jade marble perches on the Nakkerd Hills between Chalong and Kata in Phuket.\n\nOn Koh Chang, accessible from Trad, Klong Prao Beach is widely considered as one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. Large trees lined along the beach provide shade for beachgoers to lay back and soak up the sun or even have a picnic. The water is shallow for most of the day making it an ideal spot for children to take a dip or anyone who likes to paddle. Although there is no lively shopping street, accommodation and restaurants are easy to find in the northern and southern parts of the beach.\n\nTo really get away from it all, Salakphet Mangrove Walkway or known locally as the red bridge stretches through the Salakphet Mangrove Forest. Along the way, branches that have inclined towards each other make a seemingly beautiful arch, shading the walkway. It's the perfect place to get away from city lights as green hills can be seen in the distance with almost no buildings in sight at all.\n\nLike Phuket, Koh Samui has an abundance of beaches to explore for daytime sunbathing and they also come alive in the evening with beach bars and diners all along Chawang beach Fisherman's Village Walking Street takes place every Friday on Bhoput Beach. It is one of the biggest markets on the island and it has an array of small stalls and boutique shops that sell delicious food, lovely handicrafts, musical instruments and unique accessories.\n\nTake a trip on a traditional long-tail boat out to Pig Island, whose official name is Mudsum Island, but the name Pig Island is more commonly used due to the 10 pigs that roam the beach after they were saved by a local bar man.\n\nThe Explore Thailand' Campaign runs from 19-23 September 2022, with a stay period within 90 days of booking.

Andaman sea resorts such as Phuket and Khao Lak enjoy temperatures in the late twenties, and with the sea levels at their lowest this time of year, you won’t be struggling to find space even on the region’s most popular beaches.\n\nIn the North, the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai lie in rolling mountain valleys meaning the temperatures sit slightly cooler between 15 and 25, making a light jacket comfortable in the evening.\n\nMarch-May, rainy season\n\nLate march marks the start of Thailand’s rainy season, with rainfall increasing further into the summer you go. As the rainy season is Thailand’s low season, there is potential to get excellent deals on accommodation. Luxurious 5-star beachfront hotels such as Outrigger or Avani Plus Samui resort alongside the coast of Taling Ngam beach for less than £100 a night\n\nIn April, you can also experience Thailand’s largest festival – Songkran. The Thai New Year, sometimes known as the ‘Water Festival’ is held across the country, with the epicentre of celebrations taking place in Chiang Mai. The water at the onset of the rainy season is said to represent cleaning and fresh starts, with water fights often occurring to welcome the commencement of the hot weather.\n\nThe spring also provides the best opportunity to spot wildlife in the northern rainforests, such as in the Khao Sok national park. Here you can feed Asian elephants, stroll amongst the monkeys in the rainforest or kayak down the weaving rivers as they carve through the limestone mountain landscape.\n\nJune–August, monsoon season\n\nEarly June marks the start of the monsoon season in Thailand, lasting until October. The climate is humid and hot with frequent, short-lived, torrential downpours.\n\nExpect maximum temperatures around 32/33, with larger northern cities, such as Bangkok, experiencing temperatures a couple of degrees higher than southern coastal areas like Phuket.\n\nAs the monsoon season falls in these months, you can expect a reduced footfall of tourists, often meaning you can find exceptional value for money. If you’re on the hunt for some drier weather, the Eastern beach resorts of Hua Hin, Pattaya, Koh Samet and Koh Samui have some of the finest beaches Thailand has to offer\n\nSeptember–November, temperatures lower and rainfall reduces\n\nHeading into the autumn as the temperatures subside and rainfall reduces can provide one of the best opportunities to visit Thailand whilst avoiding some of the chaos and crowds that come in the peak winter months.\n\nThis time of year is the best for snorkelers or divers as the nutrients washed down to the coast during the rains provide food for a whole range of species. From Koh Tao, you can snorkel off the coast of its tranquil beaches or head out to dive amongst whale sharks.\n\nAcross the autumn months, Thailand hosts numerous of its most popular festivals. Yi Peng, known as the festival of light, is one of the most popular of the year, with thousands of flickering candles and sky lanterns drifting off against the moonlight.\n\nFor foodies, there is the Phuket Vegetarian Festival held in late September. People travel from all across Asia to visit the festival where you can expect a spectacular range of local vegetarian cooking and some more unusual demonstrations, such as walking over hot coals and performers pushing knives through their cheeks.\n\nThailand Entry Requirements\n\nTo enter Thailand, you will need to show either proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR test. Thailand will accept the NHS covid vaccination records and recovery certificates. For those unvaccinated, the PCR test must be taken within 72 hours of travel. Under 17s do not need to show proof of vaccination.\n\nBefore entry, your passport must have at least six months of validity, and a visa is required.",

    "Thailand is optimistic it has room to slow rate hikes, but one economist says it's a gamble": "watch now\n\nCustomers shop at a wet market in Bangkok, Thailand, on July 2, 2022. Thailand's economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the second quarter, official data showed on Monday, helped by increased activity and a rebound in tourism as Covid-19 curbs were eased, but surging inflation remains a concern. Andre Malerba | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n\"I think when we look at the capital inflow and outflow, we still have the net inflow of capital. As you can see, our stock market although is very volatile at this time, foreign buyers are still net buyers for capital in Thailand.\" Not everyone agrees. Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather said the Thai central bank might be too optimistic given that the Thai baht has fallen 12% peak-to-trough in the past year and foreign exchange reserves have dropped sharply. \"In terms of monetary policy, the central bank is certainly taking a gamble,\" Leather said. \"It is true that the factors pushing inflation higher, energy and food, have been on the supply side, and tighter monetary policy will not directly affect that. But raising rates just once while headline inflation has increased from 3.2% in January to 7.9% currently, is a risk.\" The Bank of Thailand's inflation target is between 1% to 3%, but headline inflation hit 7.86% in August. Thailand raised its key policy rate by 25 basis points in August from a record low of 0.5%, and the one-day repurchase rate currently stands at 0.75%. The last time the central bank raised the benchmark rate was almost four years ago in December 2018.\n\nOur expectations are for the Bank of Thailand to proceed with gradual policy rate hikes and monetary normalization as it balances rising inflation with a smooth economic growth lift-off. Chua Han Teng Economist, DBS Group Research\n\nInstead of racing to hike rates, Termpittayapaisith said it's important to take a more balanced approach to monetary policy especially when the Thai economy is recovering and the country is still experiencing net capital inflows. \"The central bank is very, very careful in raising the interest rate… at the same time our economy has to recover.\" The finance minister also said since global inflation was caused by supply side disruptions, hiking up rates to curb demand might not be an effective approach. He said he was not worried about servicing foreign debt — even as the Thai baht continues to depreciate against the U.S. dollar — since there are other growth engines in Thailand beyond the tourism sector. \"I'm not worried because debt service is still in our capacity, particularly for... the public debt,\" Termpittayapaisith said. \"I think once the economy recovers, I think we are not worried about that.\" Aside from tourism, Termpittayapaisith said the government was expecting increased foreign direct investments in its Eastern Economic Corridor, a new economic zone in the country's eastern provinces. The number of tourists is expected to rise to between 8 million to 10 million next year, about a quarter of pre-Covid numbers, according to Termpittayapaisith. On Thursday, the Thai government also said it wanted to increase its rice exports. Earlier last week, the Thai National Shippers' Council reaffirmed Thailand's exports were still on track to rise between 6% to 8% this year.\n\nwatch now",

    "Why was Thailand’s cannabis bill voted down and will this derail legalization?": "Why was Thailand’s cannabis bill voted down and will this derail legalization?\n\nThe shooting down of the marijuana bill in Parliament last week sparked concerns on both sides of the debate.\n\nThe pro-pot camp is worried the legalization of cannabis will be reversed, while others – including many doctors – are afraid that consumption of cannabis without proper controls will continue.\n\nWill marijuana become illegal again?\n\nMPs from two major parties – the Democrats and Pheu Thai – have called for a review of the draft law’s content, but they have also suggested that it may be time to reconsider whether cannabis should be removed from the list of illegal narcotics.\n\nChaithawat Tulathon, secretary-general of the opposition Move Forward Party, called on Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to cancel the decriminalization of cannabis until the Marijuana Act is implemented.\n\nAnutin is also leader of the coalition’s Bhumjaithai Party, whose key election promise was to legalize marijuana.\n\nAs such, Bhumjaithai insists it will do everything to ensure the recent legalization is not reversed.\n\nThe party’s pro-marijuana stance has won the support of many groups in Thailand. These include the People’s Cannabis Network, which described the House of Representatives’ rejection of the bill during its second reading as a “big disappointment”.\n\n“MPs should realize that there are people in their areas who require cannabis for health reasons,” the network’s key man Thanachoke Tienrungroj said.\n\nWhy was the bill shot down?\n\nPrasert Chanruangthong, Pheu Thai Party’s secretary-general, said the bill had only 46 articles in the first reading, but that suddenly grew to twice as many in the second reading.\n\n“I have to say the addition of more than 40 new articles is unprecedented,” Prasert commented. “We have to exercise caution. We have no objection to marijuana being used for medical reasons but we are worried about recreational use.”\n\nDemocrat MP Satit Wongnongtoey said the marijuana bill was problematic because it does not ease the worries of doctors and families over marijuana’s negative effects.\n\nPheu Thai, which leads the opposition, and government coalition partner the Democrat Party deny their opposition to the bill is part of a political game.\n\nHowever, the Democrats are reportedly upset that Bhumjaithai had earlier opposed their decision to keep collecting interest on student loans.\n\nWhat was added to the bill?\n\nSuphachai Jaismut, Bhumjaithai Party’s registrar, argued that the extra articles added to the bill were necessary to strengthen rules on consuming cannabis. For instance, one new article bans people under the age of 20 from using cannabis in any form.\n\nPheu Thai’s deputy leader Suthin Klangsaeng, however, complained that several changes were questionable. He cited the change in the maximum number of cannabis plants each household could grow, from six in the first reading of the bill to 15 in the second reading.\n\nWhat do doctors say?\n\nMore than 1,000 doctors have signed a petition calling on authorities to urgently plug the legal loopholes opened after cannabis was taken off the narcotics list. Since there is no single comprehensive law governing its use, consumption of cannabis is now unregulated in many aspects.\n\n“Thailand has been very liberal in terms of cannabis usage for more than three months now. Without clear and proper regulations, recreational marijuana has spread through different communities and reached children as well as vulnerable people,” the petition said.\n\n“Don’t wait for the bill to be legislated. The longer this legal vacuum exists, the more the country will be damaged.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Medical Association of Thailand, the Medical Council and several specialist colleges released a statement voicing their concerns. The statement also claimed that the policy of treating marijuana as a non-narcotic substance and allowing people to grow and use the herb to treat health conditions would do more harm than good.\n\n“Consuming marijuana can be addictive and can have long-term health impacts, including mental illness,” it said. “Homegrown marijuana can be contaminated and people lack sufficient medical knowledge to administer it properly,” the statement added.\n\nThe draft bill has been withdrawn and sent for further review before it can be tabled for debate again in Parliament. However, the House of Representatives’ current term ends in March next year, meaning the bill may not be passed during this Parliament.\n\nAnutin said Bhumjaithai would continue to push for the bill during the next election if it fails to pass under this Parliament",
    "Photos: Thailand’s out-of-work elephants in crisis": "In Thailand’s northeastern village of Ban Ta Klang, Siriporn Sapmak starts her day by doing a livestream of her two elephants on social media. She does this to raise money to survive.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who has been taking care of elephants since she was in school, points her phone at the animals as she feeds them bananas and they walk around behind her family home.\n\nSiriporn says she can raise about 1,000 baht ($27.46) in donations from several hours of livestreaming on TikTok and YouTube, but that is only enough to feed her two elephants for one day.\n\nIt is a new, and insecure, source of income for the family, who before the pandemic earned money by doing elephant shows in the Thai city of Pattaya. They top up their earnings by selling fruit.\n\nLike thousands of other elephant owners around the country, the Sapmak family had to return to their home village as the pandemic decimated elephant camps and foreign tourism ground to a halt. Only 400,000 foreign tourists arrived in Thailand last year compared with nearly 40 million in 2019.\n\nSome days, Siriporn doesn’t receive any donations and her elephants are underfed.\n\n“We are hoping for tourists to [return]. If they come back, we might not be doing these livestreams any more,” she said. “If we get to go back to work, we get an [stable] income to buy grass for elephants to eat.”\n\nEdwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, estimates that at least 1,000 elephants in Thailand would have no “proper income” until more tourists return.\n\nThailand has about 3,200 to 4,000 captive elephants, according to official agencies, and about 3,500 in the wild.\n\nWiek said the Livestock Development Department needs to find “some kind” of budget to support these elephants.\n\n“Otherwise, it’s going to be difficult to keep them alive I think, for most families,” he said.\n\nThe families in Ban Ta Klang, the epicentre of Thailand’s elephant business located in Surin province, have cared for elephants for generations and have a close connection to them.\n\nElephant shows and rides have long been popular with tourists, especially the Chinese, while animal rights groups’ criticism of how elephants are handled there has given rise to tourism in sanctuaries.\n\n“We are bound together like family members,” Siriporn’s mother Pensri Sapmak, 60, said.\n\n“Without the elephants, we don’t know what our future will look like. We have today thanks to them.”\n\nThe government has sent 500 tonnes of grass across multiple provinces since 2020 to help feed the elephants, according to the Livestock Development Department, which oversees captive elephants.\n\nElephants, Thailand’s national animal, eat 150 to 200kg (330 to 440 pounds) each day, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nSiriporn and her mother, however, said they have not yet received any government support.\n\n“This is a big national issue,” said Livestock Development Department Director-General Sorawit Thanito.\n\nHe said the government plans to assist elephants and their caretakers and that “measures along with a budget will be proposed to cabinet” without giving a time frame.\n\nWhile the government is expecting 10 million foreign tourists this year, some say this may not be enough to lure elephant owners back to top tourist destinations, given the costs involved. Chinese tourists, the mainstay of elephant shows, have also yet to return amid COVID-19 lockdowns at home.\n\n“Who has the money right now to arrange a truck … and how much security [do] they have that they are really going to have business again when they go back?” asks Wiek.\n\nHe expected more elephants to be born in captivity over the next year, exacerbating the pressures on their owners.\n\n“Some days we make some money, some days none, meaning there’s going to be less food on the table”,” said Pensri. “I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel.”",
    "Going with the flow on an impulsive trip to Thailand": "Listen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nOn the southwestern coast of Thailand, limestone cliffs tower over seawater against the backdrop of swaying trees. Long-tail boats — the only means of transportation to Railay Beach — sit parked in the distance, neon-pink-and-green flags swaying at the bow. Sand bubbler crabs dip above and below the surface, leaving their intricate designs at the mercy of high tide and flip-flops. I’m sitting in a bar on the beach, watching water droplets fall down my ice-cold Singha beer, looking at the sunset glimmer on the water. Picturesque doesn’t even begin to describe this. There’s just one question on my mind: How did I end up here?\n\nA few weeks earlier, I was fantasizing about going somewhere — anywhere — far away. I craved the feeling of being lost in an unfamiliar city, soaking in its sounds, smells, energy. This led to casually browsing plane tickets to Southeast Asia, when a reasonably priced ticket to Bangkok popped up. Later that month, I boarded the plane with a friend who booked her trip a few days after mine.\n\nWhile jetting across the world on a whim admittedly made me feel pretty cocky, it turns out I’m part of a larger trend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from the online travel company Skyscanner, demand focused on the Asia-Pacific region — and Thailand, in particular — has taken off since coronavirus restrictions began to ease in April. During May and June, for example, it was the third most popular long-haul destination from France, where I live.\n\nBeyond the uptick in trips to the region, Matt Bradford, who analyzes trends and insights for Skyscanner, has identified short booking horizons — a window of 30 days or less between booking and takeoff — as a new behavior. He explained by phone that, in France during May and June, 39 percent of bookings made on the site were for departures within one month. (In the United States, that figure was 35 percent.)\n\nWhen the doors slide open at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport, it hits you: wet, sweltering heat. Within one minute, my skin was covered in a slick film of humidity and sweat, dripping down the back of my neck as we hopped into a cab. We drove past roadside dumpling joints, skyscrapers and a seemingly endless string of stalls selling sex toy souvenirs.\n\nThe next afternoon, after a delicious lunch at Rung Reung Pork Noodle — a bare-bones, plastic-stool, fan-blasting haven for pork meatballs, noodles and broth — we set off toward Wat Arun, a temple built during the Ayutthaya era on the bank of the Chao Phraya River. Its “prang” towers more than 200 feet overhead, intricately decorated with porcelain pieces and walkways that snake up and around it. As we were strolling through the grounds, a lady approached us offering a boat ride around a nearby floating market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur boat driver soon led us through Thonburi’s network of klongs, or canals, lined with worn wooden houses, many tilting on the stilts holding them above water. A woman wearing a straw hat with bows clipped onto the band slowly approached us on her long-tail boat, offering bracelets, key chains and flowery hair clips. After we politely declined, she reached into her cooler, emerging with a grin. “Beer?” While this normally wouldn’t send me over the edge with excitement, Bangkok had banned alcohol sales for 24 hours during its election, and a cold Chang sounded pretty good in that heat. I bought one for myself and our driver, and we continued to drift through the canals.\n\nI’m no floating-market expert, but let’s just say this one was slightly underwhelming; after a quick snack of fried quail eggs with soy sauce and sugar, we set off back toward Bangkok and spent the evening on a rooftop paying for drinks with crypto, the bar’s only payment option.\n\nThe next two days would see endless heaps of sausages splattering into hot oil on street food carts, 3 a.m. massages on Khaosan Road and walks down the side streets of Sukhumvit. Then, after being seduced by travelers and locals raving about the south — they generally urged us to avoid Phuket, the notorious destination for tourists looking to get lost in the black hole of its nightlife — we hopped on a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the intense, electric urban energy of Bangkok, Krabi — a southern province on Thailand’s Andaman Sea — was a literal breath of fresh air. We hopped into a shuttle that made various drop-offs in towns throughout the area. The driver played American country music as we drove past lush greenery on winding roads, passing a shooting range on the way into Ao Nang. A tourist, probably in her 20s, was talking to the woman next to her. “We don’t really have a plan,” she said.\n\nThey weren’t the only ones.\n\nIn Krabi, we set off by long-tail boat to explore the Ko Poda, Ko Thap and Ko Khai (or “Chicken”) islands off the coast, within the Phi Phi Islands national park. To say our first stop looked like a postcard would be a vast understatement. If you’ve ever imagined yourself on a deserted island, gazing out into crystal-clear waters under the shade of a mangrove tree on a white-sand beach, this was that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no one else in sight as we dived into the calm water, splashing around gleefully with silly grins on our faces. I soon started to notice some stinging on my upper arm. Thinking I was being a hypochondriac, I ignored it. A couple of minutes later, back onshore, my friend mentioned that her arm was stinging but reasoned that it was probably because of the saltwater-and-sunburn combination.\n\nWhen we finally connected the dots about our ailments, we strolled back to inspect the water. As it turns out, the deserted white-sand beach wasn’t deserted at all, but was instead full of massive translucent jellyfish, in the water and washed ashore, a small detail we didn’t register on our walk from the boat. Our driver didn’t seem too concerned, though. When asked whether the stings were dangerous, he laughed, shook his head and said, “No dead, no dead,” still chuckling as he returned to the stern.\n\nOn our last night, we returned to Railay Beach via long-tail boat, tilting dramatically against the waves, water splashing into the boat through the open sides. After wading through the water to get to shore, we dropped off our stuff and hit the beach bar. “Hotel California” played in the background as the sun disappeared over the horizon, revealing stars and the vast surrounding cliffs shining in the moonlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, the power went out.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the bartender created a makeshift glowing lantern by putting his phone flashlight under a bottle of Curaçao. Candles were lit. We asked for another round. “Why not?” he replied.\n\nA wander through the pitch-black town revealed shadows of massage ladies, chatting quietly while huddled together, looking out onto the pathway. Bartenders hung out outside, just their silhouettes visible in the darkness. In one bar, candles cast a glowing light over a pool table beyond the open windowsills, an acoustic guitar player singing behind it. We spent a few hours in that bar as rains flooded the road outside.\n\nBehind us, the bartender kept laughing to himself, repeating, “Why not?” — seemingly the town’s unofficial catchphrase — every couple of minutes. We couldn’t make out the faces of the people opposite us, just their shadows. Reality felt conflated with a sort of dream world — in a good way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly, the lights came on. Almost immediately, the place that couldn’t have felt farther away from home made me think of the bars on Rue de Lappe, the notoriously rowdy party street in my Paris neighborhood, characterized by neon lights and flaming shots. Acoustic music quickly faded behind the Top 40 songs blasting on the stereo, and fairy lights blinked aggressively on the walls. It was time to go. The next morning, I left Krabi, already feeling nostalgic as that night shifted from reality into memory on the journey back to Paris.\n\nI’m not advocating for always traveling without a plan. We missed a lot. The one thing we really wanted to do — travel by train from north to south — wasn’t possible without booking ahead. Our floating-market experience could have benefited from better research. We could have seen more sights. But if someone had asked me, “Would you like to take a rickety long-tail boat in high swells to this isolated beach town that will lose power, where you’ll be essentially stranded until morning?”\n\nI’d say, “Why not?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadziemski is a writer based in Paris.

    "Thailand arrests Myanmar military-linked businessman suspected of drug trafficking": "Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nBANGKOK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Thai authorities said on Wednesday they had detained a Myanmar tycoon suspected of drug trafficking, who three sources said was linked to the upper echelons of Myanmar's ruling military junta.\n\nTun Min Latt, 53, was arrested in the Thai capital Bangkok in a dawn raid last week along with three Thai nationals on charges of conspiracy to traffic narcotics and money laundering, said Thailand's deputy police spokesperson Kissana Phathanacharoen.\n\n\"Police are in the process of requesting the court for pre-trial detention,\" Kissana told Reuters by phone.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThree sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Tun Min Latt, who has business interests in hotels, energy and mining, is a close associate of Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing and has procured supplies for the military.\n\nBritish authorities sanctioned one of Tun Min Latt's businesses in August in what they called an \"effort to limit the military's access to arms and revenue.\"\n\nMyanmar state media have published pictures of Tun Min Latt with the junta leader, including at an arms fair in Bangkok in 2019.\n\nA 2019 U.N. document says Tun Min Latt is the son of a retired Myanmar lieutenant colonel and that a company he part-owns had made donations amounting to about $71,500 to the Myanmar military in 2017.\n\nReuters' requests for comment from Tun Min Latt and his companies were not answered. Calls to a Myanmar military spokesperson also went unanswered.\n\nIn a statement, Kissana later said the police anti-drugs unit had asked a court to extend the suspects' detention to gather more evidence and investigate the network. He said police also confiscated assets worth over 200 million baht ($5.4 million) from the four suspects.\n\nMyanmar's military seized power from the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and has since sought to consolidate power through a deadly crackdown on opposition.\n\nA source with knowledge of Tun Min Latt's case - who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to media - said his arrest is part of a broader Thai crackdown on money laundering from narcotics in the border town of Tachileik in Myanmar's Shan state.\n\nThe Thai government's Office of the Narcotics Control Board declined comment.\n\n($1 = 37.1200 baht)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Poppy Mcpherson and Panu Wongcha-um; Editing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Thai court orders repair of The Beach location 22 years after filming": "More than two decades after the Hollywood film The Beach was shot at Thailand’s glittering Maya Bay, the kingdom’s supreme court has ordered officials to press ahead with environmental rehabilitation work.\n\nThe 2000 adventure drama, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, drew criticism for the impact of the shoot on the once pristine sands of the bay, located on the island of Ko Phi Phi Leh in southern Thailand.\n\nThe film-makers planted dozens of coconut trees to give a more “tropical” feel to Maya Bay and were accused of ripping up vegetation growing on sand dunes.\n\nHowever, the US production studio 20th Century Fox insisted it left the beach exactly as it had found it and that it had removed tonnes of rubbish.\n\nLocal authorities filed a civil lawsuit in late 1999 against Thai government agencies, 20th Century Fox and a Thai film coordinator, seeking 100m baht in compensation for environmental damage.\n\nOn Tuesday, the supreme court in Bangkok upheld a previous ruling by a civil court that the royal forest department was liable for rehabilitating Maya Bay.\n\nIn a final ruling, the supreme court ordered the department to form a committee to make a rehabilitation plan within 30 days.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners launched two unsuccessful legal challenges to stop filming of the movie, based on Alex Garland’s cult novel, over concerns about ecological damage.\n\nThe film put Maya Bay on the map and it fell victim to mass tourism. It was closed in October 2018 to allow it to recover from the impact of a daily influx of 6,000 visitors.\n\nThe entire Phi Phi archipelago was forced into a convalescence when the global pandemic hit and visitor numbers dwindled to virtually nil as Thailand imposed tough travel rules.\n\nMaya Bay reopened to tourists at the start of 2022, but visitor numbers are capped to try to limit ecological damage."
