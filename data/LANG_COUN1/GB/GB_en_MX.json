REUTERS/Yahir Ceballos\n\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Farmers in the United States are urging their government to challenge a looming Mexican ban on genetically modified (GM) corn under a regional free trade agreement, warning of billions of dollars of economic damage to both countries.\n\nA late 2020 decree by Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would phase out GM corn and the herbicide glyphosate by 2024. Supporters of the ban say GM seeds can contaminate Mexico's age-old native varieties, and point to research showing adverse effects of glyphosate.\n\nMexico prides itself as the birthplace of modern corn but it imports about 17 million tonnes of U.S. corn a year and is on track to import even more this year, experts said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSome in Mexico's government, including Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos, have signaled that yellow corn imports for livestock feed will not be disrupted. U.S. farmers remain wary since no official document states that, according to a U.S. agriculture official familiar with recent meetings with Mexican officials.\n\nAlso, Lopez Obrador this month said firmly: \"We do not accept GMO corn.\"\n\nCorn for human consumption, including white corn used in food products like tortillas, accounts for between 18% and 20% of Mexico's total U.S. corn imports. There are still questions about whether such GM imports will be eliminated by 2024.\n\nMexico's health regulator COFEPRIS has not authorized new strains of glyphosate-resistant GM corn seeds for import since 2018.

It was also blamed for two deaths.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said Thursday’s earthquake was centered 31 miles (50km) south-south-west of Aguililla, Michoacán, at a depth of 15 miles (24.1km).\n\nMichoacán’s government said the quake was felt throughout the state. It reported damage to a building in the city of Uruapan and some landslides on highways.\n\nMexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said via Twitter that Thursday’s temblor was an aftershock from Monday’s quake and was also felt in the states of Colima, Jalisco and Guerrero.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City, said via Twitter that two people died – a woman who fell down the stairs of her home and a man who had a heart attack. Residents huddled in streets as seismic alarms blared.\n\nThe earthquake rattled an already jittery country. Monday’s more powerful quake was the third major earthquake to strike on 19 September – in 1985, 2017 and now 2022.

    "What Art Lovers Should See in Mexico City, One of the World’s Top Art Destinations": "To say Mexico City is a great place to experience art would be a substantial understatement. Not only has it produced one of the world’s most beloved painters, Frida Kahlo, but it has consistently stood at the forefront of various international art movements for more than a century.\n\nBut the city’s artistic standing — as well as that of Mexico in general — suffers from misapprehensions derived largely from the region’s rather notorious reputation. At best it’s often considered a destination that offers little more than beaches and booze and, at worst, it’s assumed to be too dangerous to visit, great art notwithstanding.\n\nHaving spent most of the the past six years living in Mexico City and the rest of the country, I can report that both assertions are inaccurate. While the country has undoubtedly suffered issues with crime, Mexico is safe for visitors, with Mexico City in particular undergoing rapid shifts in recent decades to become a safer and ever-more artistically vibrant city. The city overflows with an artistic abundance that stacks up against any other great art city of the world. To that end, here’s a selection of the city’s standout art experiences, from its most renowned museums to under-the-radar spots that only locals know to visit.",

The character-driven short films will inspire and amaze, as these young change-makers tell their remarkable stories.\n\nThousand of species of marine life inhabit Mexico's Baja California peninsula. This area has colonies of seals and shoals of stingrays and was home to one of the largest shark populations in the world. However, a significant decline in the number of sharks has been observed in the area in recent years due to harmful human activity.\n\nA significant decline in the number of sharks has been observed in Mexico's Baja California peninsula in recent years due to harmful human activity Irene Barajas\n\nA non-profit association established by thirteen local women is working to save these apex predators. \"Orgcas is an organisation run by women with a shared interest in marine conservation. We come from a variety of different professions. We have biologists, pilots, cinematographers, photographers, ecologists, lawyers and many others,\" explains Porfirio Gomez, director of Orgcas.\n\nThe name, 'Orgcas,' is a play on the words, mixing 'organisation' and 'Orcas', an alternative word to describe a killer whale. Orgcas aim to preserve all species of marine life but are focusing their efforts on protecting sharks.\n\nThe importance of sharks\n\nSharks play an essential role in the ecosystem as they control their prey's distribution, abundance and diversity. They also indirectly support the growth of ocean plants by controlling populations of sea creatures that feed on them.\n\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are over 500 species of shark worldwide. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species states that over 143 of these species are in serious danger of extinction and are considered vulnerable to critically endangered.\n\nSeventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone according to Frida Lara, a scientific coordinator at Orgcas Irene Barajas\n\nThere are many reasons for the decline in the number of sharks. Their habitat is under increasing threat from pollution and climate change. Some are caught accidentally. Many are caught deliberately for their fins, which some countries consider a delicacy.\n\n\"Seventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone. We already have locally extinct sharks such as the Great Hammerhead and the Oceanic White Tip Shark that are almost gone too,\" says Frida Lara, scientific coordinator at Orgcas. \"If we don't do something now, it will be too late for shark populations to recover,\" she adds.\n\nShark fishing is legal in Mexico.\n\nThe method of shark fishing is legal in Mexico, and the country has occupied the top spot in the world in shark catching ever since the 1970s, according to the Intercultural Centre for the Study of Deserts and Oceans.\n\n\"The people that fish for sharks have been doing it for years. Their families have been doing it for generations before them. It is the only line of work they know, and we're not here to judge them,\" Porfirio Gomez tells Scenes.\n\nOrgcas are helping fishing communities transition from catching sharks to becoming tourist hubs for shark-related experiences Irene Barajas\n\nOrgcas are helping fishing communities transition from catching sharks to becoming tourist hubs for shark-related experiences. \"The town we're working with is called Agua Amarga. It is a small fishing town with a population of 500 people,\" says Elena, director of development at Orgcas. \"We are training them so that they can have an extra income and they can eventually phase out shark fishing,\" she adds.\n\nEmbracing change\n\nThere is no doubt that shark fishing is a challenging profession. Travelling to deep water to find sharks can be expensive and dangerous. So many local fishermen are willing to make a change in their careers.\n\nOrgcas's ultimate ambition is to expand its model to cover the whole peninsula of Baja, California, in order to protect its ecosystems at large Irene Barajas\n\n\"There is double the number of fishermen out there now. It is harder to fish because there are too many of us. But if we go with tourism, customers can go out and see one or two sharks, and they will be happy, and the ocean will be healthier,\" says Francisco Lucero Gerardo, a fisherman and member of Orgcas.\n\n\"If we can prove that this model is successful, I think we will start working with other fishing communities. I think Orgcas has huge potential to help people change their lives in many different ways,\" says Frida.\n\nOrgcas have gained the trust of the fishing community in Agua Amarga and are helping to increase local shark populations. As a result, the organisation's ultimate ambition is to expand its model to cover the whole peninsula of Baja, California, in order to protect its ecosystems at large.",

    "At UN, Mexico proposes a high-level diplomatic delegation to mediate between Russia and Ukraine": "The proposed caucus would include Pope Francis, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nSuch a caucus was necessary Mr. Ebrard explained, because the war in Ukraine had triggered a cascade of global consequences, including food and fuel shortages, disruptions in the world economy, polarized the multilateral system and led to a climate of mistrust and international uncertainty.\n\n“Just when it seemed like the recovery from the pandemic was on the horizon, we saw the war in Ukraine with the risk of a nuclear incident and catastrophic potential consequences,” he said.\n\nThe Mexican Foreign Minister underlined the paralysis of the UN Security Council the face of the conflict, highlighting its inaction to put a stop to armed aggression by one of its own members and to direct a diplomatic process in search of a peaceful and negotiated solution.\n\nFurther, he noted that the Security Council has not been able to guarantee necessary humanitarian assistance, nor has it been able to fully support the work of the Secretary General and other actors to manage access to grains and fertilizers produced by the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\n\nProposal to mediate conflict\n\n“For these reasons, the President of Mexico, proposes that a delegation or caucus of Heads of State and Government, that would encourage and accompany the efforts by the Secretary General to promote peaceful and trust-building measures between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This will allow us to make use of a peaceful resolution mechanism that would be within the framework of the UN Charter”, he stated.\n\nForeign Minister Ebrard explained that the intention is to create a diplomatic channel that complements those that already exist to interact with the parties in conflict, reduce tensions and channel mediation.\n\nMexico has already presented its proposal to the parties involved and will continue to make the necessary consultations “with the sole purpose of being able to contribute, as an impartial actor in good faith” and to generate greatest support for the efforts and good offices of the Secretary General and the Caucus. In this regard, Mr Ebrard said: “We hope that the creation of this caucus will have the support of the UN’s Member States.”\n\nAbuse of veto\n\nMr. Ebrard attributed the paralysis of the Security Council to the abuse of the so-called right to veto by some of its permanent members. He recalled that his country, together with France, has proposed an initiative that asks the permanent members to refrain from resorting to the veto in situations of mass atrocities. The proposal has so far received the support of 106 States.\n\nIn addition, Mexico and 83 other States promoted an accountability mechanism by which the General Assembly is urged to hold an emergency session every time a veto is registered in the Security Council and to invite the authors of that veto to explain their position.\n\n“We must now make a decision about whether or not we want to take further steps to prevent this system from suffering greater paralysis in the face of mass suffering of people,” he said.\n\nRestoring trust\n\nTo conclude, Foreign Minister Ebrard stressed that the door to political dialogue and diplomatic negotiation cannot be closed. “Current international tensions are not going to be resolved by force. We must ensure political understanding and trust-building mechanisms. Yes, restoring trust is one of our biggest challenges,” he added.\n\nIn this regard, he expressed his country's conviction that the UN continues to be a unique tool of the international community for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and progress towards sustainable development.",

    "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic": "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic\n\nRemittances hit record levels in 2021 driven by rising US wages and unemployment insurance relief\n\nRemittances—the money sent from citizens working abroad to families back home—are a crucial source of income in Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (CAPDR) as well as Mexico. Despite an expected decline at the onset of the pandemic, remittances surprisingly increased in 2020, hitting record levels in 2021. IMF staff research explores why remittances from the US to CAPDR and Mexico remained resilient during the pandemic.\n\nAn unexpected comeback\n\nRemittances to CAPDR and Mexico are sent by immigrants working predominantly in the service-providing sectors of the US economy. Economists predicted that remittances to CAPDR and Mexico would decline by up to 20 percent, given the fall in US employment at the onset of the pandemic. They based this prediction on the data from traditional macroeconomic models that linked US labor market conditions with immigrants’ income. These models accurately predicted the deep but brief collapse in remittances that we observed in April 2020, but they failed to predict the strong comeback that followed.\n\nExplaining the surge\n\nBefore the pandemic, the number of remittance transactions—the volume effect—determined the level of remittances. The jump in remittances observed in the second half of 2020 was a result of an increase in both the number of transactions and the average amount remitted per transaction—the value effect.\n\nThe rise in the number of transactions—the volume effect—was most likely driven by an increase in the number of people sending remittances rather than new immigrants arriving in the US. As a result of the lockdowns, immigrants also adapted and switched to remitting digitally, rather than in person, increasing the number of transactions. More importantly, most of the increase in remittances was due to the value effect. Rising US wages drove the increase in the average amounts remitted. US government assistance, through unemployment insurance relief, also supported incomes and compensated for the loss of income, contributing to the increase. The “altruism” motive was very strong; as COVID-19 cases were increasing at home, immigrants in the US sent on average more money home.\n\nRemittances remained strong in 2021 due to the US labor market recovery and sustained growth in real wages. By the end of 2021, the service sectors where CAPDR and Mexican immigrants predominantly work recovered, recording increases in weekly earnings that were above the US average.\n\nA look ahead\n\nLooking forward, the growth in remittances to CAPDR and Mexico is expected to slow, as some of the extraordinary factors in 2020 and 2021 dissipate. However, over time remittances are expected to grow, as immigration to the US continues to rise and the average amount remitted grows in line with US wages. If employment and wages remain strong in the US, we should expect an increase in remittances during times of hardship in Central America and Mexico, as immigrants help families back home.\n\n****\n\nYorbol Yakhshilikov is an economist in the IMF Western Hemisphere Department.",
    "Mexico's 'Chucky' Lozano steps up with late winner vs. Peru to give El Tri pre-World Cup boost": "PASADENA, Calif. -- For a little over 80 minutes on Saturday night against Peru, it looked as if a dark period for Mexico's men's national team would extend one game further as they approach the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBefore kicking off the weekend's friendly at the Rose Bowl, Mexico had one win in their last five games, which built additional tension for manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino and his side after a questionable run through World Cup qualifying and poor friendly results earlier this year.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nDuring a media day on Tuesday, themes of fan discontent, injury problems and leadership issues surrounded the national team. Martino looked frustrated behind the microphone at the media day, admitting that Mexico haven't played their best soccer since 2019-20, while also listing injuries for key players like Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Raul Jimenez, Houston Dynamo DP Hector Herrera, Ajax's Jorge Sanchez and Monterrey duo Rogelio Funes Mori and Luis Romo. Sevilla's Jesus \"Tecatito\" Corona, arguably El Tri's top player, was also unavailable in the international break after suffering a leg injury this summer that will likely keep him out of the World Cup.\n\nOff the field, the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) has dealt with a chaotic time of its own. Coupled with complications in the women's national team and at youth level, FMF president Mikel Arriola announced sweeping changes in July. Gerardo Torrado and Ignacio Hierro were fired from their respective posts as general sporting director and sporting director of national teams. Luis Perez was also let go as the men's U20 coach. Women's senior coach Monica Vergara would eventually lose her position as well.\n\nMartino held on to his post, despite failing to win the latest CONCACAF Nations League, the 2021 Gold Cup and going through four consecutive games without a victory against El Tri's U.S. men's national team rivals. Rumors of his possible exit from the FMF after the World Cup have led to a disharmonious and potentially cataclysmic end to 2022, but back on the field at Pasadena this weekend, a glimmer of hope emerged for all involved.\n\nIn front of a raucous 62,729 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, El Tri eventually looked enlivened after a dull start to the game through second-half substitutions for Uriel Antuna, Santiago Gimenez, Andres Guardado and Orbelin Pineda. Possibly due to desperation in changing the script that appeared pessimistic once again, there was excellent movement and playmaking in the final third that helped lead to a decisive corner in the 85th minute, which provided star winger Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano with a goal that sent the Rose Bowl into a frenzy. and secured a 1-0 win.\n\nThe 27-year-old did well to lead attacking efforts, and eventually found the game-winner late into the second half. Lozano was emotional after scoring his first goal in 2022 for Mexico, while fans sang his name to the usual tune of \"Seven Nation Army.\" Chants of \"El Chu-cky Lo-za-no\" were by far the loudest that they've been heard in years, joyous in the trust that the Napoli player had created a necessary step forward in Mexican soccer.\n\nConfidence at an all-game high, it was easy to forget about any of the problems El Tri has had on or off the field. The Rose Bowl became a party, and unlike the dire scenes that have become the norm at many Mexico matches, there was elation in their first of two World Cup \"sendoff\" games this month in California that ended in a 1-0 victory.\n\nHirving 'Chucky' Lozano gave Mexico a much-needed win in one of their final friendly matches before the World Cup. Omar Vega/Getty Images\n\n\"A victory is always important, and even more so against such a difficult team,\" Lozano said to TUDN after scoring the game-winner. \"I think they made the match very tough for us.\"\n\nEven the typically serious and tired Martino was beaming after the game, knowing not just that Mexico had earned a vital result, but that also he could have an unexpected leader through Lozano.\n\n\"After so many years in Europe, obviously, it makes a footballer evolve in every way,\" a proud Martino said about the Napoli winger after the match. \"It's clear that he is evolving, not only in the soccer part, but also in the professional part and in the human part.\"\n\n- 2022 World Cup bracket and fixtures schedule\n\nIt wasn't just about Chucky, but about the entire squad as they celebrated the goal. Through a release of tension, El Tri desperately needed this result ahead of the World Cup and above the criticism that has been placed upon them since struggling to recreate the magic of Martino's first couple of years in 2019 and 2020. In the postmatch news conference, Martino noted that the team is \"much more similar\" to the one that reached a perceived peak a couple years ago.\n\nIt's questionable to buy into the idea that Mexico are truly turning things around after a number of head-scratching performances over the last several months, but if they claimed another victory this Tuesday against Colombia at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium (which would mark just their second consecutive victory this year), there would be hope that Mexico's final two pre-World Cup friendlies could propel the team towards greater things at Qatar this November.\n\nThe idea of gradual changes and last-minute long shots might be unrealistic for their World Cup chances, but the same could be said of Lozano's lone attempt back in 2018 that shocked Germany in a 1-0 defeat during the World Cup.\n\nRegardless of injury problems across the squad and issues behind the scenes within the front office, Mexico can continue making small steps forward this month, with the help of an unlikely leader in Lozano and with the dreams of bigger and prominent steps this November.",

But when he arrives at a scene to report, he pulls out his single-lens reflex camera, hangs a press pass from the rearview mirror of his car, and puts on a navy-blue vest with his father’s name embroidered under the slogan, “To live with fear is not an option.”\n\nJorge Sánchez is one of a handful of volunteer journalists at La Unión, the publication that his father, Moisés Sánchez Cerezo, founded. The paper has grown from its early days in the 1980s when it was a flyer handed out around town. Now it’s a digital outlet with more than 17,000 Facebook followers and an occasional print edition. It remains free, ensuring that everyone in the community can read it.\n\nLa Unión’s focus is denuncia social, or social criticism—essentially local accountability reporting. It’s an emphasis that has proved deadly for journalists in Mexico, including Moisés Sánchez, whose body was found weeks after his kidnapping with signs of torture.\n\nOutside of active war zones, Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world for media workers. Since 2005, more than 30 reporters have been killed in the state of Veracruz alone. On September 19 at The Hague, the People’s Tribunal on the Murder of Journalists, which was organized by a group of media freedom organizations, declared Mexico (along with Sri Lanka and Syria) “guilty of all the human rights violations brought against them.” The unofficial court has no legal authority, but Miguel Ángel López Solana, the son of assassinated journalist Miguel Ángel López Velasco, read aloud part of the verdict at a public event in Veracruz.\n\nIt’s not only international groups trying to raise awareness about the attacks against reporters. The Network in Memory and Struggle for Assassinated or Disappeared Journalists, which was founded earlier this year, includes representatives from 14 families with relatives of murdered media workers. While it is the first collective in Mexico to unite around victims who were journalists, it is part of a long history of memory work in Latin America.\n\n“Mexico is a country with no memory,” said Patricia Espinosa, a preschool teacher in Mexico City whose brother Rubén Espinosa, a photojournalist, was killed in 2015. “Something happens today, and right now it’s news, and right now it’s important, but after a few months it’s no longer material.… We’ve gotten used to living with this quantity of cases.”\n\nAccording to Artículo 19, an NGO dedicated to press freedom in Mexico and Central America, the majority of documented aggressions against Mexican journalists are committed by government officials. The founders of the Network say the government has conducted smear campaigns against their deceased family members, bungled forensic processes, and mishandled their cases. Yet the group’s mission is not just to demand justice within the judicial system; with 98 percent of journalist murders in the country going unpunished, members told me that this goal often seems out of reach. The organization also commemorates murdered reporters and photographers, honors their work, and publicly and accurately discusses their assassinations to raise the political cost of future killings.\n\nThe Argentinian sociologist Elizabeth Jelin describes this type of memory work as part of a broader movement to confront large-scale impunity. In her book State Repression and the Labors of Memory, she writes, “Memory, truth, and justice blend into each other, because the meaning of the past that is being fought about is, in fact, part and parcel of the demand for justice in the present.”\n\nThis year, 15 media workers have been murdered in Mexico in possible retaliation for their reporting. After years of running into one another at protests and memorials for their dead relatives, the members of what would become the Network began to organize this spring as three more journalists from Veracruz were killed: José Luis Gamboa, Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi, and Sheila Johana García Olivera.\n\nYazmín López Solana, a nurse, and Isabel Luna Varela, an office worker, have been friendly for years, because their relatives worked together at a newspaper before they were killed in separate attacks. Yazmín López told me that when heard about this year’s murders she felt like the 11 years since the assassination of her family members had frozen, “and I was sitting here once again.”\n\nIsabel Luna added, “It feels really ugly to think that another family is going through the same thing.”\n\nJorge Sánchez, the Network’s spokesperson, has been demanding that the government hold the killers of journalists accountable. He has received threats related to both his reporting and his activism. Such threats are part of why he said it made sense for surviving family members to form a collective. “Imagine that they’ve just assassinated your relative,” he explained to me. “You have to travel. You have to look for lawyers.… On top of that, the fear of what you’re going to do, will you flee? You have to take care of yourself. They call you. They threaten you. You don’t sleep.” Helping others out with this combination of circumstances, he said, is a major reason the organization is so necessary.\n\nAs the Network grows, Jorge Sánchez said he hopes it can expand to support members in other states, but for now it’s a challenge just to coordinate the group in Veracruz, which covers nearly 30,000 square miles. The Network is fundraising for its members’ travel expenses so it can host more in-person events—whether those are talks with organizations dedicated to journalist safety, protests following a journalist’s death, or a chance to meet with the government about their cases. In August, they met with nine federal and state organizations to insist that “their petitions and agreements don’t stay in the realm of ‘goodwill’ or ‘empty words,’ rather that there be a real commitment on the part of the government bodies to follow up on the cases and make positive progress.”\n\nSurvivors told me repeatedly that being related to an assassinated journalist comes with challenges. In 2012, after her brother Guillermo Luna Varela, a photojournalist for Veracruz News, and uncle Gabriel Huge, a former reporter for NOTIVER, were murdered alongside Irasema Becerra, her colleague at El Dictamen, Isabel Luna was fired from her job selling ads. “I think maybe they didn’t want to deal with another death,” she said.\n\nFears of relatives’ being killed are not unfounded. When gunmen shot dead Yazmín López’s father, Miguel Ángel López Velasco, then the director of crime reporting at NOTIVER, they also murdered her mother, Agustina Solana, an employee of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, and her brother Misael López Solana, a budding photojournalist.\n\nShortly afterward, Yazmín López said she was driving in Veracruz when “a ton of people armed with long guns” blocked her path, forced her from her truck, and stole the vehicle. It wasn’t clear whether the robbery was related to the assassination, but she worried that it might be and spent years afraid to speak out.\n\nYazmín López told me anomalies have also plagued many of the investigations. “We ourselves, the family, mopped up the blood from how they left the bodies,” she said. “They left the blood, and they never came back to pick up the bullets. We found the bullets. We found the casings. We found pieces of teeth.… The police never did a good job collecting evidence.”\n\nPartly because of the mismanagement of the crime scene, Yazmín López believes that her family’s murderers will never be brought to justice. This summer, in a ceremony attended by the Network, Yazmín López’s surviving brother, with the support of Reporters Without Borders, mounted a plaque in their honor in Veracruz. Having a place to mourn has meant a lot to Yazmín López. “There are people that don’t have a place to go to cry over their family,” she said. “There are people who still haven’t found their family members.… I want them to feel what I’m feeling in this moment.”\n\nThere’s a pattern in Veracruz, Jorge Sánchez told me, in which the government officials charged with finding the killers blame the victim by tying the person to other forms of crime. This tars the journalist, their surviving family, and their colleagues as undeserving of justice and creates room for the government to close the case without investigating itself.\n\nJust days before his disappearance, Jorge’s father, Moisés Sánchez, told his family that he’d heard that the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, had threatened him in a private meeting. It took months before the state congress authorized an investigation into Cruz, and in the interim, he fled the state. Seven years later, he remains at large.\n\nAfter Moisés Sánchez’s disappearance, federal police showed up at the family home with surprising news: They had found explosives in the trunk of the taxi he drove to support his work with La Unión. But the Sánchez family had taken photos of the car, including inside the trunk, when Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, and no explosives were present.\n\n“So then, because they could see that we had proof that their accusation was false, they had to desist, and they didn’t continue with that angle,” Jorge Sánchez said.\n\nJorge Sánchez isn’t exactly sure what the police were trying to achieve by planting explosives in his father’s taxi. Perhaps, he said, they were trying to imply that he “worked for a terrorist cell, or something like that.” But the family has been vigilant in protecting Moisés Sánchez’s legacy—including pushing back against the government’s attempts to minimize his journalism. After Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, the governor of Veracruz himself referred to him, dismissively, as a “taxi driver and neighborhood activist.”\n\nLater in 2015, when unknown assailants assassinated Rubén Espinosa alongside Nadia Vera, Yesenia Quiroz, Mile Virginia Martín, and Alejandra Negrete in Mexico City, the local attorney general’s office published toxicology reports indicating that Espinosa and Vera had consumed drugs. The government also investigated rumors that Martín, a Colombian model, was a sex worker, based mainly on her nationality and profession.\n\nFor Patricia Espinosa, Rubén Espinosa’s sister, those speculations are beside the point. “It’s a method that the authorities and their allies in the media use to stain the image of the people [involved], so that society will say ‘Ah, well… That’s why they were assassinated,’” she told me. “The authorities, instead of looking at the perpetrators, turn their gaze on the victims.”\n\nOn the anniversary of the assassinations in Mexico City, activists and family members hold a festival called “Arte Para No Olvidarte,” or “Art So I Won’t Forget You.” Outside the apartment where the five were shot, the group conducts a ceremony to “resignify the space,” followed by performances and the testimonies of family members. This year, there was a demonstration in the Veracruz state capital as well.\n\nItzamná Ponce and Daniela Guillén, who help organize Arte Para No Olvidarte every year, told me that in the face of actions intended to provoke terror, joy is an important form of resistance. “Smiles, dancing, partying…art, music, laughter, hugs, tenderness, for us have been those spaces of searching and demanding justice and struggling,” Ponce said. “From that place, what we’ve tried to do is this: to generate a space of resistance out of our smiles. Because that’s something they’re trying to take away from us.”\n\nOn a humid summer evening, many of the neighbors in Fraccionamiento Arboledas San Miguel, a neighborhood in Medellín de Bravo, were outside searching for a breeze. There was a soccer game in progress, and near the pitch, a handful of people had gathered around an exposed electrical cable. Jorge Sánchez stood with them, camera in hand, as they explained how the neighborhood’s developer was refusing to reroute the cables underground. They told him that the exposed cable posed a fire risk to the neighborhood, that there was no street lighting at night, and that uncovered manholes lined the roads. A teen had even fallen into a manhole and injured his hand.\n\nThe next morning, Jorge Sánchez wrote up the article. “Those affected said that since VIVEICA, the developer which built the neighborhood, declared bankruptcy, no one has taken an interest in or attended to the neighborhood’s problems, evidenced by the fact that they now have been living for more than a month without adequate electrical service,” he reported in the piece.\n\nThis might seem like straightforward journalism, but for Jorge Sánchez, it’s a rejection of fear. When he goes out to report, people remember him as a boy accompanying his father. They still call him “Moi”—short for Moisés. And as his father used to say, to live with fear is not an option. “If we’re afraid, we’ll never do anything. And things are going to stay the same,” Sánchez said. “We have to do something.”",
    "Should You Attend A Timeshare Presentation On Your Next Trip To Mexico?": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 3 hours ago\n\nIf you’ve traveled to Mexico in the last few years, you’ve probably run into someone at the airport or in your hotel offering you a seemingly incredible deal on something if only you agree to sign up for a timeshare presentation. Would you sit through a 90-minute timeshare presentation to save $986 on a 5-night stay at an all-inclusive? How about for a free taxi ride?\n\nThe ‘gifts’ for attending a timeshare presentation can range from a minuscule free taxi ride to a free stay at an all-inclusive. Obviously, one is more appealing than the other! However, unsuspecting travelers may find themselves swept up into a timeshare presentation without ever knowing that’s what they signed up for.\n\nThose in the timeshare industry are incredibly adept at getting people to sign up for presentations, hence why you will see so many right after landing at many major airports in Mexico.\n\nTravel Off Path has put together a guide to considering timeshare presentations in Mexico, with particular emphasis on the Cancun area. Read on for the Who, What, Where, When, and Why of timeshare presentations in Mexico.\n\nWhat Is A Timeshare?\n\nA simple explanation for a timeshare would be a vacation property that is “owned” fractionally by many people. Essentially, you would pay to “own” a property to use for a week or two every year. Often presented as a way to save some money, there may be certain instances where owning a timeshare could be beneficial. However, in most cases, travelers probably wouldn’t be saving enough to make it a 100% beneficial decision for future travel.\n\nMany popular hotel brands have their own versions of timeshares available, such as Disney Vacation Club, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, or Wyndham Destinations.\n\nWhen most people hear the word ‘timeshare,’ they don’t think of the actual property itself. For many, hours-long presentations with high-pressure salespeople come to mind. Indeed, the most common way people come into timeshare ownership is a direct result of attending a timeshare presentation. Many go into the presentation absolutely sure they won’t fall into a timeshare purchase. But, if this were always the case, companies wouldn’t be offering benefits for attending the presentations in the first place.\n\nWhy Should (Or Shouldn’t) You Attend A Timeshare Presentation?\n\nThe biggest reason you may consider attending a timeshare presentation is for the presentation offer. As referenced earlier, timeshare offers can range widely, from small things like a free meal to significant things like free hotel stays. Depending on their impact on your travels, some offers may be worth considering attending a timeshare presentation. Some typical offers for attending a timeshare presentation include:\n\nDiscounted or free hotel stays\n\nMeals or drinks\n\n“No cost” taxi rides\n\nFree tickets to events or parks (like Disney or Universal)\n\nFree spa treatments\n\nThis isn’t an extensive list by any means. Still, these are some of the more common offers for attending a timeshare presentation. Also, notice our use of the word free. This isn’t quite correct, as you will be giving up precious time you could enjoy during your vacation. This is one of the biggest reasons you shouldn’t consider attending a timeshare presentation on your next trip to Mexico.\n\nWho Should Attend? Who Shouldn’t? Who’s Presenting?\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nTravelers on an extremely tight budget may benefit from attending a timeshare presentation. If money is really tight, some of the offers for attending a timeshare presentation may be beneficial. Suppose you can secure a free stay in a hotel up to your standard. In that case, one of the highest travel costs can be reduced immensely, sometimes completely.\n\nWho Shouldn’t Attend?\n\nSuppose you have the money to go on vacation to an area in Mexico you know you will enjoy without worrying too much about breaking the bank. In that case, a timeshare presentation will just feel like a waste of time for you. Also, if you are a person who can be easily swayed, stay as far away from a timeshare presentation as you can.\n\nThere is a reason the process is so lengthy and tedious. There’s a reason they are giving you free lunch. They want you to feel invested in the experience, and they want you to feel bad about saying no. If you aren’t the type that can stick to your decision in the face of high-pressure sales, do not go to a timeshare presentation.\n\nAn Author’s Anecdote\n\nMy wife and I got married when we were young and penniless. However, I didn’t let that deter us from going on a honeymoon. We saved as much as possible and searched for all sorts of ways to reduce costs. During a wedding show, we found out we could get four nights free at a decent hotel in Orlando as long as we attended a presentation about cookware. Being young a naïve, we happily signed up.\n\nAfter four grueling hours of hearing about how amazing this cookware was, we had to fight to contain our laughter as we said no to the hilariously overpriced $1400 set of pots and pans. We got our free stay in Orlando, and I wasn’t too annoyed about the lost time.\n\nI wish that’s where the story ended.\n\nAfter arriving in Orlando, we found out that we had to attend a timeshare presentation for the hotel stay to be free. Without writing a novel about how much I wish we had just paid for a hotel, I’ll summarize the experience.\n\nWe went to lunch with our timeshare salesperson, their treat, of course.\n\nWatched a 2-hour long video presentation about how fantastic the timeshare was.\n\nToured the timeshares\n\nFinally, we sat down to hear the final pitch (or so we thought). For the small price of $13,000, we could visit our timeshare property in Orlando once a year.\n\nThis was the easiest no thanks we’ve ever uttered. Mainly because we barely had $1,000 to our name. However, we said no an additional six times before we were finally able to leave. With each no, we would hear about some new deal that would lower the price by a few thousand dollars. The final time they asked, they offered that same $13,000 timeshare for $2,400. We said no every time, and with each no, they made us feel worse and worse. They will really try to make you feel bad for saying no.\n\nI wish we hadn’t fallen into not one but two presentation traps. For what we received, it wasn’t worth the time. However, had the final payout been a weeklong stay at an all-inclusive resort? I would probably feel differently, especially because of how little money we had at the time.\n\nNow, however, the presentation offer would have to be mind-blowing to get us to attend another one.\n\nWhen And Where Should You Expect “Timeshare Sharks”?\n\nThe most common place you will see timeshare salespeople will be after landing at the airport in Mexico. Cancun is notorious for this, but many other airports also have them. According to Rene Gaudreau, while taking a video of Cancun airport, “All these people here are trying to sell you timeshares, they’re lined up on both sides… they’re going to try and stop you, they’ll lie to you, they’ll tell you anything, they’re going to tell you they are your transportation company… just ignore them, your transportation company is outside.”\n\nNot Interested?\n\nIf you have zero interest in seeing what timeshare salespeople have to say, just ignore them and head to your transportation outside the airport. As stated in the video, many timeshare reps inside the airport will claim to be your transportation to trick you into attending a timeshare presentation. Don’t fall for it! Your transport will always be outside the airport waiting and will never meet you inside.\n\n#mexicotrip #traveltiktok ♬ Oh No – Kreepa @jennifervalentinephoto Let’s talk about timeshares on your vacation, there is no way to get out of the hotel asking you about this whike on vacation- they will usually give you some type of perk to come to their presentation that they say is an hour long.. Fun fact it usually is way over an hour long intense sales pitch lol ( I know from personal experience when I was a young traveler) – tell them no thank you and enjoy your vacation! Don’t be locked into a rate for the next 30 years 😌 #travelagent\n\nAnother place you could see timeshare salespeople would be right on your resort’s property. It’s not uncommon to get a call from the front desk letting you know you could attend a “breakfast presentation” for a percentage off your stay or other perks. Similarly, watch out for the ‘activities manager’ or the ‘concierge.’ Sometimes these roles are just a timeshare rep in disguise, as Rosamarie T details in a Tripadvisor review. However, this isn’t always the case. If you feel you are being pulled into a timeshare sales attempt and aren’t interested, simply walk away.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhether or not you should attend a timeshare presentation on your next trip is ultimately a decision left to you. Hopefully, some of this information can help you decide whether it is in your best interest. However, be extremely careful if you choose to go to a presentation. Timeshares are notoriously difficult to get out of and can be a serious financial commitment. If you can’t trust yourself to say no (assuming you don’t want a timeshare), don’t risk it!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "The UK helps entrepreneurs develop innovative financial solutions in Mexico": "In Mexico, important gaps in financial inclusion mean only 68% of adults use at least one financial product, even though internet access is at 75.6%. The UK’s Financial Services Programme sponsored the Sandbox Challenge (SC), which helped increase financial inclusion in Mexico. It did this by helping Fintech entrepreneurs develop their offerings of digital and innovative financial solutions. The second edition of the SC initiative attracted 200 participants from the United States, Taiwan, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nTo help SC winners develop their business models, they obtained bespoke support covering legal advice, business-consulting mentoring, financial modelling, cyber security advisory, and programming services, among others.\n\nMoneyWays, a Venezuelan firm, provides a digital alternative to the high costs associated with cross-border fund transfers, which disproportionately affect migrant workers sending money to their families back home. MoneyWays solution consists of a platform providing money transfers, remittances, prepaid cards services, and payments through a real-time wallet system. According to MoneyWays, the support they received allowed them to accelerate the development of their services and have a presence in the Mexican market, which, in turn, helped them reduce the financial burden on remittance beneficiaries.\n\nPlataforma 9.9% devised an innovative solution to help women and informal workers access home ownership through a collective, circular form of financing. Plataforma 9.9% recognised that participating in the Financial Services Programme gave them an opportunity to build their methodology whilst at the same accessing professional advice that guided them in structuring their services to comply with official regulations. Sagrario Gutiérrez, member of Plataforma 9.9%, shared:\n\nWe were provided with skills, tools, guidance, structure, transparency and certainty; it has been an outstanding experience to help build our solution.\n\nEscrivan helps consumers regularise their real estate assets, which is critical given that over 50% of homeowners in Mexico currently have “irregular” property status. By resolving this issue, more consumers are able to access equity on their property, increase their purchasing power and credit opportunities, and thus contribute to a more financially inclusive market.\n\nAnother seven winners of the SC initiative received similar benefits and were able to advance their offerings of digital and innovative financial solutions. With support from the UK’s Financial Services Programme, they too are contributing to the expansion of Mexico’s Fintech sector and to the financial inclusion of some of the country’s most vulnerable populations.",

REUTERS/Raquel Cunha\n\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a trained physicist vying to become the country's first female president, is hoping her environmental credentials and success in curbing crime will help set her apart in the race for the top job in 2024.\n\nSheinbaum, a loyal ally of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has held a slight lead over rivals in recent opinion polls as she gears up to compete for the presidential candidacy of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).\n\nA strong supporter of social welfare programs promoted by the president that have helped forge his power base and tackle inequality across the country, Sheinbaum, 60, is viewed by many inside the party as his obvious ideological successor.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"I've been there (with Lopez Obrador) in the good times and the bad,\" she said in an interview with Reuters in the palatial city hall, pointing to a shared past with the president going back to her stint as the capital's environment minister when he was mayor from 2000 to 2005.\n\n\"The president's projects must be consolidated, I share the president's vision of a Mexico with justice, and a Mexico where the welfare state must play a fundamental part in development.\"\n\nThe country will elect its next president in June 2024, and Sheinbaum and other potential prospects including Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard have begun jostling for the MORENA candidacy, which is expected to be settled by late 2023.\n\nLopez Obrador, who is barred by law from standing for a second term, has dominated national politics since taking office in 2018, and MORENA remains far more popular than the main opposition parties.\n\nWere she to succeed him, Sheinbaum, whose measured scientific reserve contrasts with Lopez Obrador's combative approach to politics, said she was acutely aware of how symbolic the achievement would be for girls and women in Mexico and beyond.\n\n\"For me to be able to represent that, just imagine the honor and responsibility it means,\" she said, hailing the example of Katya Echazarreta, who in June became the first Mexican-born woman to travel to space.\n\nGREEN ENERGY\n\nLopez Obrador's drive to strengthen the state oil and gas company and the national power utility - both of which depend heavily on fossil fuels - at the expense of private wind and solar power firms has caused friction with the United States and other longstanding allies.\n\nThe policy has also upset some on the Mexican left eager to see the country give priority to renewable energy sources.\n\nSheinbaum, who was part of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has defended Lopez Obrador's efforts to pursue energy independence, but also wants to capitalize on Mexico's green energy reserves.\n\n\"I think it's crucial to really take advantage of renewable energies in the country,\" she said when asked how a Sheinbaum administration could differ from its predecessor, even as she stressed her support for Lopez Obrador's vision for Mexico.\n\nSome have also pressed for higher taxation. Asked whether she favored higher taxes, Sheinbaum declined to be drawn, saying the question would need careful analysis.\n\nWhere Mexico City has diverged is in its success in reducing gang-fuelled violence that has for years ravaged the country.\n\nThe city has targeted problem areas, increasing the number of police on the streets and their pay, Sheinbaum said, and more than quadrupling the number of video surveillance cameras.\n\nWhile the national murder tally barely dropped at all in 2021 from nearly 34,000 in 2018, Mexico City's total fell by well over a third during the same period.\n\nThis year the nationwide figure has eased somewhat.

    "This smartphone manufacturer beat Samsung and Apple in Mexico": "On average, Samsung is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer. However, it doesn’t lead all its rivals in every market and performs better in some regions than others. In some markets, Samsung is the leading brand by a wide margin. While in others, such as Mexico, the company is trying to maintain its spot on the podium.\n\nMexico has an active smartphone user base of around 127 million, and needless to say, there are benefits to leading the mobile game in the country. But it’s neither Samsung nor its biggest rival, Apple, at the top of the food chain in Mexico. According to a recent report, Motorola was the leading OEM in Mexico in Q2 2022, with a smartphone sales share of 28%. (via Telecompaper)\n\nMotorola keeps a tight grip over the Mexican smartphone market\n\nAlthough Motorola led the country’s smartphone scene, Samsung was, thankfully, the second-largest OEM in Mexico during the three-month period ending in June. The company captured 26% of smartphone sales throughout the quarter.\n\nApple followed Samsung in third place. The Cupertino giant rose 3% to capture 16% of the market. Motorola’s share in Q2 2022 increased by 5%, while Samsung’s share remained flat from last year. Other notable smartphone brands were Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei. Xiaomi held 13% of the market, while Oppo and Huawei captured 11% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn other news, Samsung’s chief recently visited Mexico to meet with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, but this had little to do with the company’s performance in the smartphone segment in Q2.

As a chef, I think one of the best things about Mexico is the markets – they are like worlds of their own. I love Mercado Jamaica, the big flower market, where they also have great produce. Of course, I adore La Merced. It’s the biggest traditional market in Mexico City and it’s insane; there are tons of fruits and vegetables – it’s full of life. The best way to see it as a tourist is on one of the special food tours, like Anais Martinez’s The Curious Mexican. There’s also La Nueva Viga, the huge fish market, and the organic market Mercado el 100, which I was partly responsible for creating. The “100” is because all produce comes within 100 miles of the Zócalo, the public square downtown.\n\nCámara at Hugo el Wine Bar © Maureen M Evans Oysters served at Hugo el Wine Bar © Maureen M Evans\n\nCámara’s favourite markets La Merced Circunvalación s/n, La Merced, Merced Balbuena, Venustiano Carranza, 15810 La Nueva Viga Eje 6 Sur 650, Abastos, Iztapalapa, 09040 Mercado el 100 (El Cien) Orizaba s/n, Roma Sur, Cuauhtémoc, 06760 Mercado Jamaica Guillermo Prieto 45, Jamaica, Venustiano Carranza, 15800\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be in the city if you love food because there are so many options, though I have a few favourite restaurants I always return to, such as Hugo, a wine bar with lots of exciting small plates. I love Mikey Crespo, who cooks there, as well as Isabel. You don’t have to go there and think about what you’re eating, you just enjoy it. It’s reminiscent of many other restaurants that I love, like Estela in New York, or what San Francisco’s Bar Tartine used to be, because Mikey was a cook there. Ticuchi is also great – I need to go there more often. I love Gonzalo Gout, who is behind it, and when I go there I just eat whatever they give me.\n\nThe terrace at San Angel Inn\n\nCarla Fernández flagship store\n\nFor drinks, I go to San Angel Inn. It’s a traditional restaurant and has a very particular atmosphere emblematic of a different era, like a time capsule. It’s in a colonial building with a central patio and really good margaritas and martinis. I like to sit on the terrace and enjoy the aperitivo-style service.\n\nOne of the best things about Mexico is the markets – they are like worlds of their own\n\nI love that everyone is now looking into Mexican craft and design. I’ve always had great admiration for it, maybe because I have a foreign mother and a Florentine grandmother who was always very taken by the extraordinary textiles. My favourite design store here is Onora. It has Mexican crafts done really well, responsibly and sustainably. There there’s Remigio, named after its owner, which has a focus on Oaxacan textiles. Remigio sells pieces that he commissions with cooperatives, weavers and dyers. There are so many treasures to be found there.\n\nRemigio in Oaxaca © victorfotomx\n\nMercado Jamaica, Mexico City © Shutterstock\n\nFor fashion, I adore Carla Fernández – what is really special about her brand is that she has integrated traditional Mexican techniques and textiles into wearable but sophisticated clothing. It’s quite architectural in its conception. Usually I buy from her shop on Álvaro Obregón, as it’s close to where I live.\n\nCámara at the National Museum of Anthropology © Maureen M Evans\n\nThe National Museum of Art – the first place Gabriela Cámara worked\n\nWhen I need a culture fix, the National Museum of Anthropology is one of the most extraordinary places in Mexico City. It holds brilliant pieces of Mexican pre-Hispanic art and everyday objects and utensils. The design and architecture is by Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, who was an important figure in Mexico; and, as most people know, architecture has a special importance here.\n\nI also love downtown – to have an opportunity to see inside the incredible palaces, such as the Ministry of Public Education building with Diego Riviera’s first large-scale murals. You can also see Riviera murals at the Palacio Nacional. The National Museum of Art is personally important to me because it’s the first place I worked. I opened my restaurant Contramar while I was working there. Though it’s been challenging for the downtown area in the past two years, it’s now back to being filled with energetic crowds of people.",
    "What Do Foreign Investors Need To Understand About Baja California Sur, Mexico?": "A surfer gets out of the sea at the \"Love Beach\" in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur state, Mexico on ... [+] March 10, 2018. Despite a surge of violent crimes in popular tourist areas such as Los Cabos and Cancun, tourism is Mexico's third largest source of foreign exchange. In 2017 the country hit a new record — 39.3 million tourists who generated $21 billion in business. / AFP PHOTO / DANIEL SLIM (Photo credit should read DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe state of Baja California Sur has a less problematic political risk profile than many other areas of Mexico. The risk of organized crime-related violence (public shootouts, kidnapping of executives) in Baja California Sur is quite low. Poverty and marginalization are less extreme in Baja California Sur than in other parts of Mexico. The risk of serious social unrest in a Baja California Sur is relatively low. Expropriation risk is very low in a Baja California Sur (and in other parts of Mexico.) In general, foreign-owned businesses in Baja California Sur are able to resolve potential corruption issues through government relations, liaising with business chambers, and working with lobbying firms. Overall, Mexico’s political and economic framework is relatively stable and unlikely to suffer from major disruptions in the short or medium term. The political leadership in the tourism hub of Los Cabos, the state government in Baja California Sur, and the federal government Mexico City are all members of the same party (Morena). The current dynamic is likely to hold stable for the next two years. Although economic indicators and security dynamics may both worsen slightly, overall Mexico looks like it is on track to maintain stability in the medium term.\n\nBaja California Sur’s governor, Victor Manuel Castro Cosio, was elected in 2021. He will serve through 2027. Castro Cosio is a member of the Morena party of Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Prior to joining Morena he was a member of Lopez Obrador’s old party, the PRD. Cosio is backed by a well-established political group including former members of the PRI party. One of the local power-brokers who supports him is Homero Davis Castro, who currently serves as the Secretary General in the Baja California Sur state government.\n\nLos Cabos Mayor Oscar Leggs Castro was elected in 2021. He will serve through 2024. He is eligible to stand for re-election for another term. Leggs Castro is a member of the Morena party, the same party as Baja California Sur’s governor and Mexico’s president. The mayor in Los Cabos is from a different faction of Morena than the governor in Baja California Sur but the two enjoy a positive working relationship.\n\nIt is possible that in 2024 after local and national elections that Los Cabos mayor could represent a different political party than Mexico’s president. Given Los Cabos strategic importance to Mexico’s tourism sector the downside risk of a destructive rift emerging between the mayor and the state and national government is relatively minimal. The most likely scenario is that all three levels of government in Los Cabos will continue to be controlled by the Morena party after the upcoming election cycle. Overall, the political risk outlook in Baja California Sur is relatively stable.\n\nForeign executives doing due diligence on potential investments in Mexico need to understand the potential implications stemming from crime and security issues. In general, the risk of violent crime is lower in Baja California Sur than in other states in Mexico. It is not common for criminal groups in Baja California Sur to kidnap foreign executives or the employees of foreign companies. In 2021, Baja California recorded 77 murders, or 2.4% as many as the neighboring state of Baja California, which recorded 3,246 homicides in 2021. Overall, Baja California Sur recorded the 2nd fewest total number of murders of any state in Mexico. In 2017 three tourists were killed in a shooting at a beach in Los Cabos. Although Baja California Sur is relatively peaceful in 2022 there is no guarantee that the current dynamic will hold in coming years. In general, in Mexico violent crime depends on backroom deals and rifts between rival criminal organizations and political leaders. It is likely that current trends of violence in Baja California Sur and Los Cabos will remain steady over the next two years. However, the arrest or death of senior New Generation members in the state could provoke a new fight for control and cause a major uptick in violent crime. The default outcome for Baja California Sur and Los Cabos will be the continuation of current dynamics over the next two years.\n\nEven though the homicide rate in Baja California Sur is lower than Mexico’s national average, common crime is still a potential risk in the state. In 2021, Baja California Sur recorded 397 incidents of cars being stolen but only five cases of violent carjacking. Baja California Sur did not record any express kidnappings or any kidnappings for ransom in 2021. Although Baja California Sur only recorded 7 violent home invasions in 2021, the state recorded 2,462 non-violent home burglaries. Truck hijackings are not common in Baja California Sur. The state reported only 2 cargo truck hijackings in 2021 and 1 during the first half of 2022. Given that organized crime groups in Baja California Sur are more focused on international drug trafficking than preying on local residents, it is likely that the current dynamics of common crime will hold steady over the next two years.\n\nThe criminal underworld in Baja California Sur is dominated by the New Generation Cartel of Jalisco. Because of the lack of competition between cartels, Baja California Sur enjoys a paz narco. Because of the ongoing presence of high level organized crime activity in Baja California Sur there is risk of public shootouts in Baja California Sur. Los Cabos is not considered to be a hotspot for organized crime-related violence. Companies that export products from Baja California Sur to the U.S. face some risk that criminal groups will try and pressure employees to collude in efforts to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Most exporters are able to mitigate this risk with rigorous internal control policies. Barring the death or arrest of a senior New Generation Jalisco Cartel member or the incursion of a rival group, it is likely that the current paz narco will remain intact for the next two years. In August 2022, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel launched a series of public attacks in the state of Baja California, north of Baja California Sur. In 2022, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel has adopted “narco-terrorism” tactics including burning businesses and shooting and killing innocent civilians. So far, the group has not engaged in this type of attack in Baja California Sur. It is possible in the future that similar security issues could affect Baja California Sur.\n\nAlthough extortion by criminal groups is a potential risk for businesses operating in Mexico, it is not a major problem in most sectors in Baja California Sur. Extortion by criminal groups may be an issue in rural areas of Baja California Sur and for local fishermen. The number of open investigations for cases of extortion in Baja California Sur increased from 38 during the first half of 2021 to 71 during the first half of 2022. There are no recent news stories of hotels or restaurants in Los Cabos being burned down by criminals, a tactic used by extortionists in other parts of Mexico. It is unlikely that organized crime groups in Baja California Sur will start threatening and extorting established, formal-sector businesses over the next two years.\n\nOverall, in terms of the threats posed by organized crime, security issues, and political instability Baja California Sur has a favorable political risk outlook.",

    "This Unknown City In Mexico Is Becoming One Of The Most Popular Destinations In The Country": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 4 days ago\n\nIt seems like Mexico has a new star in the making, as an unknown city that had never before been widely promoted as a destination takes center stage as part of the country’s tourism offer. It does not have a shoreline and thus no pristine beaches like those found in the Caribbean, nor the Yucatan Peninsula’s Mayan monuments, but it is rapidly becoming one of the most popular destinations south of the border.\n\nEver since the world’s borders reopened for tourism and normal tourism resumed, Mexico has claimed for itself the coveted title of King of Tourism, and it’s not hard to see why. Being a country rich in nature and home to numerous iconic landmarks, it is a natural leader in vacation bookings, especially when it comes to sunny getaways.\n\nShockingly though, most visitors to Mexico still fail to grasp how actually diverse and multicultural it truly is – or did, up until this year:\n\nThe Secret Is Out: Mexico Is So Much More Than A Sunny Beach Break\n\nTo reduce Mexico to its resort zones and the occasional mystical ancient pyramid is a crude mistake. Yes, these attractions contribute hugely to making the country great, and we definitely cannot underestimate the power of Cancun as a winter hotspot, but at the same time, a majority of Mexico, and arguably where its untarnished beauty is found, has been concealed from the public eye for years.\n\nLuckily, things are changing, and tourists, including American vacationers, have started to venture more inland in search of ‘more Mexico’, as opposed to being isolated in one of the Riviera Maya’s colossal tourist complexes year after year. This trend translates into actual numbers: a growing number of travelers are seeking more unique experiences when visiting Mexico.\n\nAt the forefront of Mexico’s Tourism Renaissance are its colonial towns, many of which are protected by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. One of those, the unsung Guanajuato, has been smashing arrival figures, not only because it has its own international airport, allowing for easier access, but due to the fact that it’s simply stunning.\n\nAlthough many are not aware of this, Mexico is where some of the oldest European settlements in the Americas are located. Guanajuato is a prime example of that, with narrow, winding streets lined with ocher-colored houses emulating those found in Spain, and Neo-Gothic churches piercing the skyline.\n\nWhat Makes Guanajuato So Damn Special?\n\nBoth in 2021 and 2022, it was named the Best City in the World according to Travel + Leisure, while Mexico itself deemed it the country’s most beautiful this year. Guanajuato is indeed a sight to behold, not to mention bucket list material, but those who might have wished to keep this gem all to themselves a while longer may be disappointed to learn the secret is out.\n\nAccording to Juan Jose Alvarez Brunel, Secretary of Tourism of Guanajuato, by the end of 2022, the city is expected to recover roughly 70 percent of its tourists, a much higher rate than entire countries – we see you Australia and Canada – and a surprising figure for a non-coastal city that, for the most part, hasn’t been a priority for Mexican Tourism.\n\nThe data has been provided by different service providers, including those in the private sector, academics, and even the World Tourism Organization. As Brunel puts it, should Guanajuato keep up the pace, by late 2023, it should be back to where it was in 2019 and even ‘begin to grow again’. Doesn’t sound too impressive?\n\nWell, that is perhaps because the vast majority of Americans visiting Mexico flock to Cancun, and Cancun only. Of course, when it comes purely to arrivals and gross revenue, there is no beating the Caribbean jewel, but we must understand that, due to being so popular, there is over-representation when it comes to tourism trends and the Riviera Maya.\n\nIn A World Where Giants Like Cancun Exist, Guanajuato’s Recovery Rate Is Nothing Short Of Stellar\n\nA large sum of Mexico’s hard-earned tourist dollars are spent in Cancun, Tulum, and other neighboring municipalities, and naturally, those will bounce back much faster, or even entirely eclipse, other minor destinations in the country. The fact that Guanajuato is repositioning itself as a much stronger competitor this year and still getting its share when so much of Mexican travel revolves around the Caribbean cities is nothing short of stellar.\n\nThis success story is largely attributed to the regional tourism authorities, who boldly envisioned Guanajuato as Mexico’s cultural, enotourism, and gastronomy capital. Regarding the latter, they surely have enough reasons to brag, seeing that UNESCO itself granted Guanajuato’s food scene an ‘Intangible Gastronomy World Heritage’ status in 2020.\n\nCurrently, the motto is the following:\n\nGuanajuato is where visitors can live great stories\n\nYou may be wondering why, considering Guanajuato may not have been a priority on your planned itinerary for Mexico until you came across this article. Allow us to explain why according to the Secretary’s own assertions:\n\nIt is truly one of Mexico’s top enotourism destinations, being the fourth largest producer with 43 vineyards *\n\n* Its Old Town, dating back to the 16th century, has been deemed by UNESCO a true architectural wonder\n\nGuanajuato is within short driving distance of numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende\n\nof numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende The International Airport of Guanajuato offers direct flights from several U.S. cities, including Chicago, both from Midway and O’Hare, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles\n\n*21 of those vineyards welcome tourists/guided tours\n\nOther Perks Of Making Guanajuato Your Next Winter Vacay\n\nOnce landing in Guanajuato, tourists have facilitated access to 46 municipalities across the state, including its eponymous capital, by means of a ‘comprehensive road system’ cutting across the territory and reaching deep into Mexico’s more quaint, authentic countryside. Other highlights mentioned include:\n\nVarious hotel chains as well as independent accommodation providers\n\nA myriad of hot springs, spas, and wellness centers that will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money\n\nthat will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money World-renowned restaurants (Guanajuato’s cuisine has been noted by UNESCO, remember?)\n\n20 percent of Guanajuato State is a ‘natural protected area’ , home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here?\n\n, home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here? Great infrastructure, something we already discussed briefly writing on San Miguel de Allende\n\nAs Mr. Brunel brilliantly puts it, Guanajuato has no beaches, but it does not need them: its man-made colonial wonders and foodie scene are exactly what sets it apart from coastal Mexico and precisely the reason why it’s experiencing a revival lately.\n\nRead More:\n\nTravel Insurance That Covers Covid-19 For 2022\n\nMexico Enters Hurricane Season This Month – Here’s What To Expect If You’re Visiting\n\n7 Tips To Travel Stress Free During Your Fall Trip To Mexico\n\nMexico Has Already Welcomed 36 Million International Tourists This Year\n\nResearch Shows Los Cabos Is One Of The Safest Destinations In Mexico\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "Mexico could turn gig workers into full-time employees": "In the coming days, the Mexican government is set to discuss an amendment to force delivery and ride-hailing apps to make gig workers into formal employees, which could affect the country’s estimated 350,000 to 500,000 delivery workers and ride-hailing drivers. Mexico’s labor department, known as the STPS, will introduce a proposal to Congress, aimed at reforming the federal labor law, which has the support of government-recognized gig worker unions and some independent workers’ organizations.\n\nBut some independent gig workers’ groups, who do not fit the union registration requirements or don’t want to be legally constituted as one, have been vocal in their opposition. They worry that the government is primarily interested in higher tax collection and increasing membership dues for the official unions, without dealing with workers’ real concerns.\n\nThe proposed law, as drafted by the labor department with the support of official unions, requires a set amount of working hours for employees, plus union membership fees if they wish to join one. “What we want are dignified working conditions for the workers on these platforms,” an STPS spokesperson told Rest of World.\n\nThe National Union of App Workers (UNTA) is one of the official unions that collaborated with the STPS on the proposal. Sergio Guerrero, a spokesperson for the UNTA, told Rest of World that the draft law has broad ambitions, but aims specifically for three things: full legal recognition of a working relationship between platforms and workers, full social security provisions to be given by the platforms, and payment according to the number of hours that each worker is logged into the app.\n\n“We have always pushed for a three-way collaboration, promoting conversations between the government, the workers, and the platforms,” Saúl Gómez Piña, a spokesperson for Ni Un Repartidor Menos — a grassroots delivery organization that walked out of the proposal’s drafting process with the unions and the government — told Rest of World. “But right now, the government is just organizing with some unions and plans to force the proposal onto the platforms. It shouldn’t be done like that.”\n\nFor already unprofitable companies like Uber, Didi, and Rappi, becoming full-time employers would go against existing business models built around independent contractors. Rest of World reached out to all three companies, but they declined to comment. According to Guerrero, these platforms are drafting their own counter-proposals to be considered by the Mexican congress when STPS’ proposal is introduced.\n\nProviding legal rights to gig workers poses a larger challenge for both the platforms and the workers — one that the government is fully aware of. “The great debate is who should pay for social security,” Norma Gabriela López Castañeda, incorporation and collection director of the Mexican Social Security Institute, had said in an interview in October 2021.\n\nMore than 70% of the Mexican population is affiliated with some social security program. A portion of the fees they pay to access benefits is paid for by the government, another by the employer, and yet another by the employee. Independent workers, meanwhile, can voluntarily be added to the system, but they must pay more to make up for their lack of an employer.\n\nBut, many gig workers have incentives to stay out of formal employment.\n\n“Plenty of delivery workers are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms.”\n\n“We have plenty of delivery workers that are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms,” Alfredo García Campos, a spokesperson for independent delivery-workers’ organization Unión de Repas, told Rest of World.\n\nJorge García de Presno, a Mexico City-based labor and employment lawyer from international law practice group Cuatrecasas, told Rest of World that there is a significant group of gig workers who are perfectly fine being classified as independent workers because they’re able to manage their own time.\n\nThat is the case of Gabriela Gómez, a single mother who earns part of her income on several delivery platforms and who is also a spokesperson for Unión de Repas. For her, the terms the STPS’ proposal is pushing for would not be of benefit. “Forcing us to work a set amount of hours, as the proposal is attempting, will complicate our lives,” she told Rest of World.\n\nUnión de Repas, which has almost 900 members — most of whom are from Mexico City and the neighboring State of Mexico — is just one of the multitude of organizations that have emerged to protect and vouch for delivery workers’ rights. According to a manifesto published by gig workers’ organizations in late August, there are more than 50 such organizations nationwide. Of those, only two have been recognized as unions by the government. One of them is the UNTA.\n\n“We have 500 affiliated members nationwide, and our goal is to grow large enough to collectively bargain for workers’ rights,” UNTA’s Guerrero told Rest of World. As a state-accredited union, if the draft passes into law, the UNTA would be able to sue the platforms if “there are any injustices in the application of the law,” he claimed, unlike independent groups such as Unión de Repas or Ni Un Repartidor Menos. But, for them, not being able to take platforms to court isn’t an issue.\n\n“Our priority is for workers to keep their working flexibility, meaning they’re able to be online when they want to, for as long as they want to, without working exclusively for one or another platform,” says Gómez Piña, from Ni Un Repartidor Menos.\n\nRather than pushing for social security, as the STPS is, alternative proposals by independent organizations prioritize other challenges faced by gig workers. Ni Un Repartidor Menos is particularly focused on road safety, while Unión de Repas is pushing for a work flexibility and gender-focused strategy to protect female, trans, and disabled workers.\n\n“The representatives of [government-recognized] unions work in an office and not on the streets,” Unión de Repas’ García claimed. “[It] is a sign that they’re just government pawns.” He said his organization would side with the apps if they legally challenged the amendments to the law in their current state. “We would take the streets, if necessary,” he concluded.",
    "Mexico: Will the EV Transition Pull Mexico’s Automotive Industry Out of Industrial ‘Long COVID’?: Parts and components have felt fine all along.": "M\n\nexico has been a growing leader in the automotive manufacturing industry for decades with companies from Japan, the U.S. and Germany frequently seeking out the low-cost yet highly capable workforce. In 2012 the country ranked as the 10th largest automotive producer in the world and in 2021 pushed out South Korea and claimed sixth place. But the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported that in 2021 automotive production dropped by 20.25% across the country, and auto exports fell by 16.46%. The institute further reported that GM and Nissan were hit hard, with GM Mexico’s production falling by 43.7% in 2021, and Nissan Mexicana’s tumbling by 27.2%. Production halts occurred at three Nissan plants as raw materials and microchips became inaccessible.\n\nSupply chain disintegration, the semiconductor shortage and halts in production are all effects of an industrial “long COVID.” But even after a dismal 2021, this May Nissan announced plans to invest $700 million over the next three years in its Mexican plants, including its facility in Aguascalientes.\n\n“Mexico plays an important role in Nissan’s global operations, both as one of the main markets for vehicle sales, and as an export hub for dozens of markets around the world,” said Jeremie Papin, chairperson of Nissan Americas. The company still has faith in the region, and will introduce new Nissan electric vehicles such as the Nissan Kicks e-POWER to the Mexican market.\n\nMore Lover Than Competitor\n\nAlthough Mexico is producing fewer and fewer whole automobiles, the country is spectacular at producing automotive parts. “Despite the fact that fewer cars are being produced, in Mexico, we are making more for each car produced in our country,” said Manuel Montoya for Mexico Business News. Montoya is the president of the National Network of Automotive Industry Clusters, a non-profit that aims to promote automotive manufacturing in Mexico. “Thus, 2022 will be a year of growth for the Mexican automotive industry.”\n\nConway Data, the parent company of Site Selection magazine, has logged 90 automotive production facility projects in Mexico since the beginning of 2021, 64% of which are in parts manufacturing. This paints a tempting portrait for the Mexican auto parts industry, which grew by 21% in 2021.\n\nThe whole world seems to agree. Of these 90 projects — which include facility expansions, developments, and headquarters, — 61 are international, with the main players being the United States and Germany, who account for 37% of investment. Manufacturing represents 45% of all Mexican foreign direct investment, with the automotive industry as torch bearer.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports U.S. investment totaled $9.3 billion in Mexico in 2021, with transportation equipment accounting for $981 million of that total. The countries are more co-conspirators than actual competitors, since investment and nearshoring in Mexico has huge benefits for the United States, and Mexico is a consumer of U.S. goods. In 2021 the Census Bureau found that the U.S. imported $385 billion in goods from Mexico, second only to China. The U.S. also exported $276 billion to Mexico, second to Canada, which recently unseated its USMCA trade partner.\n\nElectrifying Mexico\n\nAnalysts for The New York Times predict that by 2035 EVs will make up 25% of all new car sales and account for 60% of new sales by 2050. Demand for EVs is soaring, and buyers often have to put down deposits months ahead of time or risk the model selling out. Automotive companies are likewise putting down deposits on Mexico’s EV future.\n\nIn 2018, Mexican electric car company Zacua started production in Puebla. The company’s two models resemble muscled Mini Coopers with a range of around 100 miles per charge, perfect for urban areas. After a COVID-induced hiatus the company began selling its first cars this year for a little more than US$30,000, though subsidies upwards of $2,000 are offered. The cars are majority Mexican made, but some parts are outsourced to Spanish and French brands. Zacua CEO Nazareth Black wants this to change.\n\n“When we started, we brought in the transmission systems from outside. Now, we make them at the plant,” she said in an interview with Diálogo Chino in June. “We want all the parts to be Mexican. That is what we have been doing over the years: working on supply issues.” Black said it can be difficult to compete with huge brands that have been coming to Mexico, realizing it’s cheap to assemble there. “Everything is more expensive for us than a global brand. If I buy 50 steering wheels, for example, Ford buys 5 million. Who will get it cheaper?”\n\nThe company is small, and vehicles are assembled by hand. Black wants to make the company attractive to foreign investors who want to use Mexico to enter North American markets, “So why don’t we make a platform to serve them? Either we see them as competition, or we collaborate and capitalize on this.”\n\nThe electric engine of Nissan’s Kicks e-POWER.\n\nCourtesy of Nissan\n\nIn 2021 GM announced a $1 billion investment in its Ramos Arizpe plant in Coahuila, Mexico, with the intention of making it the fifth electric-specific GM plant. Initial phases will include the production of battery packs and electric motors alongside gas engines, with the potential of producing full electric vehicles in 2023, including Cadillac crossovers.\n\nThere are further rumors of Tesla considering Mexico as its next production site, possibly to be announced at the end of 2022. This speculation comes as Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology is said to be considering two locations in Mexico with investments up to $5 billion, possibly in the states of Chihuahua or Coahuila close to the U.S. border and to Tesla’s Texas factory in metro Austin. The company is the world’s biggest maker of electric batteries for cars and is a main supplier for Tesla.\n\nThe marriage in locations between the supplier and manufacturer would funnel billions in investment to northern Mexico, which already houses 52.1% of the country’s auto parts production. Coahuila, the location of GM’s 40-year-old manufacturing operation, represents 17.2% of auto parts production, Chihuahua 11.9% and Nuevo Leon 11.4%.

    "Avelo Eyes International Expansion With Mexico, Canada, & Caribbean On The Cards": "Avelo Airlines has been rapidly building its presence in the US domestic market. Its network of more than 30 destinations on both the east and west coasts, often flying into underserved airports, has seen it expand its footprint massively over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile the airline has certainly not exhausted all its options when it comes to domestic connections, flying internationally could well be in its future. Speaking exclusively to Simple Flying, President and CEO of Avelo, Andrew Levy, said that it’s not a question of if, but when. He said,\n\n“We were not actively looking at that, but we absolutely will fly International, it's just a question of when, not if. We are a flag carrier, which means we have all the designations that you need to be able to serve international points on scheduled service. We have lots and lots of experience among our team in terms of international operations. So I do expect that that will come.”\n\nWhere would Avelo fly?\n\nFor Avelo Airlines, any international would need to be a modular progression from its existing hubs and network. It would also need to retain its out-and-back mentality; as yet, Avelo doesn’t fly any route that would leave the plane and crew requiring an overnight stop.\n\nRight now, the airline has a strong presence in the Florida region, with hubs at both Orlando and at Fort Myers. Both of these could open opportunities to the south.\n\nIn the north of the east coast, its original east coast hub airport at Tweed New Haven is far enough north that Canada is entirely doable, without spoiling its out and back in a day strategy. Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, are all well within the reach of Avelo.\n\nOn the other side of the country, its hub at Hollywood Burbank opens opportunities in both directions. Mexico is just to the south, while to the north, the airline already flies to Pasco Tri-Cities Airport, just a hop and a skip from Vancouver.\n\nLevy agreed with our assessment of its opportunities, stating that,\n\n“For us, international would be … close in, more of a leisure or VFR type focus, which is going to be mostly probably Mexico, Caribbean, those types of things. Certainly, there could be some possibilities in Canada perhaps.”\n\nLong-haul, low-cost doesn’t work\n\nAlthough Avelo could eye some near international destinations to the north and south of the USA, Levy was clear that he has no aspirations to start flying further afield. He said,\n\n“I don't foresee ever deciding to go get really big airplanes that fly across the pond or anything like that. I don't believe in long-haul low-cost - That's not for me. I've never seen it work and someone else will have to prove that one out, one day, maybe…”\n\nPlenty of airlines have had a crack at long-haul, low-cost operations, and plenty have fallen as a result. Those who survive in the longer haul market are either less low-cost than the ULCC that Avelo is – think JetBlue – or they’re flying true LCC services but with long-range narrowbodies – think Wizz Air and some of its A321LR routes.\n\nIt’s always been a tough nut to crack, and for Levy, it’s just a step too far. Nevertheless, we could see some interesting destinations added to the route map in the future that make sense for Avelo to serve.\n\nYou can watch the complete interview with Andrew on the video link below:\n\nWhere would you like to see Avelo landing north or south of the US border?

    "In Mexico, a 1,000-year-old site is declared an ancient monument, the first in a decade": "MEXICO CITY — An ancient Mexican site more than 1,000 years old has been declared the country’s first archaeological zone in a decade, antiquities institute INAH announced on Tuesday, despite several years of steep budget cuts for archeological research.\n\nCañada de la Virgen, the modern name of an ancient Otomi ceremonial center, is located near the picturesque mountain town and tourist destination of San Miguel de Allende.\n\nThe pre-Hispanic site features a large stone temple complex and other structures, many aligned with astronomical bodies, and is believed to have reached its peak around 600-900 AD, contemporaneous with dozens of major Maya cites.\n\nAncient Otomi settlements were mostly clustered around the present-day central Mexican states of Puebla, Hidalgo and Guanajuato, where Cañada de la Virgen is located, before being conquered by the Aztecs in the 14th century and incorporated into their sprawling empire.\n\nScholars believe an ancient version of the Otomi language, which is still spoken today, may have been the language spoken at Teotihuacán, the ancient metropolis near Mexico City and home to towering pyramids and temples.\n\nA stone pyramid at an ancient Otomi ceremonial center in Guanajuato, Mexico. GHI/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIn a statement, INAH stressed that the site’s designation as a protected archeological monument is a first under the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, which has slashed archeology research budgets over the past few years as part of an austerity push.\n\nThe declaration, granted under a presidential decree, affords protection against commercial development and other building projects.\n\nINAH added that past archaeological digs at Cañada de la Virgen have revealed artifacts from both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, suggesting it was located along a major trading route.\n\nLópez Obrador has faced backlash from indigenous Maya communities in the archaeologically rich Yucatan peninsula for a multi-billion dollar tourist train project under construction that critics fear will damage delicate ecosystems and undiscovered ruins. The president argues the project will promote development in Mexico’s poorer south while minimizing harm to the environment.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
    "Mexico's Big Bet on the Future of Fossil Fuels Will Get Help from a Canadian Pipeline Company": "Mexico's Big Bet on the Future of Fossil Fuels Will Get Help from a Canadian Pipeline Company\n\n09.26.2022 By TankTerminals.com - NEWS\n\nSeptember 26, 2022 [Financial Post] – Deal with TC Energy called ‘crucial’ for North America\n\nMexico is making a big bet on the future of fossil fuels with some help from a Canadian pipeline giant.\n\nBucking broad global sentiment urging a shift away from fossil fuels, Mexico is building a large oil refinery on its Gulf Coast, in the southeastern state of Tabasco. Once operational, the new refinery is expected to expand Mexico’s oil-processing capacity by 20 per cent, while reducing its dependence on imported gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.\n\nAssisting Mexico with its energy ambitions is the $4.5-billion Southeast Gateway Pipeline project, announced last month by Calgary-based TC Energy Corp.\n\nThe pipeline will carry up to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the southeast region of Mexico, and, crucially, offers up an additional power source for the new state-owned Olmeca Dos Bocas refinery.\n\nTabasco Governor Carlos Manuel Merino Campos, who is visiting Canada this week, said the pipeline will deliver gas that could be used to power the refinery as well as other industrial firms in the growing region. Merino Campos also said the deal with TC Energy shows the country’s openness to foreign investment — a remark that appeared to rebut recent trade complaints from the United States suggesting that Mexico’s energy strategy discriminates against foreign companies.\n\n“This agreement with (TC Energy) is something necessary for Mexico and it shows that Mexico wants to have private investors in our country,” said Merino Campos.\n\nTC Energy will partner with Mexico’s state-owned electric utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the utility’s first public-private partnership, to build the 715-kilometre offshore pipeline.\n\nThe project is anticipated to be in-service by 2025, just three years after the joint final investment decision was announced — a pace that appears blistering compared with the hurdles and delays connected with another high-profile TC Energy project, the controversial Coastal GasLink pipeline.\n\nThe Canadian pipeline company may find Mexico to be a particularly hospitable jurisdiction at the moment thanks to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s desire to build out infrastructure to end the country’s reliance on imported fuels and become energy self-sufficient.\n\nTabasco’s secretary for economic development and competitiveness called the deal with TC Energy “crucial” for North America, particularly in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption to global energy supplies.\n\n“We must work together to have this energy sovereignty, to help our countries face all the financial threats or the energy threats that we may have,” said Jose Friedrich Garcia Mallitz. “This project is showing this bond because the gas is going to come from the United States, the pipeline is going to come from Canada and Mexico is going to benefit from all of this work together as a team.”\n\nTC Energy is also poised to benefit significantly from its latest venture in Mexico.\n\nMexican assets currently contribute roughly seven per cent of TC Energy’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and are projected to grow to roughly 12 to 14 per cent of EBITDA in 2026, according to an analysis by RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe deal has also resolved a protracted dispute between CFE and TC Energy over fees the Canadian company was to earn from two other pipeline projects.\n\nThe two companies have agreed to terminate arbitration proceedings, with TC Energy earning a return on previous capital invested, the company said in August.\n\nTC Energy isn’t entering uncharted waters, having previously completed an offshore natural gas pipeline, Sur de Texas, in Mexico in 2019.\n\nCEO François Poirier previously said the public-private partnership will develop critical energy infrastructure serving the growing central and southeast regions of Mexico.\n\n“The Southeast Gateway Pipeline will be TC Energy’s second marine natural gas pipeline in Mexico, connecting to the coastal regions of Veracruz and Tabasco, and is another prime example of our ability to originate world-class projects that offer incremental growth to our long-term outlook,” Poirier said in an Aug. 4 statement.\n\nThe trade delegation from Tabasco met with executives at TC Energy in Calgary this week before making stops in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.\n\nThe visit comes as a quiet battle may be brewing between Mexico and its allies over Mexico’s direction on energy which its northern neighbours argue could violate the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\n\nU.S. trade representatives have warned that Lopez Obrador’s policies privilege state-owned oil producer Pemex and electricity provider CFE. Some private foreign firms have also complained about delays or revocations of permits.\n\n10,390 tank storage and production facilities as per the date of this article.

    "Can Mexico’s 43 missing students get justice at last – or will politics prevail?": "When Clemente Rodríguez imagines seeing his only son Christian again, he envisions an encounter on a Mexican beach, or a chance meeting on the streets of his home village. Maybe his son will have a beard; after eight years, he’s bound to have changed.\n\n“I tell my wife that when I see him, I’ll have heartache from sheer joy,” says Rodríguez. “When he comes home, I imagine us going to the beach – Acapulco or Cancún – just for fun.”\n\nChristian was last seen alive in September 2014, when he and other student teachers from the Ayotzinapa rural teachers’ college in southern Mexico commandeered a fleet of buses to take them to a demonstration in the capital.\n\nHours later, the 43 students were ambushed and abducted by local police working alongside a local cartel called Guerreros Unidos. Most of them vanished entirely, in one of the most notorious and baffling atrocities in Mexico’s blood-soaked recent history.\n\nScores of suspects, including local politicians, government officials and cartel thugs have been detained. Arrest warrants have been issued for dozens more, but there have been no convictions, and the fate of the students remains unknown.\n\nThe case – and the authorities’ muddled response – became a millstone for the then president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and an emblem of the crisis of impunity in Mexico, where more than 100,000 people have gone missing at the hands of criminals and corrupt officials.\n\nIn late August, however, faint hopes were raised that there might finally be some answers.\n\nA government truth commission appointed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador released a 108-page report which concluded that the mass disappearance was a state-sponsored crime involving federal and state authorities at the highest levels of government.\n\nAlejandro Encinas, the deputy interior minister who had chaired the commission, also made the startling revelation that six of the students were kept alive for several days after their abduction before being put to death on the orders of a Mexican army colonel.\n\nFriends and relatives seeking justice for the missing 43 Ayotzinapa students gather round a monument dedicated to the students during a demonstration in Mexico City lasts month. Photograph: Marco Ugarte/AP\n\nDays after the report’s publication, federal agents arrested former attorney general Jesús Murillo Karam – who oversaw the original investigation – on charges of forced disappearance, torture and official misconduct.\n\nMurillo Karam has long been accused of imposing a politically convenient narrative on the investigation – in which the students were supposedly mistaken for members of a rival group – in order to quickly close the case.\n\nArrest warrants were also issued for 83 others, including soldiers, police officers, Guerrero officials and gang members.\n\nThe developments offered some hope that the case may finally be solved – but by pointing the finger at high-level military officers and officials from the previous government, it also represents a challenge for López Obrador.\n\n“If the government says it’s going to go after guilty officials, then it must keep its word,” said Rodríguez.\n\nThe president, popularly known as Amlo, promised to “reach the truth” in the case. But he was quick to say that Peña Nieto was not himself under investigation, and added that any future decisions over the case would be up to the magistrates leading the investigation.\n\nHis comments have failed to dampen accusations that once again, politics has been prioritized over justice. “Just as politics helped shut down the case in 2014, politics is shutting it down again in 2022,” said the author and journalist Ricardo Raphael.\n\n“It’s hard to conclude that Murillo Karam came up with this official version on his own. The story was produced in Los Pinos [the former presidential residence] – not in the prosecutor’s office.”\n\nInvestigators now appear to be focusing on the theory that – unknown to the students – one of the commandeered buses was carrying a hidden shipment of heroin, which had been allowed to pass police and cartel checkpoints – and which the corrupt police officers were dispatched to recover.\n\nBut for relatives of the missing students, the priority remains simple: finding out what happened to their loved ones.\n\nAlejandro Encinas, the deputy interior minister who chaired the truth commission, addresses the Ayotzinapa case in Mexico City last month. Photograph: Sáshenka Gutiérrez/EPA\n\nLast week the families called on the truth commission to allow independent experts from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to examine its evidence.\n\n“We need undeniable scientific evidence of the whereabouts of our sons. We can’t go home with just preliminary findings which do not reveal where they are – and what happened to them,” the families said in a statement.\n\n“We’ve taken one step, and that’s important. But what we want is for the law to be followed: we want justice, and we want to know the truth of what happened to our sons,” said Cristina Asencio, mother of another missing student, Benjamín Ascencio Bautista.\n\nOne possible step towards that truth would be the arrest of Peña’s close ally Tomás Zerón, the former director of the attorney general’s criminal investigation agency (AIC). Zerón was forced to resign after video emerged of him torturing suspects in the case of the 43 students, and he was accused of tampering with evidence.\n\nTomás Zerón Photograph: Tomas Bravo/Reuters\n\nHe was then named as Peña Nieto’s security adviser, but fled to Israel to escape charges of kidnapping, torturing suspects, manipulating evidence and embezzling about $50m of public funds. Zerón denies the allegations.\n\n“If Zéron is captured, the trail to Los Pinos will become clear. The investigators will have to follow it, and it will be hard to avoid looking into the role of Peña Nieto and his circle,” said Raphael.\n\nMexico has repeatedly called on Israel to hand over Zerón, despite the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries, and last week, the foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said that he could be returned to Mexico within days.\n\nIn his state of the nation address on Thursday, Amlo mentioned Ayotzinapa and again pledged that there would be no impunity for the perpetrators.\n\nBut any arrests must be supported by evidence that will stand up in court, warned Raphael, adding that justice will only be achieved when those responsible for the atrocity are tried and convicted. “The day that there are convictions for [forced] disappearance, murder and covering up the truth – that day will be a victory against impunity.”\n\nUntil that day comes, relatives of the missing students will continue fighting, said Rodríguez. “This whole time has been an emotional and psychological hell,” he said.\n\nIn 2020, government investigators told Rodríguez that DNA from a fragment of bone found at the dump in Cocula matched that of his son.\n\nBut despite that finding – and the conclusion of the truth commission that there is no evidence to suggest the students are alive – Rodríguez refuses to let go of hope.\n\n“Until I see a body, my son is still alive,” he said. “My struggle isn’t over. My son was whole when they took him, and if they say he’s no longer alive, then they should catch whoever was responsible – and return me his body.”",

Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe country hosts the 10th-largest lithium resource globally at 1.7 million mt, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nIn April, Mexico passed a law to nationalize its lithium, paving the way for the establishment of a state-owned lithium company called Litio para Mexico, or Lithium for Mexico, four months later on Aug. 23 through a decree issued by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The cash-strapped government hopes that taking control of its lithium can pay for new spending, but it has so far released few details on how far it will intervene in the market or how private companies can participate in the country's lithium sector.\n\nAnalysts told S&P Global Commodity Insights this uncertainty may prevent Mexico from becoming an important lithium producer at a time when the world is scrambling for new supplies amid rising demand for electric vehicles.\n\n\"A lack of clarity regarding the operations of the state-owned lithium company ... will likely delay the creation of a profitable lithium industry in Mexico,\" Cecily Fasanella said in an email. Fasanella is the program coordinator at the Mexico Institute of Washington-based think tank Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nThe missing information\n\nLitio para Mexico is expected to hold the exclusive rights to exploit the country's lithium resources. The company is scheduled to start operations within the next six months, but the government has yet to establish rules on how it will manage existing concessions and hand out new concessions.\n\nThe president also vowed that lithium exploration in Mexico would only be used for national development, joining the new wave of resource nationalism sweeping Latin America. Mexico is working with Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, countries that make up the so-called Lithium Triangle in South America, to form a lithium association where they can collaborate on developing new technologies to exploit the commodity.\n\nLópez Obrador has not entirely dismissed the possibility of partnering with the private sector, given the country's lack of experience in the lithium sector, but miners have little sense of how they would be allowed to operate.\n\nPrivate sector peeved\n\nAllowing Litio para Mexico to dominate the domestic industry would likely deter private companies from investing.\n\n\"If the state-owned lithium company has a strong monopoly with little regulatory oversight, private sector investors will likely be discouraged from entering this multibillion-dollar market,\" Fasanella said.\n\nIn April, some business groups, including the Mexican branch of the International Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, flagged the law's potential conflict with Mexico's global trade obligations.\n\nThe groups said Mexico is party to certain trade pacts that prohibit new restrictions on sectors that were not previously reserved to the state.\n\nFasanella expressed doubts about whether, without the help of the private sector, Litio para Mexico could commence mining activities before the end of López Obrador's term in 2024, given the state of the country's finances.\n\nMexico needs foreign expertise. Lithium is mainly produced from brines and hard-rock deposits using conventional methods, but Mexico's lithium is typically found in clay deposits, for which extraction technologies are still being developed.\n\n\"This industry is capital intensive and requires innovative technology,\" Miguel Angel Marmolejo Cervantes, a professor at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Mexico, said in an email.\n\nAlbemarle, Allkem and Livent, all of which have invested in other Latin American countries, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe exception\n\nWhen López Obrador signed the law taking control of domestic lithium, he called for a review of all lithium concessions that were previously granted, including one owned by an unnamed Chinese company. China-based Ganfeng Lithium had also just taken complete control of the Sonora project, the world's 14th-largest lithium project based on primary reserves and resources, and Mexico's largest, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.\n\nIn June, López Obrador softened his stance on Ganfeng, saying the government will respect the company's Sonora project. The company did not respond to S&P Global's request for comment.\n\nThe possible delay in Mexico's lithium development could hamper an already tight lithium market that faces a supply deficit for the years to come. The global supply gap for lithium carbonate equivalent is expected to reach 39,000 mt by 2026 from a projected surplus of 1,000 mt in 2022, according to Market Intelligence forecasts.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights reporter Karl Decena writes for S&P Capital IQ Pro.

    "Rapid vertical exchange at fronts in the Northern Gulf of Mexico": "SUNRISE campaign 2021\n\nCharacterizing the fronts on the Texas-Louisiana shelf and their vertical circulation is one of the goals of SUNRISE. In the summer of 2021, a multi-platform field campaign was conducted on the Texas-Louisiana shelf. During the period from June 23 to 28, several wind events energized near-inertial oscillations in the ocean (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material). Over the shelf, the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river outflow creates a large plume of fresh water and a rich field of eddies and fronts develops as a result. A plume front was captured by high-frequency, repeated profiling transects conducted by R/Vs Pelican and Walton Smith which were run in parallel lines separated by ~1 km. A snapshot of the plume front (characterized by the high concentration of chlorophyll) and the ship tracks are shown in Fig. 2a. The observations revealed strong frontal convergence and divergence, the downward vertical transport of warm surface waters (through a process known as subduction) on the leading edge of the front, and upwelling of cool waters on its trailing edge.\n\nIsopycnals near the surface converge approximately every inertial period, when the plume front propagates offshore. Here, we focus on the front observed on June 24. From 03:00 to 07:00 UTC, the plume front propagates into the sampling region, which is indicated by the strong surface buoyancy gradients at the middle of the transects (e.g., the subpanel in Fig. 2a). Strong near-surface convergence was found at the head of the front, suggesting intense downward motions beneath the front (Fig. 2b). As observed on both R/Vs, the isopycnals beneath the leading edge of the front are depressed due to downward advection of buoyant water, which is evidenced by the shock-like jumps in the density fields (Fig. 2e, f). In addition, strong near-surface convergence was found at the head of the front, suggesting intense downwelling beneath the front (Fig. 2b). The appearance of streamers of warm water on the leading edge of the front that follow isopycnals is strongly suggestive of active subduction of surface waters at the front (Fig. 2e, f). In contrast, the near-surface flow is divergent on the light side of the front (Fig. 2b) which presumably drives the upward motions that occur there, as evidenced by the intrusions of cooler water (e.g., Fig. 2f). Such upwelling motions are also evidenced by the intrusion of bottom waters with lower oxygen and higher turbidity on the transects made on June 23 and 25 (see Fig. S3 and S4 of the supplementary material).\n\nDiurnal convergence at fronts\n\nA triple-nested model is configured to simulate the frontal vertical circulations on the Texas-Louisiana shelf and understand their governing physics (Fig. 1a; see Methods for details). Over the shelf, a rich field of eddies and fronts develops due to the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river outflow (Fig. 3a, b). In addition, the prominent wind variability in the summertime is often a diurnal land-sea breeze. An example of the land-sea breeze is shown in Fig. 3d. The breeze resonantly excites strong near-inertial oscillations in the ocean (oscillatory flows where the Coriolis force acts as the sole restoring force for their motions). In the absence of background currents, inertial oscillations are non-divergent in the lateral direction. However, in the presence of the plume fronts, the oscillations interact with the fronts and display convergent features, leading to strong vertical motions at the front.\n\nFig. 3: Diurnal convergence at fronts. a Surface normalized relative vorticity (ζ/f), where ζ = ∂v/∂x − ∂u/∂y. b Surface density. Isobaths are contoured in gray. The white box denotes the L3 domain. c Surface normalized divergence (δ/f) binned as a function of ζ/f and time.

Full size image\n\nThe plume fronts coincide with filaments with strong positive relative vorticity, while the plume eddies are characterized by negative relative vorticity (Fig. 3a, b). Given these characteristics, the horizontal divergence associated with the fronts and eddies can be distinguished from one another by calculating the divergence as a function of vorticity using surface fields taken from the entire numerical domain. The statistics of the divergence shown in Fig. 3c demonstrates that horizontal convergence (blue colors) primarily occurs in fronts and varies near-inertially with the sea-breeze.\n\nThe near-surface inertial/diurnal horizontal convergence at the fronts can induce downward motions at depth. The convergence at the surface across the front is found to be very strong, for example at x ≈ 16 km for the section shown in Fig. 3f. This strongly convergent surface flow draws together isopycnal surfaces and induces downward motions which advect the buoyant surface water downwards and contributes to the depression of isopycnals beneath the leading edge of the front, a feature that is seen in the observations (cf. Figs. 2f and 3g). In addition to the convergence on the frontal edge, the flow at the light side of the front is divergent, resembling the observations (cf. Figs. 2b and 3h), and could potentially drive upward motions.\n\nSlantwise vertical exchange at fronts\n\nEvidence of subduction can be seen in the distribution of the temperature field near the fronts. The density of the sea water on the Texas-Louisiana self shelf is largely dependent on salinity with a lower-water column thermocline contributing to stratification differences in the summer5. Consequently, temperature becomes an ideal tracer to identify surface waters because it tags waters warmed by solar radiation. The simulation reveals a streamer of warm water subducting into the interior beneath the front, which resembles the observed fields (cf. Figs. 4b and 2e, f). A Lagrangian analysis was used to confirm that the warm waters at depth originated from the surface. Namely, Lagrangian, or water-following floats were seeded in the simulation at the head of the warm-water streamer (the dots in Fig. 4b) and advected backwards in time to determine their origin. This Lagrangian analysis reveals that the floats came from near the surface and subducted a distance of about 10 m in a few hours, indicating rapid vertical transport (Fig. 4f). To illustrate the spatial structure of the subduction, floats were uniformly released at the surface of the frontal region (marked in Fig. 4h) and then tracked forward in time. As the floats approach the front, they are rapidly subducted beneath the front, showing a fairly uniform subduction zone along the front (Fig. 4h). The subduction has an along-isopycnal nature connecting the surface to the interior, which is different from other turbulent processes in surface mixed layers, such as breaking of surface gravity waves, convective instabilities, and shear instabilities.\n\nFig. 4: Slantwise vertical exchange at fronts. a–d Across-front sections of dissolved oxygen, temperature, potential vorticity, and viscosity. The sections are made at June 14, 2010 00:00 UTC along the orange line marked in Fig. 3e. e Time series of float depth colored by dissolved oxygen concentration. The floats are initially released at the positions marked by the upper gray dots in a and backward tracked in time. The Lagrangian rate of change of oxygen near the surface is estimated as dO/dt ≈ 0.82 mg L−1 day−1. This rate of oxygenation is obtained by averaging the rates of all the floats over the last 4 h. f Same as e but for the lower floats marked in a, b. g Distance above bottom of floats 30 h after release. The floats are initially and uniformly released in a 10 m-thick bottom boundary layer within the red dashed box at June 13, 2010 06:00 UTC. h Float depth 12 h after release. The floats are initially and uniformly released at the surface within the green dashed box at June 13, 2010 12:00 UTC. Isopycnals are contoured every 0.2 kg/m3 in gray in a–d and g, h. All the calculations are from the L3 solution. Full size image\n\nUpwelling of bottom waters on the lighter side of the front accompanies the subduction of surface waters on the denser side of the front. This is particularly evident in the oxygen field. In the simulation, a bottom boundary layer with lower oxygen concentration compared to the overlying water is reproduced (details of the oxygen model are described in the Methods section), and hence oxygen is a particularly good tracer for identifying bottom waters (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the water with lower oxygen seems to intrude upward along the tilted isopycnals near the front (Fig. 4a). To certify the path of the intrusion, 3D Lagrangian floats are released at the tongue of the water with lower oxygen (denoted in Fig. 4a) and then tracked backward in time. The time series of the float depth shows that the floats at the tongue are raised about 10 m in 18 h (Fig. 4e), indicating that the near-surface water with lower oxygen certainly originates from a deeper depth. To illustrate the spatial structure of the intrusion, floats are uniformly released in a 10 m thick bottom boundary layer in the frontal region (marked in Fig. 4g) and then tracked forward in time. The floats are raised from the bottom boundary layer quite uniformly at the light side of the front (Fig. 4g), consistent with the intrusion of water with lower oxygen shown in Figs. 4a and 2b. Although the freshwater input from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River generally suppresses ventilation of bottom waters by creating a strongly stratified layer, the exchange of water along isopycnals near the plume fronts serves as a ventilating channel of the bottom oxygen-deficient water over the Texas-Louisiana shelf that can bypass the plume’s stratification barrier. This slantwise vertical exchange at fronts contributes a ventilation mechanism among other mechanisms related to bottom boundary layer dynamics6.\n\nA third tracer that evidences slantwise vertical exchange at the fronts is the potential vorticity (PV). The PV, defined here as \\(q=(f\\hat{z}+\n\nabla \\times {{{{{{{\\bf{u}}}}}}}})\\cdot\n\nabla b\\) (\\(\\hat{z}\\) is the unit vector in the vertical direction, u is the velocity, b = − gρ/ρ o is the buoyancy, g is the acceleration due to gravity and ρ, ρ o is the density and a reference density, respectively) is a measure of the stability of the flow. Namely, large positive values of the PV indicate stable flow and strong stratification, while negative values of the PV mark a flow that is unstable to submesoscale instabilities which can drive vertical exchange7,8. The structure of the PV field near the front looks remarkably similar to that of the temperature and oxygen fields (Fig. 4a–c), with high values of the PV (associated with the strongly-stratified bottom waters) being drawn up to the surface from the bottom in the plumes of waters with cooler temperature and lower oxygen. Conversely, water with low to negative PV is subducted from the surface ahead of the leading edge of the front along with the warmer, oxygenated waters. The PV inferred from the observations made from the two ships (see Methods for the calculation detail) shows a similar correlation between the PV and temperature fields (cf. Fig. 2d, f), suggesting that related PV dynamics are at play in the observed and simulated fronts.\n\nThe resemblances in the PV, temperature, and oxygen fields highlight the conservative nature of these three tracers. Having said this, the Lagrangian time evolution of the PV, as measured by the PV interpolated to the positions of the floats that were seeded into the bottom waters (colors in Fig. S5B of the supplementary material), show that the PV is conserved only until the water reaches the surface layer, at which point the PV is rapidly reduced and in fact changes sign. These floats upwell on the isopycnals that outcrop at the front, where the PV is negative in the surface boundary layer (Figs. 4c and 5b). Here non-conservative effects, namely friction and diabatic processes conspire to change the PV by inducing a positive vertical PV flux, J z , at the sea surface that extracts PV from the ocean and hence reduces the PV in the boundary layer (e.g., Fig. 5c and Fig. S6 in the supplementary material where J z is defined and broken down into its frictional and diabatic components). At fronts forced by winds, the surface PV flux scales with the Ekman buoyancy flux, EBF ≡ M e ⋅ ∇ h b, where M e is the Ekman transport, which measures the tendency for wind-forced surface flows to advect denser waters over light and destabilize the water column8,9. The EBF at the front oscillates in time due to both the variation in the wind-driven flow and the strength of the front (Fig. S7c in the supplementary material). Expressed in terms of an equivalent heat flux, the EBF can reach values approaching 20,000 W m−2 of heat loss in the center of the front. Such intense values of the EBF were also inferred from the observations (Fig. 2c) and suggest that the surface boundary layer at the front is a hot spot for irreversible mixing.\n\nFig. 5: Inertially modulated frontogenesis and convergence. a Time series of the surface wind stress over the L3 domain. b Surface PV (color), wind stress (vectors) and density (contours) that are averaged between 06/12 12:00 and 06/15 12:00 UTC. c Hovmöller diagrams of surface normalized divergence (δ/f), horizontal buoyancy gradient squared (1/2∣∇ h b∣2), and PV flux (J z ), which are calculated along the orange line in b (the same line in Fig. 3e). d Comparison between the wind stress \\({\\tau }_{y}^{w}\\) and minus the geostrophic stress \\({\\tau }_{y}^{g}\\) at the front over one inertial period. \\({\\tau }_{y}^{g}\\) and \\({\\tau }_{y}^{w}\\) are averaged over a front-following section (the first 2 km of the magenta section in e). e Across-front ageostrophic velocity u ag . The velocity is averaged over the top 5 m. The snapshot is taken at 06/14 18:00 UTC (marked by the arrow in f). Two front-following sections are plotted for each side of the front. f Velocity evolution over one inertial period on the dense side of the front. The left subpanel shows one inertial cycle of u ml that is obtained from the slab mixed layer model. The right subpanel is a Hovmöller diagram of u ag along the blue line in e. g Velocity evolution over one inertial period on the light side of the front. The left subpanel is a Hovmöller diagram of u ag along the magenta line in e. The right subpanel is a similar diagram but for \\({u}_{ag}^{\\prime}\\) that is obtained from the reduced physics model. The gray dashed box between f and g marks the phase when the across-front velocities run opposite on either side of the front and lead to convergence. The gray box in g marks the phase with divergence on the light side of the front. The distance in the Hovmöller diagrams in f and g are front-relative with negative (positive) values on the dense (light) side. The gray contours in b, c, e are isopycnals made every 0.2 kg/m3. All calculations are made from the L3 solution. Full size image\n\nThe oxygen on the floats, like the PV, experiences similar rapid Lagrangian variations in the surface boundary layer, but in this case increasing as the fluid approaches the oxygenated surface ocean (Fig. 4e). In this way, by bringing bottom waters to the surface, the slantwise, along-isopycnal motions at the front can lead to irreversible changes in water properties, and drive a net oxygenation of the bottom waters and a reduction in the PV and stratification of the water column. The rate of oxygenation during these pulses of upwelling is estimated based on Lagrangian particle tracking as 0.82 mg L−1 day−1 (Fig. 4e), which is comparable to the rate of deoxygenation due to aerobic respiration of organic matter during the summertime in the Gulf of Mexico10. In the next section we explore the mechanisms that force the vertical motions at the front.\n\nInertially modulated convergence and frontogenesis\n\nThe vertical motions at the front are ultimately associated with convergences and divergences in the near-surface horizontal flow. Understanding the processes that drive these convergences/divergences is thus key to unlocking the underlying physics of the vertical exchange at the fronts. As emphasized above, the convergence varies inertially and hence must be linked to the wind-forced inertial motions. However, in the absence of a background current, such motions inherit the horizontal scales of the winds, which on the shelf are too broad to explain the narrow convergence lines seen in the simulations, suggesting wave-mean flow interaction at the front as the cause of the convergence. By comparing the results from a reduced physics model that retains select terms in the equations of motion to the full solution from the simulations, we were able to isolate the key wave-mean flow interaction that is responsible for the inertially-modulated convergence at the fronts.\n\nThe reduced physics model accounts for wind-forcing, the Coriolis force, the pressure gradient force at the front, mixing of momentum by turbulence, and accelerations, but not nonlinear advection of momentum in the equations of motion (namely, it is a variant of the so-called turbulent thermal wind balance, e.g., ref. 11, that allows for accelerations but it does not account for modifications of the inertial motions by vorticity; see the Methods section for the details of the reduced physics model). In spite of the model simplification, the model captures the features in the cross-front velocity that lead to the inertially-modulated convergence (cf. the two panels in Fig. 5g). Here, we highlight a period of strong convergence around 6/14 18:00 associated with the sharp reversal in the cross-front velocity within the front relative to outside of the front (e.g., Fig. 5e, g for cross-front distances less than 3 km and before 6/14 21:00). The elevated turbulent viscosity at the front indicates that the mixing of the geostrophic momentum could play an important role in driving ageostrophic frontal circulations (Fig. 4d). The reduced physics model reveals that the flow reversal is caused by mixing of the geostrophic flow, which disrupts the geostrophic balance and accelerates an ageostrophic flow u ag < 0 that streams water down the pressure gradient at the front. Mixing of geostrophic momentum is quantified by the “geostrophic stress”, \\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{\\tau }}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\bf{g}}}}}}}}}=-{\\rho }_{o}\n\nu \\hat{z}\\times {\n\nabla }_{h}b/f\\) (ν is the turbulent viscosity)12. A time series of the geostrophic stress evaluated on the light side of the front demonstrates how reversals in the ageostrophic flow follow the peaks in ∣τ g ∣ (cf. Fig. 5d, g) which in turn coincide with the maxima in the turbulent viscosity (e.g., Fig. S7b in the supplementary material). These maxima in ν occur during periods when the EBF is positive and wind-driven surface flows destabilize the water column and enhance mixing (e.g., Fig. S7c in the supplementary material).\n\nOn the dense side of the front the winds drive an oscillatory, ageostrophic flow that tracks the phasing of a slab mixed layer model (an even simpler reduced physics model that only accounts for wind-forcing, the Coriolis force, and accelerations; see the Methods section for the details), cf. the two panels in Fig. 5f. The ageostrophic flows on either side of the front thus follow different physics and have periods when they are opposing (e.g., between 15:00-21:00 on 6/14). This results in strong, diurnal convergence (δ/f < −5) at the front (Fig. 5c). The near-surface convergence leads to frontogenesis as it intensifies the lateral buoyancy gradient, ∇ h b, and cyclonic vorticity (ζ > 0) of the front, which is likewise modulated over an inertial period (Fig. 5c). Based on this analysis we conclude that this inertial modulation of the convergence and frontogenesis is ultimately attributable to periodic mixing of the geostrophic flow at the front caused by the diurnally-varying winds. Similar diurnal variations in frontogenesis have been modeled for fronts forced by diurnal heating and cooling which can induce variations in viscosity akin to the wind-driven modulations in turbulence emphasized here13,14.\n\nThe reversal of the ageostrophic flow at the front also leads to divergence on the light edge of the front (e.g., Fig. 5c, g between 2–3 km). The pattern of near-surface convergence and divergence on the dense and light sides of the front should set up a vertical circulation with downwelling and upwelling, respectively. Furthermore, theory predicts that overturning motions forced by near-surface convergence/divergence at fronts should be slantwise, with streamlines that tend to run parallel to isopycnals15,16, which is entirely consistent with the behavior of the tracer fields and Lagrangian floats seen in the simulation. A schematic highlighting the key elements contributing to the vertical circulation at the front is shown in Fig. 6.",
    "Messi: “Mexico is a great rival, they play really well”": "The Argentine National Team is experiencing a good moment since it qualified for the Conmebol World Cup qualifier without any problem. It is currently one of the candidate teams to be the world champion in Qatar. A few weeks before the tournament starts, the planet’s two-time champion continues to have preparation matches to arrive confidently and physically well at the next World Cup tournament.\n\nLast Friday, the South Americans faced Honduras in a friendly match. Unfortunately, the Catrachos lost to the Argentinians with goals by Lionel Messi and Lautaro Martínez. In an interview for TUDN, the current star of Paris Saint-Germain highlighted the qualities that the Mexican National Team has and made it clear that facing the Tricolor will be difficult due to the game system managed by the national team.\n\n🏆 #Amistoso\n\n\n\n🎙 Lionel #Messi: \"Estamos disfrutando cada momento que estamos juntos, preparándonos con seriedad cuando nos toca trabajar\". pic.twitter.com/ajRj5HybKo — Selección Argentina 🇦🇷 (@Argentina) September 24, 2022\n\nWhat does Messi think of Mexico?\n\n“It is very important to start with a win. Then comes Mexico, a great rival that plays soccer very well. We have already faced them several times in World Cups and we know that they play very well, but we don’t think more than that, we have to go game by game. I think we have put together a nice team, very strong and we know how to play every game. The biggest difference is having the luck to win the Copa América. The World Cup it is very difficult, the small teams can leave you out of the tournament, but this team is here to compete and beat anyone”.\n\nMoreover, the Albiceleste has 34 games without knowing defeat, 23 wins, and 11 ties. The last time the Argentine team lost a game was in the semifinal of the Copa América in the 2019 edition, when they fell against Brazil with goals from Gabriel Jesús and Roberto Firmino.\n\nIn its first match, the Argentine National Team in Qatar 2022 will face Saudi Arabia, where the South Americans start as wide favorites. Later they will face Mexico and finish the group stage playing against Robert Lewandowski’s Poland."
