    "Background Press Call Previewing the Vice President’s Upcoming Travel to Japan and the Republic of Korea": "\n\nVia Teleconference\n\n12:36 P.M. EDT\n\nMODERATOR: Hey, thanks so much, Brad. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us.\n\nToday we’re going to be previewing the Vice President’s travel to Japan and the Republic of Korea. This call will be on background, attributed to a senior administration official. And there is no embargo on the contents of this call, so it will be immediately reportable after the call concludes.\n\nAnd again, by joining the call, you’re agreeing to those ground rules.\n\n\n\nSo, for your information only, our speaker today is [senior administration official], who hereinafter will be referred to as a “senior administration official.” And he’ll kick us off with some opening remarks.\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, everybody, for joining.\n\nThe Vice President is traveling to Japan, obviously, on a solemn occasion — Prime Minister Abe’s funeral — but I want to say that we’re also looking forward to a busy and productive visit, covering a lot of issues that are critical to us and our allies and partners.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this trip is threefold. First, obviously again, to honor the legacy of Prime Minister Abe and support the Japanese people as they mourn the tragedy of his assassination. Second, to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to our allies in an increasingly complex security environment. And third, to deepen our overall engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\n\nAs you all know, the Vice President traveled to Vietnam and Singapore last summer, and we view this trip as building on that engagement in the wider region, including with a focus on security and economic issues and also as a follow-up to President Biden’s trip this past May to Japan and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\n\nFollowing her trip to the region, the Vice President has had a number of other meetings with leaders from the region, including at the recent ASEAN Summit here in Washington, and we can expect she’ll continue her focus on this broader region because she recognizes how critically important it is for the security and prosperity of the American people.\n\n\n\nSo, with that, let me just give you a sense of her schedule and what she’ll be discussing at each stop along the way.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the Vice President will arrive in Tokyo. She will have, that evening, a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Kishida. In addition to expressing condolences and discussing Prime Minister Abe’s legacy, we anticipate that they will also have a discussion on issues such as the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance; our broad cooperation on many issues including space; and also, a range of regional and global issues including the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and the importance of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\n\n\nFollowing that, Prime Minister Kishida is generously hosting a dinner for the Vice President and the presidential delegation. The Vice President really appreciates this warm gesture of hospitality by the Prime Minister, which, again, we think underscores the really close relationship that the United States has with Japan.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Vice President will have two meetings with other world leaders also — who will also be present in Tokyo for the funeral. She’ll meet with Prime Minister Albanese of Australia and will discuss developments throughout the Indo-Pacific, including our work through the Quad, and our collective work to address the climate crisis, including the historic investments we are making through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President will also meet with Prime Minister Han of the Republic of Korea, who will be in Tokyo for the funeral. And that will be a real opportunity for the Vice President to discuss with him our upcoming visit to Seoul and how the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance is a linchpin of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and the Biden-Harris administration’s vision for a broader alliance that takes on global challenges beyond the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President will then lead the presidential delegation to the state funeral for Prime Minister Abe and pay respects on behalf of President Biden and the American people. Prime Minister Kishida has put together a fine tribute to a great leader, a great friend of the United States, and we appreciate his efforts to bring together in Tokyo — to bring us together in Tokyo to recognize the accomplishments of former Prime Minister Abe and to mourn his tragic assassination.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the Vice President will convene a group of Japanese business executives from companies in the semiconductor industry for a discussion on the CHIPS and Science Act that the President signed into law, and she’ll talk about the benefits it provides, not just for the United States, but for our allies and partners as well.\n\n\n\nThere will be three key topics: the investments in manufacturing in the United States; two, supply chain resilience and the importance of diversification to protect to protect from disruptions; and three, research and development and how we will take the strong history of collaboration with the Japanese and others to the next level with this new law.\n\n\n\nWhen the Vice President travels abroad, I think you know she’s always advocating for American businesses and American workers, and this event and this engagement are part of those efforts. She will also highlight the strong economic relationship between our two countries, the first and third largest economies in the world, and how it directly benefits the American people.\n\n\n\nLater on Wednesday, the Vice President will travel to Yokosuka Naval Base. She will receive a briefing and a tour of the USS Howard, a naval destroyer. She will meet with commanders and sailors of our forward-deployed naval forces, and she will then deliver remarks.\n\n\n\nJust as the roundtable with CEOs highlights the economic benefits of our engagement in the region, this stop will highlight the security ties and the strength of our alliance and importance of our military presence.\n\n\n\nIn the remarks, you can anticipate that the Vice President will discuss our enduring interests in the region and our enduring commitments to the region; our work with our allies and partners; how our military presence is ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific; and the importance of upholding the international rules-based order, which is a theme that you have heard her speak about on numerous occasions in recent months and, essentially, since the start of the administration.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the Vice President will travel to Seoul, Republic of Korea, and have a bilateral meeting with President Yoon, where she will underscore the strength of the U.S.-ROK Alliance and discuss the threat posed by the DPRK, the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, our growing economic and technology partnership, and a range of regional and global issues.\n\n\n\nAfter that, she will convene a roundtable discussion with a group of what we’re calling “groundbreaking Korean women.” These are prominent women from different industries who have made strides in building a more inclusive and equitable society. This meeting will demonstrate the importance the Vice President places on gender equity issues around the world.\n\n\n\nRecognizing the barriers that many Korean women face, this is an important issue for us in the ROK and around the world, and the Vice President very much wants to lend her voice and her leadership to lift up women and expand opportunities for them.\n\n\n\nSo, you see, it’s a rich agenda. And with that, I will pause and take some questions you might have. Thanks a lot.\n\n\n\nQ Thanks for taking questions. You mentioned that the Taiwan Strait would be a topic of conversation on Thursday with Yoon. Do you expect that to be a topic of conversation with Kishida as well? And what is planned in terms of discussions about deterring China from an attack on Taiwan? Thank you.\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I think you can assume that Taiwan will come up in the various bilateral meetings both in Japan and Korea. Obviously, it’s been a focus recently, where we’ve made clear our concerns about Chinese actions in and around Taiwan recently.\n\n\n\nI think, you know, the United States has made its position clear. And one of the aspects of our approach to Taiwan is the importance of working together with partners and allies. And, obviously, Japan, the Republic of Korea, you know, has a lot at stake in Taiwan and the region.\n\n\n\nAnd I think we are very much aligned with our partners. And this will be an opportunity for the Vice President to discuss, you know, the recent developments and the way forward with the leaders of both Japan and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\n\nQ Hi there. Can you hear me?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yep, go right ahead.\n\n\n\nQ Fantastic. What are you — thank you for having the call, as well. What are you tracking in terms of whether or not North Korea could do any sort of nuclear test, any sort of test launch during the VP’s visit?\n\n\n\nAnd then also, I’m hoping just to follow up on the question around China’s aggression against Taiwan. Can you speak to how the President’s recent statements — both during his trip to Tokyo, saying that the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense in very direct terms, as well as repeating that statement in an interview with “60 Minutes” — how that impacts this trip and the messaging that you’ll be delivering to allies in the region?\n\n\n\nAnd is there any sort of heightened anxiety amongst allies after those statements? Thanks.\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure, I’ll take those inverse — in reverse order.\n\n\n\nI don’t have anything to add to what the President said. He’s been asked a number of times if the United States would come to Taiwan’s assistance. And he said the other day, as he had said in Tokyo previously, “Yes.”\n\n\n\nBut he has also said, and we’ve made clear, that our policy on Taiwan hasn’t changed. We have the One China policy. We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo. And as I said a minute ago, you know, in discussing Taiwan in the context of this trip, it’s important to us to be aligned with our allies and partners on that issue, and we think — we think that we are.\n\n\n\nOn the first, I don’t have any, you know, predictions or announcements on the possibility of a North Korea nuclear test. You’ve seen, you know, public speculation about that. It is — it is possible. We’ve previously said that the DPRK is preparing to conduct a nuclear test. We’ve made clear that such a test would result in additional action by the United States to demonstrate our ironclad commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea and to our Japanese allies.\n\n\n\nAnd so, I think, you know, it’s another topic, no doubt, the Vice President will discuss with her counterparts there. We are — we’ve made clear how concerned we’ve been by North Korean, you know, provocations and destabilizing behavior, and a nuclear test would certainly be in that category.\n\n\n\nQ Hi, there. Thanks so much for doing the call. So just to follow up on some of these questions. First, I know that when President Biden was heading to Asia, there was some consideration that he would visit the DMZ. So I’m wondering: For the Vice President, since her trip mirrors his in a lot of ways, is there any consideration from your team of whether or not she would visit that area?\n\n\n\nAnd then when it comes to the possibility of a North Korea — you know, following through with a nuclear test, I wonder if you can talk about, you know, how the U.S. is prepared\n\nto protect the Vice President if that should happen were she — while she was in Asia.\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Jasmine. I don’t have anything further to announce about the schedule beyond what I outlined. But what I will say about the DMZ/DPRK is, you know, part of the reason for this visit is an opportunity for the Vice President to demonstrate our solidarity with our South Korean allies on the threat posed by the North.\n\n\n\nSo, you know, quite apart from any visits or the schedule itself, as I said in response to a previous call — the destabilizing behavior of the north with ballistic missile tests and possible contingencies of a nuclear test — she wants to go there and make clear that the United States has a very strong commitment to the Republic of Korea and its security. And that’s what she’s going to be signaling, and that’s what she’s going to be conveying to the President and other interlocutors.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, beyond that, I won’t comment on security of the Vice President, other than the fact that obviously the professionals are going to do their job and make sure she’s safe whatever she does.\n\n\n\nQ Hi, everybody. I have two questions. First, the funeral for former Prime Minister Abe is very controversial in Japan. I’m wondering how that, you think, will affect the Vice President’s visit in Japan.\n\n\n\nAnd then, secondly, could this visit help further efforts to repair ties between Japan and South Korea? What work will the Vice President be doing on that, and why is that important that they see progress there?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, thanks for that. Look, I’m not going to comment on any internal Japanese attitudes. All I can say from our point of view is that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend of the United States. He was a great leader for Japan.\n\n\n\nHe was one of the main forces behind this vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, which we share and are seeking to advance on this trip. He really made great strides towards a stronger U.S.-Japan alliance, which is an important legacy and, again, one that we’ve been building on in this administration and intend to carry forward.\n\n\n\nSo that’s, you know, from our point of view, why it’s so important for the Vice President to be leading this presidential delegation to respect and honor that important legacy.\n\n\n\nI’m glad you mentioned Japan and South Korea relations. Obviously, we want to see the closest possible relationship between our two allies. We’re encouraged to see that leadership on both sides seems to be prioritizing that issue and meeting with each other.\n\n\n\nYou know, it’s not for us to get in the middle of such a negotiation, but it’s certainly for us to express our support for what they’re doing and anything we can do to help, but mainly just to encourage that process, because the more we can be aligned bilaterally with them and them with each other, the stronger we are in the region and throughout the world.\n\n\n\nQ Thanks so much for having the call. Can you guys hear me?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I’m hearing you just fine. Go ahead.\n\n\n\nQ Okay, thanks. Two questions. I know the primary purpose of the visit is Abe’s funeral, but are you guys tracking any deliverables or announcements — anything that should have our antenna up?\n\n\n\nAnd the second question is about South Korea. I know much has been made about the lack of female representation in powerful positions, including in government. I know the schedule says Harris is doing, you know, a roundtable, symbolic events. Does she plan to address the issue specifically with President Yoon?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, on the first, I don’t have any deliverables to announce. What, you know, I think I signaled is that beyond the core mission of the trip to honor Prime Minister Abe’s legacy and attend the state funeral, there is opportunity to, you know, work on areas of mutual concern. And so, you know, you can call that “deliverables” if you want.\n\n\n\nBut just advancing our alliance with Japan and building on the Prime Minister’s legacy, that is delivering important results. And I mentioned, you know, we want to do that on the security side, and she’s doing the CHIPS engagement and will address other economic issues. So, in that sense, at least, I think this trip is an opportunity for to deliver for the American people and the people in the region.\n\n\n\nAs for the issue of women and gender in the ROK, yes, I mean, this event is an opportunity to address what the Vice President believes is an important issue. And I think her hearing from some of these groundbreaking female Korean leaders will be important to her and, hopefully, will highlight the issue within that country.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, without getting into details of bilateral discussions, it’s obviously an issue of importance to the Vice President, so I suspect she’ll raise it in some of her meetings as well.\n\n\n\nQ Yes. Thank you for doing this. Can you hear me?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yep, go right ahead.\n\n\n\nQ Yes. I have a question. One of the delegates is USTR Katherine Tai. Does she have any meetings — planned meetings with Japanese government officials?\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can’t speak to the USTR schedule. I suggest you check with them on that.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President is honored to have her a part of the delegation. It’s great to have a Cabinet member and an important U.S. official. But you’ll have to check with USTR about her own schedule.\n\n\n\nQ Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could provide just a little more detail about VP’s visit to South Korea, whether she has any plans to visit USFK installations at least. If not, why not? Thanks.\n\n\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can say she’ll have the opportunity to engage with troops. I don’t have anything further to announce on her schedule. But, obviously, you know her appreciation for our troops serving in both countries is immense, and she definitely wants to recognize that. But I don’t have — I don’t have further announcements about the schedule itself.\n\n\n\nMODERATOR: Okay, that’s all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, for joining.\n\n\n\nAgain, this call is on background attributed to a “senior administration official.” And I’m sorry if we didn’t get to your questions, but please reach out to the OVP Press Office and we’ll be in touch. All right, thank you all.\n\n\n\nEND 12:57 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Canada stood with the ROK through the Korean War, defending not only its people but also the international order we were building, made real in the United Nations. Since then, we have been working together to protect and strengthen democracy, security, and human rights, including the rights of women and girls, in the region and around the world. We reiterate our common objective of the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). President Yoon explained the ROK’s Audacious Initiative and Prime Minister Trudeau expressed his strong support for President Yoon’s efforts to achieve a denuclearized, peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula.\n\nOur peoples have built strong ties, too. Many Canadians and Koreans live, work, and study across their borders, creating vibrant communities, families, and businesses, becoming an essential part of our cultural fabric, and making our friendship stronger. Similarly, many of our students have lived or studied in each other’s world-class universities, creating a strong network of friends between Canada and the ROK.\n\nOur long friendship, highlighted by the establishment of the Canadian embassy in Korea in 1973 and the Korean embassy in Canada in 1965, was more recently reinforced when we established the Canada-ROK Strategic Partnership and subsequently signed the Canada-ROK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I) Cooperation Agreement. These agreements have been an important part of our lasting friendship, increasing trade and economic prosperity for both of our countries and facilitating collaboration between our most innovative researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nNow more than ever, Canada and the ROK – Canadians and Koreans – are ready to modernize our bilateral relationship and to advance, through joint action, the values that we share. Today, we are upgrading our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, based on the following five shared priorities in the areas of values, security, prosperity, sustainability, and beyond.\n\nDefending the Rules Based International System, Democracy, Freedom, Human Rights, and Gender Equality\n\nStrengthening Security and Defense Partnerships, including Peacekeeping and Maritime Security\n\nEnhancing Economic Prosperity and Security, Cooperating on Supply Chains, Critical Minerals, and ST&I, and Promoting Trade and Investment\n\nAddressing Climate Change and the Environment, Supporting Energy Security, and Developing Sustainable Energy Sources\n\nDeepening Partnerships in Health and Culture\n\nTo begin implementing our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, we are pleased to jointly welcome the creation of the new annual Canada-ROK Climate Change Dialogue, the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Defence Materials Cooperation between the ROK Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND), and the renewal of the MOU on Industrial Technology and Innovation Partnership between the Korea Institute for Advanced Technology (KIAT) and the National Research Council Canada (NRC).\n\nToday, we agreed to work towards launching a high-level dialogue on economic security involving the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry. Reflecting the increasingly important nexus between economic interests and security, we also commit to address economic security challenges through enhanced cooperation and coordination. This includes deepening our strategic partnership on supply chain resiliency. We will seek to position both countries as globally competitive players in the critical minerals supply chain and battery and EV (Electric Vehicles) value chains in ways that support our collective prosperity and security, while raising labour and environmental standards. To that end, we agreed on the need to develop an MOU in the coming months to enable the building of value chains in Canada and Korea to support clean energy transition and energy security, including with respect to critical minerals. We also agreed on the need to strengthen the bilateral Joint Committee on Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I).\n\nWe are also committed to strengthening ST&I cooperation in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), and next generation network beyond 5G) and exploring future opportunities for bilateral collaboration on AI while seeking to identify mechanisms to drive collaborative innovation for the benefit of all citizens. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring mutual economic prosperity, we commit to seeking opportunities to grow bilateral trade and investment to ensure the creation of well-paying jobs in both economies.\n\nWe note with appreciation the contributions made by our Working Holiday Program to promoting people-to-people exchanges and will continue to explore avenues for its renewal. In recognition of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Canada and the ROK, we have designated 2024-2025 as the Year of Cultural Exchanges between Canada and the ROK.\n\nDuring the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations next year, and as we strengthen cooperation through our forthcoming Indo-Pacific strategies, we look forward to working together on several important initiatives under our shared priorities to fully implement the Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\n\nExpressing his gratitude for Prime Minister Trudeau’s warm welcome and hospitality, President Yoon extended, and the Prime Minister accepted with gratitude, a sincere invitation to visit the ROK, an occasion that promises to mark yet another leap in the bilateral relations upon the 60th anniversary.",

Buzz Donnelly the strike group’s commander said in the statement. “We’re excited to return to Busan. Our presence and commitments to the Republic of Korea and the Indo-Pacific region are not new, and visits like this are part of our routine operations in the region that have helped maintain peace for more than 70 years.”\n\nThe Reagan CSG will drill with the Republic of Korea Navy next month, following the port visit, which combines both preparations and planning for the drill along with engagement activities and crew recreation. Prior to arrival in Korea, the Reagan strike group conducted drills with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyer JS Amagiri (DD-154)\n\nIn addition to Reagan, guided-missile destroyer USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is operating in the Western Pacific.\n\nZumwalt departed Guam on Monday after a scheduled port call, according to the U.S. Navy. The visit marks the farthest the destroyer ever been from its home port of Naval Base San Diego, Calif.\n\nAmphibious assault ship USS Tripoli (LHA-7) is currently in the Philippines Sea after drilling with USS America (LHA-6) on Sept. 17 while both ships were sailing in the East China Sea.\n\nForward deployed amphibious transport dock USS New Orleans (LPD-18), part of the Tripoli Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) is in the Sea of Japan with embarked elements of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).\n\nAmphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore (LSD-47) is operating around Japan having wrapped up an interoperability and beach landing exercise on Monday with JMSDF LST JS Kunisaki (LST-4003) at Numazu marine exercise area in Shizuoka Prefecture, Honshu. The exercise began on Sept. 16.\n\nOperating around the East China Sea now is the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) frigate HMCS Vancouver (FFH331) as part of Operation Neon – Canada’s contribution to a coordinated multinational effort to support United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed on North Korea. Canada’s participation includes surveillance and monitoring any ships that break the U.N. sanctions. Vancouver has been conducting the mission since mid-September and it is the sixth such deployment by the RCN since 2018. On Tuesday, Vancouver conducted a Taiwan Straits transit with USS Higgins (DDG-76).\n\nAlso this week, four Russian Navy Tarantul class corvettes were sighted sailing west through La Pérouse Strait and into the East China Sea, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said on Sept. 16.\n\nThe corvettes were identified as RFS R-14 (924), RFS R-18 (937), RFS R-11 (940) and RFS Ivanovets (954). The Russian corvettes were monitored by JMSDF fast attack craft JS Kumataka (PG-827) and a P-3C Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) of Fleet Air Wing 2 station at JMSDF Hachinohe Air Base, Honshu.\n\nIvanovets is part of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and has been sighted as part of that fleet since July this year, it is unclear if the ship had been reassigned to the Pacific Fleet or if one of the other Tarantul-class corvettes in the Russian Pacific Fleet, which operates a total of 10 of the class, has been renumbered. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been painting over the hull numbers of its ships to obscure their identities.\n\nLa Pérouse Strait is an international waterway that divides the Russian island of Sakhalin and Japan’s island of Hokkaido. The strait is routinely transited by Russian Pacific Fleet ships moving between the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk as both seas form part of the fleet operational areas. Japan monitors closely the activities of Russian and Chinese naval vessels sailing nearby.\n\nOn Wednesday, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) 42nd China Naval Escort Task Force comprising of destroyer CNS Huainan (123), frigate CNS Rizhao (598) and replenishment ship CNS Kekexilihu (968) left their homebase of Qingdao to relieve the 41st China Naval Escort Task Force, which includes destroyer CNS Suzhou (132), frigate CNS Nantong (533) and replenishment ship CNS Chaohu (890), that deployed in May this year. The PLAN has been dispatching ships to perform escort duties in the Gulf of Aden since 2008.\n\nIn Australia, a total of 16 ships, one submarine, 34 aircraft and 3000 personnel from 22 countries are carrying out the sea phase of the Royal Australian Navy led Exercise Kakadu 2022 in the waters and airspace of the Northern Australian Exercise area. The exercise is being held from Sept. 12-24 and encompassed both warfare and maritime enforcement training. Countries involved in the exercise are Australia, Brunei, Chile, Cook Islands, Fiji, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Palau, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Timor Leste, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. and Vanuatu.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy ships taking part in the exercise are destroyer HMAS Hobart (DDG39), frigate HMAS Perth (FFH157), replenishment ship HMAS Stalwart (A304) and patrol boat HMAS Broome (ACPB90), along with an RAN submarine. Fiji, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United States have each sent a ship for the exercise: Republic of Fiji Naval Forces patrol craft RFNS Savenaca (401), French Navy frigate FNS Vendémiaire (F734), Indian Navy frigate INS Satpura (F48), Indonesian Navy frigate KRI Raden Eddy Martadinata (331), JMSDF destroyer JS Kirisame (DD-104), Royal Malaysian Navy frigate KD Lekiu (FFGH30), Republic of Singapore Navy frigate RSS Steadfast (70), Royal Thai Navy frigate HTMS Bhumibol Adulyadej (FFG 471) and U.S. Navy Littoral Combat Ship USS Charleston (LCS-18).\n\nAlong with Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8 Poseidon MPAs and Hawk fighter trainers, an Indian Navy P-8I Poseidon MPA and s U.S Navy P-8 Poseidon MPA is also taking part in the exercise while the German Air Force and Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) contingents, which were in Australia for the RAAF Pitch Black exercise held from Aug.19 through Sept. 8 have stayed on to participate in Kakadu.

    "Spain & Republic of Korea Strengthen Tourism Cooperation": "Spain has announced that in the second half of 2023, it will celebrate a week of cultural activities in the Republic of Korea.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nKorea is a developing tourism market that has gone from sending around 100,000 travellers to Spain in just six years to more than 630,000 in 2019, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nDuring an official visit to Korea, the Secretary of State for Tourism, Fernando Valdés, said that Tourism and culture are among the areas of bilateral cooperation between Spain and the Republic of Korea that have evolved more in recent years.\n\n“The celebration of the Week of Spain in Korea will therefore provide us with an excellent opportunity to bring our culture and gastronomy closer to Korean society, thereby also encouraging trips to Spain from Korea,” he pointed out in this regard.\n\nIn addition, through the meeting of the Working Committee, which was chaired by Fernando Valdés and the Korean Vice Minister of Culture, Sports and Culture, Cho Yongman, it was said that both sides identified gastronomy, historical heritage and smart tourism as future areas of tourism cooperation.\n\nAt the same time, Cho Yongman also confirmed that the Republic of Korea would participate in the next edition of FITUR.\n\nMeanwhile, Valdes did not leave without mentioning Spain’s interest in increasing the air connection with Korea with direct flights. According to him, there are currently five weekly flights between Seoul and Barcelona.\n\nHowever, he added that the direct flight between Seoul and Madrid that existed before the pandemic has not yet resumed.\n\nThe Spanish ambassador to Korea, Guillermo Kirkpatrick, was also part of the Working Committee meeting, as well as the General Director of Turespaña, Miguel Sanz, and the Spanish Tourism Advisor for Japan and Korea, Jaime Alejandre. During his stay, the Secretary of State announced that he would meet with the vice presidents of Korean Air and Asiana airlines and the presidents of the main Korean travel agencies.\n\nMoreover, on September 3, Korean Air resumed operations in Spain after two and a half years, resuming the route between Seoul and Barcelona with three weekly flights and becoming the eighth European destination resumed by the company.\n\nData provided by Aviacionline through Aena Estadísticas revealed that Korean Air mobilized 187,486 passengers and 27,141.6 tons of cargo in 1,054 air operations in Spain. Such data also show that the South Korean airline has planned its return to Madrid for March 26, 2023, and is expected to recover its offer and capacity in Spain for the next summer season.",
    "DPRK lashes out against international system governed by ‘exclusive Western values’": "“The present reality urgently calls for the UN to promote more than ever before cooperation and reconciliation, and unity and solidarity among its Member States, and to discharge its righteous missions and role,” Ambassador Kim Song said.\n\nSecurity Council reform\n\nHe said the UN Security Council is not “fully discharging” its mandate to safeguard international peace, because of the “unjust and double-dealing acts” of the United States and other States following in its footsteps.\n\nThe Council “does not say even a word about the high-handedness and arbitrariness, reckless arms build-up and war crimes of the US, but picks a quarrel with his country at every chance in its righteous efforts to bolster national self-defence capabilities”.\n\nMr. Song argued that the 15-nation body has lost international confidence and is in urgent need of reform.\n\nTo put an end to the arrogance of specific countries including the US and restore confidence, he advised that “urgent priority should be given to the expansion and strengthening of the representation of developing countries, which account for the absolute majority of the UN membership”.\n\nKorean peninsula security\n\nTurning to regional security, the Ambassador maintained that the Korean peninsula is caught in “a vicious cycle of tension and confrontation due to the increasing hostility of the US” and its forces against the North.\n\nNoting that “it is heading into a much more dangerous phase,” he drew attention to US President Joe Biden’s address to the Assembly in which “he picked on us saying that despite their ‘efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy,’ the DPRK continues to blatantly violate UN ‘sanctions’”.\n\n“To put it clearly, we have never recognized such ‘resolutions’ of the UN that impose pressure because we do not abide by its ‘rules’ made by the US unilaterally,” said the Ambassador, stressing that his country never would.\n\nHe observed that even though several countries in the world possess nuclear weapons, only the DPRK has been “subjected to the most brigandish and brutal” sanctions resolutions.\n\n“This is because the UN connived at and allowed the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the US antagonizing the independent DPRK with an absurd reason that it differs in its ideas and systems and opposes its unjust policy,” said Mr. Song.\n\nAgainst the backdrop that the US is planning to conduct joint military exercises in the region, he described it as “an extremely dangerous act of igniting the fuse to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war”.\n\n“The United States should clearly understand that its heinous and hostile policy against the DPRK over the past 30 years had just brought about today’s reality and ask and answer itself and ponder over how far it would prolong this situation in the future,\" he added.\n\nForeign policy stand\n\nIn closing, the Ambassador upheld the DPRK’s foreign policy stance to maintain independence, peace and friendship.\n\nHe pledged broad cooperation with all countries and nations that “oppose and reject aggression and interference, domination and subordination” and to develop “multifaceted exchanges and cooperation even with the capitalist countries that respect our country and take friendly attitude to it”.\n\n“The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea sets great store by sovereign equality and international justice…and it will fulfil its responsibilities and role in ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula”.",
    "North Korea, China resume freight train services: reports": "Reported resumption of cross-border trains comes after services were suspended in April due to an outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nNorth Korea and China have resumed freight train services after a five-month suspension due to the pandemic, South Korean media has reported.\n\nA freight train travelled from the Chinese border city of Dandong to North Korea’s Sinuiju, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported on Monday.\n\nTrains had been suspended since April 29, after an outbreak of COVID-19 in Dandong.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the train that crossed the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge on Monday marked the resumption of regular services, but Yonhap news agency quoted an anonymous source in China as saying trains would run one or two times a day.\n\nChina is North Korea’s main economic lifeline, normally accounting for more than 90 percent of its trade, but cross-border commerce has been sharply curtailed during the pandemic.\n\nChina’s trade with North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), plunged to $318m in 2021, down 90 percent compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to Chinese customs data.\n\nAid workers and analysts have warned that the country’s isolation has hammered its already fragile economy and exacerbated food shortages that have resulted in widespread chronic malnutrition.\n\nNorth Korea’s economy shrank an estimated 0.1 percent last year, according to South Korea’s central bank, following a 4.5 percent decline in 2020.\n\nAlastair Morgan, the United Kingdom’s ambassador to North Korea between 2005 and 2008, said the significance of the latest freight train service would depend on whether it marked the beginning of regular operations.\n\n“A one-off shipment of, for example, medical goods and equipment or food would not be unprecedented,” Morgan told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The resumption of regular freight shipments could be expected to support economic activity and availability of goods in the DPRK. The economic implications for China at a national level would be negligible. China in principle supports trade with the DPRK in non-sanctioned goods and favours the maintenance of stability in DPRK.”\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un last month declared victory over the coronavirus, after authorities in the isolated country had reported about 4.8 million “fever cases” following an extensive outbreak in May. Kim, the third member of his family to rule the secretive state, has nonetheless acknowledged the hardships facing North Koreans, likening the pandemic to the 1950-1953 Korean War.\n\nThe North has reported just 74 COVID-19 deaths overall, a record doubted by experts given the country’s apparent caseload, lack of vaccine coverage and dilapidated health system.",
    "Media Statement by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea": "SEOUL (2 September 2022) - The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Elizabeth Salmón, conducted her first official visit to the Republic of Korea from 29 August to 3 September 2022.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI am very pleased to be here in the Republic of Korea. I assumed the mandate on 1 August and have already had the opportunity to visit the Republic of Korea in the same month. I thank the government of the Republic of Korea for accepting my visit so soon after I have taken up the mandate. Also, I would like to thank all the escapees, victims, families of victims, civil society organizations and state institutions who have talked so openly and frankly with me during this visit.\n\nThis was my first time to visit the Republic of Korea, which I take to be an advantage as I come to this mandate with fresh eyes and fresh perspectives.\n\nMy priority on this visit has been to listen to my interlocutors which, most importantly, has included some of the victims of human rights violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and escapees from the DPRK. It is a priority of mine to meet with, speak to and learn from these victims. I will assume a victims-centred approach throughout the course of my mandate. In the past decades, we have learned that it is the victims of human rights violations that must be the focus of any human rights or humanitarian endeavour. The legitimacy and effectiveness of our work rests on this. For my mandate, this will include providing more opportunities for the voices of victims to be heard. I am particularly determined to bring more attention to the experiences of women and girls, to improve understanding of their specific needs, and to better appreciate the adversities they face in the DRPK.\n\nMEETINGS AND ISSUES DISCUSSSED\n\nRecent escapees\n\nI had the opportunity to meet with female escapees from the DPRK who have recently arrived in the Republic of Korea. These women bravely shared their stories with me, and I will use my position as Special Rapporteur to amplify their voices. The two women I talked with, who had courageously embarked on the long and dangerous journey to South Korea, came from very different backgrounds and had very different experiences. But what they both shared was their common desire to experience freedom. This really struck me.\n\nVictims and CSOs\n\nDuring my visit to the ROK, I have been impressed by the active and dynamic civil society that is working to bring improvements to the situation of human rights in the DPRK. This includes escapees, the family members of victims and a range of civil society organizations. They have helped to provide me with a panoramic view of the human rights issues in the DPRK – including the issues of South Koreans abducted by North Korea during and after the Korean War, South Korean prisoners of war during the Vietnam War who were later taken to DPRK, prisoners of war of the Korean War and their families remaining in the DPRK, and the ongoing pain of separated families. Other issues raised have concerned accountability and justice for victims, the campaign for peace between the two Koreas, access to food, the provision of humanitarian assistance, North Koreans’ lack of access to information, the practice of forced labour, and COVID-19 and the country’s quarantine measures. I have also learnt more about the issue of escapees detained in China, and those who were forcibly repatriated to the DPRK, as well as the issue of support for the resettlement and the integration of North Korean escapees in the Republic of Korea. The civil society organisations in the ROK are working on a wide range of issues. This is a good demonstration of the commitment of civil society working here. I was also encouraged to hear from the CSOs that, in the absence of any access to the DPRK, they are exploring creative ways including the use of technologies to reach out to the people of the DPRK and to monitor and document human rights violations there.\n\nGovernment Institutions\n\nDuring my meetings, I was encouraged by the commitment of high-level government officials to seek improvements to the human rights situation in the DPRK, as well as to explore ways of providing humanitarian assistance. I also discussed with the government how to utilize the information that they gather from escapees to raise awareness and to ensure future accountability.\n\nHuman Rights Concerns\n\nI am at the beginning of my term, and am not yet in a position to present any detailed human rights analysis of the situation in the DPRK. As I alluded to at the beginning of my statement, I am currently in listening mode. I come to the mandate with no preconceptions; just with the determination to use this position to push in every way I can for progress in improving the situation of human rights in the DPRK. I am collecting and digesting information and establishing important personal contacts with people who will assist me throughout my time on this mandate. This network of contacts will grow, and I hope that it will grow to include DPRK government representatives – whether that be directly engaging with me or whether it be through me assisting engagement with others.\n\nIt is also important to stress at this moment the lack of information that is coming out of the country. Almost all of the actors I met with said they do not have access to any updated information on what the current situation of human rights is in the DPRK. The current isolation of the DPRK and the lack of information coming out is one of the biggest challenges I will have to address in carrying out my mandate.\n\nFood and health\n\nHaving said that, some of the information on the current situation that I have received has been alarming. I have received information indicating a strong possibility of starvation among the most vulnerable populations. One of the recent escapees told me that the price of products had gone up by 6-7 times by early 2021, and that rice from the military reserve had been released to soldiers. With the prolonged shutdown of the border, I am worried about what is happening to the 40 percent of the population who were already food insecure before the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nI am also concerned about people’s access to health since the COVID-19 outbreak. I heard from experts that the health system would struggle to cope with a large number of patients. I am also concerned about the lack of medicine available because of the prolonged border closure. I heard that the DPRK is interested in receiving vaccinations, but that this will also require capacity development including in the cold chain and securing a reliable supply of electricity.\n\nWomen and girls\n\nI am very concerned about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 measures on women and girls. In the DPRK, I learned that every institution, including women’s associations and schools, is given a quota to fulfil, which women and children have to contribute to by providing material and labour. Many children were suffering from malnutrition and stunted growth even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Women must also be under further pressures during the COVID pandemic as market activities, which the women relied on for their living, were greatly reduced due to the prolonged closure of the borders since January 2020. With no alternative source of income, they are still required to feed their family, look after sick family members – including potentially those with COVID-19 – while also providing contributions to the State.\n\nSeparated families\n\nHere in the Republic of Korea, I have listened to the sufferings of separated family members. Securing the reunion of separated families should be the priority for both governments in the North and South, regardless of their political relationship. I urge the DPRK to engage with the ROK on resuming reunions, online or offline.\n\nThis pain of separation from family is also experienced by escapees from the DPRK now living in the ROK. One young escapee shared with me how much she is missing her parents left behind in North Korea.\n\nI have also received information that some escapees’ families who were left behind in the DPRK have been relocated from border areas to further inland and have been put under harsher surveillance.\n\nWay forward\n\nI will continue to gather all available information and data and report to the international community to give visibility to the North Korean people’s sufferings. My first short report will be presented to the General Assembly in New York in late October.\n\nAccountability for ongoing and past human rights violations in and by the DPRK remains critical to human rights improvement and ensuring justice in the DPRK. I will continue to engage with all stakeholders including governments, CSOs, victims and other groups to explore possible avenues, both judicial and non-judicial, to pursue accountability and guarantee the rights of victims.\n\nI will also try to seek engagement opportunities with the DPRK authorities through concrete issues such as women and girls’ rights. During the mission, I was encouraged to hear about small changes that the DPRK’s engagement with the UN human rights mechanisms and the international community have brought about. North Korea will not suddenly open up to the external world. I am also fully aware that the DPRK Government opposes country-specific human rights mandates including my mandate. However, that does not mean that we should not try. I hope the Government will revisit its policy and engage with my mandate. There will be windows of opportunity to engage and to make small steps. We should not give up on engagement with the DPRK because what is at stake are the lives of the North Korean people and their human rights.",

    "Thales pitching PathMaster to Republic of Korea Navy": "Thales pitching PathMaster to Republic of Korea Navy Thales pitched the PathMaster unmanned mine counter measure (MCM) system to the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) and other international customers at DX Korea 2022, the defense exhibition currently being held in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe PathMaster unmanned MCM can detect, localize, and neutralize naval mines.\n\nIn an interview with Naval News, Mathew Hunt, product line director for PathMaster MCM, explained the advantages that the system can bring to anti-mine operations.\n\n“We can take care of mines without putting divers in harm’s way. Firstly, the synthetic aperture sonar, deployed from an unmanned surface vehicle scans its surroundings. Artificial intelligence then uses these images to detect any irregularities that may indicate the presence of a mine and identifies it. After this, the information is almost instantaneously sent to human operators who make the final call. Once a decision to neutralize the mine has been reached, an unmanned underwater vehicle is deployed to take care of the mine.” – PathMaster Product Line Director Mathew Hunt\n\nPathMaster display on Thales booth at DX Korea 2022.\n\nAccording to Hunt, the system is four times more effective than legacy systems. Moreover, the system as designed for the French Navy can scan while sailing at between 8 and 11 knots, significantly faster than other MCM platforms. However, Hunt said the PathMaster can be tailored for the customer, with the MCM system itself capable of being integrated into other unmanned surface vehicles. This means that the exact specifications can be changed.\n\nHunt also expressed his views about the prospect of export to South Korea.\n\n“Purchasing the PathMaster is a logical ‘next step’ for the ROKN. So far we have seen the ROKN invest on the platform level, developing unmanned vehicles for military uses. However, the ROKN has not yet acquired a system like the PathMaster which builds an entire system around an unmanned vehicle. It is likely they will move in that direction very soon.”\n\nPathMaster Product Line Director Mathew Hunt\n\nProduct Line Director Mathew Hunt pitching the PathMaster during DX Korea 2022.\n\nThe ROKN has yet to issue a request for an advanced unmanned MCM system like the PathMaster. According to Hunt, however, the ROKN has already shown interest.\n\n“A ROKN officer in charge of mine warfare expressed interest in our system following our pitch. He told us that the ROKN is currently in the process of developing the concept of operations for this type of platform.”\n\nPathMaster Product Line Director Mathew Hunt\n\nHunt also claims that any country that acquires the PathMaster system, including South Korea, will play a major role in the production and maintenance of the system.\n\n“We would love to work on this platform with any Korean companies. Since the onset of COVID-19, we’ve seen countries put a greater emphasis on local production. If South Korea does purchase the PathMaster, it will most likely be involved in the system itself. This may take the form of technology transfers or production and maintenance on a local level. For example, if South Korea purchases this platform, rather than send it all the way to us for maintenance, a local company could do the job instead. Just today, we signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s SonarTech. This means that cooperation with SonarTech will be likely if the ROKN purchases the PathMaster.”\n\nPathMaster Product Line Director Mathew Hunt\n\nIn 2021, Naval News visited the Thales site in Brest and interviewed Thales MCM Chief Engineer Guy Le Bihan.

However, KAI said it would be able to produce the KF-21N in a few years if the need was felt.\n\n“The KF-21N would require wings that are 20% larger than those on the KF-21 to ensure safety and stabilization of the aircraft when taking off and landing on an aircraft carrier. The KF-21N would also require developing and integrating a catapult system and other structural changes,” said a KAI official.\n\nThe Defense Ministry formalized the CVX proposal to create a light aircraft carrier in February 2021. The defense ministry first proposed building a 30,000-ton light aircraft carrier with more than 400 crew members, sparking discussion about whether South Korea needs such a pricey vessel for operations at sea.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea reportedly abandoned its plans for an aircraft carrier. The projected 2023 defense budget for South Korea does not include funds for the CVX project. On September 2, 2022, the proposed budget was delivered to the National Assembly, as previously reported by EurAsian Times.\n\nAt the time, the decision to scrap the ambitious program was attributed to a shift in strategy brought on by North Korea’s increased aggression.\n\nExperts, however, argued that it has more to do with the expanding scope of the carrier’s design and rising cost, which the budget might not have covered.\n\nHowever, considering the enthusiasm with which the naval variant of the KF-21 was displayed, the aircraft carrier program is back in focus and might not have been permanently abandoned.\n\nIn a separate yet related development, General Kim Seung-kyum, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Republic of Korea, stated on September 19 that if a carrier-capable fighter is developed domestically, the military will explore obtaining an aircraft carrier that is larger than the existing CVX design.\n\nSouth Korea’s Carrier-Borne Fighter Jet\n\nThe aerospace company emphasized that the KF-21N is only a concept designed to show that a naval variant of the KF-21 may be developed. The features and capabilities of the maritime fighter are essentially the same as its air variant.\n\nA distinguishing feature, however, is that the aircraft would have foldable wings and may be modified for aircraft carriers that support either short takeoff but arrested recovery (STOBAR) or catapult-aided takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR).\n\nAdditionally, hypersonic long-range air-to-surface missiles, reportedly under development by South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, were integrated into the KF-21 model on exhibit at the DX Korea (ADD). At the time of publication, KAI had not released any information regarding the missiles.\n\nKF-21N will be powered by the same US-made F414-GE-400K twin engine from the KF-21 with a top speed of Mach 1.6 and a maximum takeoff weight of 25,600 kilograms. The KF-21 will eventually replace F-16Us in the South Korean air fleet. It is bigger than the F-35 and may have better capabilities than the most recent F-16V.\n\nThe KF-21 Boramae (Hawk), which is designed as a “4.5+” gen fighter and is supposed to be one of the most capable in its class with its “stealthy” low-Radar Cross Section design, completed its first flight on July 19, 2022.\n\nAccording to some reports, South Korea could develop a larger aircraft based on the KF-21 platform called the KF-XX. Earlier, the South Korean government considered buying the F-35B fighter jet operating aboard aircraft carriers by navies like the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, the axing of the CVX program has pulled the plug on those plans. In July, South Korea’s decision to purchase 20 new F-35A Block 4 Lightning II stealth fighters first raised questions about the future of the South Korean aircraft program.\n\nEven though the CVX represented South Korea’s Blue Water Navy goals, it hasn’t taken off due to security objectives and guard coverage changes.",
    "North Korea Fires Short-range Ballistic Missile Toward Its East Coast": "Advertisement\n\nNorth Korea fired one short-range ballistic missile toward its east coast on Sunday, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. Launched from the Taecheon area in North Pyongan province at 6:53 a.m. KST, the missile flew about 600 km with a max altitude of 60 km.\n\n“North Korea’s ballistic missile test is a grave provocation threatening the peace and security of not only the Korean Peninsula but also the international community,” the South Korean military said. It added that the North’s ballistic missile test is “a clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions” while urging the North to immediately halt such missile tests.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Security Council also called the North’s Sunday missile test “an act of provocation,” adding that the test cannot be justified with any reasons.\n\nIn a released statement, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said “the missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.” (DPRK is an acronym of North Korea’s official name: Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.)\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nNorth Korea’s state-controlled media have not published any statements or reports on its suspected KN-23 missile test on Monday. Previously, North Korean media had reported details on the capabilities and type of the missiles a day after each launch. However, it has not reported on its missile tests for months, perhaps in a bid to normalize the launches as ordinary planned drills for self-defense.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nBased on information on the performance of the missile provided by the South Korean military, North Korea might have tested its KN-23 Iskander-class ballistic missile. Some experts also noted that the tested missile appeared to have conducted a “pull-up” maneuver in flight.\n\nSunday’s missile test is the first ballistic missile test since June 5, when North Korea tested eight ballistic missiles. Its previous missile test occurred on August 17 when it fired two cruise missiles toward the Yellow Sea.\n\nSouth Korea and the United States kicked off joint military drills involving the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan on Monday on the eastern coast of the South. North Korea’s missile test on Sunday appeared to be what Pyongyang would call “a corresponding measure” to one of the “hostile policies” it has demanded Washington to withdraw. The drills are scheduled to be last from September 26 to 29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un codified a new law on the use of nuclear weapons. Rather than sticking with defining his nuclear arsenal as a means for “self-defense,” Kim has authorized the use of nuclear weapons as “preemptive measures” under certain conditions. Kim also declared that his country’s status as “a nuclear weapons state” has become “irreversible” under the new law.\n\nWe should expect North Korea to strategically respond to Seoul and Washington’s military activities while remaining silent over their offers of dialogue. However, at the moment Pyongyang may be under pressure from its main ally, China, not to disrupt the piece ahead of China’s most important political event – the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party – in mid-October. After the Party Congress concludes, Pyongyang may resume testing its most advanced ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to show off its nuclear and missile capabilities against the extended deterrence strategy of the U.S. and South Korea.",

    "Joint Media Release of Australia, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and the United States on the Occasion of the APEC Women and the Economy High-Level Policy Dialogue, 7 September 202": "We express our unwavering support for APEC and our deep appreciation to Thailand, as APEC Chair and PPWE Co-Chair in 2022, for delivering a successful host year.\n\nWe commend Thailand’s leadership in hosting the 2022 APEC Women and the Economy Forum. We are united in our resolve to ensure peace and stability in our region and to uphold international law, recognizing these are preconditions for the well-being, dignity, and economic empowerment of women, which are key APEC goals. As we strive for inclusive and sustainable economic growth that advances gender equality, we therefore reaffirm APEC Leaders’ commitment in the Putrajaya Vision 2040 to an ‘open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific community.’ We express our grave concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation, including credible reports of gender-based violence perpetrated by Russia’s forces against women, men, and children in Ukraine. It has been more than six months since Russia launched its brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We are also deeply concerned about the impacts of the conflict on women and girls in vulnerable situations worldwide, including those in the Asia-Pacific region, who are negatively impacted by the threat of food insecurity and energy scarcity in the world caused in part by Russia’s actions, which further destabilized the global economy and global supply chains, as well as undermined our ability to recover from COVID-19.\n\nWe express our concern regarding the conflict that threatens the well-being and safety of women in Ukraine, curtailing their ability to pursue full and meaningful economic participation. The displacement and the humanitarian need of Ukrainian women and children has been overwhelming; the global response to Russia’s aggression and atrocities will be the measure of our commitment towards preserving our shared vision of a sustainable and inclusive economy for women in all their diversity. We affirm our commitment to all women’s and girls’ health and well-being, including their sexual and reproductive health and rights, and to the success of our economies. We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. We strongly urge Russia to immediately cease its use of force and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from Ukrainian territory, consistent with the legally binding decision of the International Court of Justice [16 March].",

    "UK Armed Forces kick off major series of exercises in the Indo-Pacific": "The RAF has started a series of exercises that will see the UK Armed Forces training with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and other Indo-Pacific nations, until December.\n\nFour Typhoon fighters and one Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft from the RAF joined Exercise Pitch Black in Darwin, Australia. It was the first time the RAF had taken part in the exercise since the pandemic, with around 100 aircraft and 2,500 personnel from 17 countries participating in large-scale, complex training missions.\n\nThe RAF Typhoons flew by day and night as part of large multi-national formations of aircraft over one of the largest air training areas in the world. Pilots operated in both the air-air and air-ground role, often in the same sorties, both as attacking and defending forces. Each exercise mission was supported by a Voyager air-air refuelling tanker which provided fuel to jets from a number of participating nations.\n\nThe RAF’s contribution to Exercise Pitch Black is a tangible demonstration of UK air power and highlights the UK’s ability to deploy rapidly at long range. It also illustrates the UK’s desire to enhance international military relationships for the safe and effective conduct of air operations with partner nations. As part of this aim, the Typhoon fighters flew back to the UK via Malaysia and India to conduct further defence engagement activity.\n\nThe Royal Navy, meanwhile, celebrates one year of permanent presence in the Pacific, following the departure of HMS Spey and HMS Tamar from Portsmouth. In the year since they left, the vessels have sailed 40,000 nautical miles each and collectively visited 17 nations and British Overseas Territories.\n\nThe two UK warships are deployed to the Indo-Asia-Pacific as part of the UK’s tilt towards the region. HMS Spey has just completed participation in the largest military exercise in northern Australia this year, Kakadu 22, while HMS Tamar will host teams from the US Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy for a large-scale mine warfare exercise off the Republic of Korea. These teams will operate Remus autonomous underwater vehicles from the ship.\n\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said:\n\nSecurity and stability throughout the Indo-Pacific remains paramount, and with the Pitch Black exercises and the persistent presence of the Royal Navy in the Pacific, we are able to demonstrate our commitment and shared responsibility across the region and further strengthen our close ties with friends and allies.\n\nThe UK Government has identified the Indo-Pacific region as being critical to the UK’s economy, its security, and its global ambition to support open societies. The RAF’s participation in the exercise is deepening engagement in the region in support of shared prosperity and regional stability.\n\nMeanwhile, the deployment of HMS Tamar and HMS Spey has seen the Royal Navy enforce a UN embargo against North Korea; deliver aid to Tonga in the wake of a tsunami and take part in numerous regional exercises from large-scale military workouts, through to the principal humanitarian support mission, Pacific Partnership, which ended last month. This saw HMS Tamar involved in community projects in Palau and Commando engineers build a school in the Philippines.\n\nOctober will see the UK commence further exercises with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other Indo-Asia-Pacific nations. These will include Exercise Vigilant Isles and Exercise Puk Puk, both land-based exercises. Exercise Vigilant Isles will see personnel from 1 Regiment Royal Horse Artillery deploy to Japan to conduct Ground Based Surveillance training. Meanwhile, Exercise Puk Puk will enable UK Royal Engineers to hone their tactical skills by supporting Australian Army Engineers conducting construction activities in Papua New Guinea.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister of Australia, Richard Marles said:\n\nThese exercises demonstrate Australia’s longstanding commitment to deepening cooperation in the region. They reflect the high value we place on regional stability, shared security and fostering closer ties throughout the Indo-Pacific. Australia and the United Kingdom share these values and continue to advance their cause.\n\nThese exercises follow the recent visit of Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles to Barrow-in-Furness, where he attended the commissioning of the fifth of seven new Astute-Class Royal Navy submarines, HMS Anson, alongside other bilateral engagements.",

    "Governor Ducey Travels to Taiwan, Republic of Korea To Further Strong Relationships": "Trip Focuses On Semiconductors, Technology, Security, Education\n\nTAIPEI, TAIWAN — Governor Doug Ducey arrived Tuesday in Taipei for a five-day trade mission to Taiwan and the Republic of Korea with a focus on strengthening Arizona’s well-established partnerships with the two Asian partners.\n\nThe governor’s packed itinerary includes meetings with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials as well as discussions with the leaders of high-tech manufacturing companies. The governor also will deliver a keynote address to a gathering of American and Taiwanese business leaders.\n\nFollowing the address, the governor will facilitate the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the State of Arizona and the Taiwan Ministry of Education. The MOU, which is signed by the Arizona Board of Regents and its counterpart in Taiwan, promotes collaboration in higher education as well as workforce training.\n\n“Arizona has excellent relationships with Taiwan and the Republic of Korea,” said Governor Ducey. “The goal of this trade mission is to take these relationships to the next level - to strengthen them, expand them and ensure they remain mutually beneficial.”\n\nLast year, bilateral trade totaled $1.92 billion between Arizona and Taiwan and $882 million between Arizona and the Republic of Korea. Governor Ducey first visited Taiwan 17 years ago. This is his first trip to the Republic of Korea.\n\n“Arizona enjoys strong economic partnerships rooted in sectors such as technology and manufacturing – specifically within the semiconductor industry,” Governor Ducey said. “It is a privilege to once again be in Taiwan and visit our partners in the Republic of Korea to reaffirm our shared values and strengths. We look forward to building on the many opportunities ahead.”\n\nJoining the governor will be President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority Sandra Watson and President of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry Danny Seiden.\n\nThe governor will also discuss Arizona’s strong relationship with Taiwan Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu Jau-shieh and U.S. Ambassador Philip Seth Goldberg.\n\nUnder Governor Ducey’s leadership, Arizona emerged as a global advanced manufacturing epicenter, including in areas such as semiconductors, batteries and electric vehicles. Partnerships with Taiwan and the Republic of Korea have been central to that success.\n\nArizona’s budget this year included legislation establishing the state’s first foreign trade offices in Taiwan and the Republic of Korea. The offices will launch later this year.\n\nArizona’s dynamic business ecosystem combined with Taiwan’s and the Republic of Korea’s innovative industries is a sure recipe for success.\n\nTSMC’s landmark $12 billion investment – dubbed the “deal of the decade” – to build a semiconductor fab in Phoenix has opened new opportunities for collaboration in workforce training and higher education. Upwards of 750 Arizona employees for the new fab have already begun training overseas in Taiwan.\n\nWith construction complete on TSMC’s outer facility, the advanced manufacturing fab is on track to begin chip production by 2024. TSMC’s investment has attracted a host of Taiwan-based suppliers to also expand in Arizona. To date, announced supplier investments already total more than $1 billion.\n\nRepublic of Korea-based LG Energy Solution announced an initial investment of $1.4 billion in April to build its first ever cylindrical-type battery facility in North America, creating thousands of jobs.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nArizona and Taiwan have a relationship that spans decades.\n\nFor more than 25 years, Taiwan pilots flying the F-16 fighter jet have trained at Luke Air Force Base west of Phoenix.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, as Arizona experienced its early surge of cases, Taiwan was quick to step up to help. The Taiwan Government generously donated over 200,000 surgical and N-95 masks. TSMC also offered nearly 430,000 pieces of PPE including masks, face shields, goggles, and surgical gowns.\n\nArizona in recent years has become “semiconductor central.” The state has more than 205 semiconductor manufacturing establishments in Arizona, including these industry titans and other leaders like: Qualcomm, NXP, Microchip, ON Semiconductor, Benchmark Electronics and more.\n\nThese companies have helped create more than 23,000 manufacturing jobs. Business Facilities Magazine ranks Arizona the #3 state in the country for semiconductors.\n\n###",
    "Liberia: Liberian Officials Held for Rape in Korea Claim Being Framed, But Govt Vows to Cooperate with Investigations": "Liberia: Liberian Officials Held for Rape in Korea Claim Being Framed, But Govt Vows to Cooperate with Investigations\n\nMONROVIA – Moses Owen Browne, the Liberian official who is being held in South Korea along with his colleague, Daniel Tarr, for alleged rape says they were both framed by the alleged victims and he believes the allegation is an act of racism.\n\nReport by Lennart Dodoo, [email protected]\n\nBrowne is Liberia’s Permanent Representative to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) based in the UK while Tarr is the Director of the Department of Marine Environmental Protection. The pair had travelled to Busan, South Korea to attend the GHG SMART Practical Training and Study Visitwhich ran from September 19-23.\n\nThey were both taken into police custody on Friday after the alleged victims claimed they are teenagers called the police from the two officials’ hotel room that they had been raped.\n\nNews Agencies in Korea say the alleged victims informed authorities that they are 14 and 16 years old, however, FrontPageAfrica gathered they had told the Liberian officials that they are 21 and 26 years old.\n\nInformation gathered by FrontPageAfrica says the two officials met the alleged rape survivors at the mall when they (the girls) walked up to them and offered to help them find their way about at the mall and assist them in buying a mobile phone at a reasonable price.\n\nThereafter, the girls reportedly asked them out for a drink, followed them to their hotel where they had some drinks, and smoked outside the hotel room.\n\nFrontPageAfrica further gathered that after spending some time with them in their hotel room, they allegedly offered to spend the night and then called their friends to bring them some clothes for a change.\n\nHours later, the officials heard a strong bang on their door while the girls were inside.\n\nBrowne told FrontPageAfrica via a WhatsApp call that prior to the arrival of the police, there was a heavy bang on their door and when he spied through the peephole, he observed four strong men wearing black – a sight he said instilled fear in them and therefore, decided not to open the door.\n\nHe said the hotel’s receptionist hang up on him when he called to inform them of the heavy bang on the door. According to him, there was a second bang a few minutes later so he called other Maritime officials attending the conference who confirmed to him that it was the police banging on their door. It was when he gained the confidence to open the door.\n\nHe said when they opened the door, they heard the girls saying “These are the monkeys who raped us”.\n\nHe said they communicated with the girl via a translation app on their mobile phones.\n\nMeanwhile, the pair are yet to be formally charged. A Korean judge has taken statements from them to determine probable cause for a formal rape charge against them and the need for detention. If no probable cause is found, they will be released from police custody and allowed to leave the country immediately.\n\nNot A First Timer?\n\nFollowing the report of Browne’s alleged involvement with rape, Ne-Suah Livingstone posted to Facebook, “Money can’t leave his black palm behind. He raped a child that lived with him in 2018”.\n\nFrontPageAfrica could not independently confirm this allegation. However, Smart News Liberia reported that had a rape record prior to his appointment by the President of Liberia to the International Maritime organization.\n\n“We ran after an alleged rape case involving this same Moses Owen Brown as the accused perpetrator and the little girl who used to live with him and his wife. While running about, seeking justice for the survivor, Moses Owen Brown and his wife moved out of their Airfield residence, when we looked, he was given a job by the Liberian Government out of this country, leaving the case hanging!!! Monkey can’t leave its black hands behind!!!” Smart News Liberia quoted the child right advocate as saying.\n\nLiMA’s Full Cooperation\n\nThe Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA) has described the allegation against its officials as grave and says it maintains a zero-tolerance stance on any and all types of sexual and gender-based offenses, and views these allegations of the conduct of its Officials as most egregious, having no place in any civilized society.\n\n“Liberia Maritime Authority will fully cooperate with the Government of the Republic of South Korea in the investigation of this incident and vows to take appropriate actions, pursuant to national and international Law,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MGCSP) has welcomed a statement from the Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA) affirming its’ full cooperation with the Government of the Republic of South Korea on allegations of rape of minors by two Liberian government officials.\n\nCondemned by Gender Ministry\n\nThe Ministry says it finds the allegations of rape disturbing, distressing, and a matter that goes completely against the mores of Liberia’s commitment to fighting the scourge of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nAccording to the Ministry, Liberia has a Presidential declaration on rape as a national emergency. As such, it condemns these alleged sexual misbehaving acts by government agents and considers same as unacceptable and inexcusable.\n\nThe Ministry: “If confirmed, this will have the propensity to further undermine Liberia’s fight against rape and poses a setback in achieving Goal 5 of the Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which highlights the urgent need to ending violence and exploitation of women and girls.\n\n“Gender Ministry calls on the Liberia Maritime Authority to where applicable, immediately recall these Officials, and if found guilty, LiMA should not hesitate in taking appropriate actions against them, including dismissal and the pursuance of sentencing, as is allowed under the laws and jurisdictions of both South Korea and Liberia.\n\n“MGCSP admonishes all government officials and the Liberian populace at large, to be circumspect in daily interactions at home or abroad, and to continue to join hands with GoL in the fight against Sexual and Gender-based Violence.”\n\nPres. Weah – A Feminist-in-Chief\n\nThe rape allegation against the Liberian officials comes at the heels of President George Weah’s reiteration to world leaders that he is Liberia’s Feminist-in-Chief.\n\nPresident Weah told the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly last Thursday that his government is working assiduously to end harmful traditional practices against women while at the same time making gender equality a top priority of his administration.\n\nPres. Weah said: “To this end, we have developed the legal framework; including the ratification of regional and international instruments to address gender inequalities which are being carried out as a result of socio-cultural perceptions, practices, and stereotypes that support male dominance and the subordination of women.\n\n“I would like to inform you that my government, together with UN partners, is implementing the EU Spotlight Initiative to end violence and harmful traditional practices against women and girls, and promote their sexual and reproductive health and rights.”",

    "Official Website for the Governor of Maryland": "Signs Memorandum of Understanding to Support Continued Growth of Innovative Start-ups​​\n\nUNDBIO Commits to New U.S. R&D Headquarters in Rockville, Bringing More Biotech Jobs to Maryland\n\nState to Open New Foreign Trade Office in South Korea\n\nANNAPOLIS, MD—Governor Larry Hogan today continued his trade and economic development mission to Asia, meeting with the president of the Republic of Korea and making a series of major announcements to expand the strong partnership between Maryland and Korea.\n\nMeeting With Korean President. Governor Hogan met with President Yoon Suk-yeol at the presidential office in Seoul to discuss cooperation between the State of Maryland and the Republic of Korea, as well as ways to expand Korean business investment in the state. The two leaders also discussed the impact that the federal Inflation Reduction Act will have on the electric vehicle industry.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding to Support Innovative Start-ups. The governor and First Lady Yumi Hogan joined the chairman of the Korea Venture Business Association (KOVA), Kang Sam Kwon, to sign and witness a new memorandum of understanding to support Korean start-up ventures specializing in green and high-tech fields that are interested in entering the U.S. market. This could include having KOVA member companies participate in the Maryland Global Gateway initiative, which offers opportunities for international companies to make a “soft landing” at business incubators across the state. Industry sectors highlighted for support include the life sciences, information and communications technology, cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, aerospace, renewable energy, and “blue tech,” which supports the maritime industry.\n\n“This new agreement with KOVA strengthens Maryland’s partnership with the Republic of Korea, a partnership which I’m proud to say has grown and flourished during my time as governor,” said Governor Hogan. “This will benefit innovative industry sectors in both our regions, and we look forward to helping KOVA members expand to the United States.”\n\n“Supporting the global expansion of venture companies is a key goal for Korea, which is home to many innovative start-ups,” said Chairman Kang. “We hope that Korean venture companies will be able to lead global innovation in new industries through exchanges with Maryland and contribute to economic growth in both countries.”\n\nNew Foreign Trade Office In South Korea. At a business reception in Seoul, Governor Hogan announced that the Maryland Department of Commerce will open a new foreign trade office in South Korea. The Seoul office joins Maryland’s network of existing trade offices in Africa, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n\nUNDBIO to Open New U.S. R&D Headquarters in Maryland.

    "Republic of Korea provides US$1 million to WFP’s resilience-building efforts in Iraq [EN/AR] - Iraq": "Baghdad, 12 September 2022 - – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed a contribution of US$1 million from the Government of the Republic of Korea, which will support the implementation of resilience-building activities aiming at improving sustainable agricultural production in areas affected by salinity in southern Iraq.\n\nThis grant will support in restoring the agricultural-based livelihoods of nearly 4,000 smallholder farmers and their families through measures that help communities adapt to water and soil salinity in addition to focusing on climate-smart agricultural practices such as solar-powered water pumps and hydroponics, to withstand the adverse effects of climate change and build their food security.\n\n“The government of the Republic of Korea has been committed to supporting Iraq and its people over the past decades,” said Mr. Sung-soo Choi, the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Iraq. “It is my great pleasure to partner with WFP, which has the expertise to provide well-targeted assistance to the southern parts of Iraq, where our companies are also contributing to the community by building key infrastructures.\"\n\nIraq is the world’s fifth most affected country by climate change. Water availability has plummeted due to the worst rainfall season in over 40 years and increasing water evaporation has led to the degradation of large swathes of fertile lands in the southern governorates of the country due to salinity.\n\nA decrease in water flow, particularly in the southern governates where the rural population depends on agriculture to make a living, means the agricultural sector is unable to guarantee sufficient and sustainable livelihood opportunities in rural areas.\n\nIn addition, Iraq is currently a net importer of food and has been heavily impacted by the current crisis in Ukraine. “We need to take action now and introduce innovative solutions to the old agricultural practices that are just not sustainable in today’s climate, “said WFP Iraq representative Ally Raza Qureshi. “WFP is grateful for the Republic of Korea’s support to help us tackle these serious issues and promote improved agriculture and food security in the land of two rivers.”\n\nWith the support of partners such as the Republic of Korea, WFP can expand its resilience-building and livelihood interventions which have currently benefitted up to 51,000 food insecure smallholder farmers, returnees, and vulnerable communities across Iraq in 2022.",
    "Department of State Cybersecurity Training Series Boosts Global Resilience Against Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Malware": "The Department of State’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) is strengthening international capacity to counter Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) malware by sponsoring a training series for allies and partners around the world. CDP sponsored development of the nine-day training program, titled “Unhiding Hidden Cobra,” which it provided to cybersecurity professionals from six partner nations in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, and Asia. (The U.S. government refers to malicious cyber activity by the DPRK government as “Hidden Cobra.”) Courses will continue to be offered to partner nations on a rotational basis through 2022 and 2023. The program includes practical, hands-on exercises to equip participants to prevent, detect, and mitigate malicious cyber activity using cybersecurity information released by U.S. government agencies. Participants are primarily staff from computer security incident response teams and entities with similar roles in the public and private sectors. CDP offers these virtual trainings in partnership with the Software Engineering Institute, a federally funded research and development center based at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nBuilding international cybersecurity capacity is a key part of the United States’ commitment to promoting an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet and a stable cyberspace. By cooperating with international partners to disrupt cyber threats, including those from the DPRK, the United States helps to strengthen global adherence to the framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace and build global cyber resilience. The DPRK’s malicious cyber activities threaten the United States and the broader international community, including the integrity and stability of the global financial system. In recent years, the DPRK has increasingly relied on malicious cyber activities – including stealing directly from banks – to generate revenue for its UN-prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.\n\nFor further information, please e-mail CDP-Press@state.gov or follow CDP on Twitter at @StateCDP.",
    "US-ROK Strategic Dialogue: Recalibrating Deterrence Against an Evolving DPRK Nuclear Threat": "Executive Summary\n\nThe nature of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) nuclear and missile capabilities has significantly evolved since the United States first established an extended deterrence arrangement with the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea). In 2017, the DPRK conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test launches, demonstrating limited success. This milestone fundamentally changed its strategic options, adding a new dimension to US and ROK deterrence calculations.\n\nIn March 2021, the Stimson Center’s 38 North Program, sponsored by DTRA’s Strategic Trends Research Initiative within the US Department of Defense, launched a year-long US-ROK bilateral Track 2 dialogue to consider ways in which the extended deterrence arrangement could be modified in the coming years and to assess the potential effectiveness of various measures in enhancing deterrence against a DPRK attack and providing reassurance to South Korea of the US commitment and ability to respond in the ROK’s defense in case of deterrence failure. Participants came from a diverse range of functional and regional expertise across a broad spectrum of political viewpoints and included both senior-level experts and emerging scholars with diverse backgrounds.\n\nThroughout the dialogue, common threads emerged across US and ROK perspectives, highlighting the careful balance required to properly prepare for and address the issues at hand.\n\nDiscussions stressed an urgent need for improved strategic communications about alliance cooperation. There is little public understanding of the breadth of alliance cooperation and consultation that currently takes place, especially regarding extended deterrence. High-profile meetings between defense ministers or military leaders are reported on but do not convey a sense of deep cooperation when the cameras go dark. As tensions rise globally and US policy priorities adjust to world events, there is reassurance in increasing the visibility of working-level cooperation, demonstrating that the alliance is not just strong, but also adapting to the changing security environment.\n\nThe range of potential new ways conflict could unfold in the region due to evolving threats requires modifications to conventional weapons employment, war planning, and joint military exercises. Contingency planning for the use of tactical nuclear weapons, cyber attacks on military or civilian facilities, or even the potential for North Korea to initiate an attack amid other conflict in the region all pose complications for allied responses. Planning, practice and especially exercising to failure can help identify operational and command and control challenges for the alliance to prepare for any threats.\n\nFinally, the change in administration in Seoul provides new opportunities to deepen and strengthen alliance cooperation and potentially trilateral US-ROK-Japan security cooperation as well. However, in the current strategic environment, China will likely view moves to deepen regional cooperation and integration among US allies with great suspicion. Knowing Beijing is able and willing to use its economic and political power to impose hardships on Seoul—and other allies that engage in major trade with China—over alliance defense decisions, the United States, South Korea and other allies should develop a collective response strategy to help mitigate the effects of Chinese economic coercion.\n\nKey recommendations include:\n\nBuild a comprehensive and coordinated strategic communications strategy that engages stakeholders and the public in more frequent and specific ways surrounding alliance cooperation, coordination and its evolution to build greater confidence that the alliance is adapting to the changing conditions. This means creating greater visibility into the consultative process, cultivating a more-informed press corps about the various ways in which consultation and cooperation are ongoing and coordinating messaging between Washington and Seoul to avoid the appearance of cleavages in policy positions that can be exploited.\n\nInvest in long-term ROK capacity-building on nuclear policy and extended deterrence, engaging a wide range of policy analysts, opinion leaders and emerging scholars through specialized in-person professional development and educational programs, online courses and longer-term Track 2 dialogues. This will help shape public perceptions and discourse over time.\n\nIncrease working-level cooperation in the consultative process to help promote the institutionalization of knowledge. While high-level engagements are important for agenda setting and demonstrating the commitment of both sides to mutual defense, a greater emphasis is needed on working-level cooperation. Creating joint studies and allowing more flexible execution of meetings can help facilitate greater learning and exchange and feed recommendations into the higher-level meetings to maximize their utility.\n\nInject new and realistic scenarios into US-ROK joint military exercises and tabletop exercises (TTXs) to help identify vulnerabilities and areas needing improvement. Wargaming and exercising to failure on both North Korea-specific and broader regional conflict scenarios can reveal where current capabilities and protocols need to be bolstered to be better prepared for conflict and a range of contingencies.\n\nBuild an alliance support and response strategy in the case of Chinese economic coercion that utilizes all aspects of state power and galvanizes a collective response among like-minded states. As US-China competition intensifies, China is likely to view changes to the US-ROK alliance posture and deployments with great suspicion and react in a similar, if not a more pronounced, manner. A coordinated alliance response plan may help to prevent coercive actions from being exercised or can at least mitigate their effects.\n\nBuild greater trilateral security between the United States, South Korea and Japan to enhance deterrence, recognizing there will be limits to this cooperation in the long run. Focus on areas where trilateral cooperation is imperative to extended deterrence and facilitate high-level dialogue, as well as within Track 2 circles, to build broader support for sustained security cooperation regardless of shifting political dynamics.",

Security Council resolutions, and engage in serious and sustained negotiations with the United States.\"\n\nNorth Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nThe spokesperson continued, \"U.N. sanctions on the DPRK remain in place, and we will continue to encourage all member states to implement them, including through diplomacy at the United Nations and with the DPRK's neighbors.\"\n\nVOA Korean Service contacted North Korea's U.N. mission in New York City requesting comment on the senators' letter but has not received a reply. The service also contacted the Russian embassy in Washington ​and its U.N. mission in New York City but has not received a reply.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has sanctioned North Korea against exporting arms in multiple resolutions dating back to 2006, and in December 2017, it passed a resolution banning member states from hiring North Korean workers in response to Pyongyang's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile a month earlier.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies and partners sanctioned Russia, excluding it from the global financial system days after its Feb. 21 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter setbacks in the war, Moscow has turned to Pyongyang for support.\n\nIn July, Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia that Moscow was willing to hire North Korean workers to rebuild the Russian-controlled Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region.\n\nNorth Korea recognized the Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, on July 14.\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Russia wants to purchase rockets and artillery shells from North Korea as it runs short on weapons.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Sept. 6, Vedant Patel, deputy spokesperson at the State Department, said, \"The Russian Ministry of Defense is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use in Ukraine.\"\n\nHe added, \"This purchase indicates that the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages due in part because of export controls and sanctions.\"\n\nRussian Ambassador to the U.N. Vasily Nebenzya said that the U.S. claim of Moscow's arms purchase from Pyongyang is \"another fake,\" according to Tass, a state-owned news agency.\n\nNorth Korea said on Thursday it has \"never exported weapons or ammunition to Russia\" and \"will not plan to export them,\" it said in the statement released through KCNA.\n\nThe North Korean statement did not address sending workers to the Donbas.\n\nNorth Korea continued to say it \"never recognized\" the U.N. Security Council's \"unlawful sanctions resolutions\" imposed against North Korea \"which was cooked up by the U.S. and its vassal forces.\"\n\nIf Moscow hires workers and buys weapons from North Korea, it would be violating sanctions it imposed on the regime as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. Such transactions would also put North Korea in violation of sanctions designed to prevent Pyongyang from earning much-needed hard currency to finance the development of nuclear missiles and ballistic missiles.",

    "North Korea denies supplying weapons or ammunition to Russia": "North Korea has claimed it has never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia, and does not plan to do so, adding that “reckless” US reports of weapons sales were an attempt to tarnish its image.\n\n“Recently, the US and other hostile forces talked about the ‘violation of a resolution’ of the UNSC [UN security council], spreading a ‘rumour of arms dealings’ between the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and Russia … we have never exported weapons or ammunition to Russia before and we will not plan to export them,” the state-controlled KCNA news agency said on Thursday.\n\nThe statement cited, but did not name, North Korea’s vice-director general of the general bureau of equipment of the ministry of national defence\n\nKCNA quoted the official as calling on Washington to stop making “reckless remarks” and to “keep its mouth shut”.\n\nBiden administration officials earlier this month confirmed a declassified US intelligence assessment that North Korea was in the process of selling arms to Russia in violation of UN security council sanctions banning Pyongyang from importing or exporting weapons.\n\nThe inventory reportedly included millions of artillery shells and rockets, as Moscow attempts to ease severe supply shortages in Ukraine worsened by US-led export controls and sanctions.\n\nThe official cited in Thursday’s report said North Korea had never recognised the “unlawful” UN sanctions imposed in response to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes, adding that trading in weapons was the “lawful right peculiar to a sovereign state”, according to an English translation of the statement.\n\n“But we take this opportunity to make clear one thing. We have never exported weapons or ammunition to Russia before and we will not plan to export them,” the official said. It is not sure from where the rumour originated which the US is spreading, but it is aimed at tarnishing the DPRK’s image.”\n\nCalling the reported sale of weapons a “potential purchase”, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, clarified that there were “no indications that purchase has been completed and certainly no indications that those weapons are being used inside of Ukraine”.\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul and commentator on North Korean affairs, said the regime’s denial of arms sales should be treated with caution.\n\n“North Korea prefers to keep its arms sales under the table, not only because such transactions can be affected by sanctions, but also because Pyongyang’s customers tend to be involved in other illicit behaviour as well,” he said.\n\n“North Korean claims are not credible, especially as the Kim regime, like Putin’s Russia, tries to disseminate counter-narratives against US intelligence and international criticism.”\n\nExperts believe North Korea could theoretically become a major source of small arms, artillery and other ammunition for Russia, since both have defence systems based on those developed during the Soviet era.\n\nDespite Thursday’s denial of arms sales, North Korea has indicated since the start of the war in Ukraine that it hopes to strengthen ties with Russia. It has blamed the US for the conflict and said Russian military action was a justified response to western “hegemonic policy”.\n\nNorth Korea has also shown an interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild pro-Russian breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east.\n\nNorth Korea has traditionally earned foreign currency by sending its citizens to work overseas. Under UN-sanctions they were supposed to have been repatriated by the end of 2019, but significant numbers of labourers from the country have reportedly continued to work in Russia and China, as well as in Laos and Vietnam, since the deadline passed.\n\nIn July, North Korea became the only country aside from Russia and Syria to recognise the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nIn a letter to mark last month’s anniversary of Korea’s liberation from 35 years of Japanese rule at the end of the second world war, Putin told his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un that their countries would “expand comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”.\n\nIn a message to Putin, Kim said the “strategic and tactical cooperation, support and solidarity” between the two countries had reached a new level amid their common efforts to frustrate threats and provocations from “hostile military forces”.",
    "Association of Dietary Behaviors with Poor Sleep Quality and Increased": "Introduction\n\nSleep is an integral component of well-being that critically influences physical and mental abilities. In the military, sufficient sleep is important to ensure the adequate performance of individual members, promote mission success in each military unit, and even enhance national security.1,2 Enlisted personnel tend to have worse sleep quality than officers because they live in more crowded sleeping quarters.3,4 In addition, the number of patients visiting the United States (US) military medical facilities for insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) showed a tendency to increase over time.4,5 Furthermore, there have been multiple studies of military personnel reporting the association of sleep disorders with post-traumatic stress disorder,6 depression,7 and anxiety.8–12\n\nEpidemiological studies assessing sleep conditions have been conducted in the military across several countries. A Korean military health survey reported that 8.8–10.1% of the total respondents had moderate-to-severe sleep difficulty.13,14 Similarly, 8.1% of the study population in a single Korean military hospital had a high risk of OSA.15 Contrarily, a study involving US military personnel indicated that the incidence rates of insomnia and OSA were 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.5 Additionally, the prevalence of subthreshold insomnia in multiple US army units ranged from 29.6 to 54.3%.16\n\nIn our previous study, most military personnel with insomnia had indigestion and were likely to eat night meals and snacks more frequently. After prescribing herbal medicine that could enhance digestive function, their insomnia improved.17 In a previous study regarding sleep disorders and associated medical comorbidities, pain syndrome was found to increase the risk of insomnia.6 Since it has been observed that many young male patients in the Korean army with insomnia also have indigestion symptoms linked to dietary habits, a large-scale cross-sectional study exploring the association between dietary behaviors and sleep was planned. The association between sleep and dietary behaviors has been examined in various populations, including factory workers18 and white-collar workers,19 but there is limited related research among military personnel. Military service members share similar sleep and nutritional conditions, and the effect of personal dietary behaviors on sleep can be clearly assessed after adjusting for related lifestyle and occupational factors.\n\nThis study, therefore, aimed to explore dietary factors, including skipping breakfast, overeating, snacking, and eating night meals, associated with poor sleep quality and high risk of OSA among military service members. Potential covariates of demographic and occupational factors in the military were also comprehensively evaluated.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy Population\n\nThis cross-sectional survey was conducted among five units of the Republic of Korea’s army from August to September 2021. A link to the online survey was provided to members on active duty, and the responses were collected by five Korean medical doctors. Eligible service members participated in the study using their cellular phones. All participants provided informed consent and voluntarily participated in the study. The collected data were managed anonymously, and access was restricted so that only the specific researchers could access the personal information of the enrolled participants. The protocol and survey questionnaire were approved by the institutional review board of the Armed Forces Medical Command (AFMC-202107-HR-054-02). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nThis study included enlisted service members on active duty aged ≥19 years who had completed their basic military training course. They comprised only enlisted service members in the following ranks: private, private first-class, corporal, and sergeant.\n\nDefinition of Poor Sleep Quality and High Risk of OSA\n\nPoor sleep quality was defined by the global score of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), which is calculated by summing the seven component scores, including subjective quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbance of sleep, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction.20 Two studies validated the Korean version of the PSQI and reported cut-off values of > 8 and > 5, respectively.21,22 Herein, we defined poor sleep quality as a global PSQI score > 5. An additional analysis was also carried out with the higher PSQI threshold of > 9, based on a previous PSQI study on military personnel.23 High risk of OSA was defined using the Berlin Questionnaire,24 which comprises three categories: snoring and witnessed apnea, daytime sleepiness or tiredness, and presence of hypertension or obesity. A high risk of OSA was reported when two or three categories were present.25\n\nStudy Variables\n\nDietary behavior information was collected using the dietary habit survey questionnaire,26 which included 25 items used to evaluate dietary habits, and we selected four items based on previous research. The frequencies of skipping breakfast, overeating, snacking, and eating night meals were included in the analysis.17–19\n\nData on demographic, lifestyle, and occupational factors were also collected to be analyzed as covariates. Participants’ age, educational level, height, and weight were recorded. Lifestyle factors included perceived stress level, smoking history, frequency of drinking, aerobic exercise per week, and coffee consumption. Occupational factors within the military included rank (private, private first class, corporal, or sergeant), position (combat arms, driver, military chef, administration), and the frequency of night shifts.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nCategorical variables were presented as frequencies (%), while continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviation). To compare the frequencies or means between the two groups (PSQI ≤ 5 and PSQI > 5) and (high risk or low risk of sleep apnea), the chi-square test or independent t-test was performed, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between poor sleep quality and dietary behaviors; and between high risk of OSA and dietary behaviors. Demographic, lifestyle, and occupational factors were also included in the model as covariates. Unadjusted (univariate), and adjusted (multivariable) odds ratios, 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value are presented. For statistical significance, p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.3.27,28\n\nResults\n\nStudy Flow and Characteristics of the Participants\n\nIn total, 4869 responses were collected through the online survey. After removing 35 duplicate responses and 139 responses from participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria (aged under 19 years or members not on active duty), 4695 responses from eligible participants remained. Of the 4695 eligible respondents, 4389 completed the entire survey without missing any sections.\n\nThe participants were men with a mean age of 20.8 ± 1.3 years. A PSQI global cutoff score >5 indicated poor sleep quality in 2579 (58.8%) respondents. The distribution of the PSQI global score in all participants is presented in Figure 1. Furthermore, 614 (14.0%) respondents were assessed as having a high risk of OSA according to the Berlin questionnaire. The participants’ characteristics are presented in Table 1. According to the existence of poor sleep quality and high risk of OSA, the characteristics of the participants showed differences in various demographic, lifestyle, occupational, and dietary factors.\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of Military Service Members\n\nFigure 1 Distribution of global Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores.\n\nPoor Sleep Quality and Associated Factors\n\nDietary Behaviors\n\nThe adjusted odds ratios of dietary behaviors in the presence of poor sleep quality are presented in Figure 2 and Table 2. In the multivariable logistic regression, skipping breakfast 1–2 times a week was related to a greater likelihood of poor sleep quality than not skipping breakfast (odds ratio: 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.47], p<0.001). The results of the univariable and multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds ratios tended to increase as the frequency of skipping breakfast increased to 5–6 times a week. Additionally, overeating 1–2 times or 3–4 times per week was associated with poor sleepers. Those who frequently ate snacks showed a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing poor sleep quality than those who did not (X2 = 13.6, df = 6, p = 0.035). Eating night meals 3–4 times or 5–6 times per week significantly increased the likelihood of poor sleep quality. However, eating night meals daily did not appear to be associated with an increased likelihood of poor sleep quality. The overall effect of night meals on poor sleep quality was significant (X2 = 22.3, df = 5, p < 0.001). Also, additional results of dietary behaviors for poor sleep quality (defined as a higher PSQI threshold > 9), are shown in Table 3. A similar tendency was observed between the dietary behaviors and poor sleep quality in both models for the two PSQI thresholds. The effects of skipping breakfast, overeating, and eating night meals on poor sleep quality seem distinctive when applying a higher PSQI threshold.\n\nTable 2 Multivariable Logistic Regression of Dietary Behaviors for Poor Sleep Quality (PSQI > 5)\n\nTable 3 Multivariable Logistic Regression of Dietary Behaviors for Poor Sleep Quality (PSQI > 9)\n\nFigure 2 Forest plot of the odds ratios of dietary behaviors on poor sleep quality. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in the multivariable logistic model using demographic, lifestyle, and occupational factors as the covariates. The size of the square represents the number of participants in each item.\n\nOther Lifestyle and Occupational Factors\n\nThe overall results of the multivariable logistic regression are presented in Tables S1 and S2 . The severity of stress was highly associated with an increased likelihood of poor sleeping (X2 = 375.1, df = 4, p < 0.001). Additionally, coffee consumption more than twice daily had distinct effects on poor sleep quality when compared with drinking coffee less than once a week (twice daily: odds ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02–1.81], ≥three times daily: odds ratio 1.51 [95% CI: 1.02–2.27]). Among occupational factors, servicemen with military chef positions showed a greater likelihood of poor sleep quality than men in combat arms’ positions. In contrast, servicemen who were drivers showed a lower likelihood of being poor sleepers. Regardless of being off-duty after a night shift, frequent night shifts for more than five times a month were associated with poor sleep quality, compared with no night shifts.\n\nHigh Risk of OSA and Associated Factors\n\nDietary Behaviors\n\nThe adjusted odds ratios of dietary behaviors in the presence of a high risk of OSA are presented in Figure 3 and Table 4. The results of the univariate and multivariable logistic regression showed that skipping breakfast every day led to a greater likelihood of being at high risk of OSA, compared with not skipping breakfast. Moreover, overeating 3–4 times a week was associated with a high risk of OSA. Frequent overeating was associated with a greater likelihood of being at high risk of OSA, as shown in the univariate logistic regression. However, this tendency decreased after adjusting for demographic factors, mainly body mass index (BMI). Snacking did not appear to be associated with a high risk of OSA after adjusting for covariates. In contrast, eating night meals was associated with a high risk of OSA. The overall effect of night meals on high risk of OSA was statistically significant (X2 = 13.2, df = 5, p = 0.021).\n\nTable 4 Multivariable Logistic Regression of Dietary Behaviors for High Risk of OSA\n\nFigure 3 Forest plot of the odds ratios of dietary behaviors on high risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in the multivariable logistic model using demographic, lifestyle, and occupational factors as the covariates. The size of the square represents the number of participants in each item.\n\nOther Lifestyle and Occupational Factors\n\nThe overall results of the multivariable logistic regression are presented in Table S3 . Exercising for more than 3–4 times a week was negatively correlated with a high risk of OSA. Furthermore, stress and drinking coffee more than three times a day had distinct effects on high risk of OSA. Among occupational factors, servicemen in administrative positions showed a lower likelihood of being at high risk of OSA than men in the combat arms division. The frequency of night shifts did not seem to be associated with high-risk OSA.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this cross-sectional study conducted among military service members in Korea, we explored poor sleep quality, high risk of OSA, and associated dietary factors. Among various dietary behaviors, a higher frequency of snacking and frequent and irregular eating of night meals were associated with poor sleep quality. In addition, a higher frequency of skipping breakfast, overeating, and having night meals seemed to be associated with a high risk of OSA.\n\nDietary Behaviors and Poor Sleep Quality\n\nNight Meals\n\nThe time of eating has a major impact on circadian rhythms, and eating at night may shift and even disrupt such rhythms.29,30 In a previous study, higher caloric intake during dinner and late in the night was associated with longer sleep latency and lower sleep efficiency in women.31 In another study, late dinner was positively associated with poor sleep quality when compared to having an early dinner.32 In our study, we found that the higher frequency of eating night meals was associated with an increased tendency for poor sleep quality. In particular, the odds ratio dramatically increased when eating night meals 5–6 times per week. Interestingly, the effect of eating night meals on poor sleep quality was partially eliminated by eating night meals daily, 7 times per week. Frequent and irregular eating of night meals appears to be negatively associated with sleep quality. In addition to circadian rhythm disruptions, having to digest food or indigestion that might arise from eating night meals may negatively affect sleep quality.31,33 At the same time, the possibility of reverse causation also exists, in that participants with poor sleep quality may tend to eat night meals. Meanwhile, the concept of “night eating syndrome” has been proposed as a stress-related eating disorder, which is mainly characterized by night eating patterns and sleep disturbance.34,35 The pathophysiology of “night eating syndrome” describes the stress-induced decrease in the nocturnal secretion of melatonin and leptin as causing both eating night meals and insomnia.36 Eating night meals and poor sleep quality seems to be highly associated. The possible mechanism related to the association requires further research.37\n\nSnacks/Overeating\n\nIn an epidemiological study of Japanese men aged 20–59 years, snacking habits were related to insufficient hours of sleep.18 Herein, the calculated odds ratio of poor sleep quality increased as the frequency of snacking and overeating increased. Furthermore, overeating 1–4 times a week also increased the likelihood of poor sleep. Snacking and overeating habits may also cause indigestion.38 Furthermore, consuming high-fat diets has been reported to worsen sleep/wake fragmentation in mice models.39 In addition, stress-induced eating in individuals with poor sleep quality may increase snacking habits, with a preference for eating energy-dense items.40 Further, sleeping for a short duration is known to affect appetite regulatory hormones, reducing leptin and elevating ghrelin,41 which may induce overeating. A recent randomized trial reported that interventions to increase sleep duration significantly decreased energy intake in overweight patients.42 Poor sleep quality and habits of snacking and overeating seem to have a reciprocal relationship.\n\nSkipping Breakfast\n\nPrevious studies on the relationship between skipping breakfast and sleep patterns commonly reported that late sleepers typically tend to skip breakfast and a late bedtime is associated with the tendency to skip breakfast.43,44 This could be a confounding factor in the relationship between skipping breakfast and sleep quality.30 We collected data from military service members whose bedtime and meal times were almost identical since their regular sleep time was set from 10 pm to 6 am and the same meal was provided three times a day. Therefore, the data could be relatively independent of these confounding factors. In other studies, skipping breakfast was associated with shorter sleep duration in male workers aged 40–59 years,19 and daily breakfast consumption was associated with sufficient sleep in children.44 In addition, an intervention study reported that eating breakfast for seven days improved perceived sleep quality compared with skipping breakfast.45 In our study, we collected the frequency of skipping breakfast during the week, and a higher frequency of skipping breakfast was generally associated with a greater likelihood of poor sleep quality. However, responders who skipped breakfast daily showed a lower tendency of being poor sleepers. It seems that skipping breakfast irregularly adversely affects the maintenance of circadian rhythms.\n\nOccupational Factors and Poor Sleep Quality\n\nSome interesting occupational factors associated with poor sleep quality were observed in the participants. Our study included only enlisted personnel, most of them being in combat arms, and others being drivers, military chefs, or working in the administration. Poor sleepers were relatively frequent among military chefs since they are expected to wake up early at dawn to prepare the food and therefore get extra sleep time in the late morning after work. Possible reasons for frequent poor sleep quality in these military chefs may be related to the fact that splitting sleep could negatively affect subjective sleep quality.46 Contrarily, drivers had lower sleep disturbances, which can be explained by the efforts of the military to prevent vehicle accidents that could be caused by drowsy driving.47,48 In Korea, drivers are rarely assigned to night sentry duties, and even if assigned, they are placed early in the night or early in the morning rather than in the middle of the night. The likelihood of lower sleep disturbances in drivers was significant, even after adjusting the frequency of night shifts. Policies implemented by the military seem to have been relatively effective in preventing sleep disorders among drivers.\n\nMilitary rank was also related to sleep disturbances, with a private rank leading to a lower likelihood of experiencing poor sleep quality. In the Korean army, mandatorily enlisted personnel are of the private rank until the 8th week, and they receive basic military training courses during the first five to seven weeks. During these courses, enlisted personnel receive intensive physical training, maintain a constant schedule for sleep and meals, and cannot eat snacks or night meals. In the present study, those with private ranks who had just completed this training course showed a lower likelihood of experiencing poor sleep quality. Approximately 5–7 weeks of regular sleep/meal rhythms and intensive physical training may be related to a reduced number of poor sleepers. In support of this, regularizing the sleep-wake schedule was reported to improve subjective sleep efficiency in an experimental study.49 However, a previous study showed that the duration of military service was a factor that increased the risk of insomnia symptoms.50 This may partially explain the concluded results that first-class privates, corporals, and sergeants showed a higher tendency of experiencing sleep disturbances, compared to privates.\n\nThe night shift was a major factor involved in the development of sleep disturbances in previous studies.51,52 When the frequency of night shift was > 5 times in one month, the likelihood of poor sleep quality significantly increased in this study.\n\nDietary Behaviors and High Risk of OSA\n\nOvereating\n\nOvereating was clearly associated with a high risk of OSA in the univariate logistic regression, but the tendency was diminished in the multivariable logistic regression. The association between overeating and the high risk of OSA seemed to be mainly explained by BMI because the strength of the association decreased after adjusting for BMI. Being overweight is a risk factor for OSA,53,54 and frequent overeating can lead to a higher BMI.\n\nNight Meals\n\nThe effect of eating night meals on the high risk of OSA was significant after adjusting for BMI. Additionally, the odds ratio increased as the frequency of night meals increased. Previous studies have also reported that eating night meals adversely affects symptom severity in patients with OSA. Increased food intake in the evening was related to decreased sleep quality in patients with sleep apnea.55 Additionally, patients with OSA who had a late dinner showed a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) than those who had an early dinner.32 Further, consuming fatty meals before bedtime significantly increased the AHI compared with light meals, in patients with OSA.56 Considering the Republic of Korea army environment where this survey was conducted, military service members usually eat calorific foods such as fried chicken and pizza for night meals. Both the timing and characteristics of night meals appear to have a negative effect on OSA. Avoiding night meals appears to be an important dietary behavior that plays a role in preventing or alleviating sleep apnea.\n\nSkipping Breakfast\n\nSkipping breakfast daily was clearly associated with a high risk of OSA. This behavior is different from the one associated with poor sleep quality, which involved irregular skipping behaviors. In a previous study that researched meal timing and sleep parameters in patients with OSA, skipping breakfast did not influence the severity of sleep apnea.32 In contrast, in a different study of patients with obesity and OSA, higher caloric intake at breakfast was associated with lower AHI.55 The reason for this association between skipping breakfast and high risk of OSA is unclear, but the potential factors include being overweight,57 having hypertension,58 and insulin resistance,58 which are known to be related to the habit of skipping breakfast. Being overweight and having hypertension or insulin resistance are both risk factors for OSA.59,60 Further research is required to explore the effects and mechanisms of skipping breakfast on OSA.\n\nOccupational Factors and High Risk of OSA\n\nIn the present study, sedentary workers in administrative positions showed a lower likelihood of being at high risk of OSA, compared with personnel in combat arms whose main tasks were special qualifications’ training. In a study conducted in Korea, the prevalence of high risk of OSA was 10.7% in the white-collar group and 13.4% in the blue-collar group, but the difference between the two groups was not significant.61 When comparing the characteristics of personnel in administration and combat arms, older age, higher educational level, and negative smoking status were observed in the administrative group ( Table S4 ). Although the odds ratio of the administration group compared to the combat arms group was still below one after adjusting for all covariates, some reports suggest that a higher educational level is associated with a lower risk of OSA.62–64 The characteristics of personnel in administrative positions may explain the lower risk of OSA; thus, further studies are required.\n\nLimitations and Implication\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, only men in their early 20s were included. Therefore, generalizing the results of this study to other sex and age groups is limited. Second, due to the limitations imposed by a cross-sectional design, it is difficult to demonstrate causality, and only an association can be derived. Third, poor sleep quality and high risk of OSA were defined using self-reported questionnaires. Fourth, objective sleep parameters were not included in this study.\n\nNevertheless, we successfully obtained practical data from a large population to understand the relationship between dietary behaviors and sleep quality. Although the association between sleep and dietary conditions should be comprehensively examined with various potential covariates, it is challenging when the type and amount of data are limited.65 Therefore, our large-scale study using various symptom examination tools may provide a deep and broad understanding of the association between sleep and other factors, which could be a milestone for future studies ( Table S5 ).\n\nAdditionally, these results may provide insights for military policymakers regarding the development of health promotion programs for military personnel. Based on our findings and related previous research, the dietary behaviors of military service members should receive attention to improve their sleep quality and prevent the risk of OSA. Especially, a policy to avoid frequent changes in meal timings (higher frequency of eating night meals or skipping breakfast) should be considered to improve sleep quality. In addition, an educational program to decrease the frequency of snacking and overeating can be developed to prevent the risk of OSA.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this large-scale cross-sectional study that included 4389 Korean military service members, eating a night meal 5–6 times/week, skipping breakfast irregularly, and eating snacks frequently were associated with poor sleep quality. Whereas, eating night meals and skipping breakfast daily were associated with a high risk of OSA. Irregular dietary behaviors appear to be related to poor sleep quality and a high risk of OSA. To determine the possible mechanisms related to the associations between sleep and dietary behaviors needs further research."
