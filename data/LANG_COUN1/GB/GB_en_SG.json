    "UK tech companies eye Singapore as gateway for regional expansion": "21 September 2022, Singapore - This week Singapore hosts a major delegation of 24 cutting-edge British companies exploring growth opportunities in Asia Pacific. They work on diverse projects including driverless vehicles, lawtech, cybersecurity and deeptech.\n\nThey are spending a week in Singapore hosted by the British High Commission and will engage with Singapore Government agencies including the Cyber Security Agency; Defence Science and Technology Agency; GovTech; the Infocomm Media Development Authority and the Ministry of Law.\n\nThese activities form the first UK-Singapore Digital Economy Dialogue, a forum to promote the benefits of digital trade, deepen our partnerships at both the government and business levels, and ensure that regulation keeps up with the pace of innovation.\n\nThe visiting companies intend to use the all-new UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement (DEA) to support their expansion into Asia Pacific.\n\nThe DEA is the most innovative trade agreement in the world, and is the first Digital Economy Agreement between a European nation and an Asian one. UK-Singapore trade is already worth over £17bn per year.\n\nTech Nation, the UK’s leading growth platform for tech companies, is co-leading this week by organising a delegation and creating a programme of 90 meetings with corporate partners and investors.\n\nLawtech: a bright spot for future growth\n\nTen lawtech companies are visiting Singapore from the UK to explore business opportunities in Asia Pacific.\n\n‘Lawtech’ is commonly used to describe technologies that support, supplement or replace traditional methods for the delivery of legal services or legal transactions by law practice entities or lawyers.\n\nThe UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement is the first trade agreement in the world to contain specific commitments on lawtech. The UK’s lawtech sector is valued at £11.4bn, according to Tech Nation research. The UK has the largest legal services market in Europe – and is second globally only to the US.\n\nThe DEA brings together two leading nations on legal services, and will help firms identify collaboration opportunities in both markets more easily.\n\nIt has specific provisions that promote electronic contracts and signatures; secure international data flows; and ensure protection of key proprietary information.\n\nThe DEA gives businesses greater confidence and assurance about the rules of the road when it comes to trading digitally between the UK and Singapore, both now and in the future.\n\nKara Owen, British High Commissioner to Singapore said:\n\nI am excited to host 24 UK tech companies at the British High Commission, Singapore. They are keen to use the all-new UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement to support their expansion into Singapore and the region. The agreement is a marker of our ambition to break down trade barriers in areas including lawtech, data flows and cyber security. UK-Singapore trade is already worth over £17 billion per year, and this is only set to grow.\n\nNatalie Black, His Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific said:\n\nI am delighted to welcome a cohort of cutting-edge UK tech companies to Singapore to meet new partners, customers and investors and identify growth opportunities in the region. Singapore is a gateway to the rest of Southeast Asia, which has a digital economy projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. The region has the demographics and openness that scaleups are looking for. Our UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement will make the most of this opportunity – bringing together two high tech nations in a living agreement that keeps up with the pace of digital innovation.\n\nGabriel Lim, Permanent Secretary (Trade and Industry), Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore Government, said:\n\nWe welcome the visit of UK tech startups to Singapore, in conjunction with the inaugural Digital Economy Dialogue under the UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement. This is an opportunity to bring together industry stakeholders to explore how we can leverage this cutting-edge agreement and help our businesses, especially startups and SMEs, to seize new growth opportunities across our combined and growing digital markets.\n\nSamantha Evans, Director of International at Tech Nation said:\n\nTech Nation are thrilled to be bringing the third cohort of leading UK tech companies on our International Growth Programme to Singapore. While here, the companies will be meeting with over 90 corporates and investors as they look for partnerships and opportunities to land and expand into this exciting market. As part of the UK government’s Digital Trade Network, we have already supported over 300 UK tech scaleups derisk and accelerate their growth into Asia Pacific - with the majority looking to scale into Singapore first.",
    "Why a good night's sleep is not just a Singapore GP issue": "Since the first night race back in 2008, F1 folk have grown used to adjusting to the schedule by staying up until dawn and sleeping until the early afternoon in an attempt to stay on European time. Against the backdrop of the inevitable jet lag on arrival, it's never an easy thing to manage.\n\nThe reality is that while good sleep becomes a topic of paddock conversation around the Singapore GP, it makes a crucial contribution to mental and physical fitness at any time. For F1 drivers and team members facing a hectic calendar with more night events and more travel, it's becoming an increasingly important issue.\n\nThat's why teams are now looking at ways of improving the quality of sleep of drivers and crew members.\n\n\"Sleep is the foundation of everything else that we try to do in terms of well-being,\" says Mercedes team physician Dr Luke Bennett.\n\n\"You can train hard, you can train well, you can eat right, you can do all of those things properly. But if you're not sleeping well, then you're not going to get the impact that you need.\n\n\"And that goes as much for the race team members as it does for the drivers or any other athlete.\"\n\nFormerly a trauma specialist in Australia, Bennett volunteered at grands prix in Melbourne and Korea before joining Hintsa Performance, the organisation whose physios work with many drivers and teams across at the grid.\n\nOver the past decade, he's played an important, if largely unheralded role in helping Mercedes to achieve so much success.\n\nMechanics in the garage with George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images\n\n\"In our sport, where the technology is such a focus, I think human performance and well-being is genuinely valued by the teams,\" says Bennett. \"But it can often slip as a priority.\n\n\"The budget cap has changed that. And there's a real emphasis now on extracting the maximum from the human beings who travel the planet, operating this race team.\n\n\"And that's gained even further urgency with a calendar like the one that we're going to have next year, where the number of races is increasing. And the geographical complexity of the calendar makes something like sleep just an absolutely key part of the performance of not just the drivers, but the whole race team.\"\n\nKeeping drivers mentally fit over a gruelling grand prix weekend is a top priority for the people around them, notably their physios.\n\n\"I think most people appreciate that driving that car for up to two hours is an extraordinarily physical experience,\" says Bennett.\n\n\"But across the race weekend, there's also a huge cognitive demand for a driver. That steering wheel has 20 to 30 buttons and menus and sub-menus, which they're navigating sometimes even from corner to corner.\n\n\"The drivers sit through something like seven hours of engineering meetings across a race weekend, and then other countless hours of marketing and media duties, as well as the travel.\n\n\"You can quickly understand why sleep is not just a very important part of making sure that their physical preparation is consolidated. But it's also about making sure that they can still hit that apex millimetre to millimetre lap after lap on a Sunday when they've been through an extraordinarily demanding weekend even up to that point.\"\n\nWhen it first arrived on the schedule, Singapore presented some special challenges for team doctors and physios. Over the years, they have learned how to keep the drivers in tip-top condition.\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF90, and Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W10, lead the field away at the start in Singapore Photo by: Joe Portlock / Motorsport Images\n\n\"There's some very unique sleep and physiological stresses about that event,\" says Bennett. \"It's notionally conducted on European time, but we have all of this incredibly bright artificial lighting. We have mid-afternoon wake-ups, we have a couple of finishes after sunrise. So it's not as simple as staying on European time.\n\n\"It's an incredibly disruptive week for sleep. We then have a one-day turnaround and a flight to Japan, where we go immediately onto a day schedule. It's easily the most brutal back-to-back that we see on the calendar.\n\n\"And in previous years I guess it's fair to say it's been a survival exercise for most people. We now have ways to not necessarily optimise but to manage this stress at a time of the season where championships are often being decided.\n\n\"It starts ideally with preparation before travel. Looking at the daily schedule, you want the driver to maybe shift a couple of hours, and they can do that effectively in the few days before they travel.\n\n\"You want to select the flight appropriately, depending on what time of day they want to arrive and what their commitments will be. I've heard it said that you can drill down to selecting which side of the aircraft you sit on, in terms of light exposure through different parts of the aircraft.\n\n\"We'll then be talking about precisely when to be exposed to light, when to maximise light exposure, when to seek darkness or a heavily shaded room, when to wear sunglasses in the later part of the day, Melatonin supplements, and then timing of exercise and meals. All those variables go into the mix of a really good jet lag plan.\"\n\nAt the heart of it all is getting some decent sleep when the driver finally gets back to his hotel room.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"Sleep has probably had a popular renaissance over the last few years,\" says Bennett. \"I think there's an appreciation that it's not just the part of your day that gives way to all other activities. It's so important for consolidating all of the other important physiology that you have.\n\n\"But it's not just sleep. As a broad concept, I think everybody understands how important that is. But I would say even over the last year the physiology of temperature around sleep is really becoming recognised as probably as important as things like light and dark manipulation, which were traditionally considered to be the most important variables around sleep.\n\n\"The physiology about how temperature affects the depth of your sleep, phases of your sleep, the healthy phases of REM and deep sleep, and then how that affects your performance, both physically and mentally the following day. It's all logged pretty closely to temperature, and I think it's a pretty exciting field.\"\n\nThis year Mercedes has taken an interesting step in exploring the subject further by partnering with Eight Sleep, a company whose products focus on how temperature impacts sleep, and how it can be used to improve it.\n\nThe Eight Sleep \"pod\" comes in two forms, either as a complete mattress or as a mattress cover that can also potentially be transported. It works in conjunction with box that sits next to the bed, and a phone app.\n\n\"It's essentially a sensor layer, a mattress pad that you can install onto any mattress,\" says Eight Sleep co-founder Matteo Franceschetti.\n\n\"It will do a couple of different things. First of all, it's like sleeping on a stethoscope. There are sensors embedded that you don't feel that are able to track everything about your heart rate, your respiration and your sleep quality.\n\n\"And we are reaching medical grade accuracy in a couple of these dimensions, meaning that your bed is comparable to a medical grade device.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"But the key difference between us and a wearable is that the wearable tracks the data and reports the data to you. But it doesn't do much more than that. In our case, we use the data to then adjust the temperature and control your body temperature.\"\n\nThat's the key to how the Eight Sleep pod improves your sleep, as Franceschetti notes: \"The bottom line is each side of the bed can have a different temperature, and the temperature will change during the night to optimise your recovery.\n\n\"We didn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that there is already plenty of medical evidence that temperature at night can improve your sleep performance and your body temperature changes. When you hear people saying, 'You should sleep at 68degF (20degC) the whole night,' that is wrong.\n\n\"And the reason is 68degF could work for one hour out of the eight hours. But for the other seven hours, you need a different temperature. And that is what our device does.\"\n\nFranceschetti stresses that the idea is to promote what the company calls sleep fitness.\n\n\"Everything started at first from a certain vision that we had internally,\" he says. \"Most of the time when you think of bedding companies, you think about comfort and cosiness. Our approach has always been different, because I used to be an athlete.\n\n\"And I always thought of sleep not just as relaxation, but also recovery. And that is how we came up with this concept of sleep fitness, which means you need to put the work in, you need to put the effort and the hours in when you go to bed, as you will do in the gym. But then you wake up fully refreshed, energised and healthier.\"\n\nSo what are the tangible benefits of better sleep for an athlete like a racing driver, or indeed for anybody else?\n\n\"There are some ways that are more obvious,\" says Franceschetti. \"Like reaction time, mental clarity, cognitive performance and focus, which are pretty obvious.\n\n\"But then there are also I would say almost second order effects that are effects on your own health. So lower heart rate and higher HRV [heart rate variability], which is another proxy for physical stress and recovery, overall better health. By being more energised, you will likely eat better and avoid junk food, probably you will be in a better mood.\n\n\"At the end of the day, health is based on three pillars. One is sleep, one is nutrition, and one is fitness. But sleep is really the foundational part, because if you sleep two hours per night for five nights in a row, I can tell you, you will eat very shitty food, and you will not be able to train!\n\nArtificial lighting in Singapore adds an extra dimension to sleep challenges Photo by: Lionel Ng / Motorsport Images\n\n\"Other second order effects are injuries. By recovering properly and sleeping properly, you will avoid injuries, which for athletes is a major factor.\"\n\nThe Mercedes drivers and key team members have been using Eight Sleep products in their homes this season, providing useful benefits before and after travel to races.\n\nThe next step is to have the portable mattress cover version transported around and installed in hotel rooms at each event, to ensure that those benefits fully carry over to race weekends.\n\n\"We are talking to one of the drivers to see if we can have the pod installed in his hotel in all the remaining races of the season,\" says Franceschetti. \"For sure, some races will be really easy, and a no-brainer to make it happen. Some others maybe harder.\n\n\"But the idea over time, as the relationship between Eight Sleep and Mercedes develops, is how can we expand this programme and make sure that the drivers and all the engineers have it in every single race of the year?\"\n\nIn a sport where marginal gains count, Mercedes may have found a useful extra edge over rivals.\n\n\"When we say we can improve your sleep quality by 30%, imagine if I could tell you I can improve your strength by 30%,\" says Franceschetti. \"If you use the same framework for energy, clarity, reaction time, then everything being improved by 30% is a big deal.\"",

    "Williams F1 decision on Nyck De Vries Singapore drive | thejudge13": "The Williams Formula One team have provisionally decided to give Nyck de Vries a second F1 drive in Singapore. In the period since Alex Albon posted his twitter update 10 days ago revealing he was taking his first steps after his appendectomy, the team Albon and De Vries have been silent over whether the British-Thai driver will be fit enough to drive in Singapore this weekend.\n\nThe Singapore circuit is one of the most physical tests the F1 drivers face each season as Albon revealed in his tweet.\n\n“The goal is to be ready for Singapore, which is going to be tough.”\n\n“Its one of the toughest races that we go to. Its not an easy one but lets aim high and see what happens.”\n\nThe physicality the drivers face this year at the Asian circuit will be tougher than ever due to the new F1 car design regulations. The new cars now use aerodynamic under the floor ground effect to create downforce which has seen some teams run their cars lower than before to the track surface\n\nSingapore F1 circuit similar to Baku\n\nThe track surface is similar in nature to Baku and so the effect of the bumps will be greater than ever at the Marina Bay track.\n\nLewis Hamilton struggled to get out of his car following the Baku race and despite the FIA issuing at technical directive to reduce the vertical oscillations facade by the driers since Azerbaijan, the modified cars have not really faced a proper test of how much better the ride is.\n\nIt could be even though they have been modified, they react in a similar fashion to the way the handled in Baku.\n\nWilliams F1 hand forced\n\nWilliams have been forced to make an early decision on Albon because if Nyck De Vries were to substitute for him again, he will need all the track time available to him starting with FP1.\n\nJust waiting to see how Albon gets on in FP1 was not really an option if the team wish to maximise their potential in the GP.\n\nSingapore4 is a real opportunity for the Williams car which was much better suited than others to the Baku race surface, with Albon finishing P12 and Latifi P15.\n\nThe team have not yet formally announced De Vries as Albon’s substitute because the young Dutchman himself needed to get fitter since Monza.\n\nDe Vries not F1 fit\n\nFollowing. The chequered flag last time out in Italy, De Vries reported over team radio, “My shoulders are dead. I’m struggling to even…Can someone help me or am I alone in Parc Ferme? I can literally not even lift my arms anymore.”\n\nAlpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly came to over to check. On him.\n\nF1 drivers regularly face G-Forces of 5g when braking, 2g under acceleration and up to 6g when cornering. They also lose up to 3kg in weight during some races and by comparison Monza with its long straights is benign when compared to the up coming street circuit in Singapore.\n\nAlbon would have stood no chance of returning to the car had the original race calendar stood, because the Russian GP was originally slated in the intervening days following his surgery.\n\nAlex innate level of fitness will not have dropped, but concerns over the bumpy nature of the Singapore track and whether his wound could be reopened will have surely affected Williams decision on substituting him with Nyck de Vries.\n\nNyck’s preparation for Singapore hampered\n\nEven with the extra physical training the young Dutchman has had his preparations for Singapore hampered because of new travel laws from Europe to the UK.\n\nNyck took to instagram saying he had been unable to travel to the Williams factory in Grove because he only had his EU ID card and not his passport. He returned home until the matter was revolved.\n\nAs much as F1 fans appear to support Alex Allbon after his traumas racing for Red Bull, there will be many excited to see what F1’s next big thing has to offer at one of the most demanding circuits on the Formula One calendar.\n\nREAD MORE: Haas F1 criticise Mick Schumacher’s attitude",
    "Singapore Seeks To Transform Industries As World Enters New Era Of Global Trade: DPM Lawrence Wong": "Singapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong speaking at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in ... [+] Singapore. Forbes Asia\n\nSingapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state is constantly reinventing itself to remain relevant as the world enters a new era of global trade.\n\n“We do not take things for granted,” Wong, who is also the country’s finance minister, said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore. “We are always paranoid that somebody else will take our lunch.” Wong made his remarks during a key note address at the event.\n\nWong said the government is pushing ahead to expand the capacity of its airport and seaport to accommodate increasing trade flows, while at the same time encouraging the adoption of digital technologies in the finance industry to bolster the country’s position as an Asian financial hub.\n\nEarlier this year, Singapore said it’s forging ahead with a S$20 billion ($14 billion) project to build the world’s biggest port by 2040. At the same time, it plans to build a fifth passenger terminal at Changi Airport that will be mostly automated and capable of handling an additional 50 million travelers a year. “We want to make sure that capacity is in place to meet increased demand,” he said.\n\nThe investments will help Singapore retain its key position as a reliable and trusted node in the global supply chain, Wong said. “We are entering a new era of global order,” Wong said. “There are tremendous uncertainties all around us.”\n\nApart from the disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic and deteriorating relations between China and the U.S., the world has been grappling with surging inflation and rising interest rates. “Geopolitics will drive trade and investment,” Wong said. “It will lead us to a more dangerous and fragmented world.”\n\nWong—who is largely anticipated to become Singapore’s next prime minister to replace Lee Hsien Loong—said no decision has been made as to when the transition will happen. He stressed that the government is focused first on addressing rising inflation and cushioning the impact of the potential economic slowdown next year.“We will do it when we’re ready,” he said.",

    "House of the year, Singapore: OCBC": "OCBC Bank has again demonstrated its preeminence among Singapore banks this past year, through leadership in the local interest rate benchmark transition, market-leading ESG (environment, social and governance) investment offerings, and innovative digital solutions for its foreign exchange clients.\n\n\n\nAt a time when the market was awaiting the outcome of a consultation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on the adjustment spreads for the transition of legacy swap offered rate (SOR) contracts in the wholesale market, OCBC, together with another commercial bank, completed a 30-year overnight indexed swap (OIS) derivatives transaction in July this year using the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (Sora) as the interest rate benchmark. The bank believes it to be the first long-tenor Sora OIS trade in the city-state.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge, according to Wee Wei Min, global head of sales and structuring, global treasury at OCBC Bank, lies in the long tenor of the transaction because of a dearth of liquidity on that part of the Sora curve. Wee says OCBC overcame this challenge by marrying its corporate and institutional clients to create liquidity.\n\n“OCBC was able to transit a long-dated overnight indexed swap, amortising SOR-based interest rate swap into Sora with our client. OCBC was able to break down the trade into the various tenor buckets against the offsetting flows from our network of clients. This solution worked successfully and sets the precedent in the collaboration process across teams for other long-dated deals to be transited,” she says.\n\n\n\nWee says the fact the bank had senior leaders sitting on the legacy contract conversion sub-committee and the trading sub-committee of the Steering Committee for SOR and Sibor transition to Sora has not only helped the industry make the transition, but also the bank.\n\nOCBC has a long history of leadership in Singapore’s local benchmark transition. In 2019, for instance, OCBC and another commercial bank traded Singapore’s first OIS derivatives transaction using Sora.\n\nOCBC has also executed a number of sustainable finance transactions in the past 12 months, further cementing its title as a frontrunner in the ESG space. One example was a transaction for a real estate investment trust, First REIT. The bank also priced the Housing Development Board’s first green bond and a repeat sustainability-linked issuance for Sembcorp.\n\n“As ESG bonds have a scarcity factor in the Singapore dollar market, we envisioned that investor demand for such instruments will be forthcoming and we lead-managed the market’s first social bond for First REIT, an SGX-listed healthcare-focused REIT. The transaction was aligned with the REIT’s newly established social finance framework, which ties in with the United Nations’ sustainability development goals. In helping these issuers, we created a meaningful platform to further ESG bond issuances, deepening the ESG footprint in the Singapore bond market.”\n\n\n\nLike all banks, OCBC is also very much in the throes of its digital journey. One of its key initiatives – FX Online – the bank’s digital FX platform, which was launched in 2020, has seen further improvements in the past year.

    "Shifting financial centres sees Singapore overtake Hong Kong": "Hong Kong’s long-standing reign as the world’s third most important city for global finance, and Asia’s top financial hub, is over – for now.\n\nThe city has handed its financial centre crown to Singapore, which finally overtakes it to become Asia’s top financial hub and the third worldwide.\n\nSingapore moved up three places to third place in the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) of the world’s leading international financial centres, behind New York and London, while Hong Kong slipped to fourth place.\n\nHong Kong battered by strict Covid-19 restrictions\n\nThis comes as Hong Kong struggles to revive its role as a global finance centre, following a ‘zero Covid’ policy the city has had in place for more than two years, requiring visitors to spend as much as 21 days in a hotel or quarantine facility upon arrival.\n\nThese measures have weighed on the city’s economy over the last year, with the city seeing an exodus of top financial talent to Singapore with the Lion City reaping the benefits.\n\nAccording to the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao, around 10% of EU citizens living in Hong Kong have left the city, and rising numbers of employees have asked to be relocated. Citigroup quietly moved a half a dozen equities bankers to Singapore and other markets, while a similar number of MDs at JPMorgan also left earlier this year.\n\nIn August, the city’s government revised downward its growth forecast for the economy to -0.5% to 0.5%, citing worse-than-expected economic performance in the first half.\n\nA similar fate has befallen Japan, whose Covid-19 measures have been similarly restrictive with Tokyo plunging by seven spots in the latest GFCI rankings to 16th place.\n\n“Continuing travel restrictions in places like Hong Kong and Tokyo affect their ability to conduct normal levels of business,” the report’s authors said.\n\nThat said, the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen all maintain spots in the GFCI’s top 10, despite equally crippling Covid-19 mitigation measures that have almost cut off China from the rest of the world.",

    "Singapore's Temasek leads a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup": "In just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Ina Fassbender | Afp | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — Singapore state investment firm Temasek is leading a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup despite a dry spell of deals in the country. The startup, Well-Link Technologies, counts Chinese tech company Xiaomi and Chinese gaming star miHoYo as investors, according to business database Tianyancha. The $40 million deal announced Monday is an early-stage, or B2 round, led by Temasek and includes existing shareholders Future Capital and CDH Venture and Growth Capital. Temasek confirmed the deal in an email. The Singapore firm's publicly disclosed exposure to China has declined over the last two years, from 29% in 2020 to 22% as of this March. As of last week, Temasek had only participated in eight China financing deals, down from 41 last year, according to Dealogic.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Cloud rendering uses multiple servers on the cloud, rather than a single computer, to make the computations necessary for creating images such as animations and movies. Cloud gaming requires fast processing speed since it relies on remote servers and an internet connection to offer people a smooth gaming experience with just a small file download. For example, the cloud version of Genshin Impact is just 78.5 megabytes on Apple's App Store in China, versus the exponentially larger 3.7 gigabytes for the non-cloud version.\n\nSoaring revenue\n\nWell-Link claims its revenue for each of the last two years has grown by a whopping 400% or more, putting the company on track for revenue of several hundred million yuan — the equivalent of tens of millions of U.S. dollars. CEO Guo Jianjun told reporters the valuation that Temasek offered wasn't the highest one the startup received. But he said the latest financing round is part of the company's plans to expand its business overseas. It was difficult to raise funds during the pandemic, and the startup still has a lot of money, Guo said. But he added that he's confident in Well-Link's future development and wants to stick to its fundraising plan. One of Well-Link's next steps is encouraging more developers to create games that originate in the cloud. The company is also exploring how its real-time cloud rendering tech can help with the development of virtual reality and other technologies of the future.",
    "In a Complete Reversal, Singapore Foundation Apologizes for Seeking Court Order to Block KAWS Exhibition": "Ending a months-long legal battle, the Ryan Foundation in Singapore, which threatened to shut down a traveling public art show by KAWS in the Asian city state, has apologized for the “embarrassment and/or distress” inflicted on the exhibition’s organizers, Hong Kong agency AllRightsReserved (ARR), as part of an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThe drama started last November, when the foundation’s directors—Ryan Su, a lawyer and art collector in Singapore, and Adrian Chan—obtained an interim injunction against ARR to block “KAWS: Holiday Singapore,” from opening at The Float at Marina Bay. The wildly popular free show featured a 140-foot inflatable Companion sculpture by the famed Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, also known as KAWS.\n\nThe non-profit claimed it was involved in the initial planning for the show, and accusing ARR of breaching its intellectual property rights and misusing confidential information. In addition to stopping the exhibition, the injunction also hit pause on the sale and distribution of related merchandise, as well as promotional activities.\n\nBut now, in a letter obtained by Artnet News, Su and Chan now say the allegations they made against ARR, including the misuse of confidential information and copyright infringement, were incorrect.\n\n“ARR had the right to organize and conduct the Exhibition in Singapore,” the statement read. “We apologise for any embarrassment and/or distress that the Allegations have caused to ARR and its officers.”\n\nThe apology comes months after the courts sided with ARR, which has been organizing the “Holiday” world tour since 2018 in Seoul. Two days after issuing the injunction, the court reversed it after hearing arguments from ARR’s legal team, and the show was back on track on November 15. The court also ordered the Ryan Foundation to pay the Hong Kong agency’s legal costs.\n\nBut the foundation did not back down, vowing to proceed with a full trial. The legal disputes between the Ryan Foundation and ARR continued to escalate, with ARR countersuing the foundation and its directors for defamation. A settlement was finally reached during a mediation that took place on September 21—exactly 10 months after the Singapore exhibition concluded. As part of the deal, ARR has dropped its defamation charges against the foundation.\n\n“We would like to thank our long-time collaborator, acclaimed contemporary artist KAWS, partners and friends who have remained steadfast in their support of us throughout,” ARR said in a statement. “We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and colossal support for the Exhibition from the most affectionate Singaporeans. We hope to return to the city and meet you all very soon.”\n\nBeyond the public apology, no further details, including whether the Ryan Foundation will still have to pay ARR’s legal costs, have been disclosed.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:",
    "Ocon: 2022 F1 cars like ‘go karts on kerbs’ in Singapore": "The new cars have been already proved to be tricky at similar temporary venues such as Montreal and Baku earlier this season.\n\nWhile bouncing has to some degree been dialled out at recent events, it is expected to be more prominent once again in Singapore, which F1 will visit next weekend for the first time since 2019.\n\n\"It's going to be very bumpy,” said Ocon. “A big challenge I think for us, very physical. I love Singapore. But the track itself is not my favourite. They are go-karts on kerbs, it's going to be a tricky one.\n\n\"It's not going to be fun. But we're up for the challenge. And I think it's going to be interesting also to see who chooses what, in terms of set-up. If you go for the car that rides well, or the car that has grip.\"\n\nAsked if it might be the worst track of year, he said: \"I think Canada has been pretty bad. But probably it will be one of the worst ones. It always is, it's not news.\"\n\nGeorge Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nMercedes believes that Singapore track will be more suited to the W13 than other recent venues, but George Russell acknowledged that the bumpy layout could be an issue for the team.\n\n“I think, on paper, Singapore should suit our car,” said Russell. “But when we look back at the street circuits of Monaco and Azerbaijan, our car doesn't fare too well over the bumps.\n\n“So, we're not too sure how it will fall out. But we need to keep on pushing, keep on improving the car and I'm pleased that we've got a clear direction we need to go now.”\n\nMercedes technical director Mike Elliott agreed that Singapore should be good for the W13.\n\n“I think when you look back at the learning we have gathered over the season I think we expect that Singapore will be a bit more like we’ve seen in Budapest and Zandvoort,” he said.\n\n“It’s a bumpy circuit which is going to provide its challenges, but in terms of the nature of the corners we think it could be a bit better for our car. So, hopefully we will have a good result there.\n\n“As always with all the pre-simulation work we need to do, we will maximise our learning in the practice sessions and hopefully we turn that into a good result over the weekend.\"",
    "Singapore tops financial inclusivity rankings": "Singapore ranks number one globally for financial inclusivity, according to the inaugural Global Financial Inclusion Index, published by investment management and insurance company Principal Financial Group and UK-based think tank the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion is defined as individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. The UN identifies financial inclusion as an enabler for economic growth as well as a key component in several of its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe index examined 42 markets globally, ranking them for financial inclusivity based on three pillars – government support, financial system support and employer support – and looking at the extent to which each of these pillars enables a market’s population to achieve financial inclusivity.\n\nGovernment support rates, among other things, the existence and coverage of deposit schemes and the scope of consumer protection, while financial system support looks at use of real-time payments, fintech developments and access to credit and bank accounts. Employer support examines employee pension contributions and employee insurance programmes.\n\nSingapore topped the index largely due to strong scores in the government and financial system support pillars, ranking first and third respectively. It fared less well in the employer support pillar, where it finished 14th.\n\nIts high score in the government support pillar was largely due to its streamlined corporate tax system, while it also had a strong showing in the education and employment indicators. It performed less well for the availability of government-provided financial education and deposit protection scheme indicators.\n\nIts high ranking in financial system support was largely due to the relative ease of access to credit, a high percentage of the population having access to bank accounts and the strength of its fintech sector. It scored less well for enabling SME growth.\n\nIn employer support, it ranked sixth for employee pension contributions but lower for the rest of the pillar’s indicators.\n\nHong Kong ranked fourth overall in the financial inclusivity index and was the only market to rank in the top 10 across all three pillars.",
    "Singapore strives to remain relevant amid regulatory tightening for retail investors": "Singapore's largest bank, DBS, has announced another move to expand its crypto services while remaining cautious in complying with the financial authorities' view that crypto assets are not suitable for retail investors in the country.\n\nOn Friday, the bank disclosed its decision to expand crypto trading services on its digital exchange (DDEx) to approximately 100,000 \"wealth clients who are accredited investors.\" Investors who are considered accredited must meet certain criteria regarding their income, net worth, qualifications and understanding of financial markets.\n\nCaroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis, noted:\n\n\"Singapore has long indicated that it views most crypto assets as volatile and as a result, not well-suited to retail investors. At the same time though, it continues to indicate its support for DLT-based innovation, such as in the area of asset tokenization.\"\n\nPreviously, the DDEx was only available to corporate and institutional investors, family offices and DBS Private Bank and Treasures Private Client customers. DBS is also a trust anchor for the pilot Project Guardian in Singapore, a blockchain-based liquidity pool of tokenized bonds and deposits for borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nThe move comes after dramatic months for the crypto space in the country that was once ranked as the most crypto-friendly in the world due to its positive legislative environment. In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)’s chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, said in an interview that “if somebody has done a bad thing [in the cryptocurrency industry], we are brutal and unrelentingly hard.”\n\nAnother chapter in the regulatory tightening came weeks later, as the authority sent detailed questionnaires to some applicants and holders of the MAS’ Digital Payment Token licenses, reportedly seeking “highly granular information” about business activities. The questions included top tokens owned and staked via DeFi protocols and aimed to intensify the spotlight on crypto firms amid upcoming regulations.\n\nThe new framework responds to issues with liquidity and withdrawals that have occurred with firms in the country this year. During this crypto winter, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) went bankrupt after failing to meet margin calls in mid-June.\n\n\"After recent events, from the Terra-Luna crash, to 3AC, and also the Hodlnaut exchange collapse, I expect we will see more such measures, aimed at further protecting consumers in the crypto asset market, in the future.\"\n\nThe updated regulatory approach does not seem sufficient to keep crypto firms out of the country. RRMine Global, a Filecoin service provider, recently announced that it has shut down business operations in mainland China and is relocating its headquarters to Singapore after Chinese restrictions narrowed operations for Web3 companies.\n\nNext week, Singapore will host Token2049, an industry conference that was held in Hong Kong before the pandemic. The event is expected to receive over 5,000 attendees, according to its organization.",
    "Google wants to help Singapore firms tap data, AI responsibly": "Google wants to provide Singapore organisations with the cloud tools and skills they need to tap data for greater efficiencies and better service delivery. It also hopes to help them leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and to do so responsibly, based on its own set of best practices and principles.\n\nWith organisations worldwide digitally transforming their business, including those in Singapore and Malaysia, the US cloud vendor is keen to figure out how its technology and infrastructure can facilitate their efforts.\n\nData, specifically, will prove critical in enabling companies to tap new opportunities in a digital economy, said Google Cloud's Singapore and Malaysia country director, Sherie Ng, in an interview with ZDNET.\n\nShe said businesses would need to figure out how to leverage data to better understand and serve customers as well as to reduce inefficiencies and improve work processes. The ability to generate insights from the right data also would be essential for companies to not only birth new businesses and products and services, but also identify ways to measure and reduce their energy consumption and costs, Ng said.\n\nThis meant building digital infrastructures that were global in scale and able to support real-time access to data, she noted. She added that organisations in some markets such as Singapore now were looking to gain more value from their cloud adoption as they moved up the model.\n\n\"They're interested not just in moving workloads to the cloud. We're seeing customers that want to be truly cloud-native,\" she said. These organisations were building their DevOps teams and deploying cloud-native technologies, such as containers and Kubernetes, Ng added.\n\nIn doing so, however, they faced challenges in finding the right talent and skillsets to help them transform into cloud-native environments, she said. This was an area Google hoped to address through schemes such as the Skills Ignition SG training programme, which was introduced in 2020, and developer hubs for startups, she noted.\n\nGoogle also aimed to offer the technology that could establish the transparency businesses needed, for instance, in measuring their carbon footprint, she said, adding that an organisation's entire ecosystem should be sustainable, including its core infrastructure and supply chain.\n\nNg, who took on her current role in December 2021 from Microsoft where she was public sector general manager, said her top priority for the next couple of years was to enable companies in the two Asian markets to transform not just digitally, but also to do so on a green and sustainable foundation.\n\nIn Singapore, this encompassed working with the government on AI research and competency building, where Google would offer training resources and certification schemes to build proficiencies in AI and machine learning amongst local public-sector officers.\n\nIn addition, the cloud vendor would support the government's initiatives in driving AI governance and ethics in sectors such as finance. Google had contributed to Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework and self-assessment guide for businesses, and sat on the country's Advisory Council of the Ethical Use of AI.\n\nNg noted that AI was an important technology, but needed effective regulation to ensure it was used for good. Echoing the Singapore government's call for \"guard rails\", she said these were necessary to instil responsible use of AI.\n\n\"And there will be conversations about what works for Singapore as a country...every country will have its nuances,\" she said, adding that Google was keen to share its own AI best practices and principles that it had adopted globally. Data that it uses, for instance, must be inclusive to mitigate the risk of bias. Humans also are involved in final decisions to establish accountability.\n\nGoogle itself had to deal with some controversy involving its ethical AI unit, when it fired a team member last year due to--the company said--violations of its code of conduct and security policies. Reports suggested the move was related to another researcher's departure over her criticism Google was \"silencing marginalised voices\" and she had co-authored a research paper urging tech giants to ensure AI language systems did not promote gender bias.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE",

(PHOTO: HSA)\n\nSINGAPORE — Seventeen people, aged between 20 and 39, have been fined a total of $114,500 for selling e-vaporisers and related components in Singapore, said the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Monday (26 September).\n\nFive of them also received jail terms of 10 to 26 days, while three were sentenced to 12 to 24 months' probation. All of them were convicted in court between February and August, HSA said in a press release.\n\nThe offenders had bought the illegal products from overseas and sold them on local social media and e-commerce platforms, HSA said. More than $170,000 worth of the products were seized.\n\nAmong the 17 offenders, the highest fine of $23,000 was given to Chelsea Tan Yan Qi, 24, who served 50 days’ jail as she could not pay the fine, it added.\n\nTan received help from her husband and an employee to smuggle the products from Johor Bahru into Singapore, which she sold on Telegram. She and her accomplices would use a rented car to transport her supplies.\n\nOn a few occasions, an e-vaporiser supplier in Johor Bahru had helped Tan to hide the illegal products in the door panels of the car to evade detection, said HSA. Tan's accomplices have been dealt with separately.\n\nOne of the 17 convicted, Yang Jing Tao, 21, is a repeat offender who was earlier caught selling e-vaporisers on Carousell in 2018. He was then issued with a conditional warning, under which he was not allowed to be involved in any criminal conduct for 24 months.\n\nBetween August and September 2019, Yang committed new offences by importing e-vaporiser components. He was placed under supervised probation of 12 months for his offences, HSA said.\n\n\"HSA conducts active online surveillance and will continue to take strong enforcement actions against those selling e-vaporisers and related components. We also work closely with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority to monitor and stop illegal imports of e-vaporisers and related components,\" it added.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, 70 people were prosecuted for selling e-vaporisers and their related components, said HSA. The highest fine meted out so far for such offences was $99,000.\n\nFrom 1 February 2018 to 31 December 2021, 6,842 people were caught for the possession and use of e-vaporisers and their related components.\n\nSome 12,300 e-vaporisers, around 4,500 e-liquids and about 175,000 pods and components – with a total street value of about $1.9 million – were destroyed by authorities last year.\n\nFor selling, possessing for sale, importing or distributing e-vaporisers and their related components, offenders can be fined up to $10,000, or jailed up to six months or both for the first offence.\n\nRepeat offenders can face a fine of up to $20,000 or up to 12 months' jail or both.\n\nSince 1 February 2018, those who possess, purchase or use e-vaporisers and their related components can be fined up to $2,000 per offence.\n\nMembers of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale, or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can submit a report at go.gov.sg/reporttobaccooffences.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "Singapore has announced ambitious plans to greenify the city-state by 2030": "Singapore, with nearly half of its land allocated to parks and gardens, is often touted as one of the greenest cities in the world. From a distance, the wild vertical gardens climbing up buildings and the miles of leafy corridors connecting major parks look effortless, like nature has been allowed to just do its thing. But as any Singaporean will tell you, nothing on this small, densely populated island can be attributed to chance.\n\nIndeed, Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister, launched the idea of Singapore as a garden city back in 1967. The initiative started as a tree-planting drive, but by 1992 it had taken the form of a sustainability blueprint called the Singapore Green Plan (SGP), which last year was updated as SGP 2030.\n\nOrganised around five pillars of improvement for the next decade, SGP 2030 aims to promote development of the city while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing public adoption of cleaner forms of energy, such as solar.\n\nThese lofty ambitions are supported by hyper-detailed, concrete targets that touch on nearly every aspect of life. There are laudable short-term goals, like developing more than 300 acres of new parks and ensuring that every household is within a 10-minute walk of green space; tripling the number of cycling trails; developing a circular economy (like turning ash from trash incinerators into a sand alternative used for concrete); and requiring all new car registrations to be clean-energy vehicles.\n\nWhat's more impressive is the long-term investment that the plan sets out, like funding training programs for future jobs in sustainable building, solar technology and green finance. It's a tall order, but if any nation can meet these goals by 2030, it's the one that went from a colony to a global financial, shipping, and shopping juggernaut in a single generation.\n\nThis article appeared in the October 2022 issue of Condé Nast Traveller, and was originally published on Condé Nast Traveler.

    "How Albon’s ambitious bid to recover for Singapore is going": "Alex Albon has stepped up his recovery efforts following the complications of his appendicitis surgery in a bid to be fit for Formula 1’s Singapore Grand Prix next week.\n\nThe Williams driver was forced to miss the Italian Grand Prix after being diagnosed with appendicitis on the Saturday morning.\n\nHe was treated at San Gerardo hospital in Italy and had laparoscopic surgery later that day.\n\nHowever, Albon then ended up in intensive care after suffering “post-operative anaesthetic complications, which led to respiratory failure”.\n\nHe fortunately made swift progress after being re-intubated and was removed from mechanical ventilation, before being transferred to a general ward and then returning home to Monaco in the following week.\n\nAlbon is understood to have suffered no further complications, aiding his efforts to race again in Singapore.\n\nHe set that target swiftly after returning home although when he released a public video message six days after his admission to hospital, Albon admitted it would be “tough”.\n\n“It’s one of the toughest races that we go to, so not an easy one, but let’s aim high and see what happens,” he said at the time.\n\nThe Race understands that Albon’s goal is still to race in Singapore next week. It is part of an Asian double-header, with the Japanese Grand Prix following one week later.\n\nAlbon has increased his fitness preparation this week and while it is a major challenge to be ready for one of F1’s most physically-demanding races, he is believed to be determined to race if he can.\n\nSingapore’s 3.1-mile Marina Bay street circuit is a slow-speed track but it requires immense concentration and is widely regarded as one of the most mentally-taxing grands prix.\n\nAnd even though the race takes place at night it is usually around 30 degrees with high humidity, making it gruelling from a physical standpoint as well.\n\nThe good and bad of each Williams option to replace Latifi Read more\n\nAlbon has had an intense week of training and recovery but is not going to compromise his preparation to compete in Singapore.\n\nHe will only drive if ready and Williams is prepared to give Albon as much time as possible to recover.\n\nA decision is likely to be made early next week. Reserve driver Nyck de Vries, who deputised for Albon in Italy and scored points on his F1 debut in the process, is preparing for another potential substitute appearance if needed.\n\nThe Race says\n\nWhile the exact prognosis for Albon’s recovery will only be known by a few people we can safely conclude he has set an aggressive target to race in Singapore.\n\nRecovery time from keyhole surgery after appendicitis, with or without complications, is going to vary from person to person. As a sportsperson Albon is obviously very fit which will no doubt expedite his return to full health.\n\nBut his version of “full health” will be different as well. He may have a swifter route to “normal activities” than most people but Albon needs to return to a level of fitness that goes beyond normal activities.\n\nThe favourites for each remaining seat on the 2023 F1 grid Read more\n\nReading about recovery from his surgery (even without the respiratory failure complications and slightly extended time in hospital including a stint in intensive care), and also consulting a medical professional, a conservative estimate is that even a fit person like Albon would normally be best to wait weeks (plural) before physically exerting himself at a high level. That covers weight-related stress (heavy lifting, which driving an F1 car in Singapore would certainly qualify as) but also engaging the abdominal muscles (and being a racing driver certainly puts stress on the core).\n\nThe bottom line: don’t underestimate what Albon is trying to achieve. Especially when he has no reason to on the surface. He’s not fighting for anything in the championship, his future is secured, Williams doesn’t exactly have Monza levels of expectation for Singapore (probably a good reason for Italy super-sub Nyck de Vries to avoid another call-up!) and there are more races to come in 2022.\n\nAlbon will not compromise his wider health to race next weekend and he also won’t cut corners to pretend he’s healthy. He’ll either be ready or not.\n\nIf he can’t drive, it will not be for the lack of trying.",

    "Singapore: New Code of Practice details Chief Executive, Director Workplace Safety and Health Statutory Duties": "The Code details the organisational systems and culture to be implemented by directors of all companies to show full compliance with the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006.\n\nIn brief\n\nThe Code of Practice: Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' Workplace Safety and Health Duties (\"Code\") will, when gazetted in October 2022, apply to all directors and equivalent officers involved in policy making and executive decisions for business affairs of companies in all industries, even for companies which have no manual work and little risk of physical injury.\n\nWhile this Code is not mandatory, MOM will consider directors who adopt its principles and measures to have taken reasonably practicable measures to uphold their workers' safety and health. In prosecutions for offences under the existing Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (WSHA 2006), directors may show proof of compliance with the Code as a mitigating factor for the court's consideration.\n\nWe provide below the background to this Code and a summary of the four principles and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) measures as to management conduct and policy making, diligence, disclosure and reporting, budget, and dedicated staffing to be adopted by individual directors on a continuing basis.\n\nBackground\n\nMOM has expressed extreme concern over the increase in workplace fatalities since the start of 2022, as compared to the whole of 2021 and in 2019 pre-COVID. Together with tripartite partners and industry stakeholders, MOM has taken the following steps to hold employers to higher WSH standards in an effort to reduce workplace the fatal injury rate to less than 1 per 100,000 workers by 2028:\n\nThe courts have also introduced a new sentencing framework with harsher penalties against employers that fail to ensure the health and safety of employees at work under the WSHA 2006; see our alert: Recent High Court decisions on employer liability for workplace safety offences and compensation for workplace injuries.\n\nHowever, MOM recognises that the inculcation of a safety culture, which underpins safe workplaces, must start with the senior management, who:\n\nSet the culture and allocate the resources within their organisations\n\nUltimately shape WSH practices throughout the company\n\nMOM earlier ran a public consultation on the proposed Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties, and expedited the ACOP from Q1 2023 to Q4 2022. On conclusion of the public consultation and industry engagements on 8 September 2022, MOM and WSH Council have reviewed the feedback received and will gazette and bring into effect the finalised document by October 2022.\n\nThe law already places WSH responsibilities on company leadership, with section 48(1) of the WSHA 2006 obliging all officers of a company, including directors, to:\n\nEnsure their workers' safety and health\n\nProve they had exercised due diligence to prevent workplace incidents\n\nThe Code outlines the desired outcomes in organisational systems and culture that directors should seek to achieve in order to comply with section 48(1), and while directors should assess the relevance of the measures cited in the Code to their organisations, including industry type and nature of exposure to risks and hazards, the directors nonethless adopt and adapt the recommended practices that best suit the nature of work in their sector and organisation.\n\nUnder the following four principles:\n\nIntegrate WSH into business decisions and ensure clarity in directors' roles and responsibilities in leading WSH\n\nContinuously build a strong WSH culture, set the tone and demonstrate visible leadership in embodying and communicating highly effective workplace safety and health standards\n\nEnsure WSH management systems are effective and reviewed regularly\n\nEmpower workers to be actively engaged in WSH\n\nthe Code lists reasonably practicable steps that directors can take to realise the desired organisational WSH systems and culture.\n\nWe summarise these measures below:",
    "Hafnia taps F-drones for deliveries in Singapore": "Singapore shipowner Hafnia has entered into an agreement with compatriot autonomous drone startup F-drones to use drones for deliveries to its Singapore-based vessels.\n\nThe Oslo-listed product tanker unit of BW Group said the move would enable the company to rely less on the use of boats to deliver smaller loads to vessels and thereby reduce CO2 emissions with every trip.\n\nHafnia carried out a successful test of using drones to deliver small payloads to its vessels in Singapore in June 2020. Further tests were conducted in 2022 with F-drones with a higher range, leading to an official deal for drone deliveries to vessels anchored in Singapore “depending on the right circumstances”.\n\nSingapore has been trialing drone deliveries for quite some time. In 2020, F-drones was the first company in Singapore to receive authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to conduct beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone deliveries to ships in Singapore, with Eastern Pacific Shipping as its first paying customer. The company in March teamed up with fellow offshore vessel owner and operator Marco Polo Marine to co-develop what are claimed to be the world’s first large-scale, electric aerial delivery drones for offshore wind farms.\n\nAlso earlier this year, Singapore’s sole multipurpose port, Jurong, joined forces with advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure developer and drone operator Skyports to explore the development of ship-to-shore infrastructure.",

There was some hope the Silver Arrows could be quick after Hamilton challenged at the last high-downforce circuit, Zandvoort.\n\nRussell has previously suggested Singapore should “suit our car\" on paper but it appears he has since changed his mind. The former Williams star stressed that Mercedes have been poor at street circuits after difficult weekends in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan. Except for Russell’s P3 in Baku, Mercedes have not scored another podium at a street circuit all year. Russell said: “I’m not too sure; there’s no stand-outs that really spring to mind. “Singapore could be interesting, but historically it’s a circuit where Mercedes have struggled a little bit, and we know at street circuits this year we haven’t fared so well.” READ MORE: Lewis Hamilton offered Singapore Grand Prix hope by Mercedes\n\nGeorge Russell has warned Lewis Hamilton about Mercedes chances\n\nMercedes have picked up four wins at the Marina Bay Street Circuit since 2014.

    "Singapore factory output sees weakest growth in 11 months as electronics production falls": "SINGAPORE - The growth in Singapore's manufacturing output slowed further in August, as production in the key electronics sector shrank for a second month in a row.\n\nWeakness in the electronics cluster, which represents 40 per cent of Singapore’s industrial output, may drag the overall performance of the export-driven economy as rising inflation and interest rate hikes suppress consumer demand worldwide, analysts said.\n\nTotal output grew 0.5 per cent last month year on year after a revised 0.8 per cent expansion in July, according to data released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Monday.\n\nThe pace of growth in August was the slowest since September 2021, when output declined by 2 per cent.\n\nExcluding biomedical manufacturing, output shrank 1.2 per cent, EDB said.\n\nHowever, the overall output growth was better than the 0.7 per cent drop analysts had predicted in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nThe key electronics sector saw its production declining by 7.8 per cent, more than the 5.9 per cent drop in July.\n\nAll segments within the sector recorded a fall in output on the back of softening demand, led by a 19.3 per cent slide in the production of electronic modules and components.\n\nInfocomms and consumer electronics output fell 11.7 per cent, followed by a 6.6 per cent drop for semiconductors - a third straight month of decline - and a 5.5 per cent fall in computer peripherals and data storage.\n\nConcerns of a sharp global semiconductor down cycle have been on the rise after major chip companies, such as Micron, Intel, and Nvidia, predicted a weaker demand outlook for the sector through 2022 and probably 2023 as well.\n\nChemicals output decreased 11.2 per cent, as the specialties chemicals segment posted a 14 per cent drop.\n\nStill, the petroleum segment grew 8.1 per cent on account of higher demand for jet fuel driven by the relaxation of global air travel restrictions.\n\nBoth the electronics and chemicals sectors have been hit by slowing global demand, especially from China, which accounts for nearly 15 per cent of Singapore's exports.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed to 2.6 per cent in the first half, nearly half of the 5.5 per cent target set by Beijing for the whole of 2022.",

    "Second bite of the cherry in England after divorce litigation in Singapore?": "Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (“Part III”) permits further financial provision to be made by the English Court after divorce and financial orders have been made overseas. In this important and developing area of English family law, the cases of Hasan v Ul Hasan (Deceased) Anor [2021] EWHC 1791 (Fam) and Potanina v Potanin 2021 EWCA Civ 702 have both received permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on different aspects of Part III and are expected to be heard this autumn.\n\nIn Vew v Vev [2022] SGCA 34 the Court of Appeal in Singapore had to decide whether to continue an anti-suit injunction (“ASI”) in favour of the husband, which would prevent his former wife from bringing a Part III claim in England following their earlier divorce in Singapore. Within the Singapore divorce proceedings, the court had excluded a valuable property in London in the husband’s sole name, deciding that it did not fall into the pool of matrimonial assets. It was against this property that the wife made her Part III claim, relying on the provision in Part III which gives the English court jurisdiction over a dwelling-house which was, at some time during the marriage, a matrimonial home. The husband obtained an ASI at first instance in Singapore to prevent her from pursuing this claim on grounds she would be re-litigating an issue which had already been determined by the court in Singapore, taking a “second bite of the cherry” after the Singapore court had excluded the property from any matrimonial claims, and such litigation would be vexatious and oppressive.\n\nThe wife succeeded in having the ASI lifted to enable her to pursue her claim in England. The Court of Appeal in Singapore took the view that there had been no re-litigation as the Part III claim only concerned an asset which was not included, or divided, in the Singapore divorce proceedings and, for reasons of international comity, it should not interfere with the Part III process in England.\n\nThe Singapore Court of Appeal acknowledged that Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (2009) (“the Women’s Charter”) was modelled on Part III by the Singapore legislature; the purpose of both being to provide further financial provision where no, or no adequate, provision had been made for a spouse in overseas divorce proceedings. In England, this followed a Law Commission Report in 1982 which highlighted the potential unfairness, particularly to women and children, given the liberality of recognition in England of divorce orders made overseas, which then prevented the English Court from making financial provision orders on divorce. The same issue that led to the enactment of Part III was also recognised in Singapore around the 1990s and, in 2009, the Singapore Law Reform Committee recommended amending the Women’s Charter to plug this particular lacuna in Singapore family law.",
    "Opinion | I Have Worked, Played and Loved in Other Countries Because I Can’t at Home": "The idea of reducing that children’s book and its gentle cartoon penguins to pulp felt deeply personal, a reminder of how vulnerable we are to the cruel impulses of our fellow citizens.\n\nSingapore wasn’t always so suffocating.\n\nThe city’s Bugis Street nightlife district was notorious in the 1950s and 1960s for the foreign visitors who cavorted with transgender prostitutes and attended bawdy cabarets. Most other expressions of queer desire were relegated to dark alleys and toilets, but law enforcement largely left people alone.\n\nBut in the 1980s and 1990s, the state began actively policing homosexuality. Police lured gay men with handsome undercover officers and arrested them. Twelve men were arrested in a raid in 1993 and sentenced to jail time and strokes by the rattan cane.\n\nThis has stopped, but that virulent homophobia lingers in our psyche. In the mid-2000s, I was active on a gay forum called SGBOY, where teenagers like me would flirt and gossip. One day, a private message from a stranger in his 40s warned me: “Be careful. It’s not safe to be so ‘out.’”\n\nThat seemed melodramatic. Only much later, when I learned about previous police raids, did I understand his message of care and wisdom. I often think about this man. Had he only ever known desire in the context of shame and danger? Had he lost friends, seen lovers brutalized?\n\nSingapore queers today are heirs to his shame, especially those who still hide their faces on apps, who don’t meet my eyes when we hook up for sex. Many couples are still anxious about public displays of affection even after years of being together.",
    "The Big Read: Amid intensifying global talent war, Singapore faces juggling act in hunt for world's best and brightest": "Ethos BeathChapman's Mr Kochar pointed out that \"when it comes to starting something new that has not been done before by the firm, it cannot be done by just one top executive\".\n\nHe said: \"They would need their own ‘army’, if not 100 per cent at least 20 or 30 per cent (of a team).\"\n\nBut he added: \"(The rollout of) ONE Pass is also about saying … we have a working army, now we’re getting a leader to lead the army.”\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF WOOING ELITE GLOBAL TALENTS\n\nEarlier this month, Dr Tan said in Parliament that as part of Singapore's global talent \"offensive\", agencies such as the National Arts Council and Ministry of Education will help identify not just high-earners but \"exceptional talent\" in fields such as the arts, sports and science,\n\nThese high-achievers will not need to meet the S$30,000 monthly salary criterion for ONE Pass, and will help push Singapore to “new frontiers, draw in greater investments … (and) create a very diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans”, said the Manpower Minister.\n\nMr Song of CIMB bank said this signals Singapore’s effort to support the growth of non-business fields, given that their top talents will be accorded similar treatment with business leaders in terms of work passes.\n\nHowever, there are concerns from some of those interviewed about potential side effects of Singapore's targeted strategy of going after top-tier talents, be in business or other fields.\n\n“I would argue that by setting it up as some sort of ‘platinum card’ may cause envy and resentment down the line,” said Mr Black of Blackbox.\n\n“Even if the numbers accepted are relatively small, talented (locals) may feel, rightly or wrongly, that such a scheme means they will be overlooked for top jobs in favour of a foreigner,” he said.\n\nMr Black's views were echoed by sociologists interviewed.\n\nAssociate Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Social Sciences said that the ONE Pass initiative may inadvertently \"be seen as creating a two-tiered workforce, even among foreign skilled professionals working here\".\n\nShe also expressed concern that it may lead to a situation where a company would lean towards parachuting readily available top talents from elsewhere to take up apex roles, instead of investing time and resources in training Singaporeans to move up the ladder.\n\nDr Rebecca Grace Tan from National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Humanities and Sciences said that while the ONE Pass is currently “quite restrictive” in terms of qualification criteria and validity period, “it is not clear that the incentives for foreigners will stop here”, as Singapore continues to be in a “global talent arms race”.\n\n“This is especially so given the hypermobility of the super-rich. For example, James Dyson moved to Singapore in 2019 and returned back to the United Kingdom in 2021,” she said.\n\n“Instead, we are likely to see more and more incentives rolled out to attract and retain foreign talent, much like what we saw in Europe which accumulated in the provision of permanent residency based on how much migrants invested.\"\n\nQuestions on ensuring skills transfer have also been raised in Parliament, with MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asking if such training requirements can be codified into law, while other MPs suggested time-limited EPs to ensure skills transfer.\n\nIn response, Dr Tan cautioned “against too deterministic an approach” as skills transfer is not a simple or linear process.\n\nOver the years, government leaders have repeatedly stressed that developing local talents remains a priority, even as it taps on the global skilled workforce to help drive the economy.\n\nMost recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that investing heavily in human capital locally “has and will continue to be a cornerstone\" of the Government's development strategy.\n\nMr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, was speaking last week at the launch of the financial services sector's second industry transformation map. At the launch, it was also announced that S$400 million has been committed to developing local professionals as part of the sector's five-year blueprint.\n\nMeanwhile, a constant bugbear when it comes to discussing the presence of foreign talents here is the concern over housing and rental prices.\n\nProperty analysts cautioned that the push to attract global talents, especially the top tier ones, would drive up demand for housing in Singapore.\n\nMs Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, expects the rental market to feel the impact first, “especially for the luxury segment given (the top global talents') high salaries and expat packages”.\n\nAgreeing, Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director for research at Huttons Asia, said that rentals for other market segments will probably rise as well, albeit to a lesser degree than luxury homes.\n\nMr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA, said it might be too early to talk about the impact of the ONE Pass initiative on the property market. Nevertheless, he noted that foreign buyers “are already active in buying and selling high-end residential properties”.\n\n\n\nMr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Group, cited official data which showed that 180 new homes were bought by foreigners in the second quarter of this year. “This was the highest number of units purchased by foreigners since the third quarter of 2019, when there were a total of 182 units transacted,” he added.",

    "Angela Lee: ‘Singapore is in my blood’!": "Angela Lee is eligible to represent at least four different countries. But the majority of the 26 year old’s fights have taken place in Singapore and the nation holds a special place in her heart.\n\nHer father, Ken Lee, was born there and she says it is her favourite place to fight,\n\n“I love fighting in Singapore. I feel like I always have the hometown advantage.” she told ONEFC.com.\n\nOn Saturday morning (local time) she faces Xiong Jing Nan in the main event of ONE on Prime Video 2. The two have faced each other twice before but both bouts took place in Tokyo.\n\n“My dad was born in Singapore, it’s just in my blood. So it doesn’t matter where I live or where I was born, it’s part of who I am, my blood, my race,” she said.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Angela Lee Pucci (@angelaleemma)\n\nProud Singaporean\n\nShe proudly flies the Singaporean flag when she fights and Lee says she is motivated by the knowledge that her relatives there will be in he crowd to support her,\n\n“I know that my family is going to be in the crowd cheering me on. It always gives me huge motivation.”\n\n“It stirs up a lot of different emotions. I am so familiar with the Singapore Indoor Stadium, walking through those halls and being in that environment.\n\n“It’s very, very familiar, so it feels right at home, and I know that I’ve gotten through this so many times. It’s definitely going to be an iconic moment on October 1.”\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Angela Lee Pucci (@angelaleemma)\n\nWinning record\n\nLee has fought in the Singapore Indoor Stadium six times and has a 100% winning record. She won the atomweight title there in 2016 and has held that belt ever since.\n\nShe might be fighting on a Saturday morning for the first time but the environment is one she feels right at home in,\n\n“It stirs up a lot of different emotions. I am so familiar with the Singapore Indoor Stadium, walking through those halls and being in that environment. It’s very, very familiar, so it feels right at home, and I know that I’ve gotten through this so many times.”\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Angela Lee Pucci (@angelaleemma)\n\nOnly blemish\n\nThe only blemish on Lee’s otherwise spotless record comes from a pair of losses at strawweight in 2019. Despite that she has been handed at Xiong who is the division’s first and only champion.\n\nHer opponent stated that Lee does not deserve a shot and she knows that losing a third strawweight fight in succession would all but end her chances of becoming a two division champion,\n\n“Capturing the second title, becoming champ-champ, this is what I’ve been after for so many years. Now is finally the right time, everything’s lined up, and I need to capitalize on this moment and capture it, because if I don’t, I’m not going to get (another) chance to fight for this belt.”\n\nLee sees this as her final chance to win that elusive second belt and sounds very confident of success,\n\n“This is my last shot and of course, she’s going to be defending it with all she’s got. But I know that I’m going to be stealing this belt from her at the end of the night.”",
    "APPEC: Singapore to become the connection point for global carbon registries, says official": "Singapore has been selected to anchor a World Bank-initiated platform that connects information from carbon registries worldwide to enhance transparency and avoid double counting of mitigation outcomes, Low Yen Ling, Minister of State with Singapore's Ministry of Trade & Industry, said Sept. 26 at the APPEC Conference hosted by S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nNot registered?

A key challenge is how to consolidate information from all these domestic and international registries regarding carbon credit issuance, trading and retirement.\n\nThe platform, to be established under the World Bank's Climate Warehouse Initiative, is designed to consolidate different registries' carbon data to create a transparent marketplace on a global scale.\n\n\"It [Climate Warehouse Initiative] helps prevent double issuance and claiming of the same carbon credit in multiple registries by different actors,\" Low said in her speech.\n\nOnce the infrastructure is launched, Singapore will become the data backbone of the global carbon market, which will also promote carbon trading and carbon services in this city state and the ASEAN region.\n\nLow said there has already been growth in demand for carbon services in Singapore, and the government has devoted efforts to nurture more carbon professionals.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's website, the data infrastructure is expected to support services in both public and private sectors, providing aids to compliance reporting, carbon credit transactions and benchmarking services.\n\n\"Many companies continue to view Singapore as the commodity trading hub of choice,\" Low said in the speech, adding that besides trading of conventional commodities, more companies were starting to look at new areas like carbon and biofuels.\n\n\"We aim to nurture strong partnerships between global energy companies, including players like S&P Global Commodity Insights, providing transparency, pricing insights, and also the startup ecosystem to innovate, to co-create novel energy solutions,\" Low said.\n\nAt the APPEC Conference, Felipe Bayon, CEO of Ecopetrol, the largest and primary petroleum company in Colombia, said Ecopetrol established its first international trading office in Singapore this year and has plans for carbon trading in the city-state alongside its conventional trading activities.\n\nSing Fuels, a Singapore home-grown international trading company, is currently exploring plans to launch new desk in several areas including biofuels, fuel oil, LPG and carbon management services, Low said in the speech.\n\nFor access to latest carbon credit prices, commentaries and heards, visit PlattsLIVE.",

The Straits Times Index now rests just above the 3,225-point plateau and it's expected to see continued consolidation on Monday.\n\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is soft on continuing recession fears. The European and U.S. markets were sharply lower on Friday and now the Asian markets are tipped to open in similar fashion.\n\nThe STI finished sharply lower on Friday following losses from the financial shares and property stocks, while the industrials came in mixed.\n\nFor the day, the index dropped 35.97 points or 1.10 percent to finish at 3,227.10 after trading between 3,224.58 and 3,247.92. Volume was 1.33 billion shares worth 1.41 billion Singapore dollars.

For the week, the Dow dropped 4.0 percent, the NASDAQ plunged 5.1 percent and the S&P fell 4.7 percent.\n\nConcerns about the outlook for the global economy continued to weigh on Wall Street after aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks around the world. Traders remain concerned the central banks' efforts to combat elevated inflation will push the global economy into a recession.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 75 basis points earlier this week and signaled more significant rate hikes later this year.\n\nWhile the Fed's projections pointed to an eventually tapering of rate hikes by next year, traders worry about the outlook for the global economy in the months ahead.\n\nCrude oil prices fell sharply on Friday, pushing the most active crude futures contract to their lowest close in about seven months. Weak outlook for energy demand due to a possible global recession outweighed concerns about tight supplies. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for November ended lower by $4.75 or 5.7 percent at $78.74 a barrel, the lowest settlement since January.\n\nCloser to home, Singapore will release August data for industrial production later today, with forecasts suggesting an increase of 1.5 percent on month and a decline of 0.6 percent on year. That follows the 2.3 percent monthly decline and the 0.6 percent yearly gain in July.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",
