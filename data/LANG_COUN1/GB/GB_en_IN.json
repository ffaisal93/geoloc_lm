    "First Covid, now monkeypox – India’s role is key in the scramble for jabs": "Rishabh Kumar woke up in his California bedroom in a cold sweat. In the space of three weeks, the 37-year-old finance executive had lost his mother, best friend, brother-in-law and two cousins. They all died of Covid back home in India in April and May last year. The experience left him shattered and experiencing nightmares that continue to this day.\n\nOn this particular night last month, it was not thoughts of Covid tormenting him, but monkeypox, which had just been declared a health emergency in the US. Like many Indians at home and abroad, Kumar was worried for his country and the rest of his family.\n\nAt the root of Kumar’s concerns were frustration and anger over India’s missteps during the Delta wave in 2021, when the country’s crematoriums and graveyards were full of bodies and smoke from funeral pyres. India has the largest vaccine manufacturing capability in the world, yet a failure to order and produce enough Covid doses in time led to shortages and a slow rollout. His mother had had a single vaccine shot before she tested positive – the others he grieves for had none.\n\nThe world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production Ishwar Gilada\n\nNow, as monkeypox cases climb steadily around the world, India’s government has been relatively prepared, say public health experts. Researchers at the National Institute of Virology in the western city of Pune isolated the monkeypox virus in July. And the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s network of biomedical labs, has offered the isolated virus to private firms for the development of indigenous vaccines.\n\nHealth workers screen passengers arriving from abroad for monkeypox at Anna International Airport terminal in Chennai, 3 June 2022.

That’s a tiny fraction of the 61,000 known cases worldwide. Yet Covid has taught us that that could change. India’s vaccine preparedness matters not just for its population, but for the other developing nations dependent on its shots.\n\n“It doesn’t matter that India has only a few cases at the moment – the world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production,” says Ishwar Gilada, an infectious diseases specialist who set up India’s first Aids and HIV clinic in 1985.\n\nGlobally, monkeypox has killed fewer than two dozen people this year, according to the World Health Organization, and research suggests that the mortality rate is significantly lower than from Covid. Monkeypox spreads primarily through prolonged, direct contact with a patient, rather than through respiratory droplets or aerosols.\n\nStill, this is the first time the virus has spread widely to countries with no history of monkeypox: 104 nations have reported cases. And the global scramble for vaccines that marked the Covid pandemic has started with monkeypox, presenting a challenge for public health initiatives seeking funding, such as the Global Fund, which met on 21 September for its seventh replenishment conference.\n\nAn isolation ward built as a precautionary measure for monkeypox patients at a hospital in Ahmedabad, 25 July 2022. Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOnly one vaccine, for smallpox – Jynneos, produced by Danish firm Bavarian Nordic – has so far been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use against monkeypox.\n\nWealthy nations such as the US, UK and Australia, joined the queue for doses early but are already facing shortages. As with Covid, poorer countries risk falling far behind in accessing the vaccines. India is yet to order any.\n\n“Even if the government ordered vaccines today, the pile-up of demand is such that we aren’t going to get doses for many, many months,” says Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, and the first Indian woman elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n\nIndia’s efforts to develop indigenous vaccines for monkeypox could help it limit its dependence on Jynneos eventually, but that, too, will take time. “This isn’t going to yield vaccines soon either,” says Kang.\n\nIf the spread of monkeypox can be contained, mass vaccinations may not be needed, and some researchers suggest that a vaccine may not be needed at all – at least for now. T Jacob John, a paediatrician and virologist who was one of the founders of India’s successful polio vaccination programme, says: “If we could do well without a vaccine for HIV/Aids, we can manage here too.”\n\nHowever, in some ways monkeypox presents a challenge more complex than HIV, says Gilada. “There’s a double social stigma, especially in a conservative country like India.” It is a sexually transmitted disease – a vast majority of cases involve men who have sex with men. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the cases we’re seeing reported are just a tiny fraction of the actual number,” he says.\n\nWhile India waits for a homemade vaccine and for demand for Jynneos to ease up, its vast pharmaceutical industry should focus on developing antiviral treatments for monkeypox, Kang says.\n\nHealth workers test for the monkey pox virus at a molecular laboratory set up by the Tamil Nadu health department in Chennai. Photograph: Sri Loganathan/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nYet Covid brutally exposed a challenge that the government is still to address. “India does not fund research in sufficient amounts,” says John, meaning the private sector is left to take the risks. Even though the ICMR has invited private firms to join efforts to develop vaccines, it has not issued any research grants to incentivise their science.\n\nHowever, the way monkeypox is spread is a silver lining for India, says Gilada. Once a vaccine or antiviral is available, the country’s vast Aids-control network – consisting of 1,160 centres dedicated to treating sexually transmitted infections – could offer rapid frontline services. “We should be able to prioritise those who are most vulnerable, in settings where they already feel somewhat comfortable,” says Gilada.\n\nFor those traumatised by the unnecessary human losses of the Covid pandemic, the way India responds to monkeypox will be closely scrutinised.\n\nBack in San Jose, California, Kumar said it would be “unpardonable” if the Indian government were to repeat its Covid mistakes. “I hope they have learned their lessons,” he says. “I can’t deal with these nightmares any more.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n",

    "Heather Knight denies India’s Deepti Sharma gave Mankad warning": "Heather Knight, the England captain, has denied India’s Deepti Sharma repeatedly warned Charlie Dean before opting to Mankad her for the decisive wicket to win the third one-day international at Lord’s on Saturday.\n\n“The game is over, Charlie was dismissed legitimately,” Knight wrote on Twitter. “India were deserved winners of the match and the series. But no warnings were given.\n\n“They don’t need to be given, so it hasn’t made the dismissal any less legitimate. But if they’re comfortable with the decision to affect the run out, India shouldn’t feel the need to justify it by lying about warnings.”\n\nKnight’s tweets were in response to an interview given by Sharma on Monday at Kolkata airport, when she said the Mankad had been a deliberate “plan” against Dean, who – according to analysis carried out by Peter Della Penna of ESPNcricinfo – left the crease early 72 times in her innings.\n\n“We had warned her also,” Sharma said. “We did it according to the rules and guidelines. We told the umpires, but she was still there so we couldn’t do anything.”\n\nThe dismissal came in the 44th over of the ODI, when Dean and England’s No 11, Freya Davies, looked to be taking England to an unlikely win. From 118 for nine, chasing 170, Dean and Davies had steered England to within 17 runs of victory only for Sharma to pull out of her bowling action and remove the bails to end the match.\n\nDeepti Sharma’s method of dismissing Charlie Dean, running her out at the non-striker’s end, was legitimate but controversial. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images\n\nThe India captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, gave no indication on Saturday that her side had issued warnings to Dean, nor that they had consulted with the umpires. “I wasn’t aware [she was going to run her out],” she said.\n\nKnight is out injured with a hip injury but was present as a spectator. Last July, she was dismissed by Sharma in controversial circumstances, run out after a collision between the pair mid-pitch meant Knight was unable to get back into her crease at the non-striker’s end.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "'India has a big role to play': New Delhi is trying to turn the country into a chip powerhouse": "The government of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has looked to boost the country's chipmaking prowess. Money Sharma | AFP | Getty Images\n\nIndia could have a large role to play in the semiconductor industry, analysts say, as the world's fifth-largest economy looks to boost its domestic chip sector. Along with other countries like the U.S., India has been looking to forge strategic alliances around semiconductors, a critical technology that goes into many of the devices we use from smartphones to refrigerators. But India has also been making moves to bring the manufacturing of chips to the country and has laid out incentives for the industry. \"I think India has a crucial role to play,\" Pranay Kotasthane, chairperson of the high tech geopolitics program at the Takshashila Institution, told CNBC's \"Beyond the Valley\" podcast, published last week.\n\nIndia tries to woo giants\n\nThe issue for many countries looking to boost their chipmaking prowess is that the companies and countries that dominate the industry are few and far between. For example, Taiwan and South Korea make up about 80% of the global foundry market. Foundries are facilities that manufacture chips that other companies design.\n\nIndia has typically not been in the mix of the top countries for semiconductors. So there aren't many giant Indian chip firms and certainly no leading-edge manufacturing companies. While India might not have native semiconductor firms, it's plan under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi relies on trying to attract foreign giants. In December, India greenlit a $10 billion incentive plan for the semiconductor industry. Therefore, New Delhi's strategy seems to be twofold — lure in foreign companies and build on areas where India has an advantage.\n\nIndian strengths\n\nThe large amount of capital required, the time it takes to set up factories and uncertainty over the business, tax and trade environment has often put companies off setting up in India. \"Previous attempts in India failed because of apprehensions on these counts,\" Kotasthane said. However, there are signs that things are changing. \"The track record has been not great but the new government has been heading in the right direction ... [with] policies to drive impetus and attract leading semi and fab companies,\" Neil Shah, partner at tech consultancy Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nIndia's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world. Neil Shah Partner, Counterpoint Research\n\nIndia has a number of strengths which could back up its bid to be a global chipmaking hub. \"India's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world,\" Shah said. The analyst also said incentive plans will help. \"Also, India has loads of English speaking engineering talent and [a] cheaper labor force making it cost effective,\" Shah added. That well-educated and cheap labor force could help India in a specific area of the semiconductor supply chain — chip design — an area that requires a large number of skilled workers.\n\n\"I have no doubt that India has a big role to play,\" Kotasthane said. \"India has semiconductor humanpower. Semiconductor design requires large numbers of skilled engineers and this is where India's strength lies,\" he added. Kotasthane said that of the largest semiconductor firms in the world, eight have design houses in India. While also in the early stages, India is trying to boost its domestic companies to build technology. \"What we are now seeing from the Indian government side is trying to take the next step. We have design centers of international firms, but India doesn't have a lot of intellectual property, which can be termed Indian ... because these are companies from other countries which are doing this. So now, the next step is the effort to build an ecosystem where there is some Indian IP (intellectual property) by Indian companies,\" Kotasthane said.\n\nManufacturing in focus\n\nWhile design is one area the analysts say that India can find success, manufacturing is a little more difficult. In terms of the most cutting-edge chips, such as those in the latest flagship smartphones, Taiwan's TSMC dominates the manufacturing arena. India doesn't have any fabs, or semiconductor fabrication plants, which manufacture chips. However, the government has looked to woo foreign chipmakers. ISMC Digital, a consortium of investors, is planning to build a $3 billion manufacturing facility in India. Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company, would be the technology partner on that project.\n\nwatch now",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies India wants local GPS rival in smartphones; industry fears costs\n\nSmartphone players want delay to New Delhi's Jan. 2023 deadline\n\nSamsung, others say Indian system needs hardware changes-sources\n\nBoosting native system part of Modi's self-reliance campaign\n\nNEW DELHI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - India is pushing tech giants to make smartphones compatible with its home-grown navigation system within months, worrying the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple who fear elevated costs and disruptions as the move requires hardware changes, according to two industry sources and government documents seen by Reuters.\n\nIn line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for self-reliance, India has over the years expanded the use of its regional navigation satellite system called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).\n\nThe Indian government wants to reduce dependence on foreign systems, including the widely used U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), and says NavIC provides more accurate domestic navigation and that its use would benefit the economy.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nChina, the European Union, Japan and Russia have their own global or regional navigation systems to rival GPS. Operational since 2018, NavIC's uptake is minimal; it is mandated in public vehicle location trackers, for example.\n\nBut government and industry documents show Modi's administration and space officials want to broaden its use, and have this year pushed smartphone giants to make hardware changes to support NavIC, in addition to GPS, in new phones they will sell from January 2023.\n\nIn private meetings in August and September, representatives of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others pushed back, citing worries that making phones NavIC-compliant would mean higher research and production costs.\n\nThe changes would also require more testing clearances, which with a Jan. 1 deadline would disrupt businesses and planned launches, according to two smartphone industry sources and documents.\n\nSamsung declined comment on the meetings, while Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India's IT ministry and the space agency ISRO that are both involved in the project also did not respond.\n\nSamsung in particular voiced concerns during a Sept. 2 closed-door meeting between top smartphone players and chipmakers with Indian IT ministry and space agency officials, according to the meeting's minutes reviewed by Reuters.\n\nSamsung's India executive Binu George warned of cost worries, telling officials that NavIC support requires not just new smartphone chipsets but also many other components.\n\n\"This would add to cost as it requires hardware design changes and additional investments to support devices specific to India. Further, the companies have already prepared for models to be launched in 2024,\" the minutes quoted him as saying.\n\nGeorge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe smartphone players have sought time until 2025 to implement the changes, and a final decision is expected in coming days, a senior government official said.\n\nThe minutes said the Indian space agency will provide technical support for implementing NavIC in new smartphones, adding another meeting may be called.\n\nINDIA VS OTHERS\n\nIndia's space agency has said systems like GPS and Russia's GLONASS are operated by their countries' defence agencies, making it possible for civilian service to be interrupted.\n\nNavIC, it says, is fully under the control of the Indian government, which one day wants to take it global like GPS.\n\nIndia would not be the first country to push smartphone makers to add support for a native navigation system.\n\nRussia has sought to mandate inclusion of its own GLONASS system in smartphones sold locally to reduce reliance on GPS, which Washington can switch off for civilian subscribers as it did during military operations in Iraq.\n\nChina's Beidou was completed in June 2020, and, though not mandated, the official Xinhua news agency has reported that in 2021, 94.5% of China-made smartphones had Beidou support.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung together account for 38% of the smartphone market in India, the world's second biggest after China. Apple's more expensive smartphones have a roughly 3% share in India, data from Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint shows.\n\nOther Chinese manufactures making up a further 28% of the market were also present at the Sept. 2 meeting, government minutes show. China's Realme, which has a 16% market share, did not attend, and neither did smaller manufacturers.\n\nApple's website says it already supports the five global and regional navigation networks including GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou in current iPhones. The Indian directive could force it to add a new one.\n\nA key concern for players like Samsung and Xiaomi remains the higher cost of so-called dual band chipsets they would need to support both GPS and NavIC, as these companies are leaders in the sub-$200 category in India's price-sensitive market, the smartphone industry sources said.\n\nCHIPSET CONCERN\n\nFor procuring NavIC-compliant chipsets, most smartphone makers are reliant on global giants such as U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc (2454.TW).\n\nVoluntary use of such chipsets has been limited in India as phone manufacturers remain hesitant to add the extra components - and cost - required to make it work, said Parv Sharma, senior semiconducter analyst at Counterpoint.\n\nIndia's space agency said that by mid-2021, only about two dozen mobile handset models in India had NavIC capability. In total there are around 300, Counterpoint has said.\n\nDuring the Sept. 2 meeting, MediaTek said all of the company's chipsets for 5G phones would support NavIC, with \"some cost enhancement\" and additional hardware. MediaTek added that it expected about 80% of mobile phones to be 5G-enabled in two years.\n\nMediaTek declined to comment on Reuters queries. Qualcomm in a statement said it has been working with the Indian space agency to enable NavIC on its chipsets for years and will continue to do so.\n\nAnother lobbying push from smartphone players is to convince the Indian government to make NavIC available on the so-called L1 satellite frequency which is already used by GPS, and not onlyon the L5 frequency used by New Delhi.\n\nThat, executives say, will make it easier for manufacturers to integrate NavIC in chipsets which mostly support the L1 band the world over, curbing separate development costs for NavIC.\n\nIndian space agency ISRO told the Sept. 2 gathering that was not immediately possible, as NavIC was likely to be available on the L1 band only by 2024-25, after more satellite launches, the meeting's record shows.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "The people resurrecting India's ancient fruit trees": "It can take an entire village to grow a new-age garden. That’s what 42-year-old Shyju Machathi, a policeman living in Kannapuram in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, found out when his town was declared an \"Indigenous Mango Heritage Area\" by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board in 2020.\n\nThe honour came after the villagers had got together to grow over 200 indigenous species of mangoes, sourced from surrounding towns and villages, preserving diverse varieties that were in danger of dying out.\n\nThe technique that made it possible, Machathi says, is the age-old art of grafting. He started experimenting with the technique in July 2016, despite no formal training in farming, after an unfortunate incident shook the village of Kannapuram.\n\nA neighbour had hacked down a 200-year-old mango tree known locally as Vellathan, which grew in his home. \"The tree had produced the sweetest mangos I’ve ever tasted,\" says Machathi. \"It was exquisite, an endemic native variety that was very rare.\" But it was also undeniably old. Parts of the large tree would come hurtling to the ground, making it such a hazard that the neighbour decided that it needed to be chopped down for his peace of mind. \"The tree was so much a part of our growing years, the landscape of our lives that we were all just shocked over losing it overnight,\" says Machathi.\n\nStaring at the wasted branches the next morning, and feeling a deep sense of loss, Machathi reached out to a friend who was working as an agricultural officer with the Kerala government. There was a way to save the tree, his friend said. If they could graft portions of the tree onto a growing mango plant with a sturdy root, they could regenerate the old tree and one day, savour its exquisite fruit again.",

    "Russia’s allies China and India call for negotiations to end Ukraine war": "China and India have called for a negotiated end to the Ukraine war, stopping short of robust support for traditional ally Russia.\n\nAfter a week of pressure at the United Nations general assembly, Russia’s foreign minister took the general assembly rostrum to deliver a fiery rebuke to western nations for what he termed a “grotesque” campaign against Russians.\n\nBut no major nation has rallied behind Russia, including China, which just days before the February invasion of Ukraine had vowed an “unbreakable” bond with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nChina’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on Russia and Ukraine to “keep the crisis from spilling over” and from affecting developing countries.\n\nAny annexed territory will have Russia's ‘full protection’, says Sergei Lavrov – video\n\n“China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to facilitate talks for peace,” Wang said on Saturday.\n\n“The fundamental solution is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.”\n\nDuring his visit to the United Nations, Wang met Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in their first talks since the war began.\n\nEarlier this month Putin acknowledged Chinese “concerns” about Ukraine during a meeting with his counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nUS officials have been heartened by what they see as China’s lack of concrete backing for the war and said that Beijing has declined requests to send military equipment, forcing Russia to rely on North Korea and Iran as its own supplies dwindle.\n\nChina’s reaction to Russia is being closely watched for clues on its approach to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nWang held firm that China would take “forceful steps” against any interference, insisting that efforts to prevent “reunification” with Taiwan would be “crushed by the wheels of history”.\n\nIndia, unlike China, has a warm relationship with the United States but it has historical ties with Russia, its traditional defence supplier.\n\n“As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\n“Our answer, each time, is straight and honest – India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there,” he said.\n\n“We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out.”\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at a news conference declined to answer whether there has been any pressure from China. In his speech, he sought to cast blame squarely on the west.\n\n“The official Russophobia in the west is unprecedented. Now the scope is grotesque,” Lavrov told the general assembly.\n\n“They are not shying away from declaring the intent to inflict not only military defeat on our country but also to destroy and fracture Russia.”\n\nThe United States, he said, since the end of the cold war has acted as if it is “an envoy of God on Earth, with the sacred right to act with impunity wherever and whenever they want”, Lavrov said.\n\nHe also blasted the European Union as an “authoritarian, harsh, dictatorial entity” and said the bloc’s leadership forced one member state’s leader – the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades – to cancel a planned meeting with him.\n\nLavrov criticised the west for not engaging with Russia, saying, “we have never stepped away from maintaining contact”.\n\nWestern powers are looking at further sanctions after Putin called up reservists and made a veiled threat to use nuclear weapons, and have refused to recognise results of referendums on Russian annexation being held in occupied territories.\n\nThey have welcomed Lavrov’s isolation, noting how he only showed up at a security council session on Thursday to deliver remarks and not to listen to others.\n\nRussia enjoyed one rare voice of support on Saturday at the general assembly. Mali’s interim prime minister, Col Abdoulaye Maïga, appointed by coup leaders, hailed the “exemplary and fruitful cooperation” with Moscow.\n\nThe junta has welcomed Russia’s Wagner Group security firm, despite western allegations of rights abuses, as France pulled out troops who had been struggling to contain a jihadist insurgency.",
    "Most pilots in India fall asleep while flying: Study": "In India, two-thirds of pilots have admitted to dozing off in the pilot's seat. According to a study by the Safety Matters Foundation that included 542 regional, local and international pilots, 66% of those polled admitted falling asleep while at the controls of the aircraft without waking up a fellow crew member. There is a chronic scarcity of competent pilots in India, where airlines require up to 1,500 new pilots annually. However, only 200 to 300 of these new hires have the appropriate training.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA imposes ₹10 lakh fine on Vistara\n\nThe most common causes of falling asleep in the cockpit were overwork and having to fly back-to-back morning flights, which required getting up as early as 2am. One of the biggest causes of aeroplane accidents is fatigue. Between India and the UK, where 1.5 million British Indians reside, there are hundreds of flights per week. Around 54% of pilots reported having severe excessive daytime sleepiness, according to their responses, while 41% reported having moderate excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nAt least one-third of those polled admitted to having a near-accident experience while flying, which they attributed to being too fatigued. Pilot weariness accounts for 15-20% of human mistakes in fatal accidents. Aviation accidents do not happen every day. However, statistics reveal that 80% of the time, human error is to blame. Slower reaction times, diminished concentration and worse decision-making are all effects of fatigue.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA slaps 5 Kedarnath helicopter operators with 5-lakh fine, suspends officials\n\n48% of fatal accidents and onboard fatalities occur during the final approach and landing, according to a statistical review of commercial aeroplane accidents worldwide between 1959 and 2016. According to data from 2011 to 2015, the approach and landing phases of a flight accounted for over 65% of all accidents that were reported, with unstabilised approaches being a contributing factor in 14% of these incidents. Additionally, unstabilised approaches were at blame for 31% of runway excursions.",
    "What are the functions of the Attorney General for India?": "Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi has declined the government’s offer to be Attorney General (A-G) for India after “second thoughts”. Rohatgi, who had earlier agreed to take up the position, told The Indian Express on Sunday (September 25) that there was “no specific reason” for changing his mind.\n\nThe term of the incumbent A-G, K K Venugopal, ends on September 30. He is 91 years old, and on his third extension. Venugopal has conveyed to the government that in view of his advanced age, he would not be able to continue after the end of his current term.\n\nWho is the Attorney General for India?\n\nThe Constitution of India places the post of the A-G on a special footing. The A-G is the Government of India’s first law officer, and has the right of audience in all courts of the country.\n\nArticle 76(2) of the Constitution says “it shall be the duty of the Attorney-General to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character, as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the President”.\n\nThe A-G is also supposed to “discharge the functions conferred on him by or under this Constitution or any other law for the time being in force”.\n\nUnder Article 88, the “Attorney-General of India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member”. However, he “shall not by virtue of this article be entitled to vote” in the House.\n\nAlso, the A-G for India is not, like the A-G for England and Wales and the A-G of the United States, a member of the Cabinet.\n\nWho can become A-G?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Article 76(1), the A-G is appointed by the President from among persons who are “qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court”. Article 76(4) says “the Attorney-General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, and shall receive such remuneration as the President may determine.”\n\nThe post of the A-G has been occupied by some of the finest jurists in India’s history. The first two incumbents of the post were the legendary M C Setalvad and C K Daphtary.\n\nSoli Sorabjee served as A-G twice, in 1989-90 when V P Singh and Chandra Shekhar were Prime Ministers, and from 1998-2004 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

    "Indian government accused of ceding land in Himalayas to China": "Indian people living near the country’s disputed Himalayan border with China have accused their government of giving away swathes of land after both sides agreed to withdraw troops from some contested areas and create buffer zones.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops, who have been locked in a tense border dispute since June 2020, began to draw back from the contested area of Gogra-Hot Springs after an agreement was reached to disengage.\n\nThe Indian government said the agreement restored the territory on both sides of the contested border, known as the line of actual control, to the “pre-standoff period”. In the newly created buffer zones, neither side will be allowed to patrol their troops.\n\nNevertheless, local Indian residents, elected representatives of the region and former Indian military officers who have served along the disputed border in Ladakh are claiming that the new “buffer zones” have been established in areas previously under Indian control.\n\nMeanwhile, they allege Chinese troop positions remain either in contested areas or much inside the Indian territory.\n\n“Our army is vacating areas which were not disputed at all, while Chinese troops are stationed in the areas traditionally patrolled by India,” said Konchok Stanzin, an elected councillor from the region.\n\nStanzin claimed that India had already given up territory to China during a 2021 agreement to withdraw from contested areas around Ladakh’s Lake Pangong. “We raised similar concerns in earlier disengagement, like in the Pangong Tso area where our army again lost a huge area,” he said.\n\nMany people in the local area spoke of concerns not only for their security but the consequences the loss of land to Chinese troops was having on their livelihoods. “We are losing massive pastures, which we would use as grazing land,” said Stanzin, who belongs, like most of the people in the area, to the tribal Changpa cattle herders community. Their main sources of living have been cashmere wool-producing Changra goats.\n\n“Earlier, our concern was about Chinese incursions only but now the situation is more worrying as our government is giving up our land happily,” he said. “If India’s approach remains the same, we are going to lose more land.”\n\nIndia’s main opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Narendra Modi’s government of “giving 1,000 sq km [390 sq miles] of territory to China without a fight”.\n\nThe recent withdrawal consensus was reached last week, during the 16th round of bilateral talks between leading Indian and Chinese military commanders. The two sides claimed to have agreed to disengage from respective sides in the area of Gogra-Hot Springs in a move “conducive to the peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.\n\nTashi Chhepal, a retired Indian army captain who served in Gogra-Hot Springs area around 1997, said that the areas now declared “buffer zones”, where neither Indian or Chinese troops will be positioned, had previously been patrolled by Indian troops.\n\n“We would patrol these areas where Chinese posts are now located, leave aside the buffer zones, which are clearly in our territory,” said Chhepal. “Ideally, the Chinese should also have moved behind their patrolling area, but that does not seem to be the case.”\n\nThe pullback of troops has been the second disengagement act since August 2021, when troops “ceased forward deployments” and dismantled infrastructure in another area in the region where tensions escalated in June 2020, when at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers died during the deadliest clashes between the two nuclear powers in 50 years.\n\nAfter the violent altercation, in which soldiers fought with sticks and rocks in hand-to-hand combat, the two countries stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets along the disputed border, militarising the region like never before.\n\nAfter the 2020 clash, tensions soared to extraordinary levels, with deployment of 200,000 troops on both sides of the frontier in this inhospitable high-altitude terrain, where the temperature drops as low as -40C (-40F) in winters. There was also unprecedented artillery and infrastructure buildup on both sides of the 2,100-mile border, including when China invaded India in 1962.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and China have remained icy. On Friday, Modi and President Xi Jinping of China were present at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, the first time they had met since the clashes, but no handshakes or meetings were held between the two leaders.\n\nIndia’s military leaders called the disengagement a positive step that decreased the chances of a physical confrontation between the rival troops, who have been positioned almost nose-to-nose at certain points. In the area recently declared a buffer zone, China was reported to have built a temporary army base that has since been taken down.\n\n“The idea of buffer zones is to disengage so that troops are not face to face with each other and problems do not occur,” said Deepender Singh Hooda, the Indian army’s former head of northern command, which also includes the Ladakh region. “For example, in some areas tanks were within 100 metres of each other.”\n\nThe negotiations appear to be part of efforts by the Modi government to defuse the tensions along the border in order to portray the idea that India has been successful in dealing with an increasingly hostile China.\n\nNevertheless, Hooda was among those who said India had still been unable to get China to withdraw from the most strategically important border regions, including the Depsang and Demchok areas of Ladakh “where the Chinese are preventing Indian troops from patrolling a very large number of places”.\n\nThe area, home to a huge buildup of Chinese troops, is tactically important to India because of its proximity to India’s Daulat Beg Oldi military airbase and Shiachen glacier, the world’s highest battlefield, where India’s nemesis, Pakistan, has a strategic presence.\n\n“That is the area where the biggest problem is,” said Hooda.",
    "Now the UK Has to Wrestle With India’s Demons, Too": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nHere in India, Hindu-Muslim clashes that threaten houses of worship, force shops to close and inflame passions on social media no longer constitute news. It is noteworthy, however, when they break out not in Madhya Pradesh but in the English Midlands. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Police in the city of Leicester have arrested dozens of people in recent days after what authorities described as “serious disorder.” Weeks ago, a game of cricket between India and Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates raised tensions, as such matches often do. Subsequently, Hindu revivalists marched through a Muslim-dominated part of Leicester, chanting religious slogans. A Muslim mob surrounded a Hindu temple and burned its saffron flag. Scuffles between the two groups broke out across the city.\n\nAlmost 40% of Leicester’s residents are of South Asian origin and the city has often been held up as a successful model of integration. Even now, official statements and media reports about the violence have taken pains not to puncture that reputation. Some have blamed “outsiders,” especially from nearby Birmingham, for the trouble. Police have complained that disinformation spread through social media fired up the mobs. And many observers have stressed the pacifying influence of “community leaders.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s some truth to all those statements. But they miss the larger story, which is that the sectarian politics of the Indian subcontinent can no longer be contained within the subcontinent. Such divides are being globalized, spreading alienation, disinformation, political partisanship, radicalization and violence in their wake.\n\nTake social media. Today, political mobilization in South Asia is driven largely by online content — and, increasingly, by made-to-order misinformation. This is true for Hindus, Muslims and even Sinhala Buddhists in Sri Lanka. Indeed, the subcontinent is making new and innovative advances in hate speech. Bigots are no longer content to relabel and retweet incendiary videos; they are creating their own fake content and labeling it as “entertainment.”\n\nJust last week, a viral video — retweeted by, among others, a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party — appeared to show a Muslim clergyman abusing a young woman. The video was in fact created specifically for “educational” — rabble-rousing — purposes. The scenes it depicted were imaginary, according to a portentous disclaimer, “because the reality is too bitter to be told or shown.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media has also dissolved boundaries between locals and “outsiders.” Technology makes it easy for angry co-religionists to collaborate and egg each other on, even if they aren’t physical neighbors. Until a decade ago, for instance, riots in India were predominantly an urban phenomenon. Then, in 2013, the advent of social media allowed mobs from different villages to launch a coordinated attack on Muslims in rural Uttar Pradesh, displacing tens of thousands of them.\n\nThe uneasy peace that has long held in places such as Leicester — negotiated by local faith leaders and maintained by separating the different communities — cannot survive this new age. If Leicester has more Hindus than Muslims, then a provocative march will be organized in a Muslim area. If the Midlands as a whole have more Muslims than Hindus, then they will in turn combine to intimidate Leicester’s Hindus. And on and on, to the level of the nation itself.\n\nNor will politics-as-usual solve the problem. Rather than speaking directly to minority voters, too many British politicians and administrators still rely on “community leaders” of doubtful opinions and increasingly limited authority. Why would a young British Asian man listen to his local imam or pandit when he consumes media from the subcontinent that is full of far more entertaining, and incendiary, voices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, it is too easy for politicians, in the UK as well as India, to exploit these sectarian divides. Priti Patel, until a few weeks ago the cabinet minister in charge of law and order, recently described her Tories and the BJP as “sister parties.” At least one Hindu Labour MP has accused his own party of employing a “divide and rule” policy in which, he implied, Hindus were at the bottom of the pile.\n\nThe worst possible outcome would be for Hindus and Muslims in the Midlands and the wider UK to start voting for different parties based on their religion. Then adoption of the subcontinent’s divisive politics would be complete.\n\nThat “divide and rule” comment — a reference to how the British supposedly controlled a diverse and divided subcontinent for two centuries — gets to the heart of the problem. Over the past fortnight, some in the UK have tried to examine how the echoes of empire still animate aspects of national identity. Yet they have failed to see how actual policies in today’s Britain, in what the state does and does not do, in its acceptance of ghettoized communities and its dependence on “faith leaders” as interlocutors, eerily reflect how the Raj once kept the peace half a world away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe modern British state cannot afford to continue ruling distantly through community leaders, allowing Hindus and Muslims in the UK to live separately and build up grudges against each other. Those policies no longer work in South Asia — and they certainly won’t work elsewhere.\n\nMore From Bloomberg Opinion:\n\n• Truss Faces Four Hurdles to Spur Growth in UK: Mohamed El-Erian\n\n• Modi’s India Risks Making the Case for Partition: Nisid Hajari\n\n• Could India Fall Under the Same Spell as Russia?: Pankaj Mishra\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMihir Sharma is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

    "India is quietly laying claim to economic superpower status": "The rise of China has been the biggest story in the global economy in recent decades. But amid concern about its stumbling property market and global fears about inflation, the emergence of its neighbour, India, as a potential new economic superpower may be going under the radar.\n\nYou won’t find mention of it in Liz Truss’s blueprint for a “modern brilliant Britain”, but the UK has just been overtaken by India as the world’s fifth biggest economy. The nation of 1.4 billion people is on track to move into third place behind the US and China by 2030, according to economists.\n\nAnd while the world became familiar with Chinese business titans such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma, the staggering wealth accumulated in recent years by Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani has been less well publicised.\n\nAdani, in particular, has come to represent India’s growing economic strength thanks to the rapid expansion of his Adani Group conglomerate, which covers everything from ports to airports, and solar power to television. Having entered the global Top 10 when he became Asia’s richest person in February, he is now ranked third with a fortune of $143bn (£123bn) and is closing fast on second-placed Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.\n\nIndia was for many years seen as the poor relation to China, held back by a sclerotic, sprawling state sector and labyrinthine bureaucracy. It still has enormous problems of poverty and poor infrastructure, but it is beginning to emerge as a rival to its large neighbour with the kind of economic growth figures that were once the pride of Beijing.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.8% in the second quarter of this year as pandemic controls were lifted and manufacturing and services boomed. Although double-digit growth is unlikely to be repeated in subsequent quarters, India is still on track to expand by 7% this year as it benefits from economic liberalisation in the private sector, a rapidly growing working population, and the realignment of global supply chains away from China.\n\n“India has overtaken the UK to become the world’s fifth-largest economy,” says Shilan Shah, senior India economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, citing recent updated figures from the International Monetary Fund. “Looking ahead, India looks set to continue its march up the global rankings. In all, we think India will overtake Germany and Japan to become the third-largest economy in the world within the next decade.”\n\nA key part of India’s continued rise will be its ability to grow its manufacturing sector and challenge China as the world’s No 1 exporter. India has already benefited from a large, well-educated, often English-speaking middle-class, helping the country to develop world-class IT and pharmaceutical sectors. It also has strong consumer demand, which accounts for about 55% of the economy compared with less than 40% in China.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With a geopolitical wedge opening up between China and the west, India also has the opportunity to grow in reshaped international supply chains.\n\nNguyen Trinh, emerging markets economist at Natixis bank in Hong Kong, says the outlook is promising for India if it can keep investing.\n\n“Indian demand is expected to be strong due to its demographics,” she says, “which is rather favourable with rising working-age population that will push for demand for essentials such as food and energy as well as infrastructure investment. The normalisation of activities post-Covid as well as an increase in government spending, particularly in infrastructure investment, is helping growth. Consumption rose in double digits and investment is accelerating.”\n\nAs with many aspects of India’s economic rise, Adani’s story is instructive. Now 60, the billionaire dropped out of Gujarat University, moved to Mumbai, and began trading diamonds before expanding into ports, construction and – latterly, but very profitably – renewable energy.\n\nThese widespread industrial interests have dovetailed perfectly with the country’s thirst for growth and seen his Adani Group holdings on the Indian stock market rocket in value. His main listed company, Adani Enterprises, has grown 50-fold in value in the past five years, while Adani Green Energy, which looks after its push into solar power, has doubled in value in the past year. The group is ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer – ironic given the controversy over its plans to expand coal mining in Australia.\n\nAnother important symmetry comes from Adani’s origins in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the power base of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Modi’s market reforms, which have included cutting corporation tax from 35% to 25% and opening up India to more foreign investment, have freed up entrepreneurs such as Adani and the man he overtook as the country’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, and another Gujarati. Adani is close to Modi who has been known to use the tycoon’s private jet for campaign trips.\n\nNowhere is the local and global ambition of Adani more clearly illustrated than in Mundra, the Arabian Sea port which he wants to become the world’s largest by the end of the decade. With Modi’s government rolling out a 100tn rupees ($1.35tn, £1.1tn) infrastructure programme – it aims to build 25,000km of new roads in the current financial year alone – Adani is well placed to profit at every stage as the necessary raw materials are shipped in, turned into goods and services, and then sent back out around the world through Mundra.",
    "Dependence on Russian defence equipment not lack of trying on India’s part: Jaishankar": "India’s dependence on Russian defence equipment and the strong defence ties with Moscow is not because New Delhi did not approach the US to get those from the United States, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Sunday.\n\n“One of the changes in our relationships has actually been the defence cooperation which has really come about in this current form maybe the last 15 years,” Jaishankar told Indian Americans here during an interactive discussion with him organized by the US India Friendship Council and Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies.\n\n“From 1965 pretty much for the next 40 years, there was no US defence equipment to India. This was, in fact, a period when the India Soviet, India Russia relationship became very strong,” he said.\n\n“This was not due to a lack of trying on India’s part. I can vouch for it myself. I’ve had my relatives, my father, my grandfather, they worked with the defence ministry. So, I know firsthand what great efforts were made over those years to try to make the US understand that it was in American interest to have a strong, united, independent, prosperous India,” Jaishankar said.\n\n“At that time, they did not succeed, maybe the state of the world was such,” he noted. “The change that started was really triggered by the nuclear deal that removed a very big obstacle to go forward and then to actually take the relationship to a new level requires leadership in India,” that did not had reservations.\n\n“It takes two hands to clap. It was not just that all the problems are on the American side they were visitations on the Indian side as well,” he said.\n\n“So we also have to address the institutions on our side. I think today, the relationship is on a very different footing. We have possibility of working together in many more areas, especially the security domain. Some of our major exercises are with the American military. We fly a number of American planes today, the C 17,” the minister said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVery bullish on the future of India-US relationship, he said: “I think there are really deep convergences, which will sustain it over many, many years.”",
    "An Anti-Muslim Symbol From India Is Paraded on Main Street, New Jersey": "“What is the bulldozer’s meaning?” Chandrakant Patel, an Edison restaurant owner who leads the association, told the township council. “Illegal land construction.”\n\nOthers dismissed the claim that the bulldozer was a symbol of hatred and expressed strong support for India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi.\n\n“Nobody has a right to disrespect our prime minister,” said Bimal Joshi, who has lived in Edison for 30 years and is not affiliated with the business group.\n\nBut within two weeks, at the urging of the mayors of Edison and the neighboring town of Woodbridge, where the parade ended, Mr. Patel had apologized. In a letter, he called the bulldozer a “blatant divisive” symbol.\n\nMr. Patel added that his group was aware it had “offended the Indian American minority groups, especially Muslims, from the local area and across the state and country” and vowed to never again include anything similar in future parades. He did not respond to requests for additional comment.\n\nFor many, the apology was too little, too late.\n\nMuslim leaders had already filed a complaint with the Edison Police Department, citing intimidation and bias.

    "Clues in Caves Suggest Drought May Have Brought Down India’s Mughal Empire": "This story was originally published on The Conversation and appears here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nIn a remote cave in northeast India, rainwater has slowly dripped from the ceiling in the same spots for over 1,000 years. With each drop, minerals in the water accumulate on the floor below, slowly growing into calcium carbonate towers known as stalagmites. These stalagmites are more than geological wonders—like tree rings, their layers record the region’s rainfall history. They also carry a warning about the potential for catastrophic multiyear droughts in the future.\n\nBy analyzing the geochemistry of these stalagmites in a new study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to create the most precise chronology yet of the summer Indian monsoon over the past millennium. It documents how the Indian subcontinent frequently experienced long, severe droughts unlike any observed in the last 150 years of reliable monsoon rainfall measurements.\n\nThe drought periods we detected are in striking synchrony with historical accounts of droughts, famines, mass mortality events, and geopolitical changes in the region.\n\nThey show how the decline of the Mughal Empire and India’s textile industries in the 1780s and 1790s coincided with the most severe 30-year period of drought over the millennium. The depth and duration of the drought would have caused widespread crop failures and the level of famine discussed in written documents at the time.\n\nAnother long drought encompasses the 1630-1632 Deccan famine, one of the most devastating droughts in India’s history. Millions of people died as crops failed. Around the same time, the elaborate Mughal capital of Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned and the Guge Kingdom collapsed in western Tibet.\n\nBuland Darwaza (Door of Victory) at Fatehpur Sikri, the one-time capital of the Mughal Empire. Marcin Białek, CC BY-SA 3.0/Wikimedia\n\nOur findings have important implications today for water planning in a warming world, particularly for India, which, with its vast monsoon-reliant agriculture industry, is on pace to soon be the most populous country on the planet.\n\nScientists began systematically measuring India’s monsoon rainfall with instruments around the 1870s. Since then, India has experienced about 27 regionally widespread droughts. Among them, only one—1985 to 1987—was a three-year consecutive drought or worse.\n\nThe apparent stability of the Indian monsoon in that data might lead one to surmise that neither protracted droughts lasting multiple years nor frequent droughts are intrinsic aspects of its variability. This seemingly reassuring view currently informs the region’s present-day water resource infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the stalagmite evidence of prolonged, severe droughts over the past 1,000 years paints a different picture. It indicates that the short instrumental period does not capture the full range of Indian monsoon variability. It also raises questions about the region’s current water resources, sustainability, and mitigation policies that discount the possibility of protracted droughts in the future.\n\nTo reconstruct past variations in rainfall, we analyzed stalagmites from Mawmluh Cave, near the town of Cherrapunji in the state of Meghalaya—one of the wettest locations in the world.\n\nStalagmites marked for study inside Mawmluh Cave. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nStalagmites are cone-like structures that grow slowly from the ground up, typically at a rate of about one millimeter every 10 years. Trapped within their growth layers are minute amounts of uranium and other elements that were acquired as rainwater infiltrated the rocks and soil above the cave. Over time, uranium trapped in stalagmites decays into thorium at a predictable pace, so we can figure out the age of each stalagmite growth layer by measuring the ratio of uranium to thorium.\n\nThe oxygen in rainwater molecules comes in two primary types of isotopes: heavy and light. As stalagmites grow, they lock into their structure the oxygen isotope ratios of the percolating rainwater that seeps into the cave. Subtle variations in this ratio can arise from a range of climatic conditions at the time the rainwater originally fell.\n\nOur previous research in this area showed that variations in oxygen isotope ratios in rainwater, and consequently, in stalagmites, track changes in the relative abundance of different moisture sources that contribute to summer monsoon rainfall.\n\nDuring years when monsoon circulation is weak, rainfall here is primarily derived from the moisture that evaporated from the nearby Arabian Sea. During strong monsoon years, however, atmospheric circulation brings copious amounts of moisture to this area all the way from the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe two moisture sources have quite different oxygen isotope signatures, and this ratio is faithfully preserved in the stalagmites. We can use this clue to learn about the overall strength of the monsoon intensity at the time the stalagmite formed. We pieced together the monsoon rainfall history by extracting minute amounts of calcium carbonate from its growth rings and then measuring the oxygen isotope ratios. To anchor our climate record to precise calendar years, we measured the uranium and thorium ratio.\n\nA cross-section of a stalagmite shows variations in ring formation, which can be linked to changing climate conditions. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nThe paleoclimate records can usually tell what, where and when something happened. But often, they alone cannot answer why or how something happened. Our new study shows that protracted droughts frequently occurred during the past millennia, but we do not have a good understanding of why the monsoon failed in those years. Similar studies using Himalayan ice cores, tree rings, and other caves have also detected protracted droughts but face the same challenge.\n\nIn the next phase of our study, we are teaming up with climate modelers to conduct coordinated proxy-modeling studies that we hope will offer more insight into the climate dynamics that triggered and sustained such extended periods of drought during the past millennium.\n\nGayatri Kathayat is an associate professor of global environmental change at Xi’an Jiaotong University.

    "Are China and India changing their stance on Putin's war in Ukraine?": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nEarlier this month, Vladimir Putin met one-on-one with Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi as the three world leaders attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. For the first time, Putin publicly admitted that China had “questions and concerns” about the continuing war in Ukraine. Likewise, Modi reminded Putin that the present era is “not one of war.”\n\nThese developments are noteworthy. Until now, China has openly supported Russia, while India has avoided public criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the summit, Modi reaffirmed the historic importance of India-Russia relations. And China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement calling the China-Russia relationship “stable as mountains.” Both countries continue to buy Russian exports in large quantities. They even joined military exercises in Russia this month.\n\nWhy have China and India been so reluctant to rein Moscow in? While their dependence on Russia for defense and energy resources are significant factors, my research suggests that status also plays a role in their policies. India and China share Russia’s resentment about their second-tier status in a U.S.-led international order. That makes both countries likely to continue to be tolerant about Moscow’s ambitions.\n\nNot defending the international order is risky\n\nIt may seem that security and economic factors are driving Beijing and New Delhi’s policies. But Moscow’s war in Ukraine has disrupted the economies of both China and India. The conflict has affected food and energy supplies worldwide, raising the price of oil and other commodities for India and China. Bankrolling a warring country with mounting economic problems is risky — Russia’s collapse, for instance, would also hurt partner countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia’s invasion also jeopardizes the international order, by disrupting the settled rules and norms that govern relations between countries. Moscow’s actions have challenged foundational international principles such as sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination. Russia has also announced its intention to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and World Health Organization, institutions that are core to the international order. In that light, it’s surprising that China and India would support Putin’s efforts to undermine the very order that has enabled their rise.\n\nRising powers won’t support an exclusionary order\n\nHistory shows, however, that rising powers like China and India do not simply value economic and security goals. They also value being recognized as eminent countries with an elevated status in international politics. In my recent book, I show that this status comes from being recognized as equals of the great powers that manage the international order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen core institutions of the international order recognize a rising country’s equality — typically by including these new aspirants in global leadership positions — they’re likely to uphold the order, even at great cost to themselves. When the order instead excludes these countries, they will demand greater representation in the governance of global issues and will be less willing to cooperate. If these demands are denied or indefinitely deferred, they may get frustrated and challenge the order.\n\nThe United States itself was once in this position, in the 19th century. Initially, it cooperated with a mostly inclusive international order. As a club of European great powers took over after 1815, the U.S. sought — unsuccessfully — to transform international law as a way of joining the club. Feeling unfairly excluded, the U.S. eventually challenged the order. In 1856, when Britain and France introduced new rules abolishing the use of private vessels in maritime warfare, the U.S. vehemently opposed the effort and refused to cooperate. At the time, private vessels provided the only source of equality the U.S. had with the naval powers of Europe.\n\nChina and India see the current order as exclusionary\n\nChina and India today are looking for opportunities for leadership in a global order dominated by the U.S. and its allies. New Delhi, for example, seeks a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. India’s foreign minister declared in 2020 that India deserved “due recognition” for its contributions to global order, and called for “reformed multilateralism.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing, already a permanent Security Council member, seeks greater representation in international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, whose top leadership positions have been exclusively occupied by American, European and Japanese nationals, respectively. Indeed, scholars have found that since 1971, the year China joined the United Nations, senior management positions within the U.N. system have been held largely by nationals of the U.S., France, U.K., Japan and Canada, with China, India and Russia trailing far behind.\n\nFrustrated that these institutions have been slow to change in this regard, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2014. When the U.S. pressured other countries to boycott the institution, China’s vice minister of commerce compared the international order to a basketball game in which “the U.S. wants to set the duration of the game, the size of the court, the height of the basket and everything else to suit itself.”\n\nChina, India and Russia prefer a ‘multipolar’ order\n\nSo long as the international order continues to exclude China and India from the great power club, these nations have little incentive to defend rules and institutions that they did not create and over which they feel little ownership. Since the end of the Cold War, China and India have joined Russia in consistently declaring their preference for a “multipolar world order,” which would give them a greater say in global affairs.\n\nAt the same time, there are limits to how far China and India will go. The recent Shanghai Cooperation summit shows that Russia may be pushing its friends too far, and they are beginning to push back. The need to protect their own longer-term interests and to successfully transform — but not wreck — the international order may now be leading both countries to restrain Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory shows that rising powers do not wait indefinitely for their place in the sun. Without some accommodation of their status aspirations, China and India are likely to remain skeptical of Western efforts to defend the international order against Russian excesses.\n\nRohan Mukherjee is an assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

The match was played at Girona in Spain.\n\nIt was the first match of the exposure tour for the Indian girls ahead of the age-group showpiece, which India is hosting in October-November. Sudha Tirkey (62′) scored the only goal for India after Sweden U-17 girls took a comfortable 3-0 lead through Ida Gramfors (44′) Sara Frigren (52′) and Selma Astrom (54′). India, however, looked promising at the start as they competed on equal terms in an intense midfield battle that saw winger Anita Kumari get an early shot at the rival goal, which was saved.\n\nMinutes later, Nitu Linda tried her luck to take a shot from the edge of the Swedish penalty area, but was blocked. India earned a free kick in the 19th minute and Anita once again made an attempt at the rival goal, this time a header, but the Swedish custodian Elin Ekmark saved it with ease.\n\nA few minutes later Sweden striker Maja Jarvensivu tried a long ranger, which went over the bar. Both Anita and India goalkeeper Anjali enjoyed a good first half. The former made a few inroads around the half-hour mark, while the latter made a few worthy saves to keep her side in the game.",
    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society.

    "GT Voice: India’s call for global debt relief laudable, West must step up too": "Photo: VCG\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Saturday that with India set to assume the presidency of the G20, the South Asian nation will work with other G20 member states to address serious issues of debt, food and energy security, Indian media outlets reported on Sunday.\"The accumulation of debt in fragile economies is of particular concern,\" Jaishankar said in his address to the UN General Assembly session on Saturday.His call for global debt relief efforts, which came at a time when global debt levels have soared significantly, especially in a number of vulnerable developing countries, is laudable, considering the growing urgency for Western countries, developing countries and multilateral institutions to work together to find appropriate ways to restructure and ease debt burdens on some emerging market economies to avoid further crisis.While the US has often been critical of China's debt relief efforts to low and middle-income countries, the fact is that the developed world is largely responsible for the debt woes faced by the emerging market economies and thus should take more responsibility for their debt relief.Early in January, Gita Gopinath, first deputy managing director of the IMF, said that 60 percent of low-income countries were in or at high risk of debt distress, and would find it increasingly difficult to service their debts.With central banks in the developed world, such as the US Federal Reserve, raising interest rates aggressively this year, developing countries have faced more debt pressure exacerbated by currency depreciation, imported inflationary pressure, and further downward economic pressure.Moreover, developing countries mainly borrow from Western commercial and multilateral lenders. According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, by the end of 2020, commercial and multilateral creditors accounted for 40 percent and 34 percent, respectively, for the public external debt of 82 low-income and lower middle-income countries.Also, these Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions, which hold the biggest share of debts, claimed they need to maintain their credit rating and have been absent from the global debt relief and service suspension effort for developing countries. By comparison, China has been implementing the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative and is the biggest contributor to the effort.Western countries always like to pay lip service when it comes to tackling global challenges as if they are the saviors of the world, but deflecting responsibility when it comes to global debt relief efforts. They are reluctant to actually do something to be the savior, because it may probably conflict with their own selfish interests.Against this backdrop, developing countries, including China and India, may need to play a greater role in terms of debt relief coordination and collaboration.In particular, India has been stepping up efforts in easing debt burden and helping some developing countries like Sri Lanka. With a total of $968 million in loans in four months of 2022, India \"has emerged as Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender, overtaking China in the process,\" India's ANI news agency reported last week.To a certain extent, India's increased sense of responsibility for the developing world may have something to do with its bullish economic performance. India has overtaken the UK to become the world's fifth-largest economy, according to the latest calculations by Bloomberg. The Indian economy grew 13.5 percent in the second quarter of this year, making it the fastest growing economy in the G20.Meanwhile, China's efforts on debt relief for developing countries have been steady and effective. Last month, China announced the waiving of 23 interest-free loans for 17 African countries that had matured at the end of 2021.The willingness shared by China and India to take greater responsibility for the debt problems in the developing world may also provide the potential for the two to strength their coordination in this area for alleviating the debt burden on other economies. Both sides may play their due roles of coordinating debt relief and restructuring with other developing countries under such platforms as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.",
    "India warns its citizens in Canada of ‘increase in hate crimes’": "Advisory issued by New Delhi cites ‘incidents of hate crimes, sectarian violence and anti-India activities’ in Canada.\n\nThe Indian government has advised its nationals in Canada to exercise caution, citing “a sharp increase in incidents of hate crimes, sectarian violence and anti-India activities” in the North American country.\n\nIn an advisory issued on Friday, the Indian foreign ministry asked the Indians in Canada to “remain vigilant”.\n\n“In view of the increasing incidences of crimes … Indian nationals and students from India in Canada and those proceeding to Canada for travel/education are advised to exercise due caution,” it said.\n\nAdvisory for Indian Nationals and Students from India in Canadahttps://t.co/dOrqyY7FgN pic.twitter.com/M0TDfTgvrG — Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) September 23, 2022\n\nThe advisory said New Delhi has requested the Canadian authorities to investigate the crimes and take appropriate action. “The perpetrators of these crimes have not been brought to justice so far in Canada,” it said.\n\nThe ministry did not detail any alleged hate crimes, nor it did provide information to back up its claim that Canada has seen an increase in such incidents.\n\nCanada’s foreign affairs department and a spokesperson for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on Friday morning.\n\nIn the advisory, New Delhi urged its nationals – workers and students – in Canada to register with the Indian mission in Ottawa or consulates in Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nIndian media reports on Friday said the advisory followed reports of a “referendum” purportedly organised by a faction among the Sikhs in Canada, demanding a separate Khalistan nation in the northern Indian state of Punjab.\n\nThe separatist movement was at its peak in the 1980s.\n\nIn June 1984, New Delhi sent troops to the Golden Temple – the community’s holiest site in Punjab’s Amritsar city – in a military operation targeting pro-Khalistan leaders. The Operation Blue Star, as the army assault was known, killed hundreds.\n\nIn October that year, former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards, an event that led to nationwide anti-Sikh riots in which thousands were killed.\n\nToday, Sikhs form a large chunk of the 1.6 million Indian diaspora in Canada – more than 3 percent of its population. Canada has 17 parliamentarians and three cabinet ministers of Indian origin, including defence minister Anita Anand, the Hindustan Times newspaper said.\n\nIndia has repeatedly raised the issue of Canada allowing the Khalistani separatist groups to operate on its land.\n\nNew Delhi believes the Trudeau government has not done enough to address its concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistan elements in Canada, the Hindustan Times said.\n\nIndia’s foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi on Thursday called the referendum in Canada a “farcical exercise held by extremist and radical elements,” according to a report by the NDTV network.\n\nBagchi said it was “deeply objectionable” that such an exercise was allowed in a friendly country.\n\nIn response, the Canadian government said it respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and will not recognise the so-called referendum, according to Indian media reports.",
    "Recent Match Report - Australia vs India 3rd T20I 2022": "India 187 for 4 (Suryakumar 69, Kohli 63, Sams 2-33) beat Australia 186 for 7 (David 54, Green 52, Axar 3-33) by six wickets\n\n\n\nSuryakumar got together with Kohli after Daniel Sams and Pat Cummins had bounced out KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma respectively. Whenever the bowlers hit the Hyderabad pitch hard, the ball either kicked up or stopped on the batters. Case in point: the first ball to Suryakumar, from Cummins, reared up from a back of a length and zipped away past his outside edge.\n\nSuryakumar, however, rose above the conditions and Australia's attack, proving a potent point of difference in India's line-up. He struck up a 104-run partnership off 62 balls with Kohli and disrupted the bowlers by manufacturing swinging room or jumping out of the crease.\n\nAfter Suryakumar ultimately fell for 69 off 36 balls, with India 53 away from victory, Australia staged a mini-fightback and dragged the game down to the last over in which the hosts needed 11.\n\nKohli shovelled the first ball from Sams over long-on and holed out next ball for 63 off 48 balls. Dinesh Karthik and Hardik Pandya, though, got the job done for India with one ball to spare.\n\nGreen's opening salvo\n\nWith the new ball sliding onto the bat, Green immediately teed off in the powerplay, muscling his way to a 19-ball fifty in the fifth over. Much like Suryakumar, Green often backed away outside leg and lustily swung at the ball. Only David Warner and Glenn Maxwell have hit faster fifties for Australia in T20Is.\n\nGreen was responsible for 52 off the 66 runs Australia had scored in the powerplay. He once again unfurled his range against spin when he cracked Axar Patel for three successive fours in the fourth over, with the pick of those being a hard, flat sweep to the midwicket boundary.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar, who had conceded 12 runs in his first over, however, returned to the attack in the next over and hid one away from his reach to have Green caught at backward point for 52 off 21 balls.\n\nAxar steps up once again\n\nAfter being picked apart by Green, Axar got his arm ball fizzing against Maxwell and varied his pace well to make it even more effective. He had already dismissed Aaron Finch for 7 and claimed 1 for 31 in his three overs in the powerplay.\n\nAxar then returned to the attack with a double-wicket 14th over. He had Josh Inglis lobbing a catch to backward point and drew a return catch from Matthew Wade. Axar went over the wicket to the left-handed Wade, got a shortish ball into the pitch and had him spooning a punch back to him. Axar ended the series with figures of 8 for 63 in ten overs at an economy rate of 6.30. No other bowler got more than three wickets in the series.\n\nDavid's end-overs bash\n\nThat Australia reached 186 for 7 from 117 for 6 was largely down to David's big-hitting. In his first international series for Australia, David showed why he is in demand in franchise T20 leagues. Despite India posting fielders at both long-on and long-off for the most part, David took 27 of his 54 runs down the ground with Kieron Pollard-esque blows. When Bhuvneshwar marginally missed his yorker, David took him for 6, 6, 4 in the 18th over. Jasprit Bumrah, too, couldn't control the damage, finishing with 0 for 50 - the most he has conceded in a T20I.\n\nThe Suryakumar-Kohli show\n\nIndia lost both their openers within four overs, but Suryakumar and Kohli quickly changed the mood and tempo of the chase. Both batters were proactive against legspinner Adam Zampa, using their feet and hitting him against the intended turn for sixes.\n\nZampa could've cut Kohli's innings short at 23 had he hung onto a tough return catch. Suryakumar soon overtook Kohli and surged to a 29-ball fifty. He then hit two sixes and a four off his next five balls and threatened to rush India home. Hazlewood and co. though applied the brakes and made India work hard for victory.",
    "Patrolling points do not define the Indian claim in East Ladakh LAC": "When External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was asked about the PLA troop withdrawal from patrolling point 15 in Kugrang River on September 13, he correctly and tersely replied that it was “one problem less” with the Chinese authoritarian regime post May 2020 belligerence on the 1,597 km East Ladakh LAC.\n\nOn May 17-18, 2020, the aggressive PLA under control of Chinese ruler Xi Jinping transgressed in the areas of Kugrang river, Gogra, and north banks of Pangong Tso and junked all the peace and tranquillity agreements of the past. The Indian Army bound by the 1993-1996 border agreements and subsequent Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) did not open fire as it would have led to vertical escalation like it did when brave Colonel Santosh Babu and his men taught a lesson to the Chinese at Galwan on patrolling point 14 on June 15, 2020.\n\nSince the May 2020 transgressions, the Chinese have made new permanent structures all along the LAC, which is in violation of the past bilateral agreements and CBMs. One must recall that in 1976, the Cabinet Committee on Security under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had approved what was then called “Limits of Patrolling” as defined by the then Cabinet Secretary and the China Study Group (CSG) on large topographical sheets.\n\nIn East Ladakh, the then Congress government approved 65 patrolling points from Karakoram Pass to Chumar as the limits for the Indian Army to patrol and avoid confrontation with the PLA. These points are well within Indian claim line on the LAC and were defined so to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border with China, which had proved to be a superior military power in 1962 border war.\n\nWhile the Narendra Modi government and the national security planners are quite clear that patrolling points do not define the Indian LAC claim in East Ladakh, the Indian Army must also not take the easy way out and only defend the LAC till these patrolling limit point on the map.\n\nThe disengagement from patrolling point 15 does not in any way restore the April 2020 status quo ante on the Ladakh LAC as the PLA must dismantle fresh military structures that have come up along the line since the aggression.\n\nThe Chinese must respect the Indian claim line in Depsang Bulge and Demchok area and restore the Indian Army’s right to patrol point 10 to 13 in the strategic bulge area as well as Charding Nullah Junction in Demchok before bilateral ties are normalized with Beijing. Simply put, the India-China LAC in East Ladakh is not defined by the patrolling points but by the Indian claim line.\n\nJust as the Modi government showed the way by ordering its troops to take dominant positions on south Pangong Tso banks on August 29-31, 2020, and force PLA subsequently to disengage from north banks of the lake, the Indian Army must now be in the position of strength all along the 3488 km LAC as the adversary only understands the language of power not peace.\n\nFact is that the Indian Army has no options as the PLA will continue nibbling on the East Ladakh LAC till it has impose its 1959 line, as advocated by then Chinese Premier Chou or Zhou En-Lai, on the disputed border. China has made its intentions very clear on the disputed border, time has come from Indian Army to also do so.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",

To get it in your inbox every Monday, sign up here (click on “follow”). Have feedback, interesting links or memes? Send them to theindiafix@scroll.in.\n\nFor much of September, Leicester in the United Kingdom saw sporadic bouts of communal tension between Hindus and Muslims. The incident, while unfortunate, was purely a local law and order issue that the city police handled.\n\nUnusually, because of the charged communal situation in India, the issue became the focus of prime time television debates in India. A UK journalist pointed out that communal programming by India’s pro-government news channels, already under criticism for pushing hate, had “completely distorted” the events in Leicester.\n\nThis mainstream media programming was driven by intense social media interest in India about these faraway events. A BBC investigation estimated that half of the tweets about tensions in Leicester actually originated from India. Much of the communal messaging that pushed hashtags such as #HindusUnderAttack displayed “classic signs” of “inauthentic activity, ie a likelihood that individuals are deliberately using multiple accounts to push a narrative”. The BBC singled out OpIndia, the Hindutva website based in India, for spreading misinformation around Leicester.\n\nRepresenting Hindutva, not India\n\nHowever, what was truly odd about this narrative over Leicester was that the government of India soon barged into the conversation. On September 19, the Indian High Commission in the United Kingdom issued an official statement that mentioned only the alleged “vandalisation of premises and symbols of Hindu religion”. Soon after, the Muslim Council of Britian criticised India for taking a partisan view of the communal tensions in the UK.\n\nThis came days after the Indian High Commission in Canada publicly criticised the defacing of a Hindu temple in Toronto. On Friday, the government of India even issued an advisory alleging a “sharp increase in hate crimes and anti-India activities” in Canada.\n\nThe fact that the government of India is deploying its foreign policy tools to intrude into the law and order dynamics of other countries points to one of the starkest changes that Modi has made while in office: Hindutva is now a major part of India’s foreign policy. This involves both the use of Hindu nationalist symbols and ideas while conducting foreign policy to even going so far as to support purported Hindu causes in foreign countries.\n\nReligion as foreign policy\n\nOne of the most prominent Hindutva pushes after Modi become prime minister was the merging of his personal faith with diplomatic engagements in neighbouring countries. In 2021, for example, Modi prayed at a temple in Bangladesh, pushing both Hindutva as well an election talking point just before the West Bengal polls. On his visits to Nepal too, Modi has always combined diplomacy with prayer. Similarly on a visit to Sri Lanka in 2015, Modi prayed at a Hindu temple.\n\nThis was a key part of his Hindutva messaging, centering India’s majority religion in public life rather than keep faith away from government business, as a classically secular state would do.\n\nAs one Bharatiya Janata Party leader told a journalist, “When Modi goes and prays at the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu, or Kedernath, or Banaras, and comes out with tika [the mark on the forehead made with powder or paste applied after prayer], he is saying he is a Hindu and he is proud of being one.”\n\nHindutva shapes not only the form but also the substance of Modi’s foreign policy. Australian academic Ian Hall, in his 2019 book on Modi’s foreign policy outlook, argues that a central thrust of India’s foreign policy post 2014 “aims – at least nominally – at rendering the country into the ‘world guru’ (vishwa guru) Hindu nationalists have long promised it will become”.\n\nIt also meant a vital role for the Indian diaspora in foreign policy. A stark feature of Modi’s first term was highly publicised interactions with foreign citizens of Indian origin, relayed back to India using wall-to-wall television coverage. Much of this flowed from already existing Hindutva networks with the Indian diaspora, especially in places such as the United States.\n\nA cardboard cutout of Narendra Modi during a rally of his in the United States in 2019. Credit: Daniel Kramer/Reuters\n\nUnstable new thrust\n\nMoreover, Modi has placed great emphasis on people who are not career diplomats – BJP members, members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological parent, as well as friendly think tanks. This ecosystem, writes Hall, ended up “serving as platforms from which to propound Hindu nationalist worldviews; and providing bases for like- minded ideologues to develop and expound their interpretations of his government’s actions”.\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act passed in 2019 is both the apogee of Hindutva in foreign policy as well as a great example of just how damaging it can be to India’s national interests. The law, for the first time, offered a path to Indian citizenship for people from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who had crossed the crossed into India without documents, as long as they were not Muslim.\n\nMuch of the political rhetoric in the run-up to the passing of the legislation saw the BJP pillorying Bangladesh, one of Delhi’s closest allies, for its treatment of its religious minorities. To underline the communal thrust of this politics, this purported measure to protect Bangladeshi Hindus was accompanied by allegations that Bangladeshi Muslims were streaming into India. Most infamously in 2018, the current Union Home Minister Amit Shah called Bangladeshi migrants “termites”.\n\nThe result: in 2021, as Modi visited Bangladesh to celebrate the golden jubilee of the country’s independence, riots erupted. As many as 17 people in Bangladesh were killed in the ensuing violence. This was an astonishing reaction from a country that had been liberated with significant military and diplomatic help from India. While the ruling Awami League is still closely allied with India, Modi’s image as a Hindutva icon has made the job of Indian diplomats rather difficult.\n\nModi's 20201 visit to Bangladesh saw widespread protests and violence. Credit: Mohammad Ponir Hussain/Reuters\n\nHurting Indian interests\n\nA similar dynamic now plays out in the Muslim-majority Maldives too. While pro- and anti-Indian sentiments are a regular part of the island’s politics, the latter group have been gifted a strong rhetorical weapon thanks to the Hindutva branding of Indian foreign policy. For example, in June, a mob disrupted a yoga event organised by the Indian High Commission in Male, the Maldvian capital.\n\nNotably, using Hindutva in foreign policy has been a domestic success for Modi as it has greatly shored up his image in the eyes of Indians from the majority community as the BJP depends almost entirely on Hindus for its votes. This, in turn, plays organically off growing communal divisions within the Indian diaspora itself.\n\nIn August, for example, Indian independence celebrations in a town in the United States came under criticism for featuring a bulldozer, referencing a new wave of the demolition of mostly Muslim homes in several BJP-ruled states. Eventually, the organisers apologised for using “these blatant divisive symbols”.\n\nHowever, by involving itself in the domestic politics of the UK, Canada or Bangladesh in pursuit of Hindutva aims, the Modi government has weakened its ability to use foreign policy as a tool for the Indian state’s interests.",

Upon arrival, one of them expressed happiness for having fled the country, which plunged into a crisis after the Taliban returned to power last year, overthrowing the Ashraf Ghani-led government.\n\nTalking to news agency ANI, Baljeet Singh spoke of the conditions in the country, and said he had been imprisoned by the Taliban for four months. \"The condition is not very well in Afghanistan. I was imprisoned for four months. The Taliban have cheated us, they cut our hair in prison. I am thankful and happy to return to India,\" he said.\n\nFifty-five Afghan Sikhs arrived in a special flight which landed at Delhi airport Sunday, as a part of the government's efforts to evacuate the distressed minorities in the Taliban-led nation. The flight was organised by the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandak Committee, Amritsar, in coordination with the Indian World Forum and the Centre to evacuate these Afghan minorities, said ANI.\n\nAnother refugee thanked the government for providing urgent e-visas and safely evacuating them.\n\n\"We would like to thank the Indian government to give us urgent visas and help us to reach India.

    "UN leadership, developing countries hail India’s contribution to global good": "“India is a multilateral institution in its own right when it comes to its commitment to humanity… It is not just the fifth largest economy in the world but it is the largest economy in terms of its heart, compassion, humanity and putting lives ahead of profits.”\n\nAs Guyana’s foreign minister, Hugh Hilton Todd, spoke about the role India has played in helping countries in the Caribbean with its pandemic management, especially with the provision of vaccines, there was emotion and a sense of deep gratitude in his voice. “Can you imagine this is a country which has to take care of 1.3 billion of its citizens, yet finds time to help the world?”, he added with a sense of wonder.\n\nIt was this sense of wonder and acknowledgment of India’s post-Independence journey, coupled with hopes about its future and expectation that India will continue to contribute to global public goods, that marked a special event to celebrate India@75 and India’s special partnership with the United Nations (UN), on the sidelines of the UNGA, in New York on Saturday. The event was organised by the Permanent Mission of India to UN, led by India’s permanent representative Ruchira Khamboj.\n\nAnd the message came from all quarters, with the UNGA president attending the event in person in the busiest week of the year for him; the UN deputy Secretary General (SG) reading out the SG’s message on the occasion; the French foreign minister sending a message; and foreign ministers of Armenia, Antigua and Barbuda, Guyana, Jamaica, Tanzania, Maldives, Gambia, Timor-Leste, Cyprus and Yemen hailing India’s contribution from vaccines to food security, from development projects to international peacekeeping.\n\nFor India, it was a moment of pride but also a moment where it strongly sent out a message of commitment to multilateralism and solidarity with the global south, and the UN and global south reciprocated with all its vigour.\n\nExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar said he had a story to tell. “This year, India turns 75. In the 18th century, India accounted for quarter of global GDP. By the middle of the 20th century, colonialism ensured that we were one of the poorest nations in the world. That was our state when we became founding members of the UN. Now, India stands before you proudly as the fifth largest economy in the world. And it is the strongest, most enthusiastic and definitely the most argumentative democracy.”\n\nJaishankar spoke about how India’s development rested on digital public infrastructure that was designed to ensure that no one was left behind. “India today envisions itself as a developed country by 2047. We dream of digitising our most remote villages and landing on the moon and perhaps even digitising it.”\n\nAnd through this journey, he said, India had benefited from partnership with the UN and its agencies. He then listed out India’s own contribution to global good — the India-UN development partnership fund is the first ever single country south-south initiative and extends to 66 projects in 51 countries; a quarter of a million Indian personnel have participated in UN peacekeeping, more than that of any other country in the world; its leadership of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure is helping countries with clean energy and fighting the climate crisis; the provision of vaccines during the pandemic; and food assistance as the conflict in Ukraine has “aggravated food and energy inflation to make it one of the biggest challenges of our times”.\n\nCsaba Kőrösi, the president of the GA, wished India on its “diamond jubilee”, adding that this was preceded by thousands of year of its civilisational history. He said that the UN had spent the past week in unpacking various interlocking crises. But one thing was clear. “These are hard and difficult times. These are times of a paradigm shift..So far, we haven’t been able to analyse all the symptoms but conditions of global cooperation have changed. We have entered a new era, a new chapter of history.”\n\nAnd it was in this backdrop that as home to one-sixth of humanity, India’s “leadership and strong voice” mattered. The UNGA president pointed out that India was leading in digital public infrastructure, both in terms of innovative governance and citizen services. “International community has much to learn from India.” He added that during his stint, he aimed to bridge the gap between the global north and south, and India’s experiences and partnership in this regard would be very useful.\n\nThe UNSG Antonio Guterres’s message, read about by DSG Amina Mohammed, quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message at the last UNGA, “When India reforms, the world transforms”. The SG said India would be central to the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and recognised India’s post-independence development journey, in terms of poverty allievation and growth, life expectancy and health, education, food production, and solar capacity.\n\nBut just like in the case of Guyana, the most heartfelt messages came from foreign ministers of countries that had benefited from India’s support.\n\nJamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Johnson Smith, recalled the devastating consequences of the pandemic for her country and said she had never felt as “impotent” as she did when looking for vaccines. “When I spoke to Dr Jaishankar, it gave me hope.” Jamaica’s vaccination campaign kicked off with Indian provision of vaccine doses and for that, at a time when others were holding back their support, Jamaica was deeply grateful to India. She also noted how it was also India that provided vaccines to protect UN blue helmets, the peacekeepers.\n\nTanzania’s foreign minister, Liberata Mulamula, brought the house alive with her energy and said, “Our countries agree on everything. We are committed to end colonialism, to non alignment, to south south cooperation, combating climate change, SDGs and work together in maintaining global peace and participate together in peacekeeping operations.”\n\nMaldives foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, who finished his term as the UNGA president, said, “Maldives count on India’s leadership at multilateral fora”. He acknowledged India’s support in areas spanning disaster relief, pandemic and vaccines, economic recovery and helping address water related infrastructure in 34 of his country’s islands. Yemen thanked India for providing food supplies at a time of desperate need in recent months.\n\nAt the end of the event, hours before he was to give his address at the UNGA, Jaishankar tweeted, “At #UNGA, India normally speaks to the world. This morning, at India@75 event, the world spoke about India…This morning, at the India@75 event, a Foreign Minister said that she carried Vaccine Maitri inside her. Another, also from the global south noted that while India may be the 5th largest economy, it was one with the largest heart. How can you not have a good day after that!”\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",
    "‘There hasn’t been closure’: India mourns Queen but awaits apology": "Over the course of her seven-decade reign, Queen Elizabeth II made three visits to India, a country she would herald for its “richness and diversity”. But it was her third and final trip in 1997 that is often considered the most significant.\n\nIndia was celebrating 50 years of independence and on the Queen’s itinerary was a visit to Jallianwala Bagh, the site in the city of Amritsar where in 1919 a British general ordered thousands of peaceful protesters to be shot, a massacre that was one of the bloodiest episodes of British colonial rule over India. The hope among many was that the Queen’s visit would finally bring about a long-awaited apology for colonial atrocities. But in the end, the apology never came.\n\n“It is no secret that there have been some difficult episodes in our past,” said the Queen in her address the night before her visit. “Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise.”\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth was born in 1926, her grandfather was still the Emperor of India, which was under British rule for 200 years, but by the time she ascended to the throne in 1952, India had been independent for five years. At her wedding to Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the Queen was given a handkerchief by India’s best known freedom campaigner, Mahatma Gandhi, and it was said to remain one of her most treasured possessions.\n\nThe somewhat muted response to the Queen’s death in India reflects her complex position in a nation where the British monarchy is still seen as a lasting symbol of colonial rule that pillaged its lands for 200 years. India’s last viceroy before independence was the Queen’s distant cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten – also Prince Philip’s uncle – who oversaw the bloody partitioning of the country into the separate nations of India and Pakistan.\n\nIndia remains the largest country in the Commonwealth, which is largely made up of former British territories and is still formally headed by the British monarch. After news of the Queen’s death broke, a national day of mourning was declared and all flags were lowered to half-mast.\n\nThe Indian national flag flies at half-mast on the ramparts of Red Fort in Delhi. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will be remembered as a stalwart of our times,” tweeted India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “She provided inspiring leadership to her nation and people. She personified dignity and decency in public life. Pained by her demise.”\n\nBut though multiple Bollywood stars sent effusive condolences over the Queen’s death on social media, there was otherwise little public outpouring of grief.\n\nJyoti Atwal, a professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said that in India, the institution of the monarchy was still lambasted as a symbol of British rule. Hours before the death of the Queen was announced, Modi oversaw the renaming of Rajpath, a central avenue in Delhi that during the colonial period had been named in honour of King George V, Queen Elizabeth’s grandfather. Modi said Rajpath was a “symbol of slavery”, which would now be erased.\n\nHowever, Atwal said that on a personal level, the Queen’s visits to India, particularly her first in 1961, had earned her much affection and admiration – many people can still recall watching her riding through the streets of Delhi in her royal coach buggy.\n\n“The Queen represented the oppression of British rule and colonialism, but she was also viewed separately as a person, not just as a monarch, and people in India were very charmed by her visits, by that buggy culture,” said Atwal. “My mother still remembers the Queen’s visit in 1961; she was a child sitting in the front row when the Queen was travelling in the buggy. So it captured the public imagination even though it was clearly a remnant of the British Raj.”\n\nNonetheless, Atwal said, as the furore around the Queen’s visit to Jallianwala Bagh had demonstrated, in India there was a lasting expectation that the British monarchy should apologise for the injustices of colonial rule, which some view as an essential part of the process of decolonisation.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“There are large sections in India who still wanted an apology from the Queen and who still think there hasn’t been closure for the oppression of the Raj,” said Atwal. “The burden of giving that apology falls on the monarchy, not the prime minister or another member of the British government. So now that Charles is King, people in India will be expecting the apology from him.”\n\nSince the the Queen’s death, there have also been calls for the return of the Koh-I-Noor diamond, one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, which sits in the crown of the Queen Mother and is on display at the Tower of London. The diamond, which was mined in India, has been the source of a decades-long dispute between India and the UK, with India saying it was taken illegally.\n\nOver the weekend, the Indian MP and author Shashi Tharoor called its display in London a “powerful reminder of the injustices perpetrated by the former imperial power”. It is thought the crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond will now be worn by King Charles’s wife, Camilla, the Queen Consort.\n\n“Until it is returned at least as a symbolic gesture of expiation it will remain evidence of the loot, plunder and misappropriation that colonialism was really all about,” said Tharoor.\n\nNonetheless, in India’s financial hub of Mumbai, one community made a heartfelt tribute to the Queen. Years ago, the city’s famed dabbawalas, who deliver hot food from homes to workplaces in tiffin boxes, caught the attention of the royal family, and two dabbawalas were invited to the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla in 2005, where they breakfasted twice with the Queen.\n\n“We share the grief of the family of King Charles,” said the Mumbai Dabbawala Association in a statement. “We are very sad to hear about the death of Queen Elizabeth II and all dabbawalas pray that her soul rests in peace.”",

    "Indian and Chinese troops pull back from disputed Himalayan border area": "Indian and Chinese troops have begun to pull back from another disputed Himalayan border area, as peace talks between senior military officials after deadly clashes in 2020 continue.\n\nThe two defence ministries confirmed troops were disengaging from respective sides in the area of Gogra-Hot Springs, in a move “conducive to the peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.\n\nThe withdrawal was according to a consensus reached in July during the 16th and most recent round of bilateral talks between top commanders, both ministries said.\n\nIt marks the second major act of disengagement since August 2021, when troops “ceased forward deployments” and dismantled infrastructure in another area also near Gogra. The act was described at the time by India’s ministry as restoring the area on both sides to the “pre-standoff period”.\n\nThe dispute centres along the line of actual control (LAC), which divides areas of physical control, rather than territorial claims, and separates Chinese-held and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. It is broken into parts where Nepal and Bhutan border China.\n\nAccording to India, the control line is 2,167 miles (3,488km) long, while China says it is considerably shorter.\n\nTensions over the disputed section of border in the Himalayas exploded in June 2020, when at least 24 soldiers died during violent clashes. Indian authorities said 20 of its soldiers had died, while Beijing confirmed just four Chinese deaths. It was the deadliest event between the two nuclear powers in 50 years. After the clashes, in which soldiers fought with sticks and rocks in hand-to-hand combat, the two countries stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets along the LAC.\n\nAmid claims of continuing encroachment by the Chinese military, top military leaders from both sides have since met 16 times to negotiate and there have been several disengagements. However the two countries have struggled to agree on some specifics, and tensions have remained high.\n\nBrahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, said the return of peace and tranquillity in the border region “still looks distant”.\n\n“The latest disengagement agreement relates to the smallest Chinese encroachment – on a traditional Indian patrolling area,” Chellaney, who is also a former member of India’s national security advisory board, said.\n\n“China has been reluctant thus far to discuss with India its largest and deepest encroachment – into the northernmost Depsang plateau of the Indian Ladakh region.\n\n“China’s stealth encroachments of April 2020 on the borderlands of Indian Ladakh violated all its border-peace agreements with India over the years. Since then, China has engaged in a frenzied buildup of its military infrastructure and capabilities along the Himalayas. The two countries, consequently, remain on a war footing along the glaciated heights of the Himalayas.”",
    "How India's economic interest is better served by letting rupee weaken": "Just as it used sterling balances to meet the demand for imports in the 1950s, it can draw upon its stock of foreign exchange reserves to finance capital outflows at the prevailing exchange rate.\n\nIt can make it attractive for the private agents to supply the necessary dollars by letting it appreciate (and the rupee to depreciate).\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) had fought hard to hold the value of the US dollar below ₹80 in recent months, using up nearly $45 billion of its foreign exchange reserves since July 1. But it finally yielded to the pressure stemming from the latest interest-rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Board with the dollar attaining the value of ₹81 on September 22.Many analysts view this rise of the dollar and corresponding fall of the rupee as a sign of weakness in the Indian economy . But such inference is not only wrong but also encourages policymakers to rally behind a strong rupee when the national economic interest might well be served by allowing it to weaken.To understand how damaging wrong choices on the exchange rate can be, it is instructive to briefly digress to a historical episode going back to the 1950s. During World War 2, strong performance of Indian exports and tight controls on imports had allowed India to accumulate a large volume of foreign exchange in terms of the British pound sterling, which came to be called as the sterling balances.After the war, as India embarked upon its ambitious Five-Year Plans, it had to resort to money creation to finance part of the expenditure, which resulted in inflation rates exceeding those in its trading partners. With the nominal exchange rates fixed at the time, the higher inflation rates made Indian products uncompetitive relative to foreign ones. Imports became more attractive while, simultaneously, exports suffered.Evidently, this created a deficit in India's balance of payments (BoP), which had to be financed by drawing on the sterling balances. The availability of these balances proved a big blessing, since they allowed the country to import not just machinery and raw materials required for industrialisation but also consumer goods to soften the blow of inflation. Unfortunately, however, the sterling balances ran out by the end of 1957-58, and India came face-to-face with its first serious BoP crisis.At this point, India had two options: devalue the rupee to make Indian goods more competitive vis-a-vis those of its trading partners, or clamp down on imports by stricter enforcement of import licensing that had been in place since the World War. At the time, devaluation was widely viewed as equivalent to admission that the economy is fundamentally weak. Therefore, there was no political constituency whatsoever for it. So, strict import licensing buttressed by exchange control became the default choice.Many of the problems associated with the licence-permit raj that followed in the 1960s and beyond had their origins in this fateful policy choice. Even then, the government found itself compelled to devalue the rupee subsequently in June 1966. But it was too little too late by then and, moreover, the policy was ill-timed. Two back-to-back droughts effectively overwhelmed any positive effects that the devaluation could have had.Though the current policy environment is very different from that in the 1950s, the lessons of this episode remain relevant. The origins of the pressure on the rupee today are to be traced not in higher inflation rates at home but in the rising interest rates in the US in the face of high degree of international mobility of financial capital. Attracted by these high interest rates, financial capital in India seeks to flow to the US and puts downward pressure on the rupee.As in the 1950s, India, specifically RBI, has two options in the face of these capital outflows:If the RBI chooses the first strategy while its trading partners choose the second, Indian goods become uncompetitive vis-a-vis those of the latter. As in the 1950s, exports would suffer and the temptation to increase protection against imports would rise. Additionally, there is the risk that - as happened with the sterling balances in the 1950s - our foreign exchange reserves will drop and undermine the ability of RBI to credibly stabilise future exchange-rate fluctuations.While RBI has used a mix of these two options till date, it has relied more heavily on the first than is the case with several of its trading partners. Consequently, its reserves have seen a significant depletion, while Indian goods have experienced a loss of competitiveness vis-a-vis those of the latter. Most recently, the central bank seems to have concluded that the US war on inflation - and, therefore, its interest rate hikes - and pressures for financial capital outflows from India are likely to continue for some time. Hence, it has shifted the mix of the policies towards the second option.This is a welcome shift since maintaining the competitiveness of Indian goods both at home and abroad, as well as safeguarding the foreign exchange reserves, are essential to sustaining the current growth momentum in the economy.",

    "VPN Providers Flee India as a New Data Law Takes Hold": "Ahead of the deadline to comply with the Indian government’s new data-collection rules, VPN companies from across the globe have pulled their servers out of the country in a bid to protect their users’ privacy.\n\nStarting today, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT—a body appointed by the Indian government to deal with cybersecurity and threats—will require VPN operators to collect and maintain customer information including names, email addresses, and IP addresses for at least five years, even after they have canceled their subscription or account.\n\nIn April, CERT said it needed to implement these rules because “the requisite information is not found available” with the security provider during investigations into cybersecurity threats, thereby thwarting inquiries. The new rules, CERT claims, will “strengthen cyber security in India” and are “in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of India.”\n\nVPN companies and privacy experts believe this move impacts user privacy and freedom of speech, and defeats the sole purpose of using VPNs, which encrypt users’ internet activity and mask their locations and identities.\n\n“As digital privacy and security advocates, we are concerned about the possible effect this regulation may have on not only our users but people’s data in general,” says NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrylyte. “From what it seems, the amount of stored private information will be drastically increased throughout hundreds or maybe thousands of different companies.” She adds that similar regulations have been “typically introduced by authoritarian governments in order to gain more control over their citizens.”\n\nLast year, India became the country with the highest rate of growth in the use of VPN services worldwide. During the first half of 2021, 348.7 million VPNs were installed, showing a 671 percent jump in growth when compared to the same period in 2020, according to a 2021 analysis by Atlas VPN. This massive growth can be attributed to continuous internet shutdowns, a rise in digital scams, and the need for Indians to protect themselves online.\n\n“VPNs by nature can be a privacy advancing tool and can be capable of protecting information security in multiple ways, being used by individuals and companies to secure confidential information,” says Tejasi Panjiar, associate policy counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation. “They also help secure digital rights under the constitution, especially for journalists and whistleblowers, because the nature of information that’s transferred over VPNs is primarily encrypted, which allows them not only to secure confidential information but also to safeguard their own identity, protecting them from surveillance and censorship.”\n\nThe government defended its rules, saying it will not violate user privacy as information would be sought only on a case-by-case basis. This claim ignores the Indian government’s track record of surveilling critics, politicians, and activists. In August, an official investigation into whether Indians were spied on by the government using Israeli spyware Pegasus revealed that at least five phones of victims contained malware, but refused to disclose the report. Instead, the country’s top court recommended that existing surveillance laws incorporate the right to privacy and introduce mechanisms for citizens to raise complaints against illegal surveillance.",
    "Kuldeep hat-trick, Shaw 48-ball 77 the highlights as India A claim series": "Rachin Ravindra, Joe Carter score fifties but find little support from others as India A romp home with 16 overs to spare\n\nIndia A 222 for 6 (Shaw 77, van Beek 3-46) beat New Zealand A 219 (Carter 72, Ravindra 61, Kuldeep 4-51, Dhawan 2-16, Chahar 2-50) by four wickets\n\nKuldeep Yadav 's four-wicket burst, which included a hat-trick, backed up by Prithvi Shaw 's 48-ball 77 headlined India A's comfortable four-wicket win over New Zealand A in the second unofficial ODI in Chennai. With this win, India A took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.\n\nBatting first, the visitors lost Chad Bowes in the sixth over to Umran Malik . Dane Cleaver fell soon after, but Rachin Ravindra held fort with a 65-ball 61. Rishi Dhawan then got into the act sending back Ravindra and captain Robert O'Donnell in the space of three balls as New Zealand A slipped to 106 for 4 that soon became 133 for 5 with Raj Bawa removing Tom Bruce.\n\nJoe Carter , who has been excellent all through this tour , kept fighting. He struck one four and three sixes in his 72 off 80 balls but found little support from the other end. He added 57 runs for the sixth wicket with Sean Solia, but once Carter fell to Rahul Chahar in the 42nd over, New Zealand A folded quickly. Kuldeep claimed a hat-trick, removing New Zealand A's last three batters - Logan van Beek caught by Shaw, Joe Walker caught behind by Sanju Samson and Jacob Duffy out lbw - to wrap up the innings on 219.\n\nAlready behind in the game, New Zealand A suffered even further as Shaw came out swinging. The opener smashed 11 fours and three sixes during his knock, adding 82 runs for the first wicket with Ruturaj Gaikwad, and 49 more for the second wicket with Rajat Patidar.\n\nIndia A did lose their way a bit in the middle, slipping from 131 for 1 to 134 for 4 with Patidar, Shaw, and Tilak Varma falling in the space of nine balls. However, Samson and Dhawan took the hosts forward with a 46-run stand before Shardul Thakur's 24-ball 25 not out provided the finishing touches.",
    "India arrests dozens after nationwide raids on Muslim group PFI": "An earlier version of this story quoted erroneous Indian media reports that said more than 100 PFI members were arrested. This was incorrect - the number of those arrested was 45 - and has now been corrected.\n\nOfficials at India’s top investigation agencies say they have conducted nationwide raids and arrested 45 people associated with a prominent Muslim organisation for alleged terror links.\n\nThe simultaneous raids on the offices of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and homes of its members were conducted by the federally controlled National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at 93 locations in 15 Indian states, the NIA said in a statement on Thursday evening.\n\nNIA said the searches were conducted at the houses and offices of top PFI leaders and members in connection with five cases related to “funding of terrorism and terrorist activities, organising training camps for providing armed training and radicalising people to join banned organisations”.\n\n“As on date, the NIA is investigating a total of 19 PFI-related cases,” said the statement.\n\nMost of the arrests were made in the southern states. In Kerala, where PFI enjoys considerable influence in Muslim-majority areas, 19 people were arrested, the NIA said in its statement.\n\nArrests were also made in Tamil Nadu (11), Karnataka (7), Andhra Pradesh (4), Rajasthan (2) and one each from Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, according to the statement.\n\nEarlier, Indian media reports said more than 100 PFI leaders and members were arrested in the raids.\n\nThe PFI was established in 2007 after the merger of three Muslim groups – the National Democratic Front in Kerala, the Karnataka Forum for Dignity in Karnataka, and the Manitha Neethi Pasarai in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn 2009, the organisation formed its political wing, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), to contest elections.\n\nPFI says it works for the rights of Muslims and other marginalised communities in India. But right-wing Hindu groups, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accuses the group of violent attacks on its members.\n\n‘Totalitarian regime using agencies as puppets’\n\nFederal minister Giriraj Singh accused PFI of “working against India” and his counterpart Ramdas Athawale said the group was “linked to terror organisations”.\n\n“We don’t have problems with running an organisation or bringing together Muslim community. But taking the name of this country and spreading terrorism, then there is a need to take action. I welcome the NIA and ED raids,” Athawale told reporters.\n\n“PFI should change itself if they want to live in India … They should stand with India.”\n\nBut the PFI called the NIA and ED raids a “witch hunt” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government.\n\n“Popular Front will never ever surrender on any scary action by a totalitarian regime using the central agencies as its puppets and will stand firm on its will for recovering the democratic system and spirit of the constitution of our beloved country,” it said in the statement shared with Al Jazeera.\n\nThe raids sparked protests in several parts of Kerala, where the PFI has called for a strike on Friday. Similar protests were also reported from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states.\n\nRights activists have accused the government of using investigative agencies to harass and intimidate groups critical of its policies. Muslim organisations have particularly come under attack and are often accused of terror links, they said.\n\n“There are Hindu supremacist organisations and their leaders who are regularly giving calls of violence against Muslims. How come their organisations face no scrutiny whatsoever, let alone raids and all? Those people are allowed to go free, they are not punished,” activist Kavita Krishnan told Al Jazeera.\n\nKrishnan said the raids – which she described as “Islamophobic profiling” – were reminiscent of the ones conducted against another Muslim group, the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in 2000.\n\n“We know what happened as a result of those raids (on SIMI). So many innocent people who were not implicated in any crime were profiled and implicated in so many cases. They were acquitted much later in those cases and found innocent. They unnecessarily had to spend time in prison,” she said.\n\n“The danger is that PFI is also going to result in a similar kind of situation.”\n\nSIMI, which was formed in 1976, was banned soon after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Many people alleged to be linked with the group were arrested on terrorism charges. Most of them were freed after spending years in jail and the courts not finding any evidence against them.\n\nIn one incident in 2001, 127 Muslim men were arrested during a seminar in Gujarat state and accused of terror links. Last year, a local court acquitted all of the men, declaring them innocent. Five of them died during the trial.\n\n“I feel if there is a specific allegation against a specific crime against a specific person, pursue that. But branding entire organisations and ideologies as criminal is something that the Supreme Court has repeatedly said should not be done. Even belonging to an organisation cannot be a crime,” said Krishnan."
