    "Brazil oil production to increase 70% by end of decade, says minister": "The Brazilian government forecasts the country’s oil production will grow 70% by the end of the decade, propelled by multibillion-dollar investments from state-controlled company Petrobras and other operators.\n\nBrazil is recovering faster when compared to the world’s largest economies, Mines & Energy Minister Adolfo Sachsida said on Monday during the opening ceremony of the Rio Oil & Gas 2022 conference.\n\n“Something different is happening in Brazil. We are cutting taxes and undergoing the largest economic revolution since 1990,” said Sachsida, highlighting that gross domestic product is on the rise and inflation is falling.",
    "Brazilian election will determine the future of the Amazon rainforest": "The re-election of president Jair Bolsonaro would severely harm the Amazon rainforest, while his rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is promising to reverse much of the recent environmental damage and meet climate change targets\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva (left) and Jair Bolsonaro are the main presidential contenders in the Brazilian election Foto Arena LTDA/Alamy\n\nThe upcoming Brazilian election will decide the fate of the Amazon rainforest, ecologists have warned, as the country looks set to choose between re-electing current president Jair Bolsonaro or his rival and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nSince Bolsonaro took office in 2019, deforestation records have repeatedly been broken as his administration pursued a policy of environmental deregulation. Now, ahead of the 2 October poll, the Amazon is under increased threat as land-grabbers are exploiting what could be their final opportunity to clear trees without retribution, says Philip Fearnside at the National Institute for Research in Amazonia.\n\nThe number of fires in the Brazilian Amazon usually increases in June, when ranchers take advantage of a drop in rainfall to clear land. But even for the dry season, the level of blazes in the Amazon this year has shocked conservationists: 31,513 fires were detected by Brazil’s national space agency in August, the highest number in 12 years and almost half the number seen in the entirety of 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People realise they can get away with ignoring all the current environmental regulations under Bolsonaro, but the end of his first term is looming and many assume he may not be re-elected,” says Fearnside.\n\nIssues like soaring inflation and hunger levels are high on the political agenda, but the vote is also a referendum on the future of the Amazon, say researchers.\n\n“I don’t say this lightly as a scientist, but this is the most important election ever in Brazil for the Amazon and its survival,” says Erika Berenguer at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe amount of forest lost in the Amazon is now 74.65 per cent higher than when Bolsonaro took office, with 13,000 hectares cleared in 2021 alone, the largest annual figure since 2008.\n\nThis deforestation has pushed the Amazon to a tipping point, say ecologists. Unless this is halted, the rainforest will no longer be able to store enough moisture to support itself and will become a savannah.\n\nExperts blame Bolsonaro for the destruction. The president has stripped environmental regulations, appointed military officials who seek to develop the Amazon to run environmental institutions and publicly encouraged colonisation of the forest. “The Bolsonaro administration has been a complete disaster for the environment,” says Fearnside.\n\nBolsonaro’s main opponent, Lula, was president from 2003 to 2010 and leads the latest polls with 41 per cent to Bolsonaro’s 37 per cent. To win in the first round and avoid a run-off poll, scheduled for 30 October, a candidate must gain 50 per cent of the votes.\n\nRead more: Global forest destruction continues despite COP26 deforestation pledge\n\nFormer governor of the state of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, and senator Simone Tebet are also in the presidential race, but are outsiders, polling 8 and 6 per cent, respectively.\n\nLula says he will reverse the environmental damage by dissolving many of Bolsonaro’s decrees, appointing experts to environmental agencies and purging Indigenous reserves of illegal miners.\n\nThe former president has also proposed more ambitious measures, such as the creation of a carbon-pricing scheme, a ministry dedicated to Indigenous peoples and a National Climate Change Authority to ensure Brazil’s policies are in line with its Paris Agreement targets.\n\nConservationists have raised concerns over mega-dams constructed when Lula was in power, but the former union leader has a strong track record on defending the Amazon: deforestation plunged 72 per cent between 2004 and 2016, when Lula and then Dilma Rousseff – his successor as both leader of the Workers’ party and president – were in power.\n\nLula’s administration made Amazon conservation a central goal for all government ministries, says Suely Araújo at the Climate Observatory in São Paulo. As well as stepping up forest monitoring, they sought to tackle the causes of deforestation by promoting sustainable production and formalising land ownership.\n\nThe task this time would be more complicated. Growing mining communities depend on the illicit gold they extract from Indigenous reserves, new roads have been constructed and regions of the Amazon have become lawless.\n\nRead more: Deforestation in Brazil has rocketed since Bolsonaro became president\n\nIf elected, Lula’s strategy will have to be more ambitious this time round, says Izabella Teixeira, the candidate’s adviser on the environment and Brazil’s environment minister from 2010 to 2016.\n\nAs well as military operations to clear the Amazon of illegal miners, loggers and ranchers, the government has to better regulate food and gold markets, incentivise sustainable production and use technology to make agriculture more sustainable, she says.\n\n“I think that Lula is very cautious to understand that this is a huge challenge and is completely different than it was in the past,” says Teixeira.\n\nLula would unite the government with the private sector, scientists and civil society to tackle the root causes of deforestation, Teixeira adds. He would also seek to restore the international relationships and conservation funding that have been lost under Bolsonaro, making Brazil a global leader on tackling climate change, she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolosonaro has played down the growing deforestation. He told the UN General Assembly in New York on 20 September that the Amazon is as pristine today as it was in the 1500s. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up to our free Fix the Planet newsletter to get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox, every Thursday",

    "A Strategic Moment for the U.S.-Brazil Relationship": "Brazil’s upcoming presidential election on October 2 is not taking place in an international vacuum. To paraphrase an old saying, never entirely accurate, Brazil is not just a “country of the future.” Seismic shifts taking place around the world are placing its current importance in stark relief.\n\nBrazil is emerging as a central actor in global food and energy supply chains, on climate change, in multilateral and regional organizations, and on engagement with China in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil could certainly be more of a partner to the U.S. in addressing these issues. The bilateral relationship, however, has rarely been particularly strategic for either country. Making it more so in the context of the changing international landscape is the challenge.\n\nThe future of bilateral ties rests not only on how Washington engages with Brazil, but also on a successful democratic outcome to upcoming elections and the priorities of the next Brazilian government. The contentious campaign is certainly raising concerns internationally and within Brazil about whether the incumbent, President Jair Bolsonaro, will accept a result where his main rival, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is declared the victor. But if the door opens to a more dynamic relationship—regardless of who wins—both countries will have a rare opportunity to work together at a critical moment for the hemisphere and for the world.\n\nA more influential global force\n\nMeanwhile, global possibilities for Brazil are opening. Take, for example, the world economy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated the urgency of diversifying and increasing the medium-term availability of energy and food supplies. Brazil is a central and strategic player, both as a major energy producer and as an agricultural powerhouse. The country’s oil and gas production is now among the ten largest in the world. Brazil is also among the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, corn, meat, sugar and coffee and has a modern agricultural sector capable of expanding production to meet global demand.\n\nAs tensions with China increase and supply-chain relationships are redefined, major but non-aligned economies like India and Brazil have also become key players in the emerging trade and investment frameworks in their regions and beyond. India is increasingly influential and central to efforts by the U.S. to strengthen the broader Indo-Pacific economy by diversifying supply chains and promoting open trade, digital innovation and clean energy.\n\nThe landscape is similar in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The U.S. presented an economic agenda at the Summit of the Americas in June 2022 that emphasized innovation, fighting climate change, opportunities for near-shoring supply chains and economic growth. It is impossible to imagine moving forward strategically in the region without Brazil.\n\nBrazil, like India, can also be more of a partner in multilateral organizations at a time when China is challenging within those institutions, and there is less agreement on the rules of the game for the global economy. Brazil historically is a strong believer and actor in international institutions.\n\nMoreover, as regional trade blocs become more of a factor in the global economy, Brazil’s voice and actions may carry greater weight. The trade grouping of Mercosur, which includes Brazil, is resuming discussions with the European Union on a long-stalled trade agreement. As Brazil emerges as China’s key trading and investment partner in the region, U.S. concerns about the hemisphere’s growing ties to Beijing are only likely to be addressed fully with Brazil at the table.\n\nBrazil, like India, continues to emphasize a largely non-aligned vision of international relations. It should not have been a surprise that neither country took a strong stand on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; or that both are active in the BRICS organization which groups them with China, Russia and South Africa.\n\nBut no one serious in Brasília is suggesting following the Chinese model of development. Brazil, after all, has also begun the process of accession\n\nto the OECD. The social transformation of Brazil that began after the return of democracy requires further reforms and faster growth\n\nFinally, Brazil remains central to combating climate change globally. Concern is rightly widespread about the accelerating rate of deforestation in the Amazon. The murders this year of journalist Dom Phillips and environmental defender Bruno Araujo Pereira tragically highlighted the challenge. As the international community responds to the unprecedented impact of global warming, however, it is critical to reengage Brazil as a key partner in a more constructive and strategic dialogue than exists at present.\n\nTensions at home\n\nOpportunities for the world to engage with Brazil are significant—but taking advantage of them depends to a great extent on whether Brazil’s politicians respect whatever choice the country’s voters make in the upcoming elections.\n\nPolitical tensions are likely to heighten in the coming weeks, but it would be wrong to think there are no guardrails in Brazil’s democracy. Its legal and electoral systems are stronger than they seem to receive credit for, and there are no indications that Brazil’s military as an institution is looking to intervene on behalf of any candidate. U.S. Defense Secretary Austin visited Brasília in July to convey to his counterparts the importance of a transparent electoral process. Other high-level U.S. officials have paid visits over the past few months transmitting the same message, including Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, in August.\n\nWhat’s more, many of the sharp differences visible in Brazil’s presidential election are not reflected in national congressional or state elections, which will also be held on October 2. Since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, the country’s now more than 150 million eligible voters have favored a largely centrist mix of parties focused on transactional politics. The mix of candidates for October’s legislative and gubernatorial elections look unlikely to alter that pattern.\n\nWashington has expressed strong confidence in Brazil’s electoral system as a model for Latin America—and all hopes are that it will prevail. While the international community would certainly react against any effort to subvert the outcome, it should be equally prepared to welcome another successful democratic electoral process.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas (CDMA) in Brasilia on July 26, 2022. Photo by Mateus Bonomi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.\n\nA wide array of venues for collaboration\n\nIn the latter case, there will be the chance to reframe the U.S.-Brazil relationship to reflect both new global realities and strengthened bilateral ties, despite the ups-and-downs of the past decade. Doing so would also require recognizing Brazil as a global player, with its own priorities that do not always mirror those of the U.S. There will inevitably be tension with whomever wins the elections—but that does not preclude the U.S. and Brazil from finding common ground.\n\nThe scale of high-level dialogues and working relationships sustained by the two countries is, in fact, remarkable. There is a U.S.-Brazil Commercial Dialogue; an Energy Forum; a Critical Minerals Working Group; there is the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum and Defense Industry Dialogue.\n\nSome channels work better than others, but the institutional framework is deep—to which can be added several important recent agreements. Brazil in 2021 became the first Latin American country, and one of only a dozen globally, to sign the Artemis Accords, which promotes the peaceful and transparent use of outer space. This followed a long-sought Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA), approved in 2019, which permits U.S. space launches from Brazil’s Alcântara Space Center.\n\nBilateral cooperation on pandemic response and medical research is long-standing and cutting-edge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has worked in Brazil for almost twenty years, where the National Institute of Health (NIH) also has its largest Latin America research portfolio. Cooperation can be traced back decades to the early stages of the HIV/AIDS and Zika pandemics and has continued more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nU.S.-Brazil cooperation on environmental protection continues, too—though it is falling far short of its potential. People-to-people ties are stronger than often recognized, with Brazilians among the top ten visitor streams to the United States. Brazil remains a major trading partner for the United States. Though China is now more important to Brazil for trade, the portion of high-value exports destined for the U.S. is critical—while U.S. investment in the country is still higher than China’s. Brazil remains an important participant in international peacekeeping and is now a major non-NATO ally, creating a new platform for greater strategic engagement between the two countries.\n\nLooking ahead, there is nothing wrong with the U.S.-Brazil relationship maintaining a strongly economic cast. But issues of energy, climate change, food production, digital revolutions, pandemic responses and Chinese investment and trade practices have all become profoundly geopolitical in today’s uncertain world. Addressing them requires cooperation from a wider set of partners than those included in the U.S.’s traditional alliances.\n\nThe Biden administration is currently involved in multiple bilateral dialogues with India and collaboration through the Quad discussions. It is time to approach Brazil with the same strategic mindset and seriousness of purpose.\n\n—\n\nMcKinley is former U.S. ambassador to Brazil (2017-18).\n\nBerg is director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
    "Why Brazilian football fans are ditching the yellow jersey": "Once an icon of unity and luck, the association of the shirt with Brazil’s far right has led football fans to give up on it.\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil – Higor Ramalho, an ardent football fan, plans to resume his regular trips to football stadiums as worries over the spread of the coronavirus ease, restrictions are lifted and the nation gets into the World Cup spirit.\n\nHowever, the famous yellow jersey associated with the Brazilian national team has been hanging in his closet since June 2018. The last time he wore it was on his birthday. He does not know when, and if, he will ever wear it again.\n\n“Wearing the yellow jersey was a moment of pride for me,” the 33-year-old told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It was a symbol of victory. I used to wear it not only while watching matches but also on regular days. Now, I have stopped wearing it for political reasons. The current president, along with his supporters, turned the yellow jersey into a political campaign and a symbol of their political party.\n\n“And as I don’t support their political ideas, I refuse to be mistaken as one of them.”\n\nThe yellow jersey, known as the “canarinho jersey”, has not always been the Brazil national team’s shirt.\n\nIt was designed in 1953, three years after the World Cup final heartbreak at the hands of Uruguay in the Maracana. At the time, the national team wore white.\n\nThe national football governing body, along with a newspaper, launched a competition to design a new uniform for the national side, the condition being the new kit should have the colours of the national flag as the current did not carry “the idea of Brazilian nationality”.\n\nMore than 300 entries were submitted. The winning submission was by Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a Brazilian who felt torn by the 1950 result given that he was born on the border with Uruguay.\n\nFast forward many years, including a record five football World Cup wins and two Copa America triumphs, the yellow jersey had become a symbol of optimism, luck and unity among football fans.\n\nThe number 10 worn by Pele during his mesmerising years on the pitch, Ronaldo’s number 9 when he became a World Cup winner and Romario’s number 11 during his dazzling World Cup 1994 run all became part of Brazil’s rich and successful history on the pitch.\n\nBut the shirt’s adoption in political campaigns, most recently by President Jair Bolsonaro and his right-wing supporters prior to his 2018 election win, forced a huge number of fans to give up on it.\n\nAnalysts say those same iconic moments of Brazilian football are being used off the pitch to promote ideas antithetical to the unity that made the national team, and the country, famous.\n\n“Football is something iconic for Brazil, it is what brings everybody together most of the time,” Isabela Guedes, 25, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“When they [right-wing supporters] take something so meaningful for the country and use it with political intentions, it is like they are stealing it from us. I don’t feel comfortable hanging a flag on my window during the World Cup because I will be mistaken for people with completely different political views.\n\n“They have taken the flag and yellow jersey and turned them into political symbols.”\n\nCo-opting the jersey did not start with Bolsanaro supporters. In 1970, the military dictatorship used the national flag and the team’s image, associating the essence of Brazil with the team, according to Carolina Fontenelle, a researcher at the Laboratory of Media and Sports Studies at UERJ.\n\nGeneral Medici, Brazil’s military leader at the time, also played a big role in the removal of the national team coach ahead of the 1970 Mexico World Cup.\n\nWith time, and these efforts, a strong connection was formed between Brazilians and their team’s jersey, she added.\n\n“Since then, the yellow jersey has been perceived as a symbol. People look at that jersey and wear it with pride because they feel part of a group,” Fontenelle told Al Jazeera.\n\nBefore that, during the 2013 riots protesting a rise in the cost of living, corruption and police brutality, the jersey took on another aspect.\n\n“People part of the riots were also wearing it. There was a high number of people on the streets protesting against many things, including the money spent on the World Cup 2014. In 2018, we had the far-right wearing the jersey,” Fontenelle said.\n\n“So those who don’t agree with it start to feel ashamed. The jersey gives a feeling that you belong to a group and this feeling is lost when it is being used by a political group that doesn’t defend the minorities.”\n\n“During the 2014 elections, the campaign of [centre-right candidate] Aecio Neves hijacked the colours of the Brazilian flag,” Fontenelle said.\n\n#GiveBackOurFlag\n\nJust over two years ago, a campaign, led by writer and filmmaker Joao Carlos Assumpcao, demanded the national football body abolish the famous yellow jersey and bring back the white and blue kit.\n\n“We’re in a ghastly situation with a horrendous government that has stolen our flag,” Assumpcao had said at the time.\n\nSeveral pro-democracy groups, including the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, tried to dissociate the colour with the far-right campaign.\n\nIn 2020, following campaigns by Bolsonaro supporters on the Supreme Court and Congress, it urged its readers to wear yellow as part of the dissociation campaign.\n\n#DevolvamNossaBandeira (#GiveBackOurFlag) also got the backing of several political figures.\n\n“Football is for everyone, I don’t like it [the jersey] being used by people who promote racism, sexism and discrimination,” Ademir Takara, the librarian and historian at the Museum of Football in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The shirt is the opposite of that. It represents unity and it’s not being used for that purpose. There’s an affectionate relationship between people and the shirt – the beautiful game attached to something it represented.\n\n“From 2013, it has become a political thing more than ever before. It’s being used by people with different ideas who wanted something to unify them and the shirt was the easiest and strongest thing they saw.”\n\nEarlier this month, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters flocked the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, among other cities, as part of a campaign push ahead of the October elections, just a month ahead of the Qatar World Cup.\n\nMany of them wore the yellow jersey.\n\nFormer president Luiz Inacio Lula, tipped to win next month’s polls, lashed out at the demonstration on the anniversary of Brazil’s 200 years of independence.\n\n“7 September should be a day of love and union for Brazil. Unfortunately, that’s not what is happening today. I have faith Brazil will recover its flag, its sovereignty and its democracy,” Lula tweeted.\n\nWith love for the jersey, football fan Marina Moreno told Al Jazeera how “frustrated” she was “to see the yellow jersey becoming a symbol of the current government”.\n\n“Today, it is almost impossible to not associate it with the current president and his supporters. It’s automatic and it’s frustrating. I don’t support the current government and I don’t want to be mistaken for one of his supporters so I decided to don’t to wear it any more.”",

    "UK-Brazil Conversa 2022": "After 2 years in online mode, I am delighted to be able to be with you all here, in person, to speak about what has been and will be our priority for the next years: how to enhance the UK-Brazil collaboration whilst reflecting upon our areas of common interest and I am very keen we are able to advance with these conversations through the Conversa.\n\nI want to talk to you about the UK’s foreign policy vision for the world as outlined in the Integrated Review and how we want to work with Brazil and Brazilians to not only strengthen our great friendship but turn it into a bold partnership.\n\nI also want to talk about the breadth and strength of our relationship, which we have advanced in many areas, from science & innovation, security and dealing with emerging cyber threats, climate and green growth, expanding digital access, English language teaching, bilateral trade and more.\n\nThe Integrated Review\n\nThe UK Government set out its foreign policy vision for the role that the UK will play in the world through the Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy which was published in May last year.\n\nIt sets out the how the UK can work across all parts of government, using all of its capabilities, and most importantly through building international partnerships to meet global challenges and protect and champion our interests and values.\n\nOur over-arching aim is to be an active force for good in the world.\n\nThat is underpinned by our fundamental values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, freedom of speech and faith, and equality.\n\nGlobally, our work will focus on five key objectives: solving global challenges, investing in science and technology; defending democracy and human rights; championing the free flow of trade, capital and knowledge; and taking a more robust approach to security and deterrence.\n\nFundamentally, the review recognises that we cannot do this alone. To be successful and to meet these global challenges we have to work collaboratively. Cooperation with our allies is central to our success.\n\nBrazil and the UK are natural allies and share an alliance founded on friendship, a shared commitment to democratic values, freedom and the market economy. We have strong and deepening bilateral, commercial, security and cultural ties. It is right that we view Brazil as a strategic partner in our efforts to meet the global challenges we face today.\n\nSolving Global Challenges – Russia/Ukraine\n\nAnd there is no bigger challenge or threat to the rules based international system than the senseless act of aggression and brutality by Russia against Ukraine and its people. A malicious act against a sovereign, independent state which if Putin wins, threatens not just Ukraine but threatens our shared democratic values on a global scale as well as our national security.\n\nThe free world has united behind Ukraine in its fight for freedom. And it’s this united stance that we must maintain, so that those that seek to undermine the integrity and self-determination of another independent nation are not only contained but will fail.\n\nWhat the situation in Ukraine has shown us is that our current security and economic structures created after the Second World War are no longer fit for purpose. A new approach is needed that builds stronger global alliances and is better able to uphold the rules-based system.\n\nMultilateral institutions must be able to support effective coordination amongst sovereign nations to ensure peaceful international cooperation. They must defend and promote fundamental freedoms, which are essential for human dignity.\n\nAs part of these needed reforms the United Kingdom is committed to the reform of the UN Security Council – another point of common interest between Brazil and the UK. We acknowledge the world has changed and the Council must change too, to better reflect the world in the twenty first century, and to better respond to the threats to international peace and security that confront us. With this we support Brazil in its ambition of a Permanent Seat as part of a reformed and expanded Security Council.\n\nBut to meet today’s challenges our prosperity and security must be built on a network of strong partnerships. Working flexible groupings of like-minded partners to face specific challenges where we share a common position.\n\nAs our Foreign Secretary has said, in this new increasingly multipolar world, the UK is prepared to do things differently, to think differently and work differently with partners to get things done.\n\nSolving Global Challenges – Climate Change\n\nConfronting Climate Change is another great example of the UK and Brazil successfully working together to resolve an urgent global challenge.\n\nBrazil plays a key role as a G20 member and is home of around 60% of the Amazon rainforest. Under the UK’s COP26 Presidency - which runs from last November until next November – we are working with Brazil to implement the Glasgow Climate Pact, which Brazil helped create during the COP26 Conference in Glasgow. This global agreement represents almost 200 countries and will accelerate action on climate necessary to limit global temperature rise to with 1.5 degrees.\n\nDuring COP 26 Brazil committed to half its GHG emissions by 2030, to reach net zero by 2050 and to achieve zero illegal deforestation by 2028. It has 14 states, over 40 cities and 200 businesses pledge to the Race to Zero Campaign. Ambitious and laudable goals which deserve greater recognition.\n\nImplementation of these commitments is now critical. Managing emissions from deforestation, agriculture and related supply chains, including growing soy for livestock feed, will be crucial to keep the goals of limiting global temperature warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nImplementation will be challenging given the size of Brazil. But this could be dwarfed by the economic and social opportunities an economy-wide shift towards net zero would provide given Brazil’s natural gifts. Momentum is building in Brazil but there is much we can do together to ensure that our post-pandemic economic recovery is based on building sustainable, resilient economies that support green jobs and sustainable land use. There are advantages a transition to a low carbon economy would bring to the economy.\n\nWhen compared to business-as-usual, a low-carbon and climate resilient economic recovery in Brazil could deliver by 2030[1]\n\na net increase of more than two million jobs –four times more jobs than those already existing in Brazil’s oil and gas industry, a total GDP gain of US$ 535 billion (R$ 2.8 trillion) – equivalent to the annual GDP of Belgium\n\nUS$ 3.7 billion (R$ 19 billion) in additional agricultural production\n\nUS$ 144 million (R$ 742 million) in additional tax revenues from the agricultural sector alone; restoration of 12 million hectares or more of degraded pasturelands to more productive uses such as intensive grazing and natural forest\n\nWe will support Brazil’s global leadership in sustainable agriculture and to foster closer connections between the UK and Brazilian agri-tech ecosystems. We will support initiatives to boost connectivity in Brazil’s remotest areas to enable the use of precision agriculture, and stand ready to mutually share expertise on sustainability practices, and engage the private sectors from both Brazil and the UK who are an integral part of the solution.\n\nBrazil has the largest financial sector in Latin America and this sector has a vital role to play in the transition to net zero. Only through mobilising private finance can we match the scale of investment required for the net-zero transition.\n\nI am pleased that many major Brazilian financial institutions and asset managers came together at COP26 to join the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero. The goal of the alliance, which so far represents over $130 trillion of private finance assets, is to transform the global financial system in order to finance the investment needed to achieve a net-zero economy\n\nThe challenges are great, but the UK is committed to partner with Brazil to face them.\n\nBrazil is one of four of the biggest recipients of International Climate Financing, totalling over £275m over 20 programmes in areas such as forests, agriculture, cities, energy transition and infrastructure. The programme mobilizes private investments into sustainable, low carbon projects and incentivises the use of emerging eco-friendly technologies.\n\nThe Brazil Energy Prosperity Programme is a crucial example of UK-Brazil cooperation in efforts to support Brazil’s transition to clean energy, supporting work on offshore wind, waste to energy, and biofuels.\n\nAnd offshore wind has the potential to become a true example of partnership between the UK and Brazil. Through expanding off-shore wind Brazil has the potential to build the foundations for a huge new renewable energy sector. Supporting and complimenting hydropower, while making a major contribution to reducing Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions, and meeting growing energy needs. The UK is the world leader in offshore wind, with more installed capacity than any other country and through initiatives such as our annual Energy Showcase event that took place this week, and technical support through the Brazil Energy prosperity programme, we are building the basis of a long term green growth partnership.\n\nInvestment in Science, Digital and Technology\n\nIt is not just in tackling climate change where a focus on innovation and technology is important. The integrated review puts investment in science digital and technology as the foundation of the UK’s future economy, security and defence policy.\n\nTechnological developments and digitisation will reshape our societies, economies and change relationships – both between states, and between the citizen, the private sector and the state.\n\nWhile the proliferation of cyber capability to countries and organised crime groups, and the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, will increase our security risks. In parallel states will seek to shape the global digital environment between ‘digital freedom’ and ‘digital authoritarianism’ that will strengthen or undermine our real world democratic values. Our challenge will be that uphold these values.\n\nInvesting heavily to strengthen our leadership position as a science and technology power to maintain our lead at the cutting edge of emerging technologies; putting science and technology at the heart of our international partnerships and then working together to build transparent norms and standards that ensure their responsible use are vital to secure our future prosperity.\n\nThe Integrated Review highlights Brazil as one such country we have prioritised to deepen our science and innovation partnership.\n\nThis partnership is already strong.\n\nScience and innovation are at the centre of the UK’s partnership with Brazil to promote mutual prosperity and economic growth and to work together to find solutions to global challenges.\n\nThis growing partnership on tech and transformative digital access is highlighted through a number of joint initiatives including:\n\nthe Newton Fund, which has played a fundamental roles in increasing scientific collaboration and innovation between our two countries in climate, agritech, health and biodiversity.\n\nthe Digital Access Programme will pilot new technologies, develop digital skills and promote cybersecurity awareness to provide equitable, safe, meaningful and inclusive digital access to underserved Brazilian communities. The UK-Brazil Tech Hub is creating connections between our start-up ecosystems, supporting tech for good ventures and female entrepreneurs to promote positive impacts responding innovatively to the most urgent local and global development challenges.\n\nthe Better Health Programme which has strengthened links between our national health systems, sharing expertise and learning as we face todays urgent global health challenges.\n\nthe programme has supported initiatives to identify digital health solutions that improve primary care delivery and expanding primary care services to remote Brazilian populations by testing a pioneering digital primary care model; and grew our partnership in genomics and precision medicine supporting the launch of the Brazil Genomas Project and the Brazil partnership with the UK Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult.\n\nThe strength of the UK Brazil innovation partnership in healthcare is ably highlighted by the partnership between Oxford University, Fiocruz and AstroZeneca that enabled the Covid19 vaccine to be produced within Brazil.\n\nBut a growing digital landscape brings with it new challenges, one where we must work together to face them. As such we are seeking a closer relationship with Brazil to tackle cybercrime and identify opportunities to work together on cybersecurity issues, supported by our Digital Access Programme.\n\nMoving towards a world where our economic and security success depends on embracing the adoption of new emerging technologies and supporting the drive for innovation across all our priorities. But we need to ensure this drive is done so in an equitable and inclusive way and that we leave no part of society behind. To do so we both have a challenge in ensuring the next generation are supported and equipped to take advantage that this new world will bring.\n\nThe UK is a champion for education in Brazil, and through our work with the British Council we are supporting the increase in access to English language teaching and learning across Brazil reaching millions of teachers and learners.\n\nThe Skills for Prosperity programme is also working to equip youth with language skills where poor English is a barrier to access further education and employment. It also creates a model for ELT that elevates language standards in Brazil, supporting social mobility and business opportunities. This programme has already reached more than 2 million students and more than 14 thousand teachers all around Brazil, and it is part of a global UK programme developed in other eight emergent countries.\n\nWe are aiming to increase our Higher Education partnerships to further research and innovation, this year alone, through partners such as the British Council we connected over 100 Higher Education institutions in Brazil and the UK for research collaboration.\n\nAnd this partnership is strengthened through our cultural ties of almost 200 years of history. These are bonds we continue to strengthen. This year alone over 200,000 Brazilians, have had the opportunity to engage face to face in a range of creative and artistic collaborations between the UK and Brazil\n\nChampioning the free flow of trade\n\nIt is clear that there is an opportunity to develop a partnership of tomorrow that focusses our cooperation through a lens of digital, tech and cyber, science and green growth that is underpinned by a deeper relationship on security to achieve our longer term mutual prosperity. But with the departure from the EU, the UK and Brazil have an opportunity to develop a tailored trading relationship that will deliver economic benefit to both sides.\n\nThe UK is competitive, connected, innovative and sustainable. The most attractive investment destination in Europe, the most globally connected economy in the G20, a global centre for innovation and venture capital investment, and committed to the greening of our economy through a green industrial revolution that will build green jobs and industries of the future.\n\nThere is much that we both can gain from a renewed focus that harnesses the potential of our connected economies to increase productivity and push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nBut we are not building from scratch. The UK and Brazil already have a strong economic relationship, with over 800 British companies currently operating in Brazil. Total trade between the UK and Brazil, including imports and exports as well as goods and services, was £6 billion in 2021.\n\nAnd the UK has supported Brazil’s aspirations to become a major actor in the globalised economy, increase trade and attract international investment. We have been a vocal supporter of Brazil’s aspirations to join the OECD, providing support to Brazil’s alignment with OECD standards and best practices, and providing support to BNDES in efforts to foster private sector participation in sustainable infrastructure projects and to consolidate the green finance market in Brazil.\n\nIn the last Economic and Financial Dialogue, our finance ministers agreed to efforts to boost our trading relationship further, making new agreements on financial services, double taxation, sustainable growth and Green Finance, helping to boost jobs and investments for both our countries.\n\nFree trade and free markets are powerful engines of progress and we will always champion economic freedom and uphold the free flow of trade, capital and knowledge. The UK is building new trade links and working on free trade agreements. We are deepening our trade relationship with our strategic partners, and hope to do so with Brazil.\n\nBut as the Integrated Review highlights, the economy has a growing role to play in security. Access to the global economy is not a given. It must be earned and countries must play by the rules of the international system. Those that break those rules should held to account, and the UK will seek to use the economic levers at our disposal to ensure adherence.\n\nBy working together, expanding trade, and diversifying where we source our strategic goods we can reduce dependence and deprive any aggressors of their leverage and strengthen our own economic security.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe UK recognises that the world has changed. We are ready to work differently with our allies and partners to forge a better, more secure world and a stronger global economy.\n\nIn Brazil, we have the opportunity to translate this new approach to one that delivers in practice. Here, our ultimate goal is to become the country’s partner of choice in Europe, bring our cultures closer, close the trade gap and move forward with key partnerships in the areas of common interest.\n\nBrazil is a key strategic partner in trade, science and security and we recognise its leading role not just in the region but on the global stage where Brazil is a natural ally to the UK in many ways. Be it in efforts to uphold a rules based international system; promoting our shared democratic values of open societies and open trade; or developing new international economic and security structures fit for today’s global challenges.\n\nWorking together we can secure our mutual prosperity and security.\n\n[1] WRI report supported by Lord Stern",
    "Brazil’s Global Ambitions": "Introduction\n\nAs Latin America’s largest and most influential country, Brazil has long played a leadership role in the region, throwing its economic and diplomatic might behind hemispheric integration efforts. It has also increasingly sought a bigger voice for developing countries on the world stage. In addition to its active membership in the United Nations and other major multilateral institutions, Brazil has worked closely with countries such as China, India, and Russia to develop alternative forums.\n\nHowever, a decade marked by economic upheaval and corruption scandals that implicated much of the political establishment has hindered its goals. President Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a “Brazil above everything” slogan that he argued would help reclaim the country’s sovereignty, but critics say his approach has exacerbated domestic inequalities and led to growing international isolation.\n\nWhy does Brazil matter in world affairs?\n\nBrazil is the largest and most influential country in South America, accounting for about half of the continent’s population, landmass, and gross domestic product (GDP). It is the fifth-largest country in the world and the sixth most populous, with an estimated 214 million people. Brazil plays a major role in world trade: it is a leading producer of soybeans, beef, and iron ore. Moreover, the two-thirds of the Amazon Rainforest that fall within its borders make it central to the global fight against climate change. After the United States, Brazil has the largest military force in the Western Hemisphere, though it has historically relied on soft-power strategies, including foreign aid, to exert its influence.\n\nBrazil wields considerable political and economic clout beyond Latin America. China and the United States are its top two trading partners, and the country has forged closer political and military ties with Russia. It has also asserted itself in nuclear talks with Iran despite objections from the United States. Brazilian forces have at times led peacekeeping missions in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the country has hosted international sporting events, including the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nHow have Brazil’s foreign policy ambitions evolved?\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It maintained its monarchy until 1889. The foreign relations of its early years were largely preoccupied with regional upheaval, including war with neighbors Argentina and Paraguay. World War I marked the beginnings of Brazil’s role on the world stage, as it was the only Latin American country to participate and the largest South American delegation involved in the negotiations that created the League of Nations in 1920. Brazil’s military contributions to the Allied powers during World War II and its cooperation with the United States during the Cold War drew it closer to the West, even as it advocated for noninterventionism and neutral international institutions.\n\nThis tension grew after Brazil’s republic gave way in 1964 to a repressive military dictatorship, which shared Washington’s fears about communist influence in the region. By 1979, an ailing economy drove the regime to begin a slow process of political liberalization that culminated in the transition to a civilian-led democracy in 1989. This political reform was accompanied by an opening of the heavily state-led economy. Between 1995 and 2010 under Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (commonly known as Lula), Brazil solidified its reputation as an emerging power with one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. It was under Lula that Brazil “had this really ambitious idea that almost through sheer force of will, it would become a major power,” says Dartmouth College’s Andre Pagliarini.\n\nBrazilian foreign policy emphasizes diplomacy and multilateral institutions. To date, Brazil has participated in fifty UN peacekeeping operations, and it has offered expertise, equipment, and scholarship opportunities to postconflict countries [PDF] including Angola, Mozambique, and Timor-Leste. It has pushed to increase the role of lower income countries, often referred to as the Global South, in global governance in other ways, too: it is in the Group of Twenty (G20), a grouping of the world’s largest economies, and it helped found the alternative economic bloc BRICS alongside Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Brazil is also regularly elected as a non-permanent member to the UN Security Council, and it has joined calls to expand permanent council membership to better represent today’s global distribution of power.\n\nWhat role does Brazil play in regional affairs?\n\nBrazil has long pursued a leadership role, at times butting heads with the United States and navigating tensions with other regional powers. It has largely focused on furthering development and regional stability through economic integration and involvement in multilateral institutions.\n\nIt is a founding member of and among the largest donors to the Organization of American States (OAS), the Western Hemisphere’s premier diplomatic forum. It is also the driving force behind the Mercosur trade bloc, in which it seeks to unite its economy with those of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. With a combined GDP of roughly $2.2 trillion in 2021, the bloc is one of the world’s largest. Yet, Brasília previously led the opposition [PDF] to a failed U.S. proposal for a hemisphere-wide trade bloc, arguing that the United States’ heavily subsidized agriculture would give its exports an unfair advantage.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil’s stance toward the region’s authoritarian governments has tested its commitment to diplomacy. Under Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff, Brazil sought closer trade and energy ties with the socialist government of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. But Bolsonaro has joined most of the region in refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, and tensions have escalated as the Brazil-Venezuela border has become a hotspot for crime and violence.\n\nRelations with Cuba have likewise worsened despite years of Brazilian efforts to expand oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and increase aid to the island. In 2019, Bolsonaro became the first Latin American leader in nearly three decades to vote against an annual UN resolution condemning the U.S.-led embargo on Cuba. The following year, Brazil withdrew from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), citing the growing authoritarian influence of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\n\nHow has Bolsonaro governed Brazil?\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain who spent twenty-seven years in Brazil’s Congress, won the 2018 presidential election riding a wave of antiestablishment fervor. Campaigning as a right-wing, socially conservative nationalist, he promised to tackle crime and corruption and right the economy in the face of a series of crises, including a presidential impeachment, a deep recession, a historic corruption scandal, and a sharp rise in violent crime. His controversial moves have included abolishing dozens of civil society groups, cutting funding for federal education, relaxing gun ownership laws, and attacking LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessors, Bolsonaro has embraced anti-globalist rhetoric and has said that international norms and institutions threaten Brazil’s sovereignty. This has led him to distance Brazil from the United Nations; encourage development in the Amazon Rainforest; downplay the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; and threaten to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris Agreement on climate, though he hasn’t followed through. Furthermore, his administration’s moves to isolate former partners, such as Venezuela, have been paired with efforts to form closer ties with like-minded right-wing leaders such as former U.S. President Donald Trump, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhat are relations like with the United States?\n\nThe relationship dates to 1824, when the United States became the first country to recognize Brazil’s independence. In the twentieth century, Washington wielded a strong influence over Brazil’s development, including by backing the 1964 military coup and later supporting the country’s democratic transition and economic liberalization. Still, Brazil has at times acted as a countervailing force against U.S. interests. In addition to rejecting the U.S. hemispheric trade proposal, Brasília opposed the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and condemned the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the left-wing Lula and Rousseff administrations, Brazil’s pursuit of closer relationships with U.S. adversaries such as China, Cuba, and Iran also became a source of tension.\n\nBolsonaro’s 2018 election marked a sharp turn toward the right and the beginning of efforts to grow closer with Washington. Bilateral relations were particularly amicable under the Trump administration. In recognition of their partnership, Trump designated Brazil a major non–North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, granting it access to certain U.S. economic and security programs. In 2020, the two leaders signed a limited trade deal.\n\nHowever, under President Joe Biden, Washington and Brasília have increasingly diverged on major issues, including climate action and Biden’s global effort to combat authoritarianism. Bolsonaro has even made unsubstantiated allegations that Biden committed fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Still, there is potential to deepen the partnership on several fronts, says Brazil-based journalist Catherine Osborn, including the leaders’ pledge to prevent further deforestation of the Amazon.\n\nWhat are Brazil’s other major bilateral ties?\n\nChina. Beijing elevated its relations with Brasília to a comprehensive strategic partnership—the highest classification that China awards its diplomatic partners—in 2012. China has since become Brazil’s top trading partner, primarily due to exports of soybeans and iron ore; in 2021, bilateral trade reached a record $135 billion. Though not a participant in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Brazil is one of the largest recipients of Chinese infrastructure funding in South America. Between 2007 and 2020, Brazil received more than $66 billion in Chinese investment. Brazil is also one of a dozen countries in Latin America that have granted Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications giant, access to its 5G network. Bolsonaro campaigned on ending Brazil’s dependence on China, but the COVID-19 pandemic underscored its continued reliance, as Brazil almost exclusively used Chinese-made vaccines in the early months of global vaccination efforts.\n\nEuropean Union. The European Union (EU) is a major destination for Brazilian agricultural goods, especially soybeans, fruit, and coffee; Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain are the largest European importers. Since 1999, Mercosur has been negotiating a free trade agreement with the bloc, which, if accomplished, would be the EU’s largest trade deal. However, ratification efforts have stalled amid opposition from several EU members. They object to illegal logging in the Amazon, though Brazilian officials assert that these environmental concerns mask EU member states’ desires to protect their agricultural sectors from competition.\n\nRussia. Brazil is Russia’s primary trade partner in Latin America. Over the past twenty-five years, Russian exports to Brazil have grown at an annual rate of 11 percent, reaching $2.2 billion in 2020. Russia has invested billions of dollars in Brazil’s oil and gas sector, infrastructure, and electronics industry, and the two countries collaborate in several multilateral forums, such as BRICS and the G20. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated relations. Brazil has twice voted in support of UN resolutions condemning Russia’s violation of international law, though Bolsonaro has said Brazil will remain neutral in the conflict. At the same time, leading Brazilian lawmakers have criticized Western sanctions against Russia, which they say are contributing to global shortages.\n\nWhat is the state of Brazil’s economy?\n\nWith a GDP of $1.6 trillion in 2021, Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and accounts for almost 30 percent of the region’s economic output. In 2016, it overtook Venezuela as the leading producer of crude oil in South America, and it is the world’s top exporter of beef and soybeans; other major exports include iron ore, sugar, and coffee. It is also a major manufacturer, though in recent decades its economy has shifted toward services.\n\nBrazil is considered a mixed economy that has relatively high tariffs and several state-owned enterprises, most notably the oil and gas giant Petrobras. This is the legacy of import substitution industrialization, or ISI, an economic strategy adopted in the 1930s that used protectionist policies to increase domestic manufacturing. But in the wake of economic crises in the 1970s, policymakers introduced reforms to address growing debt and soaring inflation. These included the 1993 Real Plan [PDF], which established a new currency initially pegged to the U.S. dollar to tame inflation, as well as measures to open the economy to trade. Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 further accelerated Brazil’s integration into the global trading system, though the country retains some aspects of trade protectionism through Mercosur’s common external tariff.\n\nBy the 2000s, Brazil had become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. However, falling commodity prices and the series of high-profile corruption scandals helped bring about Brazil’s worst-ever recession starting in 2014. And more recently with the economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the country continues to struggle with limited growth and double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil remains one of the world’s most unequal countries.\n\nWhat other challenges does Brazil face?\n\nWith general elections set for October 2022, the next administration will be constrained by worsening domestic troubles. Bolsonaro’s primary opponent in the elections is former President Lula, who has promised new approaches to the country’s challenges. These include:\n\nCorruption and political polarization. Brazil ranked 96 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2021. Bolsonaro campaigned on rooting out corruption in the wake of the scandals that led to the impeachment of Rousseff and imprisonment of Lula. In 2019, Bolsonaro signed an anti-crime bill that introduced harsher punishments for corruption, but critics say little progress has been made, and his own administration has been beset by corruption allegations. Election watchdogs worry that Bolsonaro, who has often alleged electoral fraud, will dispute the election results in October should he lose.\n\nClimate and the environment. Deforestation of the Amazon, which hit a fifteen-year high in 2021, has sparked international concern. Many scientists criticize Bolsonaro’s environmental policies, which include opening up the rain forest to more commercial development. By contrast, Lula has proposed creating “green jobs” in the Amazon to replant trees, as well as reopening the Amazon Fund, through which countries previously paid Brazil to monitor and combat deforestation. Still, about 35 percent of energy consumed in Brazil comes from low-carbon sources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind.\n\nCrime and violence. At 22 murders per 100,000 people, Brazil has one of the highest homicide rates in South America; the country also suffers from high rates of robbery, kidnapping, and gender-based violence. Many experts attribute Brazil’s crime rate to wealth inequality, a lack of economic opportunity, and arms and drug trafficking. Bolsonaro has kept up the government’s long-standing “tough on crime” approach, which includes harsh drug laws and strict sentencing.\n\nCOVID-19 policy. Brazil is still grappling with the effects of the pandemic, including economic contraction, increased poverty, and an education crisis that has primarily affected Black and Indigenous communities. More than 680,000 people in Brazil have died, one of the world’s highest per capita death tolls. Global health authorities have criticized the Bolsonaro administration, which downplayed the severity of the virus and opposed lockdown measures. Also, the government’s immunization campaign stumbled over concerns about the efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine. More recently, the government has prioritized U.S.-made vaccines. By late 2022, more than 80 percent of the population was fully vaccinated.",
    "Will Brazil’s COVID disaster sway its presidential election?": "Brazilians have recognized the more than 600,000 people in their country who have died of COVID-19 with a display of white handkerchiefs.Credit: Buda Mendes/Getty\n\nAccording to official government statistics, more than 685,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, placing it among the nations with the most fatalities. As infections skyrocketed in Brazil between 2020 and 2021, the country spread the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus beyond its borders, exporting the virus ten times more often than it imported it, according to a study published in Nature Microbiology last month1. The results suggest that the nation — Latin America’s largest — was a COVID-19 epicentre, and that policies implemented by its government, and its leader Jair Bolsonaro, failed to curb the virus.\n\nThe report comes as Brazil gears up to elect its next president in October. Bolsonaro is up for re-election and faces 11 challengers, including former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who led the nation from 2003 to 2010. It remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro’s questionable pandemic response will work against him during the election. Public-health researchers have decried his refusal to implement lockdown measures, his spreading of misinformation about vaccines and his backing of ineffective drugs such as hydroxychloroquine to combat COVID-19.\n\n‘We are being ignored’: Brazil’s researchers blame anti-science government for devastating COVID surge\n\n“For most of the pandemic, the government did not offer a coordinated response, giving room to a wave of disinformation — at times spurred by leaders in the federal government,” says Otávio Ranzani, an epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo and at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.\n\nMany of the presidential candidates, including Bolsonaro, are promising to bolster Brazil’s health system, known as SUS. But the country is also now grappling with other issues, including food security and economic inflation, which could trump pandemic concerns when Brazilians head to the voting booth. According to a recent study from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a higher-education think tank based in Rio de Janeiro, one in three Brazilians could not afford to eat properly in 2021 — the highest proportion in more than a decade.\n\nStill, it’s exciting that health care is being discussed in this presidential election, says Rosana Onocko Campos, president of the Brazilian Association of Collective Health in Campinas, São Paulo. “It is the first time I’ve seen the great majority of candidates say they agree that an increase in federal funding for SUS is needed,” she says.\n\nVirus exporter\n\nAccording to the Nature Microbiology study, SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Brazil mainly from Europe in early 2020, before the country had implemented any response measures. But between then and September 2021, the nation spread the virus to many countries; the highest number of virus exports went to other South American nations, ten of which border Brazil (see ‘Super spreader’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo draw these conclusions, the team sequenced 3,800 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from infected people in 8 Brazilian states and one neighbouring country, Paraguay. The researchers also analysed genome sequences in the popular data repository GISAID — more than 13,000 from Brazil and about 100 from Paraguay — to understand which coronavirus variants were prevalent, and at what times, between 2020 and 2021. And they compared their sequences with more than 25,000 global sequences to draw conclusions about viral spread. They found that Brazil had most often exported the Gamma variant, which first emerged within its borders.\n\nThe main point of the study, says lead author Marta Giovanetti, a visiting virologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, “is to discuss the role of populational mobility and the emergence of the first variants of concern” in Brazil.\n\n‘The perfect storm’: lax social distancing fuelled a coronavirus variant’s Brazilian surge\n\nTo Marcelo Gomes, a public-health specialist and computational scientist, the findings make sense, because COVID-19 infections in Brazil remained at a consistently high level from 2020 through September 2021, making transmission to other countries possible. Gomes is based at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, of which the institute is a part.\n\nThe SUS was overwhelmed by COVID-19, revealing a resource deficit, Onocko says. “We need to requalify services and personnel to increase technical capacity for faster service [and have] better coordination among the federal, state and local governments. It will take an extraordinary effort,” she says.\n\nPromises, promises\n\nAcknowledging that the SUS was overworked during the pandemic, Bolsonaro has promised a 250% increase in funding for health-care workers if he is re-elected. He and Lula — who are leading the polls — have pledged to bolster Brazil’s post-pandemic response, and Lula wants to improve women’s access to public services for the prevention and treatment of disease.\n\nHow these promises would be implemented and paid for isn’t clear to many researchers, however. “The proposals are superficial and don’t go into concrete steps on how they will face the challenges we have,” says physician Gonzalo Vecina Neto, who directed Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLatin America’s embrace of an unproven COVID treatment is hindering drug trials\n\nVecina worries that even though the candidates have acknowledged the impact of the pandemic, and made various pledges in response, public-health concerns are being overshadowed by the economy and other issues during the run-up to the election. “The sensation I have is we are forgetting what happened”, he says, “and we are now facing new outbreaks such as monkeypox without having learned enough from the pandemic.”\n\nOthers agree. Ranzani says he wants to see more emphasis on strengthening the SUS and Brazilian research in election discussions. “It is fundamental for us to face what the pandemic has caused and still causes.”\n\nThe Brazilian presidential election takes place on 2 October.

    "'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Discusses Brazil's Fragile Democracy & Puerto Rico's Power Crisis": "The latest episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver dedicated most of its runtime to showcasing how Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently up for Presidential re-election, is trying to undermine the country’s voting system by suggesting that if he loses next Sunday, it will be because there’s something wrong with the vote counting.\n\nBefore the main story, though, Oliver drew some attention to the fact that Ron DeSantis flew a slate of illegal immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard, in a stunt that put the Florida Governor under heavy fire. To add insult to injury, the show highlights the fact that the political move might have been pitched by Fox News – and sloppily executed. We also learned you can always count on Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny to protest effectively about the country’s constant power outages. In addition, we were reminded that singer and songwriter, Adam Levine, is really bad at sexting, and that, in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, the British people managed to out-queue every queue that the world has ever seen.\n\nBack to one of the world’s biggest countries, John Oliver kicked the segment off by showing that in Brazil, everything goes when you’re vying for a public office – even nunchucks. And it’s all downhill from there: the show exhibited clips that illustrate how Bolsonaro is pretty much inciting a response akin to Donald Trump's supporters attempting to take over the Capitol on January 6, 2021, should he lose the election.\n\nRELATED: 'SNL' Sets 'Top Gun: Maverick's Miles Teller as Season 48 Premiere Host\n\nLast Week Tonight did not shy away from the shortcomings of Bolsonaro’s presidency. On his watch, Brazil handled the pandemic in disastrous ways, which led to the death of almost 700,000 people. When questioned about it, Bolsonaro stated that “we’re all going to die anyway”, all the while refusing to admit that COVID-19 was a real and serious problem. The Amazon rainforest also took a huge hit during his government, with deforestation reaching an all-time high with 1,000 fires being reported daily.\n\nThe “Brazilian Trump” saw the result of his terrible management in polls: former president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva has been leading by a 10% margin, and has a real shot at winning next Sunday if the polls are correct. The problem is, if Bolsonaro indeed loses, he has a whole army – literally the Army – standing behind him, in what could potentially result in a devastating military coup for a country that rid itself of dictatorship not that many years ago. No amount of nunchucks will be able to save the Brazilian population if this comes to pass.\n\nYou can watch the full episode below:",

    "Five Brazilian beach and wilderness hotels": "A Paraty pousada for the literati\n\nThe pool at Pousada Literária\n\nIn my experience, most countries have a payoff place; the one that, for you the traveller, encapsulates everything about its appeal – landscape, built environment, cuisine, people, culture – and to which you know you can return for a 360-degree fix. For me, in Brazil, that place is Paraty. Its dense cobbled streets harbour not just the country’s most alluring aesthetic attributes but also one of its nicest vibes. I’ve walked alone here at night for hours, stopping for a drink at this café or admiring microscopic bikinis in the window of that boutique, and never once felt anything but enveloped in its welcome. The town isn’t short on boutique accommodations, but I fell for Pousada Literária the day I visited.\n\nThe dining room at one of Pousada Literária’s suites\n\nIt’s a more or less perfect Paraty house, part-colonial, part new-build, made into a clever, slightly quirky (but never not totally stylish), more or less perfect maison d’hôtes. Some rooms are tucked under 17th-century beamed ceilings with tile floors and pretty paned sash windows; others spread out in a more hacienda-style fashion around a wide pool. Common chilling and dining areas abound. Some of the furniture, whether mid 20th-century or antique, is so gorgeous I wanted to stow it away home. The location is dead central, and the town’s best bookstore is adjacent (the Pousada has been the official hotel of Paraty’s annual literary festival for a decade). From BRL1,416 (about £260)\n\nFrom sea to savannah in style\n\nBeach views from Pousada Tutabel\n\nPousada Literária’s owners have two other properties: one north in Trancoso, and the other deep inland, in Brazil’s vast Cerrado region. Tutabel’s 18 suites and clutch of small villas all face a particularly calm stretch of Trancoso’s famous sand beach (but it’s also a short walk to the town’s rainbow-hued Quadrado). Sisal and rattan, wood and lots of white cotton set the design tone. At Pousada Trijunção, the mission is creating awareness of Brazil’s wildlife-rich savannah. Night safaris and daytime tracking – of birds, ocelot, anteaters, the famous maned wolf, possibly even jaguar – are on the activity agenda, and as at Tutabel, part of the proceeds of your stay goes to local conservation organisations.\n\nInterior styling at Pousada Trijunção\n\nThe gorgeous lodge itself (consider splurging on the master suite, with its private sitting room and two balconies) is constructed partially of reclaimed demolition wood, and naturally cooling ‘water mirrors’ occasionally stand in for air con temperature permitting. Tutabel, from about £305; Pousada Trijunção, from about £430\n\nUnder-the-radar beachside bliss in Itacaré\n\nThe hotel’s pool\n\nI recently met the owners of The Barracuda, a rather magical-looking destination in Itacaré which now sits close to the top my 2023 list – and of which, I’ll admit, I was surprised I’d never heard. About halfway between Trancoso and Salvador, in the south of groovy Bahía state, The Barracuda consists of two small hotels, Barracuda Boutique and The Barracuda Hotel & Villas (the latter of which is the more elegant and exclusive, and soft-opened in 2020) as well as a handful of private villas ranging from four to eight bedrooms. All is warm, natural surfaces and open-plan common spaces, everywhere a low divan or sofa or ipe wood chair asking to be reclined on.\n\nBeach views from a villa at The Barracuda Cocktails at one of the hotel bars\n\nThe Corner Suite at The Barracuda Hotel & Villas\n\nThe villas, surrounded by lush rainforest, are all privately owned (one or two of them by Swedes hailing from a very famous band, is the whisper on the Itacaré street), but most are available for private rental throughout the year. They come with pre-provisioned kitchens, a cook and housekeeper, and the option for some local tailor-made experiences. The whole enjoys a prime situation on a little peninsula between warm, swimmable sea and the village itself. Boutique suites from about £90, Barracuda suites from about €430\n\nThe Fasano touch comes to Angra dos Reis\n\nThe Marea club at Hotel Fasano Angra dos Reis\n\nIf there’s one Brazilian who can be relied on to set a bar for coolness (and really good Italian food) it’s Rogério Fasano. While his empire of hotels and gastronomia now extends from Punta del Este to Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, Brazil still feels like where Fasano does Fasano best. Take Angra dos Reis: close to Paraty, it’s a beach community and island archipelago between São Paulo and Rio that’s a popular second-home destination with the beau monde of both cities.\n\nA bedroom at Fasano Angra dos Reis\n\nFasano Angra dos Reis, which opened in 2017, is big and bold: 60 suites, apartments and residences, multiple sunning decks overlooking a huge pool, a full spa and fitness centre. Polished tropical woods, loose slipcovers, spinning fans and windows prevail here, with lots of aqua and turquoise thrown in to reflect the marina and sea beyond. From about £380",
    "Met handcuff peaceful anti-Bolsonaro protester to delight of Brazil’s far right": "The Metropolitan police have been accused of using unnecessary force and handing a propaganda coup to Brazil’s far right after a peaceful demonstrator was detained and handcuffed during a protest outside the Brazilian ambassador’s London residence.\n\nAli Rocha, a 50-year-old Brazilian and British citizen, and her flatmate were intercepted by officers on Sunday lunchtime as they joined a protest against Brazil’s radical rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was in the UK for the Queen’s funeral.\n\nRocha, who was carrying three placards denouncing Bolsonaro’s assault on the Amazon and a backpack containing a loudhailer, was not arrested or charged with any offence.\n\nBut she said she was handcuffed for about 20 minutes before being released and escorted past a group of Bolsonaro supporters who had also gathered outside the ambassador’s Mayfair home.\n\n“I was very shocked and shaken and now I’m just angry and disgusted,” said Rocha, a Brazil-born producer and journalist who is a British citizen.\n\nFootage of the incident has been distorted and used to smear the left on social media by members of Brazil’s far right.\n\nBolsonaro’s politician son Eduardo Bolsonaro shared images of Rocha’s detention with his more than 6.5m followers on Twitter and Instagram, falsely claiming she had been arrested by police. “Woman in [leftwing] T-shirt was arrested while trying to disrupt pro-Bolsonaro protest,” he wrote beneath the minute-long clip.\n\nAs Rocha is handcuffed, a narrator in the footage celebrates the police action, saying: “They don’t like communists here [in the UK] either. Look, they’re handcuffing her. She’s been handcuffed and she’s going to jail.”\n\nA Metropolitan police spokesperson confirmed that shortly after 1.10pm on Sunday police stopped two women “who they had reason to suspect may have been in possession of items to commit criminal damage”.\n\n“Both women were searched. One of the women was initially placed in handcuffs to safely facilitate the search after she repeatedly ignored instructions not to place her hands in her pockets. The handcuffs were subsequently removed,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“No items of concern were found on the two women who were stopped and they were allowed to continue on their way without any further action.”\n\nThe spokesperson declined to comment on how footage of the incident was being used as far-right propaganda, because of the political nature of the issue.\n\nThe incident comes after civil liberties campaigners voiced alarm over the police response to anti-monarchy protesters in the lead-up to the Queen’s funeral.\n\nRocha, the co-founder of a campaign group called Brazil Matters, said she had wanted to protest Bolsonaro’s “absurd and disrespectful” attempt to exploit the Queen’s funeral for political purposes.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reports in the Brazilian media suggested he thought rubbing shoulders with world leaders in London might boost his flagging campaign.\n\n“We didn’t want him to come to London unchallenged,” Rocha said.\n\n“We wanted to protest about his policies of death, his destruction of the Amazon, the genocide of black and Indigenous peoples and the general disrespect to human rights.”\n\nRocha, who was a friend of Dom Phillips, the British journalist murdered in the Amazon in June with Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, said she was approached by police shortly after reaching the street on which Bolsonaro was staying.\n\n“They came straight at me … [One male officer] grabbed me by the arm and just started taking me to this corner and while he was talking to me he was holding both my wrists really strong. He was hurting my wrists. I was asking him: ‘Why are you holding me? Let me go.’”\n\n“He kept saying: ‘We’ve received some intel that someone in a red T-shirt was going to commit criminal damage … so I’m going to search you and you are detained,” added Rocha, who was wearing a red T-shirt at the time.\n\nSoon after the officer “got the handcuffs out and turned me around and handcuffed me with my hands behind my back”.\n\n“I was in a state of shock … we knew the police were on high alert because of the funeral and all the state leaders that were here but we never expected anything like that.”\n\nFootage of the incident seen by the Guardian shows a male officer searching Rocha’s pockets before handcuffing her and saying: “I told you, ‘Don’t go reaching towards your pockets again – and you reached’ … It’s not my fault you chose not to listen.”\n\n“I felt very disrespected. I’ve never been handcuffed before. I’ve never been detained before,” said Rocha. “Why was I treated this way? So violently, so aggressively.”",

    "Brazil votes: Indigenous candidates target Bolsonaro stronghold": "This is the first in a three-part series on Roraima in the context of Brazil’s general elections. The project was supported by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Journalism Fund.\n\nNormandia, Brazil – Cheers and applause greet Joenia Wapichana as she arrives at a political campaign event in the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous territory in northern Brazil.\n\nIn 2018, Wapichana became the country’s first Indigenous woman elected to Congress; today, she seeks a second term for the Amazonian state of Roraima, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has more support than in any other state, according to recent polls.\n\nBut Wapichana says Bolsonaro has been a disaster for Indigenous communities across Brazil, as his pro-mining rhetoric fuels the growth of illegal gold mining operations on Indigenous lands.\n\n“From the moment he opens his mouth to talk about the absurd, illegal, illicit issues that he supports, he puts the lives of the Indigenous people at risk,” she told Al Jazeera in a rare interview with foreign media.\n\nHighlighting the importance of Indigenous political representation, she added: “Thirteen percent of Brazil is Indigenous territories, yet in Congress, they make decisions without our participation.”\n\nIndigenous advocacy groups hail Wapichana as a trailblazer, and this year, a record number of Indigenous candidates — more than 180 — have registered to run in Brazil’s October 2 elections. Yet, with campaigns on shoestring budgets, lacking traditional political party structure and wealthy donors, many face an uphill battle.\n\nIn Roraima, nearly two-thirds of people support Bolsonaro’s re-election, while just 18 percent back national frontrunner and left-wing former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, according to the latest opinion polls by Ipec.\n\n“It’s a frontier state with a mainly conservative population that mostly shares the president’s views on family, land use and Indigenous rights,” political scientist Paulo Racoski, who teaches at the Federal Institute of Roraima, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe highlighted several of Bolsonaro’s past claims, including that Indigenous people have too much land for their population numbers and that if he were “king” of Roraima, its economy would rival that of Japan or China on account of the state’s mineral wealth.\n\n“Despite being mostly untrue, these are messages that resonate,” Racoski said.\n\nSearching for El Dorado\n\nIn the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors scoured Roraima for the mythical, gold-rich kingdom of El Dorado. In the late 20th century, thousands of migrants from across Brazil, and especially the poorer northeastern region, flocked here in search of opportunities. Many ended up working as gold miners on the Yanomami Indigenous territory, which, since Bolsonaro’s election, has seen a new uptick in illegal mining and related violence.\n\nToday, while there are no legal gold mines operating in Roraima, a seven-metre-high monument to miners outside the legislative assembly in the capital Boa Vista is emblematic of the state’s relationship with mining.\n\n“Politically, it’s tough for a candidate to confront the interests of wildcat mining in the state,” Alisson Marugal, a federal prosecutor based in Roraima, told Al Jazeera. “It plays a large part in the economy.”\n\nLast October, Bolsonaro visited an illegal mining site in Raposa Serra do Sol and touted a proposed bill to legalise mining and other industrial-scale activities on Indigenous lands.\n\n“If you want to plant, you will plant,” the president, wearing an Indigenous headdress, told an assembled crowd. “If you are going to mine, you are going to mine.”\n\nAccording to Roraima’s Indigenous Council, the state’s largest Indigenous rights group, more than 4,000 illegal miners have operated on the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. The council has presented federal prosecutors with a report listing alleged human rights violations linked to these operations.\n\n“The invasion of illegal miners causes environmental degradation, deforestation, pollution of rivers, streams and lakes, an increase in cattle and vehicle thefts, high rates of malaria, STDs and COVID-19 in communities,” notes the report, a copy of which was seen by Al Jazeera.\n\nIt further highlights “drug trafficking, presence of criminal gangs and firearms … increased violence in communities, death threats and persecution of leaders”.\n\nIn April, three people were shot to death in the territory, in a killing authorities alleged might have been tied to illegal mining debts.\n\nWhile federal agencies run frequent enforcement operations to combat illegal mining, there has not been one in Raposa Serra do Sol for more than a year, authorities confirmed. Federal police told Al Jazeera that the last operation to combat illegal mining on the reserve took place last year, but offered no further comment.\n\nThis has led some locals to take matters into their own hands. In one recent example, a surveillance group organised by Indigenous guardians in Raposa Serra do Sol in June burned a raft used by illegal miners to extract gold on the Ireng River, near the border with Guyana.\n\nDestroyed landscape\n\nDuring Roraima’s recent rainy season, Al Jazeera joined three Indigenous guides on an expedition through flooded plains to one of several illegal mining sites at the base of a sacred local mountain known as Serra do Atola, and surveyed the area with a drone. The destruction was striking: the mining encampment opened up like a brown scar across the otherwise green landscape, with dozens of mining pits, some covered by blue tarpaulin to protect miners from the elements.\n\n“Lots of strange people pass through here,” said one of the Indigenous guides, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. The guides said that because of the recent heavy rains, the number of miners was temporarily reduced, but they would flow back in again for the dry season.\n\nLast year, the Amazon military command, federal police and environmental agencies raided the site and found 400 people, precision scales, excavation pits, gold and toxic mercury for gold processing. Months later, an Associated Press news agency investigation found the mining camp up and running again, with workers using portable generators to power jackhammers to break the rocks.\n\nRoraima’s Indigenous Council says that businesspeople and politicians from outside the reserve have financed the mining, taking a percentage of the gold extracted, while Indigenous people have often been exploited as cheap labour.\n\n“There is no Indigenous person here that has gotten rich from illegal mining,” Bartolomeu da Silva Tomaz, running for Roraima as Brazil’s only Indigenous Senate candidate, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The people who get rich from illegal mining are the businessmen … companies that sell machines, motors and equipment, the companies that sell fuel … these guys get rich,” he said.\n\nIf elected, he says he would make the removal of illegal miners from Indigenous lands a top priority — a bold position in a state whose economy is sustained in part by illegal mining, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nLacking a voice\n\nToday, more than 26,000 Indigenous people from five ethnic groups live on the 17,470sq-km (6,745sq-mile) Raposa Serra do Sol territory, which borders Venezuela and Guyana. Unlike many Amazonian Indigenous lands covered in lush rainforest, Raposa Serra do Sol is mostly tropical savannah. Cattle ranching, often associated with deforestation, is also permitted in the area.\n\nIn all of Brazil, which is home to some 900,000 Indigenous people from more than 300 ethnic groups, Roraima has the largest Indigenous population, at more than 55,000. Nearly half of its territory comprises Indigenous lands, and yet, there is no Indigenous representative on its 24-seat state assembly.\n\n“Today we have a voice in Brasilia, which is our lawmaker Joenia Wapichana,” Aldenir Wapichana, an Indigenous leader who is running to be a state legislator, told Al Jazeera. “But on a state level, we still don’t have dignified representation … It’s important to defend our rights, in health, in education.”\n\nHe praised the work of Lula da Silva, who is running again to unseat Bolsonaro and leads polls by a double-digit margin, in ensuring that Raposa Serra do Sol gained full protected status in 2005. Bolsonaro has previously said he would “undo” this demarcation, even though he does not have the power to make that change, and arm local farmers “with rifles”.\n\nIn Brazil’s 2018 elections, Normandia, Uiramuta and Pacaraima, located within the limits of Raposa Serra do Sol, voted against Bolsonaro — the only three municipalities in Roraima to do so. A rock painted with the words “Get Out Bolsonaro” sits near an entrance to Normandia.\n\nStill, public opinion on Bolsonaro remains divided in this region.\n\nLast year, the Society for the Defence of the United Indians of Roraima, which opposes the Indigenous Council’s leadership and advocates for mining and other activities, invited Bolsonaro to an illegal mining site in the Flexal community, where he touted the bill to legalise mining. The group’s leader, Irisnaide Silva, is also running for Congress against Joenia Wapichana.\n\nIn March, the Brazilian government awarded Silva, Bolsonaro and a group of ministers “Indigenous merit” medals, drawing scorn from Indigenous advocacy groups.\n\nWhile Silva did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, she has publicly described herself as “the Indigenous woman who defends development”.\n\n‘Environmental crisis’\n\nIn Brazil, political parties are allocated public funding based on how many seats they have in Congress. Joenia Wapichana’s Sustainability Network has only two seats in the lower house, compared with 77 for Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party.\n\nCandidates may also receive private donations from individuals, a system that tends to favour those who represent mining or agricultural interests. In addition, candidates can use their own money to help fund their campaigns.\n\nJoenia Wapichana, who declared 20,000 Brazilian reals ($3,900) in assets this year, is competing against Rodrigo Cataratas, a pro-mining businessperson and Liberal Party supporter of Bolsonaro who declared 33 million Brazilian reals ($6.45m) in assets, for one of eight congressional seats for Roraima. The fight promises to be a tough one, and it will not end on election day.\n\nIf re-elected with enough support in Congress, Bolsonaro could try to push through his long-planned bill to allow mining and other industrial activities on Indigenous lands. As is the case with many Indigenous territories, official requests from companies to mine in Raposa Serra do Sol, including proposals for both gold and diamond mines, have increased since Bolsonaro took office, according to data compiled by the monitoring group Amazonia Minada and seen by Al Jazeera.\n\nSome fear that a long-planned hydroelectric dam on the Cotingo River, a project considered strategic by mining interests, could also be resurrected in the event of Bolsonaro’s victory, posing a flood risk to many communities in Raposa Serra do Sol.\n\n“If Bolsonaro is re-elected, we will see a continuation of anti-Indigenous policies,” Antenor Vaz, a former coordinator with Brazil’s Indigenous agency Funai who now works as an independent consultant, told Al Jazeera. “Raposa Serra do Sol would face even more pressure from illegal gold miners, as well as large landowners from outside the reserve.”\n\nBack at her campaign event, Joenia Wapichana maintains that Indigenous representation in Congress is vitally important, both for Brazil and for the planet as a whole.\n\n“Many non-Indigenous people have the same interests as Indigenous people, such as the preservation of the environment,” she said. “The planet is going through an environmental crisis, and we know that a lot depends on the protection of Indigenous territories.”",
    "Religion is shaping Brazil’s presidential election – but its evangelicals aren’t the same as America’s": "With one week to go before Brazil’s presidential election, the two front-runners are battling for the religious vote.\n\nLast month, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro told an evangelical church service that the presidential palace had been “consecrated to demons” under previous presidential administrations – a gibe against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, and his center-left Workers’ Party.\n\nLula is running again in this year’s election, whose first round is Oct. 2, 2022, and has joined the fray. In his official campaign kickoff in August 2022, for instance, he alleged that the right-wing current president, Jair Bolsonaro, is “possessed by the devil.”\n\nLula has been heavily favored to win the election and retake the office he held from 2003 to 2010. In polls, he currently runs about 15 percentage points ahead of Bolsonaro.\n\nReligious voters are an important part of the story. Bolsonaro – whom international media dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics” for his persona as a conservative firebrand, his anti-democratic streak, and his ability to attract a Christian base – garnered 70% of evangelical support in the 2018 election. Scholars, including me, argue that without the evangelical vote, he would have narrowly lost.\n\nHowever, as a political scientist who has written a book about religious politics in Brazil, I see these comparisons between the U.S. and Brazil as also glossing over key differences. Yes, Bolsonaro and Trump are very similar in how they use religion. Yet the ways evangelical communities work and how religion shapes politics is different in each country – and my own research suggests that conservative Christians will not be as consistent a base for Bolsonaro as they are for Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nWho’s who\n\nOne key difference is the language used: who “evangelicals” are in the first place.\n\nIn Latin America, traditionally a Catholic stronghold, the Spanish and Portuguese term “evangelico” is applied to nearly all non-Catholic Christians, including Protestant denominations that are usually classified as “mainline” or even “progressive” in the U.S. Estimates indicate that around a third of Brazilians identify as evangelical today, up from just a few percentage points in 1970. In the same period, the percentage of Catholics has fallen from over 90% to right about half.\n\nBy contrast, in the U.S. the term “evangelical” is reserved for theologically conservative Protestant groups, as well as Christians who have had a “born-again” experience of religious awakening. Americans also increasingly apply the term “evangelical” in a political sense, to refer to predominantly white political conservatives who are affiliated with Protestant churches.\n\nAs a result, the group of people termed “evangelicals” is much more diverse in Latin America than in the United States – and it’s politically quite diverse, too. All this said, many evangelicals in Brazil do have some tendency to adopt theologically conservative beliefs, such as interpreting the Bible literally.\n\nDozens of parties\n\nA second major difference is the lack of strong partisan affiliation on Brazil’s religious right. Since the 1970s, many Americans are used to associating evangelicalism with the Republican Party. The founding of groups such as Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority helped spur evangelicals to become a strong base for political conservatism.\n\nHowever, there is no political party in Brazil that can claim such a strong link to evangelicals as a whole. Brazilian politics is famously fragmented, especially on the right, and there are dozens of parties in Congress at any given time. Many parties – mostly conservative ones – court evangelicals, but none have shored up strong loyalty across the wide spectrum of evangelical denominations and churches.\n\nJair Bolsonaro personifies this weak partisanship. Bolsonaro ran for the presidency in 2018 under the Social Liberal Party, but then left the party to attempt to form his own party in 2019 after taking office. Those efforts ultimately failed, and he joined the Liberal Party in late 2021.\n\nEvangelicals may support Jair Bolsonaro, but polls have shown they have little loyalty to whatever party he is affiliated with at the moment. As a result, the president cannot count on his voters to also elect his political allies. Ultimately, this very weak partisanship in the electorate weakens presidents, since they have to negotiate with a highly fragmented Congress.\n\nKey issues\n\nA third difference between evangelicals in Brazil and the U.S. relates to their views on political issues. Like their counterparts in the U.S., religious conservatives in Brazil feel very strongly about issues related to sex and gender. In a striking parallel to recent controversies in U.S. public schools, Brazilian evangelicals mobilized politically over the past decade to oppose efforts to teach children and teenagers tolerance on LGBTQ issues.\n\nHowever, Brazilian evangelicals are much less conservative than their American counterparts on many other issues. This is particularly the case for topics on which U.S. evangelicals often follow cues from the Republican Party. For instance, my research shows that Brazilian evangelicals from a wide range of denominations are highly supportive of environmental action such as preventing deforestation.\n\nMany Brazilian evangelicals have historically tended to come from poor areas and communities of color, leading them to support issues such as welfare policy and affirmative action. About 1 in 3 Brazilian evangelicals identifies as white, versus 2 in 3 in the U.S.\n\nAs a result, they are likely to be attracted to President Bolsonaro for his conservative stances on gender and sexuality. However, they may penalize him for his very weak record of environmental protection as well as what is generally recognized as poor performance on the economy and COVID-19.\n\nTea leaves\n\nWhat does this mean for the upcoming presidential election? Bolsonaro is again attracting evangelicals, though not yet as strongly as in 2018. New evidence indicates that only about a quarter of evangelical churches are getting involved in the campaign so far this year – a substantially lower share than what my co-authors and I documented in 2018.\n\nHowever, particular churches are still taking a strong stance. Brazil’s most politically engaged Pentecostal church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, is urging its followers to begin a monthlong “fast” from secular news sources. This will presumably increase the political influence of church leaders, including the church’s head, Bishop Edir Macedo, who is an ardent Bolsonaro supporter.\n\nLike their U.S. counterparts, Brazilian evangelicals tend to be highly religious and believe that religion should influence politics.

    "Bruno Guimaraes ruled out of Brazil friendly": "NEWCASTLE UNITED’S injury problems continue to mount, with Bruno Guimaraes having been ruled out of Brazil’s friendly against Tunisia tomorrow evening.\n\nBrazil complete their World Cup preparations with a run-out at the Parc des Princes in Paris, but Guimaraes will not be involved, with South American media sources claiming the midfielder has already returned to Tyneside for a medical assessment and treatment.\n\nWhile the Magpies midfielder joined up with the Brazilian national squad last week, he was not involved in Friday’s 3-0 friendly win over Ghana, with the Brazil hierarchy confirming his absence was due to an injury issue.\n\nGuimaraes missed almost a month after suffering a hamstring injury in the 3-3 draw with Manchester City. He made a substitute appearance in the following week’s Carabao Cup win at Tranmere, but was subsequently sidelined for more than three weeks before returning in the 1-1 draw with Bournemouth that preceded the international break.\n\nAfter coming through that game seemingly unscathed, it was hoped he had completely recovered from his injury issues.\n\nHowever, his absence from Brazil’s World Cup warm-up games is an obvious concern, and he will now be reassessed ahead of Newcastle’s return to Premier League action at Fulham this weekend.\n\nThis is turning out to be a damaging international break for the Magpies, with a number of their players missing matches because of injury concerns.\n\nAlexander Isak was allowed to leave the Sweden squad without participating in any of their Nations League matches because of an unspecified injury problem, while his fellow striker, Chris Wood, was forced off in the first half of New Zealand’s 2-0 defeat to Australia at the weekend.\n\nWood appeared to suffer a rib injury as a result of a collision with an opponent, and while he was initially keen to continue after receiving treatment on the field, he was eventually forced to concede defeat and leave the pitch in obvious discomfort.\n\nElliot Anderson also withdrew from the Scotland Under-21 squad last week because of an injury problem.\n\nIt is hoped that Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin could be in contention for a place in the squad that travels to Craven Cottage at the weekend, with the former understood to be at a more advanced stage of his recovery.\n\nWilson has been training at Newcastle’s Little Benton base this week, while Saint-Maximin posted a picture on social media showing him taking part in some light running work.

    "Brazil more isolated after four years of Bolsonaro": "The video was painful to watch, but spoke volumes to Brazil’s isolation on the world stage: President Jair Bolsonaro awkwardly meandering alone around the room as other G20 leaders chatted amiably in Rome last year.\n\nPolitical analysts say the international influence of Latin American giant Brazil has shrunk under Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent fighting an uphill battle to win re-election next month.\n\nBolsonaro standing at the sidelines at G20 while everybody else engages in conversations like a PhD student attending their first academic conferencehttps://t.co/Yv4QZN4E4b pic.twitter.com/jvTZeIuzx5 — Christoph Harig (@c_harig) October 31, 2021\n\nHis ideologically driven foreign policy and disregard for diplomatic etiquette have overshadowed Brazil’s one-time role as a heavyweight in the world arena, experts say.\n\n“The country is going through a period of relative international isolation and a major reputational crisis,” says Fernanda Magnotta, coordinator of international relations at the FAAP institute in Sao Paulo.\n\n“Not many people want to have their picture taken with our leaders these days.”\n\nShe attributes that to a government where “decision-making is centralized around the administration’s most ideologically driven faction: the president, his sons and closest advisers.”\n\nWhether it is a surge of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest or rows with China and the Arab world, Bolsonaro, who has made relatively few trips abroad as president, has managed to alienate a substantial part of the international community since taking office in 2019.\n\nHis most recent faux pas came Sunday (18 September), when he drew criticism for using a visit to London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral to hold a thinly veiled campaign rally.\n\nBolsonaro makes campaign speech in London, on eve of the Queen’s funeral. #Brazil pic.twitter.com/4hhMkzJY4s — Stephen Gibbs (@STHGibbs) September 18, 2022\n\nThe Bolsonaro administration’s closest ties are with hardline conservative governments that are themselves isolated on the world stage: Hungary, Poland and especially Russia, which Brazil has chosen not to sanction for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBrazilian diplomacy has ceased to be seen as “a means for promoting economic ties and become a means for building far-right alliances for internal political gain,” says Rodrigo Goyena Soares, a historian at the University of Sao Paulo (USP).\n\nEven in its own neighborhood, Brazil has lost influence with insults aimed at a new wave of left-wing governments — such as Bolsonaro’s put-down of Argentina’s “bad choice” in electing President Alberto Fernandez in 2019.\n\n‘Unheard of’\n\nThings got off to a bad start when images of huge wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon sparked international outcry in 2019.\n\nAs Amazon burns, Brazil's Bolsonaro tells rest of world not to interfere Amid growing international criticism over the wildfires raging through the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday (22 August) admitted farmers could be illegally setting the rainforest ablaze but told foreign powers not to interfere.\n\nFrance came away particularly incensed, after Bolsonaro got into a spat with counterpart Emmanuel Macron over the environmental destruction — and resorted to mocking First Lady Brigitte Macron’s appearance.\n\nTies have not exactly improved.\n\nJust last month, Bolsonaro’s economy minister, Paulo Guedes, said of France: “You better start treating us right, or we’re going to tell you to go fuck yourselves.”\n\n“It’s unheard of in Brazilian diplomacy — in diplomacy, period,” says Goyena Soares.\n\nBolsonaro bet all his diplomatic chips on his political role model, former US president Donald Trump.\n\n“Bolsonaro’s Brazil aligned itself unprecedentedly with Trump’s United States,” says Felipe Loureiro, of the international relations institute at USP.\n\nBut “the alignment was with Trump and Trumpism,” he adds.\n\nUS-Brazilian relations have soured since President Joe Biden took office last year.\n\nBolsonaro was one of the last world leaders to recognize Biden’s win, as the defeated Trump fought in vain to overturn the election result.\n\nIt was “another bleak departure from Brazil’s foreign policy tradition of non-interference in other states’ affairs,” says Loureiro.\n\nDiplomatic to-do list\n\nThe Brazilian foreign ministry, a venerable institution known as “Itamaraty,” after the palace where it is headquartered, got a jolt when Bolsonaro named obscure diplomat Ernesto Araujo, a die-hard supporter, as foreign minister.\n\nA Trump-loving, China-bashing, climate change-skeptic, the “anti-globalist” Araujo turned Brazilian diplomacy on its head.\n\nForced out in March 2021 amid a seemingly endless series of imbroglios, Araujo was replaced by the comparatively tame Carlos Franca.\n\nBut some analysts point to Bolsonaro’s congressman son Eduardo as the real force in Brazilian diplomacy.\n\nThe man leading Bolsonaro in the polls for the 2 October election, leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), is vowing to restore Brazil’s international standing and slash Amazon deforestation if elected.\n\nOften more popular abroad than in Brazil, the charismatic but tarnished Lula would have to “reopen dialogue with every country… and resume South-South cooperation between Latin America and Africa,” says Magnotta.\n\nLula would also have to “renegotiate the terms of Brazil’s alliance with the US,” develop a proper China policy and seek “a rapprochement with the European Union around environmental issues,” says Goyena Soares.",

    "Brazil's meat regulation carnage": "A new law proposed by the Brazilian Government will end mandatory inspections of meat production which would result in a huge upsurge in extreme cruelty, chemical pollution and staff health and safety.\n\nDozens of animal advocacy organisations, conservationist groups and Brazilian senators have now joined together to voice collective concern over the Self-Control Bill from the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nIf approved, the law will enable the government to withdraw all mandatory state inspections into the animal agriculture industry. Federal inspectors would supervise compliance by auditing company reports, with no on-site supervision required.\n\nPlates\n\nThe bill was put forward to increase the capacity of the animal agriculture sector to increase exports. But charities warn that animal welfare and sanitary standards “are at extremely serious risk” and that “already vulnerable farmed animals will be at increased risk of extreme violence and cruelty ”.\n\nAbigail Penny, executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “This issue is far closer to home than you might first think.\n\n\"The UK imports tens of thousands of tonnes of animal products from Brazil every year and with such a disturbing lack of oversight there’s no way of knowing how those animals lived and died.\n\n\"The suffering they endured will forever be kept out of sight. Ultimately, if governments won’t protect them, we as consumers can, by leaving animals off of our plates.”\n\nThose companies that opt-in for inspections will be allowed to hire private inspectors or firms to supervise legal compliance.\n\nAgribusiness\n\nThis has raised alarms with members of the Association of Inspectors (ANFFA Sindical), who admit that it poses a conflict of interest, as private companies will not have the resources or power to counterbalance the interests of the large food businesses and, if they highlight failings, will be at risk of losing paying clients.\n\nThe bill would also allow for automatic approval of animal vaccines, antibiotics and anti-parasite medicines to be used on farms without commercial purposes, without the need for a formal assessment to first be carried out by government professionals and for a formal license of approval to be given.\n\nCampaigners say that the withdrawal of government inspections also means that the use of illegal agrochemicals cannot be easily identified and prevented, nor can those manufactured and sold at lower prices that are not approved by authorities and may cause serious public health problems.\n\nThe bill has already been approved in May 2022 in the Lower House of the Congress and sent to the Senate the same month. A public hearing was held in early June but only representatives of the agribusiness sector and the ANFFA Sindical-o were invited.\n\nCarla Lettieri, executive director of Animal Equality Brazil, said: “The bill is moving at such speed, it’s clearly being fast-tracked.\n\nAttack\n\n\"This bill is a blatant attack on the protections currently in place to protect animal welfare, our environment and human health. We will not sit back and watch as our laws are loosened. The only ones who would win is the animal agriculture industry, who will be left to self-police”.\n\nAnimal Equality Brazil has coordinated a number of actions to shed light on the potentially negative impacts of the bill, including sending letters to appeal for Senators to reconsider the Bill’s approval. Supporters include Greenpeace Brazil, Mercy for Animals and Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do Consumidor (IDEC).\n\nThis latest joint action has successfully reverted the voting of the public consultation and now, with this increased public awareness, the number of Brazilian citizens voting against the Bill is greater than those in favour.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, in 2021 the UK imported £3.2 million worth of fresh beef and Brazilian imports made up nearly half of processed beef imports in 2021, the equivalent of £33.6 million of meat.\n\nThis Author\n\nBrendan Montague is the editor of The Ecologist.

    "‘Bolsonaro promotes hatred’: violence stalks run-up to crucial Brazil election": "The body was found in the shade of a mango tree: a man’s life cut short in a frenzy of stabbing – and a horrifying symbol of the political violence that has gripped Brazil under its rabble-rousing president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\n“He showed no sign of remorse,” the police chief investigating the murder said of the prime suspect, a Bolsonaro-supporting lumberjack who allegedly committed the crime because he disliked the victim’s leftist views.\n\nThe murder of Benedito Cardoso dos Santos, which took place last Wednesday near a remote Amazon town, has sent shock waves through South America’s most populous nation as it braces for its most important presidential election in decades on 2 October.\n\nBolsonaro, a pro-gun former paratrooper notorious for his radical rhetoric, has not commented on the killing, which police say was the result of a political altercation involving one of his devotees.\n\nBut Bolsonaro’s political opponents are convinced the toxic climate whipped up by the far-right populist lies behind the murder – and a series of other violent incidents which have taken place ahead of next month’s crunch vote.\n\nWithin hours of last week’s murder Bolsonaro – who calls the election a battle between good and evil – demanded leftists be “eradicated from public life”. During the last election – when Bolsonaro himself was stabbed by a mentally ill lone wolf – he called for supporters of Lula’s Workers’ party to be “machine-gunned”. After winning power, Bolsonaro promised a cleanup of “red outlaws”.\n\n“The country is moving toward a savagery we have never before known,” the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who looks poised to defeat Bolsonaro in October’s election, warned last week after the murder of his supporter.\n\nThe opposition candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva walks with supporters during a rally on a farm in Nova Erechim in southern Brazil in March. He has now taken to wearing a bulletproof vest. Photograph: Eraldo Peres/AP\n\nAlexandre Padilha, a key member of Lula’s campaign team and former minister, said he had no doubt Bolsonaro bore responsibility for the spate of violent incidents, which includes the fatal shooting of a member of Lula’s Workers’ party by a Bolsonarista and an attack on a Lula rally with an excrement-filled bomb.\n\n“Bolsonaro and Bolsonarismo encourage political violence with an intensity Brazil has never seen,” claimed Padilha, a congressman for São Paulo state.\n\n“Bolsonaro promotes hatred, he promotes the extermination of his adversaries and Bolsonaro has doled guns out all around the country,” Padilha added, noting how the number of privately owned weapons had soared to nearly 2m thanks to the president’s loosening of gun laws.\n\nLast weekend armed Bolsonaro supporters reportedly threatened two prominent leftwing politicians, Guilherme Boulos and the presidential candidate Ciro Gomes, while they were campaigning.\n\n“It was horrible … nobody was expecting it,” said Ediane Maria, a leftist politician who was handing out leaflets with Boulos when they were confronted by a visibly agitated man.\n\n“He said, ‘I’m Bolsonaro!’ and, jittery, he lifted up his shirt and showed that he was carrying a gun. You could see the grip,” Maria said. “These people have always existed … but Bolsonaro has given them a voice.”\n\nAt a televised debate on Tuesday night, a pro-Bolsonaro politician was filmed harassing and insulting Vera Magalhães, a prominent female journalist whom Bolsonaro recently called “a disgrace to Brazilian journalism”.\n\nPolice escort Rafael Silva de Oliveira, the Bolsonaro-supporting lumberjack who allegedly murdered a colleague after a row over politics. Photograph: Police handout\n\nPadilha cited the recent murders of the British journalist and Guardian contributor Dom Phillips and the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereria as further examples of the “extremely serious [wave of] political violence” affecting Brazil.\n\n“Phillips advocated the protection of the Amazon and was denouncing illegal activities in the Amazon. Bolsonaro has turned the Amazon into a land without law,” he said.\n\nPolice are still investigating what exactly happened in the lead-up to last Wednesday’s murder, near the Amazon town of Confresa in Mato Grosso state.\n\nInvestigators believe the crime occurred after two lumberjacks – Cardoso dos Santos, 42, and Rafael Silva de Oliveira, 24 – went out for a post-dinner cigarette and ended up arguing over Brazil’s rancorous election race.\n\n“Benedito was championing the former president Lula. Rafael was championing President Bolsonaro – and they started to row,” said the local civil police chief, Victor Oliveira Pereira.\n\nWhat followed was a bloodbath, with Silva de Oliveira allegedly stabbing his victim at least 15 times in the neck and head before trying to decapitate him with an axe and filming the scene.\n\nThe suspect confessed to the crime the next day after unsuccessfully trying to flee.\n\n“We live in a democratic state where people have the right to express their opinions. According to the constitution, political pluralism is one of the foundations of our country. If things go on like this, we will go backward as a society,” the police chief warned.\n\n“We cannot allow this to become commonplace. We must have the right to express our opinions without it ending in violence,” he added.\n\nPadilha said that at no point in his four decades in politics had he felt such aggression and hatred on the streets. “Brazil is living through a climate of political violence the likes of which we’ve not seen since the return of democracy … and more than merely a climate, we’re now seeing a concrete reality.”\n\nBolsonaro supporters hold a demonstration against Lula in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro state, this month. Photograph: Andre Borges/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFears of a violent attack on Lula – which grew after the recent attempt to assassinate Argentina’s vice-president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – are such that the former president has taken to wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his shirt at rallies.\n\nPadilha admitted politicians and activists were worried, but insisted they would not be frightened into withdrawing from campaign events. “We will face this political violence without hatred but without fear,” he said.\n\nEdiane Maria also vowed to continue her political struggle despite the threats. “We will not abandon the streets. These things only make us more determined … to fight so we can defeat Bolsonaro and he is gone from government on 2 October,” she said. “They will not intimidate us. We will continue to advance.”",
    "Bolsonaro tries red scare tactics in Brazil election by raising spectre of Nicaragua": "More than 4,000km and an ideological abyss separate the capitals of Nicaragua and Brazil, where an acrimonious race for the presidency is under way.\n\nBut the Central American country has found itself at the centre of Brazil’s election debate as its far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro seeks to weaponise Daniel Ortega’s authoritarian crackdown on the Catholic church to attack his leftist challenger, the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly cited Ortega’s anti-clergy offensive in the run-up to Brazil’s 2 October vote, hoping to convince God-fearing voters Lula’s return to power would result in similar persecution.\n\nOn Tuesday Bolsonaro hammered home his message at the UN general assembly, declaring: “I want to announce that Brazil will open its doors to receive the Catholic priests and nuns who have suffered persecution under Nicaragua’s dictatorial regime.”\n\nExperts describe the Bolsonarian allegation that Lula – a moderate two-term president from 2003 to 2010 who enjoyed good relations with both Catholic and Protestant leaders – would close churches and jail clergy as ludicrous.\n\n“There is just zero evidence in his governing that he would ever behave like dictators in Nicaragua and Venezuela. I just find it a ridiculous argument,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University Latin America specialist and the author of How Democracies Die.\n\n“Do these guys really believe that, having lived in Brazil for eight years under Lula, that Lula would suddenly turn Brazil into Nicaragua?” Levitsky wondered. “Maybe, but I don’t think they are that stupid. I think they’re just saying that because they want to legitimise or justify authoritarian behaviour.”\n\nHowever dubious the claim, it is one Bolsonaro and his allies continue to peddle, primarily in the hope of winning over evangelical voters, who represent almost a third of Brazil’s 156 million-strong electorate.\n\nIn one recent television interview Bolsonaro appeared with the word Nicaragua written on the palm of his hand.\n\nHis politician sons, Eduardo and Flávio Bolsonaro, have been warning millions of social media followers over the supposed threat of a Nicaragua-style future under Lula. “If Jair Bolsonaro leaves power, Brazil won’t become an Argentina or a Venezuela – it’ll go straight to Nicaragua,” congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted last month.\n\n“Don’t forget, he’s a friend of Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega,” Flávio Bolsonaro, a senator for Rio, wrote of Lula. “Have a look on Google to see what he’s been doing to priests and nuns.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Silas Malafaia, the radical televangelist who Bolsonaro took to London for the Queen’s funeral, shared his ally’s offer to shelter Nicaragua’s embattled clerics on Twitter, claiming Nicaragua “was supported by Lula”.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, left, appears alongside the evangelical leader Silas Malafaia in Rio de Janeiro last week. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nThe weaponisation of Nicaragua is a rehash of Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign when he used the collapse of Nicolás Maduro’s Venezuela to make spurious claims about what might happen were Lula’s Worker’s party (PT) to win power.\n\nLula has sought to neutralize Bolsonaro’s attacks by distancing himself from Ortega, a revolutionary hero turned authoritarian who has governed continuously since 2007 and secured a fourth consecutive term last year through elections opponents called a sham.\n\nOrtega’s re-election followed a six-month crackdown on Nicaragua’s opposition which saw all of the former rebel’s main challengers detained or forced into exile.\n\n“It’s been 10 years since I last had contact with Nicaragua. I don’t know what’s happening in Nicaragua. But I’ve heard things aren’t going well there,” Lula said last year, urging Ortega not to “abandon democracy”.\n\nLula has been facing groundless allegations that he would attack Christianity since the first of his six presidential campaigns in 1989.\n\nMore than three decades later such scare tactics have been turbo-charged by social media. Together, Bolsonaro and his three sons boast nearly 16 million followers on Twitter and 20 million on Facebook.\n\nSo far the scaremongering appears to be failing, however, with Lula launching a charm offensive to reassure Brazilian Christians.\n\n“I don’t think anyone has ever taken such care and ensured the freedom to open churches and practice one’s faith as I did,” Lula told a rally of evangelical supporters earlier this month.\n\nThe latest polls suggest support for Lula is actually increasing among Catholic voters, rising from 52% to 53% this week according to the pollster Ipec. Evangelicals still prefer Bolsonaro, with 48% of them supporting his presidential bid. But Lula’s evangelical vote share this week rose from 31% to 32%. Overall, the leftist boasts a 16-point lead over Bolsonaro with less than two weeks until the election.",

    "Brazil will channel 2002 vibes to try and end World Cup trophy drought": "Brazil's hopes of breaking their World Cup drought this year are high. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the summer of 2002, under a sweltering Japanese heat inside the International stadium in Yokohama, Brazil dazzled the footballing world by becoming the most successful nation in the history of the men's World Cup, beating Germany 2-0 and earning their fifth trophy. Blessed with an embarrassment of riches -- from Rivaldo to Ronaldinho, Cafu and Golden Boot winner Ronaldo \"O Fenomeno\" Nazario -- it was the perfect conclusion to a perfect tournament. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men had emulated the legendary 1970 victory, having also won every match in the competition, and gave Brazilians a sense of redemption against mighty Europe after losing to France four years earlier.\n\n\"I feel pleasure, a joy that the people of Brazil are feeling now,\" Scolari said after the match. \"The joy of knowing we did our job, but it was full of very hard work. Brazil back as world champions -- that is not something we can forget.\"\n\nBack in Brazil, people on the streets celebrated for days, joyful at not just the victory but the fact that the Selecao was finally back where it belonged: at the top of soccer royalty. (Speaking of royalty, Japan's emperor Akihito couldn't attend the ceremony due to national custom, but it didn't matter to Brazilians as Pele, their footballing king, handed the trophy to Cafu instead.)\n\n\"It was an amazing thing that happened in my life. From the combination of the players we had, the generation [of those players], the way we won it... I can't fully describe how I felt that day but it was a very special day for me,\" Kleberson, who was a member of Scolari's historic squad and is now working as an assistant coach at defending MLS champions and newly crowned Campeones Cup winners NYCFC, told ESPN. It was the midfielder's decisive run and pass to Ronaldo (which included a lovely dummy from Rivaldo) that secured the second goal against Germany. \"The fact that I shared this with the best players in the world, it was a powerful moment in my life,\" he added.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nBrazil out to end World Cup trophy drought\n\nTwenty years later and, as a new World Cup appears on the horizon, Brazil are still holding on to those memories from Japan and South Korea, hoping to use them as fuel as their drought continues. Should they lose in Qatar, it will mark 24 years without winning the coveted trophy and, even though there has been some success (three Copa America titles and an Olympic gold medal) and some gigantic failures (see the 2014 World Cup semifinals), two decades without lifting the most valuable piece of silverware in the game is just not acceptable for Brazilians.\n\n\"We know it's been a long time since we have won it. We were close in 2006, and also in 2010, and of course the result at home against Germany... no-one wants to remember that,\" Kleberson says of the 2014 nightmare when Brazil lost 7-1 in the semifinals at the Mineirao stadium in Belo Horizonte. \"I believe, however, that it's all about the generations and a lot of things change. A lot of Brazilian players have changed during those times and thanks to the younger players now, those playing in Europe, Brazil has a great chance again to win the World Cup. It's a process and we need to continue this process in order to see Brazil play the way it can.\"\n\nThis process under Tite has generated some impressive players to choose from. So much so that there is an erratic sense about his squad selections. At least from an offensive standpoint, there are too many cooks in the kitchen and Tite -- entering his final World Cup as manager -- has to get it right. But one thing is for sure, this Brazilian side, which eased its way into qualification in record form (10 wins, three draws, 30 goals scored and only five conceded) has the potential to overwhelm anyone in Qatar. And it's not a stretch to say that the talent not only matches the 2002 squad, but could very well surpass it.\n\n\"This [current] squad is bringing back a lot of the same style from before when we had Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo in the team, we now have players like Neymar, Vinicius Jr., even Rodrygo... they're bringing so much talent to the team,\" says Kleberson. \"But I don't think we should compare too much. It's two different squads. The players from 2002 were of a different generation to what we have now. Brazil, I think ultimately want to play with freedom, one-on-one on the field, with really creative, fast and powerful players.\"\n\nNeymar is one the keys to success. Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images\n\nNeymar leads the way\n\nAll of these attributes begin with the team's obvious leader, Neymar Jr., who is the undoubted headliner of this squad.\n\n\"Neymar Jr. is the best player in Brazil and maybe in the world. The way he plays, with passion and how he contributes on the pitch,\" says Kleberson. \"He can bring a lot of qualities for Brazil and I think he is probably going to push himself and Brazil a lot in order to have the perfect World Cup.\"\n\nEven with the likes of Champions League winners Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, or the showmanship of Raphinha or Antony, this is Neymar's team and just like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he represents the final chapter of current World Cup nobility, knowing full well that younger stars are ready to take over. This might not be his last World Cup, but it might be his last to fully take centre stage, and just like Kleberson states, from a contribution perspective, it's coming at the perfect time.\n\nUnder new PSG manager Christophe Galtier, Neymar is having one of his best campaigns -- he leads the scoring charts with seven goals and is tied with Messi with seven assists from seven Ligue 1 appearances. He tops the list for direct goal contributions in Europe's Big Five leagues but, more importantly, Neymar is playing like the Neymar we knew from his Santos days: Free, brave, uncompromising. This is similar to Ronaldo in 2002, who after recovering from injury, decided to wave goodbye to any inhibition. Hence \"that\" haircut, I guess.\n\nOnly three goals behind Pele (77) for the all-time national scoring record, Neymar could have more than one reason to celebrate in 2022.\n\n\"I don't think it will be Neymar's last World Cup, because I think he can play for a long time,\" Kleberson says. \"But I believe he's going to be putting a lot of work in to be at the top and help Brazil win the World Cup. I am looking forward to seeing him be successful in 2022.\"\n\nplay 0:42 Laurens: Close Atletico's stadium after racist chants Julien Laurens calls for Atletico Madrid's next home game to be played without a crowd after fans shouted racist chants about Vinicius Junior during Sunday's Madrid derby.\n\nVinicius Jr. needs to keep dancing\n\nSpeaking of working towards the top, nobody in the game seems to be earning it more than Vinicius Jr. these days, and just like his idol Ronaldinho during the 2002 World Cup, he enters Qatar at 22 years old, ready to take some of the burden from the shoulders of his other idol, Neymar.\n\nHowever, Vinicius Jr. is not coming to this World Cup as a young prodigy ready to make an impact on the game. He's there already. A two-time champion in LaLiga and Champions League winner with Real Madrid, the young forward from Rio de Janeiro is already a star.\n\nThere's something else, however, that might motivate him at this World Cup, and that's the willingness to rewrite the script for Afro-Brazilians. After the grotesque racist remarks made by Pedro Bravo, president of the Spanish Agents Association, about his goal celebrations, Vinicius Jr. responded via social media.\n\n'As long as skin color is more important than the brightness of the eyes, there will be war.' I have this sentence tattooed on my body. This thought is permanent in my head. This is the attitude and philosophy I try to practice in my life. They say happiness is upsetting. The happiness of a Black Brazilian successful in Europe upsets much more! But my desire to win, my smile and the sparkle in my eyes are bigger than all of this. You can't even imagine. I was a victim of xenophobia and racism in a single statement. But none of this started yesterday. Weeks ago, they started criminalizing my dances. Dances that are not mine. They belong to Ronaldinho, Neymar, (Lucas) Paquetá, (Antoine) Griezmann, João Félix, Matheus Cunha... they belong to Brazilian Funk and Samba artists, to reggaeton singers and to Black Americans...they are dances to celebrate the cultural diversity of the world. Accept it, respect it. I'm not going to stop. The script always ends with an apology and an 'I've been misunderstood', but I'll repeat it for you, racist: I will not stop dancing. Whether it's in the Sambadrome, in the Bernabéu or wherever.\n\nThe reaction from the soccer world was overwhelming as Brazilian stars of past and present, including Pele, Ronaldo and Neymar, stood behind their compatriot with words of support. Last Sunday, Gabriel Jesus even performed Vinicius Jr.'s celebration after scoring for Arsenal against Brentford. When Rodrygo opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the derby against Atletico at the Metropolitano, he was joined by Vinicius Jr. by the corner flag and proceeded to dance. Atletico responded to the racist chants by their fans before the game.\n\nThis collective moment of unity from the national team of past and present, from teammates and others from the Brazilian national setup -- mainly made of afro-Latinos -- is more than just words of encouragement for the Real Madrid star. It's a call to action, a battle cry and perhaps a taster for what's to come in November. Let's hope the world is ready for more dancing.\n\nQatar 2022 will be Tite's last World Cup. Edilzon Gamez/Getty Images\n\nTite's selection issues\n\nFrom a selection perspective, here's the problem for Tite -- and it was similar for Scolari back in 2002 -- who do you leave out?\n\nGabriel Jesus is not in the squad for the September friendlies, and neither is the well-liked and often-selected Philippe Coutinho. The latter is not as shocking due to recent subpar performances with Aston Villa (although he improved this past weekend against Southampton) but Gabriel Jesus' absence is perplexing, considering how well he has started with the Gunners.\n\nAfter announcing his squad, Tite stated in a news conference that these omissions are in order to allow other players -- such as Flamengo's Pedro, who leads scoring in Copa Libertadores -- to show what they can do. It's still slightly confusing, however, as this is the final break before the World Cup and you would think that Tite, a glutton for detail, would also want to encourage fluidity and chemistry before heading off to Qatar. Regardless, barring any injury setbacks, Gabriel Jesus should still have a seat on the plane in November, though we might not be able to say the same for Coutinho or other players such as Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nTaking a wider look -- just like 2002 with then-31-year-old Cafu, 30-year-old Rivaldo and 29-year-old Roberto Carlos -- there is valuable experience in this current squad. Alisson Becker (29), Casemiro (30), Thiago Silva (38) and Marquinhos (28) are all well-travelled and will be important voices in the dressing room.\n\nMany often question Brazil's defensive issues, specifically out wide, but this side actually defends very well. Conceding only five goals to get to the World Cup, especially in South America, is not an easy feat and this team are once again emulating another blueprint from the 2002 campaign. In Japan/South Korea, Scolari's side emphasized the need to be collective together, on and off the ball; not only did they end the competition in perfect fashion, but they showed their defensive fortitude against some very tough opposition -- allowing just four goals in total, and only one in the knockout stages.\n\n\"I know Tite really well and I know how much he works with the guys at the back,\" Kleberson says. \"The great players we have at centre-back, they're very experienced. Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, sometimes Eder Militao. They give something different to Brazil in terms of defending. But our goalkeepers are also amazing. Two starters in the Premier League (Alisson for Liverpool and Ederson for Man City), then the rest are top in Brazil so they give a lot of consistency for the team. That's why Brazil conceded only five goals in qualifying.\"\n\nThe upcoming World Cup, for better or worse, is unlike no other. Not only are countries dealing with having to stop domestic competition midway through the season, but they also have less time to fully prepare for it as a squad. Brazilians, however, won't care as the time to reclaim the World Cup trophy is right now.\n\n\"We know Germany has a good team. France has a good team. We know Argentina always plays very well at the World Cup but for me I think Brazil has a very good chance just because of the way they are preparing, performing and even talking,\" Kleberson adds. \"They have a lot of players who can play. I think for a long time Brazil hasn't had a team where they can build really, really good players, and that's what's going to make a really powerful Brazil. I believe in Brazil. I hope at the end of the year, we can have this title and win the World Cup.\"\n\nAfter his success in 2002, Ronaldo was asked how much he wanted to win the World Cup? How often did he imagine lifting the trophy? \"I used to visualize the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air. It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it,\" he told reporters. \"I wanted to become a world champion so badly. Achieving that goal, winning the biggest prize there is to win in football, made me ecstatically happy.\"\n\nIt's time for this current squad to share the sentiment.",
    "Brazil’s Catholic Church frowns on proposals to legalize homeschooling": "SÃO PAULO – Facing opposition from both the Brazilian bishops and the National Association of Catholic Education, conservative Christian groups are pressuring President Jair Bolsonaro and lawmakers to legalize homeschooling.\n\nBrazil’s Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that although homeschooling was possible, specific legislation was necessary to allow it.\n\nSeeking a second term in elections scheduled for next month, Bolsonaro has met with advocates of homeschooling on two different occasions since the end of August.\n\nIt is estimated that around 30,000 families in Brazil educate their children at home, despite the legal ambiguity surrounding the practice.\n\nWithout specific legal protection, they risk being charged by the authorities with the intellectual neglect of their children.\n\nIn May, a homeschooling bill endorsed by Bolsonaro passed in the Chamber of Deputies, but still must be approved in the Senate.\n\nAlthough the Catholic Church in other countries has been supportive of homeschooling – or at least neutral on the subject – the church in Brazil has been firmly opposed to the legislation.\n\nAccording to Ascânio Sedrez, an experienced principal of Catholic schools in São Paulo and a member of the National Association of Catholic Education (ANEC), homeschooling “is a bad idea on several levels and seems especially inappropriate in the current Brazilian situation.”\n\n“We have just witnessed firsthand how most families clearly were not able to handle the learning process of their children at home during the pandemic. Now those people want to take education to families again,” Sedrez told Crux.\n\nIndeed, educational assessment data released by the government on Sept. 16 showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a brutal impact on the literacy development of elementary school students. Experts fear the possible consequences of such deficiencies for future learning.\n\nSedrez argued that the Bolsonaro administration has been continually dismantling previously consolidated educational policies with the aim of “reducing costs with schools and opening the way for their privatization.”\n\nHomeschooling in that sense is, at the same time, an excuse for Bolsonaro’s free market agenda and a way of “showing to his constituents that he is a pro-family president, given that he supports the rights of families to educate their children at home,” he said.\n\nAlthough homeschooling is mostly supported by Evangelicals and Pentecostals, many conservative and traditionalist Catholics also prefer educating their children at home.\n\nIn the politically charged scenario in Brazil since Bolsonaro’s election in 2018, many conservative Catholics have been increasingly suspicious of schools, frequently perceived as places of ideological indoctrination by left-wing groups. That has been a top reason for the new interest in homeschooling.\n\n“Schools combat mostly the Catholic Church and its 2,000-year thought. It is sad to see that the episcopate is aligned against the possibility of a truly Catholic education for our children,” said Ricardo Silva, father of a one-year-old son.\n\nFor two years, he and his wife have been members of the Society of Saint Pius X, a traditionalist fraternity founded by Archbishop Michel Lefebvre in 1970 that is in irregular communion with the Vatican. Silva is worried about secular education, “which attacks the church and struggles against its doctrine, at the same time relativizing the knowledge in several areas,” he said.\n\n“The most important thing about homeschooling is that I will be able to teach my son about the church doctrine the way it used to be taught till 60 or 70 years ago. Besides, learning at home is faster and more efficient than learning at school,” Silva said.\n\nHe said that he does not fear his son will lose anything by not going to school because his family is able to provide a good environment for socialization.\n\n“I believe families should have the right to teach their children at home,” he said.\n\nSedrez said homeschooling “appears for some people as a way of preserving a Catholic identity that has been perverted by the world.”\n\n“But it is part of an ideology that opposes public schools and universities. It opposes everything that can lead to emancipation,” he added.\n\nMany private companies have been giving signs that they are ready to get into the market of educational systems to help families in homeschooling.\n\n“They know there is money in it. Many of those families have financial conditions of hiring a tutor. It is really an elitist project,” Sedrez said.\n\nAuxiliary Bishop Joaquim Mol Guimarães of Belo Horizonte, one of the members of the episcopate who has been following the debate on homeschooling over the past few years, argued that it is never a good solution, given that it disregards relevant economic disparities in society.\n\n“That is a rather excluding and elitist project that may have terrible consequences if the poor end up being put aside – like they are in other aspects,” he told Crux.\n\nGuimarães, who is the president of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, stressed that both families and schools have fundamental roles in the learning process, but “schools can at times supplant the families that lack the conditions to adequately offer the basic elements of education.”\n\n“Schools have an indispensable relevance because they put children side by side, something that is primordial for human development in learning projects guided by well-prepared teachers,” he said.\n\nSedrez emphasized that a truly Christian educational perspective has to consider that “ours is a gregarious species, so education must be a collective experience.”\n\n“Besides, Catholics need to be educated for common life – in community and in society as a whole,” he said.\n\nThe parents’ ability to properly teach their children is another concern among education experts in Brazil.\n\nAccording to Guimarães, good teachers are trained to help students think about reality and its meaning.\n\n“We cannot be sure that family members, even though they have studied to have a career in this or that field, have the conditions and the pedagogical resources necessary to teach all subjects,” he said.",
    "The growing cost of coffee in Brazil": "In Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, substantial increases in farming costs are impacting roasteries and cafés both domestically and internationally. Mariana Proença explores how farmers and hospitality entrepreneurs are addressing these new challenges – and even harnessing new opportunities. English translation by K.J. Yeung\n\nMicro-producers in the Campo das Vertentes Region, Minas Gerais, sorting green coffee from ripe cherries on an African bed\n\nHigh-price scenarios\n\nIn Brazil, coffee is part of everyday life – so important that it is classed an essential household item among food staples necessary for daily family life.However, a half-kilo pack of commercial grade coffee (known as tradicional) has more than doubled in price since the beginning of the pandemic – 144% to be precise.Inflation over the last 12 months has reached 12%, a figure influenced by fluctuations in the price of Brazil’s beloved coffee bean.Prices around the world have been affected by supply chain disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While high inflation is not exclusively a Brazilian issue, coffee has contributed even more to the rise due to climate phenomena such as droughts and frosts in several producing regions.As the largest coffee producing country in the world, not only by volume but also land area, the rising cost of fuel has pushed up the cost of production throughout Brazil’s coffee supply chain, impacting road transportation and machinery used for the harvest and crop management.Price spikes for fertilisers and pesticides have also contributed to the economic challenges Brazilʼs coffee farmers face, alongside higher logistics and export costs.Professionals from across the coffee value chain are facing a new economic landscape following the pandemic and the climate emergency, which have contributed to 2022’s record high coffee prices.Luiz Eduardo Melo, owner of Supernova Coffee Roasters, located in Curitiba, Paraná, in the southern region of Brazil, says he decided not to pass price increases on to his customers because he had sufficient coffee stored from the last crop due to decreased sales during the pandemic.\n\n“We couldn’t hold the prices down, otherwise we wouldn’t have the cash to invest in buying the new crop”\n\nLuiz Eduardo Melo, Owner of Supernova Coffee Roasters\n\nIt was 2021, and prices had already started to spike. However, when his lower-price coffee stock dwindled, he had to go shopping and found the old prices were no more.“We raised our prices in June 2021 and again in January 2022 – two rises in a short interval. We couldnʼt hold the prices down, otherwise we wouldn't have the cash to invest in buying the next crop,” he explains.These price increases were made by businesses across Brazil. On average, 60% was added to price tags across the countryʼs supermarkets and coffee shops.In the international market, Latitudes Coffees is an exporter. Its CEO and current president of Alta Mogiana Specialty Coffee Association (AMSC) Edgard Bressani says that “with rising production costs during the pandemic, prices of green coffee in the Brazilian market have responded accordingly. These high (prices) were due to climate issues we had.“We were all caught off guard and so was the international market.” Bressani explains that roasteries he exports to outside Brazil needed to pass on the price increase to consumers, “who were not ready to absorb the impact of higher prices.” This has caused a significant shrinkage of profit margins and even resulted in losses. “Many roasteries have closed for good or were sold,” he says.Expocaccer, one of the largest coffee exporters in Brazil, is located in Patrocínio, in the Cerrado Mineiro region. Sandra Moraes, who leads the company’s specialty coffee division, has other insights about the price increases: “In the international market, we had additional logistics challenges concerning the lack of containers and available ships, which drastically impacted the prices of international freight.”Moraes evaluates that production costs for farmers in the region have swelled 60-70%. “Consequently these costs were passed on to the final price,” she explains. In addition, the Cerrado Mineiro region had large areas affected by a serious frost in 2021, which caused significant losses and impacted production.Moreover, AMSC’s Bressani points out that the average production per hectare rate in Brazil is often low.“Some producers who are more structured and professional have more efficient production methods and can manage rising costs. But many farmers donʼt even know their real production costs,” he says.Instant coffee produced from commercial grade robusta crops also plays an important role in the Brazilian coffee market.\n\nCoffee pickers in the mountains of Espírito Santo region, Espírito Santo State\n\nQuality and consumption\n\nHowever, with robusta far less affected by the climate factors impeding arabica crop yields, subsequent increased demand is leading to disproportionately higher prices for the traditionally cheaper crop, according to Aguinaldo Lima, Director of Institutional Relations of the Brazilian Instant Coffee Industries Association (ABICS).“In our country, the production yield of arabica was jeopardised, but canephora (robusta) was not affected.Add to that a significant improvement in quality, and the industry migrates to canephora. Consequently, prices get higher compared to the international market, as in Vietnam, for instance. This causes a direct impact in the instant coffee industry,” he says.Operating in the premium and specialty coffee market, Curitiba-based coffee shop owner and roaster Luiz Melo says it would be a gamechanger if “consumers able to pay more for a better coffee, but who typically buy commercial grade coffee out of habit, could ‘migrate’ to specialty coffee since prices are no longer much different.”He has noticed new customers at his coffee shop – former commercial coffee drinkers – and he even recorded an increase in sales.“This is my perspective in the domestic market, but it is still a local perception from the city I work and live in, Curitiba,” Melo adds.According to AMSC’s Bressani, roasteries are tending to choose lower quality beans compared to those they used to buy: “Buyers can no longer pass the high prices to the products on the shelves or to the cup.But that may be a terrible mistake because quality is deeply connected to consumption (habits),” he points out.However, traders currently trying to get their green beans to be sold in August and September are facing challenges transacting with farmers.“Some big players who had settled their deals on future crops at old prices are selling well with lower margins. Often the margins are good because they have bought at low prices but I buy from partner farms to sell [to the international market], and it is much harder. Nevertheless, we keep on betting that the market will stabilise”, Bressani concludes.Expocaccerʼs Moraes also notes potential for growth in the specialty coffee market. She says consumers are increasingly seeking higher quality. Consequently, they are also looking for sustainability, organic and even regenerative certification.\n\n“The production yield of arabica was jeopardised, but canephora (robusta) was not affected”\n\nAguinaldo Lima, Director of Institutional Relations of the Brazilian Instant Coffee Industries Association (ABICS)\n\n\n\n“We had our first Regenerative Coffee Certification issued to Expocaccer associate Fernando Nogues Beloni, who put the Cerrado Mineiro region on the map and leads Brazil in this field,” she says.\n\nFor Supernova’s Melo, even though inflation will likely impact coffee consumption among Brazilian families, he does not anticipate overall trade volumes will change much.“Curiously, our income is growing, especially now that we are in the winter. It all depends on how each coffee shop works around its prices.Some traditional shops canʼt add much value to what they are offering. We, from the specialty market, have this differential.”Coffee has long been a relatively cheap staple for households in Brazil and around the world. However, as coffee farmers continue to grapple with rising prices due to the pandemic, the climate emergency and geopolitical tensions, even commercial grade coffee destined for instant brands could see significant price increases.Nevertheless, this dynamic has led some in the premium and specialty segments to bet on higher quality yielding greater perceived value, which could prove a boost to growers, roasters and coffee shops at the top end of the market.Whatever the outcome, current environmental and economic headwinds look set to blow all grades of coffee into pricier territory – and could consign the days of the cheap morning pick-me-up to the history books.\n\n\n\nMariana Proença is an independent journalist and coffee specialist based in São Paulo, Brazil.

    "Brazil election: Bolsonaro and Lula trade insults in first debate": "The first round of the election will be held on 2 October with a second round scheduled for 30 October if none of the candidates gets 50% of valid votes.",
    "Brazil's Bolsonaro campaigns on Independence Day": "\"We are celebrating because we are going to win, democracy is going to win here,\" said Henrique Vendrini. \"We don't accept the polls, we believe what we can see here, a lot of people just celebrating Brazil, celebrating democracy, and celebrating the new re-election.\"",
    "‘Olê, olá, Lula!’ Brazil’s voters sing for a heroic comeback to banish Bolsonaro": "It was a scene that could have been plucked from Brazil’s history books: an enraptured crowd, a sea of flags and, on stage above them, a bearded leftist in a bright red shirt.\n\n“The president of hope is here!” the master of ceremonies roared as the star of the show arrived in a police convoy to address the people whose country he is promising to save.\n\nAs their champion came into view, the throng chanted back a refrain from old times: “Olê, olê, olê, olá, Lula, Lula!”\n\nVirtually identical spectacles played out two decades ago as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva prepared to claim a momentous election victory in 2002 that would make him the first working-class president of one of the world’s most unequal nations.\n\nBut this was September 2022 and the factory worker who became a left-wing legend was battling to complete a sensational political comeback that would return him to the presidency at the age of 77.\n\n“Get your new Bermudas ready! Get your new shirts ready! Because on 1 January, I’ll be taking power!” Lula told the thousands of supporters who had come to see him in Nova Iguaçu, a down-at-heel city north of Rio.\n\nBrazil’s incumbent president, Jair Bolsonaro, gestures during a campaign rally in early September at Copacabana beach, Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Wagner Meier/Getty Images\n\nWith two weeks until an election in which Lula hopes to defeat Brazil’s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, the leftist is in pole position to achieve that goal – and the mostly black, working class crowd in Nova Iguaçu is desperate for him to succeed.\n\n“Bolsonaro is dragging our country into destitution and we’re counting on Lula to change this,” said Isac de Jesus da Silva, a street hawker who was selling blocks of banana jelly outside Lula’s event beneath a forest of electricity pylons.\n\n“He’s the greatest president Brazil has ever had,” added the 38-year-old, one of an estimated 33 million Brazilians struggling to feed themselves as a result of soaring food prices and a Covid crisis that killed more than 685,000 people and brought economic misery. “My fridge is empty, my friend,” he sighed. “Unfortunately, under Bolsonaro I’m going hungry. We need Lula back in power so we can eat again.”\n\nNostalgia for Lula’s two-term government, when he used a commodities boom to bankroll social programmes that helped millions escape poverty, has played a leading role in his sixth presidential run.\n\nOn the stump in Nova Iguaçu, Lula promised to empower the urban poor as he did from 2003 to 2010, telling his audience: “We abolished slavery in 1888 and we no longer want to be anyone’s slave.”\n\n“We are going to build a compassionate, humane and fraternal country where no mother will go to bed seeing her child go hungry,” he declared, to cheers of delight.\n\n“What would become of us without Lula?” asked Rute Alves, a 60-year-old snack vendor who was there with her family and believed her candidate was set to win outright in the first round on 2 October.\n\nThat is a possibility, with two recent polls giving Lula a 12 to 15-point lead over Bolsonaro and suggesting he might secure the 50% of votes that would return him to the presidency without a run-off in late October.\n\nPresidential candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva poses for a photo with a baby during a visit last week to a farmers’ fair in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Photograph: Fernando Bizerra/EPA\n\nBut Bolsonaro, to whom a third of voters remain loyal, is not without support. Many millions of Brazilians view the prospect of a Lula revival with dread after the corruption scandals that blighted his government. Twenty-four hours earlier, the right-wing radical rallied tens of thousands of devotees on Copacabana beach for a show of strength designed to demonstrate he still has a shot at staying in power.\n\n“He’s doing a good job and we do not want Brazil to become communist,” said Fernanda Laranjeira, a 45-year-old lawyer wearing a bright yellow T-shirt stamped with Bolsonaro’s slogan: “Brazil above everything! God above all!”\n\nWould Bolsonaro win? “I want him to win,” Laranjeira said. “If the results are honest, he’ll win. If he doesn’t win, it’s because the vote was rigged.”\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some worry the Donald Trump-admiring former army captain will contest the result, as his US ally did after Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, potentially bringing 6 January-style turmoil to Brazil’s streets.\n\nBolsonaro has said he will concede if he considers the result “clean and transparent” – yet Brazil’s president has repeatedly suggested it will not be and has dismissed polls showing him trailing Lula as a sham.\n\nLast month more than a million Brazilians signed a manifesto warning that their young democracy faced a moment of “great danger” given Bolsonaro’s admiration for Brazil’s 1964-85 military dictatorship.\n\nThomas Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil under Barack Obama, said he doubted Brazil’s armed forces would back an attempt by Bolsonaro to overturn the result by force. “They would be putting their long-term reputation and their long-term relationship with the Brazilian people on the line for a very short-term product.”\n\nYet the former ambassador did not rule out some key hardline military figures supporting such a rupture to keep Bolsonaro in power. “The question is specific individuals – because individuals can always decide to act in ways that are not in the best interests of an institution but are certainly in their best interests,” Shannon warned.\n\nAlexandre Padilha, a former minister and key member of Lula’s campaign team, said he was hopeful of a first round victory but expected Bolsonaro to challenge the result.\n\n“We have to be prepared for the most preposterous behaviour from Bolsonaro,” he said, pointing to the president’s “outrageous” response to Covid, his destruction of the Amazon and incitement of political violence. “We have to be ready for him to question the election result and bring political instability to the country. We have to be ready for everything.”\n\nPadilha voiced optimism, however, that Lula would prevail and, on day one of his presidency, launch an immediate war on hunger.\n\nSuch pledges are music to the ears of people like Isac de Jesus da Silva, who was a teenager when Lula was first elected and is now struggling into middle age. As he waited for the leftist to arrive in Nova Iguaçu, Silva scoffed at Bolsonaro’s efforts to portray himself as “captain of the people”. “Bolsonaro’s the rich man’s president. And the one who’s fighting for the poor - the Robin Hood of the poor - right now is Lula. He’s the only person who cares about those of us who have nothing,” he said.\n\nSilva shrugged off the corruption scandals that saw Lula jailed ahead of the 2018 election that brought Bolsonaro to power. The convictions were quashed last year, paving the way for Lula to write what he hopes will be the final chapter in a storybook four-decade political career.\n\n“Lots of people say Lula stole. I’ve no idea if he did or he didn’t,” Silva said. “But if he did, at least he took from the rich to give to the poor.”",

REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli\n\nSAO PAULO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's government admitted that its estimates for coffee crops over recent years have problems and need improvements to better reflect the reality, since the numbers for production have been smaller than the sum of local consumption plus exports.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Thursday, the director of Agricultural Policy at Brazil's food supply and statistics agency Conab, Sergio De Zen, said that due to those discrepancies there is a process going on do revise numbers and methodology for Conab's coffee crop forecasts.\n\nConab's coffee numbers for Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter, have for years been subject of debate among coffee traders and analysts, who generally consider production estimates to be too low.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nTrading houses and independent analysts usually have higher crop numbers for Brazil than Conab. For this year, for example, while Conab sees the crop at 50.4 million 60-kg bags, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects 64.3 million, Rabobank sees 63.2 million and consultancy Safras & Mercado, 58.2 million bags.\n\n\"We've been talking to co-ops, farmers and exporters, trying to work together to be able to have a crop projection that better reflects the reality,\" said De Zen.\n\nThe director's comments came after Reuters questioned Conab's forecasts with numbers for Brazil's consumption and exports. There is a clear supply gap when they are compared (see table).\n\nSource: Brazil coffee consumption data from ABIC, export numbers from Cecafe\n\nWhen numbers for local consumption plus exports are compared with crop projections for the last five years there is a large deficit of more than 32 million bags.\n\n\"We've done that calculation before...\" the director said, admitting to the problem.\n\nStock numbers could help solve the equation, but Conab has stopped publishing those.\n\n\"We have not publish them because the supply balance calculation does not make sense,\" he said, confirming the gap.\n\nDe Zen said, however, that stocks at farms are not negligible and could help to solve the S&D equation, but he said the number and quality of answers to the stocks poll was low.\n\nThe director said that Conab plans to revise the numbers for the crops in recent years in the same way it did with soybean data in 2020, when the revision resulted in millions of tonnes added to the S&D table.\n\nHe partially blamed the problems to the bad state of Conab's structure when the current government took over four years ago.\n\nHe said Conab is hiring people to boost the coffee projection, adding that it will use satellite data to better measure planted area and improve agricultural yields calculation.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Roberto Samora; additional reporting and writing by Marcelo Teixeira in New York Editing by Marguerita Choy\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "World Cup favourites Brazil helped by versatile West Ham new boy Lucas Paqueta, who gives them plenty of options": "\n\nBRAZIL did full justice to their status as World Cup favourites on Friday when they swept aside Ghana in fine style in a magnificent first half to win 3-0.\n\nIt was a match where they unveiled Plan C; this Brazil side can now switch between three different formations, a process which showcases the versatility of recent West Ham signing Lucas Paqueta.\n\n2 Lucas Paqueta offers Brazil versatility Credit: Rex\n\nThe main formation features two wingers - Raphinha on the right and Vinicius Junior on the left, with Neymar floating as a false nine and Paqueta operating in his most natural position of an attacking midfielder.\n\nThe system of play has done Brazil proud since losing the final of the Copa America to Argentina last year.\n\nOne of the stand outs has been the easy understanding between Neymar and Paqueta through the middle of the field.\n\nThe first alternative is to include a centre forward, most likely recent Tottenham signing Richarlison.\n\nIn this case one of the wingers misses out - probably Vinicius, though this would be a very big call in the World Cup, and Paqueta instead plays from the left flank.\n\nHe lacks the extreme pace of a winger, and so is more likely to cut infield, where, once again, his relationship with Neymar is key to the team’s attacking construction.\n\nThis is the way that Brazil may well line up in Tuesday’s friendly against Tunisia, their last warm up before facing Serbia, Switzerland and Cameroon in Qatar.\n\nBut what if they want two wingers, a centre forward and Neymar?\n\nHOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL\n\nThis was the question that coach Tite answered against Ghana on Friday.\n\nLucas Paqueta then drops into a deeper midfield role, taking the place of Manchester United’s Fred.\n\nThis is not without risks. Paqueta is a creative player, who requires the freedom to take chances.\n\nOperating in this role there is always the chance that he will give the ball away too close to the Brazil goal.\n\nBut, as West Ham fans have already seen, he is not a luxury player.\n\nDefensive duties may not be the most natural side to his game, but he is fully prepared to put in a shift - and, as was clear against Ghana, starting deeper does not inhibit his ability to rumble forward as an element of surprise.\n\nThe ultra-attacking formation that Brazil tried on Friday worked because the whole team put in a shift, pressing hard to win back possession as soon as they had lost the ball and effectively making sure that almost the entire first forty minutes took place in the Ghana half.\n\nIt is hard to sustain such intensity for the full ninety minutes, but this is a system that Brazil have now added to their repertoire.\n\nThree formations and three different functions for Paqueta - and he has a fourth string to his bow. He can also play at centre forward.\n\n2 West Ham fans will be delighted with the ability of Paqueta Credit: Getty\n\nThere have been times for Brazil when he has carried out three different functions in the same game.\n\nIt might take time for all of these virtues to become apparent at West Ham.\n\nPaqueta is essentially a combinations player, and will need to get on the same wavelength as his new team-mates.\n\nBut David Moyes must surely be excited by the chance to work with a player of such talent and versatility.",

Given we had the first LatAm Tech Week here in Brazil with several events, high quality content and intense networking - I will start out with the usual market overview but then jump to a description of everything that happened. The news and deals of the week will be consolidated at the end, instead of doing on a day by day basis. Hope you like it!\n\nDespite the global tech market correction, recent political transitions, rising internet adoption and a growing pool of tech talent are causing a surge of private market activity in Latin America. This week, Pitchbook & Intralinks released a new market brief called Private Investment in LATAM: An Emerging Market's Response To Global Headwinds. It is no news that VC activity skyrocketed globally last year. Latin America was no exception, with deal value more than tripling YoY. Several high profile investment firms are turning to the region, as other emerging markets (such as China) become more challenging to invest. LatAm startups are grasping the attention of global investors, with 2022 having the highest cross-border deal value from non-Latin American investors year-to-date (YTD) than any year prior to 2021. Although it is highly unlikely that venture dealmaking will match the unprecedented levels generated in 2021, there are still a lot of deals happening in the region with investment sentiment becoming “cautiously optimistic”. The region faces significant challenges in the near term (such as Brazil’s upcoming elections); however, the development of its tech ecosystem is a positive signal for investment activity and investors will continue to seek opportunities in this emerging market.\n\nSpeaking of Brazil, Sling Hub & VC Fellows released their new Startup Index. Using the Sling Hub Platform intel, they gathered 3.7 million pieces of data from the Brazilian innovation market and calculated the relative weight of each of these variables. The result is a robust statistical measure that tracks the ecosystem's evolution, enables quick analysis, and helps to predict trends. The image below shows how the index evolved through time. If you want to understand more on the weights of the different variables, and some conclusions drawn from the calculation, go to the link above and download the August 2022 Report.\n\nOn to a less optimistic view, Pitchbook also released its Q3 2022 report on Down Rounds, Impacts, and Exit Opportunities. The decline in public markets has left many private startups with extended valuations and no exit opportunities in sight. VC investor advice shifted from growth at all costs to a focus on breakeven. However, just 6% of completed rounds in 2022 have been at lower valuations than the company’s previous investment, the majority of them occurring at the late stage. Analyzing historical data, companies taking on a down round often continue to grow. Only 13% of companies raising a down round from 2008 to 2014 were unable to raise a new round or exit immediately after the down valuation investment. Nearly 20% of post-down round exits occur via PE buyout, which is a significantly higher proportion than what is seen in the broader venture exit dataset. Nevertheless, as a natural mechanism of a market, down rounds remain unavoidable for some companies within VC. They will likely increase in years after significant market growth, but data shows that these rounds aren’t a contagion and are limited to a few companies within a certain market. I always end on a positive tone :)\n\nWomen’s Update: This week QED Investors, Canary and Itau BBA joined forces to host a Women Founders & Investors breakfast in Brazil. The result was a group of 60 women of different nationalities networking, exchaning experiences and lessons and showing that we are super important to the tech ecosystem!\n\nLatAm Tech Week:\n\nThe 2022 report was launched live (video in the link above) during Canary’s and Atlantico’s Tech Summit.

    "How Latin Grammy-nominated Brazilian artist Gabeu turns sertanejo into queernejo : NPR": "Challenging traditional sertanejo, Brazil's Gabeu creates space for queer love songs\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pedro Nekoi for NPR Pedro Nekoi for NPR\n\nIn celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, NPR Music is spotlighting a series of artists across Latin America who are engaging with their musical heritage in unique ways. From reworking conservative genres for new eras, to teasing out modern sounds from old-school instruments, these artists represent the wide range of experimentation that makes up contemporary Latin music.\n\nIn certain parts of Brazil, it's nearly impossible to escape the sound of sertanejo. Deep in the countryside, in the small towns that line soybean farms and endless stretches of land, you won't find bikinis, coconut water or samba for miles. This is the land of country music and cowboy hats. \"It doesn't matter where you are — every dive bar or restaurant will be playing it,\" says singer Gabeu, who grew up in Franca, a small city in the state of São Paulo. \"That or a duo will be performing sertanejo songs live.\"\n\nMelding elements of rock, pop and forró, the melodic genre is often touted as Brazil's alternative to American country music. But it's also more complicated than that. \"Unlike country, sertanejo is distinctly Latin American,\" says Gabeu, speaking via Zoom from his living room couch in São Paulo. \"It draws inspiration from Paraguayan genres [such as the guaranía or the polka], for example. Maybe that's why it's hard to fully explain what it is.\" What is certain, however, is that it is the biggest genre in the country. Consistently topping the national charts, sertanejo is an increasingly popular — and lucrative — industry. Last year, 60% of the top hits played on Brazilian radio fell under the genre.\n\nPart of what makes the genre so successful is that its artists are decidedly earnest. It's common in sertanejo for lovelorn musicians to sing about longing and heartbreak — experiences people often relate to. But not everyone can see themselves in these stories. Growing up, Gabeu, the son of well-known sertanejo artist Solimões, could never relate to the straight, heteronormative ballads around him. So on his 2021 debut album AGROPOC, which earned a Latin Grammy nomination this year for best sertaneja music album, he set out to change that by singing about finding queer love in the country's largely conservative heartland. Part of a new scene called \"queernejo,\" Gabeu, 24, is among a group of artists leading the charge in the creation of a new kind of sertanejo — one which carves out space for more than one kind of love story.\n\nThat starts with flipping the image of the macho cowboy on its head. For as long as Gabeu can remember, sertanejo singers have been straight. And while they may no longer look exactly like they did in the '90s — women, for example, now hold an increasingly larger stake in the genre — conventional gender stereotypes and heteronormativity still loom large. \"These days the look can feel more modern for men, it's more polo shirts and jeans, less traditional\" says Gabeu. \"Maybe a cowboy hat or a big belt buckle once in a while.\" But, at its core, the genre's relationship with traditional gender dynamics and aesthetics has largely stayed the same, he explains.\n\nGabeu started feeling like the odd one out in his city when he was a teenager. The longer he spent at sertanejo shows and drinking in the barzinhos around town, the more he realized these spaces weren't meant for him. \"I was beginning to understand my sexuality and just couldn't see myself in any of it,\" says Gabeu, running a hand through his short, flame-colored hair. \"That's when I started listening to American pop.\" Finding Lady Gaga helped. \"I loved all the divas, but she was the main one for me,\" he adds with a laugh. \"At one point, I really was that annoying fan.\"\n\nMoving away from Franca to study film in São Paulo was another turning point. \"While I was there, I started getting to know queer artists who were daring to try their hand at genres that weren't pop: people from working class neighborhoods that made hip-hop, queer musicians from the northeast making brega funk,\" an energetic style of dance music born in Recife, Brazil. It soon became clear that if they could do it, he could do it too.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe way Gabeu sees it, sertanejo has a lot to gain from mingling with other genres, from pop to American country to tecno brega. \"I wanted AGROPOC to be playful,\" he says. \"Every song points in a different direction.\" Lyrically, Gabeu's strength lies in his ability to craft evocative scenes out of personal experience — a characteristic shared by the best sertanejos. \"How much longer do we have to love in the dark?\" he asks in the track \"Amor Rural\" over a jangly guitar lick. \"Every piece of this farm is hiding the truth.\"\n\nAGROPOC opens with a fake radio message broadcast in an imaginary world. \"This is AGROPOC, the most popular sertanejo radio station in the country,\" says Gabeu in the first track. It's wishful thinking, he tells me, but not necessarily impossible. In 2020, Gabeu and non-binary sertanejo artist Gali Galó launched the country's first queernejo music festival, Fivela Fest. Bringing together live performances and talks, it sought to introduce the genre to a wider audience. \"People like Alice Marcone, Reddy Allor and Zerzil performed,\" says Gabeu. \"It wasn't hugely popular, but we managed to reach our audience.\"\n\nFor Gabeu, it's impossible to separate the onset of queernejo from Brazil's broader political situation. Over the course of the past four years, a remarkable number of sertanejo artists have spoken out in favor of Brazil's far-right, anti-LGBTQ+ President Jair Bolsonaro. \"That really messed with me,\" says Gabeu.\n\nIt was also about what the president represented to Gabeu. \"I remember having a horrible experience around the time Bolsonaro was elected at a Shania Twain concert in Barretos.\" During the show, Twain invited a gay couple onto the stage and one of them proposed. \"I've never heard so much booing in my life,\" the artist says.\n\nIn some ways, the genre's support for the president is still ongoing. In 2018, leading artist Gusttavo Lima declared his support for the president in a video in which he is seen shooting a rifle. Ahead of the presidential election on Oct. 2, the duo Mateus e Cristiano launched a jingle for Bolsonaro's campaign.\n\nStill, the scene is changing. \"In some ways, queernejo was born out of this gigantic need to redefine the genre's relationship with Bolsonarismo,\" says Gabeu. \"It's also why we try to reclaim symbols too, even when it might seem like we're leaning on stereotypes: I want people to look at a cowboy hat and not see a Bolsonaro supporter.\"\n\nThis feels like a distant reality, but recent strides made by queer country artists in North America such as Orville Peck, whose song \"Dead of Night\" scored a highly-discussed scene in the HBO hit series Euphoria this year, make him hopeful. For Gabeu, there's no reason queernejo can't enter the Brazilian mainstream in the same way one day.\n\nFor now, however, his focus is reaching queer Brazilians who, like him, grew up thinking sertanejo wasn't for them. \"There are so many people in the LGBTQ+ community living in the countryside,\" he says. \"How crazy is it to think that this is the first time they've been able to see and hear themselves in the genre?\" It's no surprise many might feel inclined to change the radio station when sertanejo plays. But, if they hear a queernejo song instead, they might be inclined to keep listening.\n\nCarolina Abbott Galvão is a researcher at Monocle magazine.

    "Messi's best Argentina side? Super-charged Brazil? South America's World Cup-bound teams in action": "South America's four World Cup-bound squads -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador -- were in all in action on Friday as they prepare for Qatar. While Brazil and Argentina had looked the part of tournament favourites, Uruguay and Ecuador continue to be works in progress.\n\nTaking into account their performances, we answer a key question for each CONMEBOL side as their preparation for the game's biggest stage continues.\n\nAre we prepared for a super-attacking Brazil?\n\nBrazil coach Tite already has a Plan A and a Plan B -- and in an exhilarating first half against Ghana in Le Havre, France, he unleashed an ultra-attacking Plan C, which probably worked even better than he had hoped.\n\nOver the past year, his team have grown accustomed to playing with two wingers -- usually Raphinha on the right and Vinicius Junior on the left, with Neymar floating as a false nine, linking up with attacking midfielder Lucas Paqueta. The variation has been to include Richarlison as a centre forward, dropping one of the wingers and using Paqueta cutting in from one of the flanks.\n\nBut what if there was a way to have both a centre forward and two wingers? Now there is. This time Paqueta fills the role of Fred, dropping deeper to play from central midfield. With him to the right of Casemiro and Neymar to the left, there is room for a front three ahead of them. It means that Paqueta has to put in a defensive shift, but so does everyone. As soon as they lose possession, Brazil press collectively to win it back.\n\nGhana found it hard to work up any rhythm, and the few times they managed to beat the press, the imperious Marquinhos was on hand to use his pace and awareness to snuff out the danger. Brazil were on their way to the 3-0 win -- and could have been more -- at the end of a first half that, against respectable opponents, was almost absurdly one-sided. Brazil's collection of attacking talent passed holes in Ghana's 4-1-4-1 formation, and front-loading the team did not leave the team looking vulnerable.\n\nThis new formation will not work for all situations against all opponents. But it is an option that Brazil have added to their repertoire -- one that will surely send a shiver down their World Cup rivals.\n\nIs this Messi's best Argentina side?\n\nOn its own, Argentina's 3-0 win over this Honduras side hardly qualifies anyone for greatness. But 34 games unbeaten tells its own story. And what was striking was the utterly predictable nature of the Argentine triumph in Miami.\n\nHonduras brought back memories of an outclassed boxer coming up against Muhammad Ali in his prime. They never came close to laying a glove on Argentina, while all night their heads were being snapped back as, patiently and with purpose, Argentina jabbed away, pulling them out of position and setting them up for the big punch. Some might recall the 2006 side, eliminated on penalties by Germany in the quarterfinal, while a teenage Lionel Messi sat on the substitutes bench, unable to do anything about it.\n\nThat team revolved around playmaker Juan Román Riquelme. The focus of this team is a little higher up the field. With that midfield trio -- Leandro Paredes playing the first pass forward with quality, Rodrigo De Paul adding drive and changes of rhythm and Giovani Lo Celso stroking the ball around with rare precision -- Messi is brought into the game closer to the opposing goal, in a zone of the field from where he can do something to unlock the opposing defence.\n\nFor much of his previous time in the national team, Argentina were a shambles. Plan A was to give the ball to Messi and hope. Plan B was to give the ball to Messi and hope. And there was no Plan C. Not now. This is a side with an almost hypnotic quality about its possession-based game -- they took the match away from Honduras in the first 15 minutes. It is a team that functions, and one which, in his fifth World Cup, might even give Messi his best chance of winning the competition.\n\nWill Diego Alonso's first loss unsettle Uruguay?\n\nSince taking over as Uruguay coach at the end of last year, Diego Alonso had only known victory, plus a goalless draw against the United States in a June friendly when he fielded a reserve side. He has now tasted defeat after his side lost 1-0 to Iran in Vienna on Friday. As he said after the game, there are no grounds for despair but he does have food for thought.\n\nAgainst an opponent who dropped back deep and looked for the counterattack, Uruguay defended well enough with a couple of centre-backs who were making their debuts -- an injury crisis in the position that got worse when Ronald Araujo limped off in the opening minute. There were clear advantages in fielding a pair of full-backs who could push forward -- it allowed the wide men in the 4-3-3 system to get into the penalty area. This was especially important for Darwin Nunez, whose lack of an effective left foot was a problem when he was out on that flank. Nunez is surely more of a threat as a centre forward, and if there is only space for one in the team the Alonso could have a big decision to take.\n\nLuis Suarez looked well short of his best and missed some of the team's clearest chances. Uruguay ended up playing 4-4-2 with both Nunez and Suarez -- a switch which, at the other end, may have cost them the game (Edinson Cavani is not with the squad as he settles in with new side Valencia). Uruguay played most of the match with a trio in the centre of midfield, Matias Vecino holding while Rodrigo Bentancur and Federico Valverde looked for space between the Iranian lines.\n\nFor the last 20 minutes, Vecino was sacrificed as Alonso changed his system -- and the only goal of the game soon followed, the move originating in the space that Vecino was no longer protecting. Uruguay are surely at their best with three in the middle, which does not make it easy for Alonso to squeeze in all of his attacking talent.\n\nWhere will Ecuador's goals come from in Qatar?\n\nCoaches are always pleased with clean sheets, so after three games without conceding in June, Ecuador boss Gustavo Alfaro could take some comfort from a 0-0 draw with Saudi Arabia in the Spanish town of Murcia. But the lack of goals at the other end was a disappointment to the region's sizeable Ecuadorian community and a cause for concern for the coach. True, his team have now gone four games without conceding -- although Japan on Tuesday promise to provide a stiffer test.\n\nBut in these four matches, Ecuador have only found the back of the net twice. There were times in qualification when Ecuador were a free scoring side, but the goals have dried up. Alfaro could perhaps take some comfort from the way that his men created chances in different ways against the Saudis -- thrusts of Gonzalo Plata from the right, crosses of Pervis Estupinan from the left, through aggressive pressing in midfield, from set pieces played into the box or long balls over the top of the defence.\n\nBut the team lacks a cutting edge. Ecuador 's all-time top scorer is the veteran Enner Valencia. He is probably happier cutting in from the left than operating through the middle, as he did in this game. And his goals tend to come in spurts. Alfaro has had a look at options in the centre forward position, but probably can do no better than the rangy Michael Estrada, the side's top scorer in qualification, who came off the bench against the Saudis but is surely the favourite to lead the line in Qatar. All but one of his six goals came in the first half of the qualifiers, and Ecuador need him to rediscover his best form.",
    "The Most Important Election in the Americas Is in Brazil": "Former Brazilian President Luíz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula) runs about on stage at the Latin America Memorial in São Paulo. He was there on August 22, 2022, speaking at a book launch featuring photographs by Ricardo Stuckert about Lula’s trips around the world when he was the president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010. Lula is a man with a great deal of energy. He recounts the story of when he was in Iran with his Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in 2010, trying to mediate and end the conflict imposed by the United States over Iran’s nuclear energy policy. Lula managed to secure a nuclear deal in 2010 that would have prevented the ongoing pressure campaign that Washington is conducting against Tehran. There was relief in the air. Then, Lula said, “Obama pissed outside the pot.” According to Lula, then-U.S. President Barack Obama did not accept the deal and crushed the hard work of the Brazilian leadership in bringing all sides to an agreement.\n\nLula’s story puts two important points on the table: he was able to build on Brazil’s role in Latin America by offering leadership in far-off Iran during his previous tenure as president, and he is not afraid of expressing his antipathy for the way the United States is scuttling the possibility of peace and progress across the world for its own narrow interests.\n\nThe book release took place during Lula’s campaign for president against the current incumbent—and deeply unpopular—President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula is now in the lead in the polls ahead of the first round of Brazil’s presidential election to be held on October 2.\n\nFernando Haddad, who ran against Bolsonaro in 2018 and lost after receiving less than 45 percent of the vote, told me that this election remains “risky.” The polls might show that Lula is in the lead, but Bolsonaro is known to play dirty politics to secure his victory. The far right in Brazil, like the far right in many other countries, is fierce in the way it contests for state power. Bolsonaro, Haddad said, is willing to lie openly, saying offensive things to the far-right media and then when challenged about it by the mainstream media, he tends to feign ignorance. “Fake news” seems to be Bolsonaro’s best defense each time he is attacked. The left is far more sincere in its political discourse; leftists are unwilling to lie and eager to bring the issues of hunger and unemployment, social despair and social advancement to the center of the political debate. But there is less interest in these issues and less noise about them in a media landscape that thrives on the theatrics of Bolsonaro and his followers. The old traditional right is as outflanked as the far right in Brazil, which is a space that is now commanded by Bolsonaro (the old traditional right, the men in dark suits who made decisions over cigars and cachaça, are unable to supplant Bolsonaro).\n\nBoth Bolsonaro and Lula face an electorate that either loves them or hates them. There is little room for ambiguity in this race. Bolsonaro represents not only the far right, whose opinions he openly champions, but he also represents large sections of the middle class, whose aspirations for wealth remain largely intact despite the reality that their economic situation has deteriorated over the past decade. The contrast between the behavior of Bolsonaro and Lula during their respective presidential campaigns has been stark: Bolsonaro has been boorish and vulgar, while Lula is refined and presidential. If the election goes to Lula, it is likely that he will get more votes from those who hate Bolsonaro than from those who love him.\n\nFormer Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is reflective on the way forward. She told me that Lula will likely prevail in the election because the country is fed up with Bolsonaro. His horrible management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the deterioration of the economic situation in the country mark Bolsonaro as an inefficient manager of the Brazilian state. However, Rousseff pointed out that about a month before the election, Bolsonaro’s government—and the regional governments—have been rolling out policies that have started to lighten the burden on the middle class, such as the lifting of taxation on gasoline. These policies could sway some people to vote for Bolsonaro, but even that is not likely. The political situation in Brazil remains fragile for the left, with the main blocs on the right (agro-business, religion and the military) willing to use any means to maintain their hold on power; it was this right-wing coalition that conducted a “legislative coup” against Rousseff in 2016 and used “lawfare,” the use of law for political motives, against Lula in 2018 to prevent him from running against Bolsonaro. These phrases (legislative coup and lawfare) are now part of the vocabulary of the Brazilian left, which understands clearly that the right bloc (what is called centrão) will not stop pursuing their interests if they feel threatened.\n\nJoão Paulo Rodrigues, a leader of the Landless Workers Movement (MST) is a close adviser to the Lula campaign. He told me that in the 2002 presidential election, Lula won against the incumbent Fernando Henrique Cardoso because of an immense hatred for the neoliberal policies that Cardoso had championed. The left was fragmented and demoralized at that time of the election. Lula’s time in office, however, helped the left mobilize and organize, although even during this period the focus of popular attention was more on Lula himself rather than the blocs that comprised the left. During Lula’s incarceration on corruption charges, which the left says are fraudulent, he became a figure that unified the left: Lula Livre, “Free Lula,” was the unifying slogan, and the letter L (for Lula) became a symbol (a symbol that continues to be used in the election campaign). While there are other candidates from Brazil’s left in the presidential race, there is no question for Rodrigues that Lula is the left’s standard-bearer and is the only hope for Brazil to oust the highly divisive and dangerous leadership of President Bolsonaro. One of the mechanisms to build the unity of popular forces around Lula’s campaign has been the creation of the Popular Committees (comités populares), which have been working to both unify the left and create an agenda for the Lula government (which will include agrarian reform and a more robust policy for the Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian communities).\n\nThe international conditions for a third Lula presidency are fortuitous, Rousseff told me. A wide range of center-left governments have come to power in Latin America (including in Chile and Colombia). While these are not socialist governments, they are nonetheless committed to building the sovereignty of their countries and to creating a dignified life for their citizens. Brazil, the third-largest country in the Americas (after Canada and the United States of America), can play a leadership role in guiding this new wave of left governments in the hemisphere, Rousseff said. Haddad told me that Brazil should lead a new regional project, which will include the creation of a regional currency (sur) that can not only be used for cross-border trade but also for holding reserves. Haddad is currently running to be the governor of São Paulo, whose main city is the financial capital of the country. Such a regional currency, Haddad believed, will settle conflicts in the hemisphere and build new trade linkages that need not rely on long supply chains that have been destabilized by the pandemic. “God willing, we will create a common currency in Latin America because we do not have to depend on the dollar,” said Lula in May 2022.\n\nRousseff is eager for Brazil to return to the world stage through the BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), and offer the kind of left leadership that Lula and she had given that platform a decade ago. The world, Rousseff said, needs such a platform to offer leadership that does not rely on threats, sanctions and war. Lula’s anecdote about the Iran deal is a telling one since it shows that a country like Brazil under the leadership of the left is more willing to settle conflicts rather than to exacerbate them, as the United States did. There is hope, Rousseff noted, for a Lula presidency to offer robust leadership for a world that seems to be crumbling due to the myriad challenges such as climate catastrophe, warfare and social toxicity.\n\nVijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor and journalist.
