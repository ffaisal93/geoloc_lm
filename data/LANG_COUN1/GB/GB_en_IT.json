    "Italy’s Salvini vows far-right alliance will last as Meloni heads for power": "Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League, has promised that his alliance with Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy will deliver a long-lasting government, as Italians begin to digest the outcome of an election that will bring about the country’s most rightwing government since the end of the second world war.\n\nFinal results gave the coalition control of both houses of parliament with 44% of the vote and confirmed a swing in the balance of power in the Italian far right towards Meloni as her party made spectacular gains in the League’s northern strongholds of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.\n\nMeloni is expected to be given a mandate from the president, Sergio Mattarella, to form a government after 13 October, meaning she could take office by the end of next month.\n\nBrothers of Italy, a party with neo-fascist origins, scored 26% of the vote, while the League took 9%, an abysmal result for a party that in 2019 was polling at almost 40%. The third member of the coalition is Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.\n\nThe outcome nonetheless makes Salvini, who enacted tough anti-migrant measures during his stint as interior minister in 2018-19, a key protagonist in a government that will be hostile towards immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and women seeking to access safe abortions.\n\n“There is a lot to be worried about, as for Meloni to respond to her electorate she will maintain her promises on things that will hit the weakest communities hard, such as immigrants,” said Paolo Branchesi, an activist for Refugees Welcome.\n\nEarly in the election campaign, Meloni called for the navy to turn migrants back to Africa, while Salvini, eager to return to the interior ministry, said last week that he “can’t wait” to resume a policy of blocking migrant rescue ships from entering Italian ports.\n\n“They will bring many difficulties for migrants – in the phase of their migration and the conditions they find upon arrival in Italy,” Branchesi said.\n\nThe League and Brothers of Italy blocked a law in parliament last year that would have criminalised homophobia, arguing that it would have eroded freedom of speech. Meloni and Salvini have repeatedly made it clear that they are against gay adoption and surrogacy.\n\n“We are facing an extreme right that is really worrying, especially if you look at their closeness with Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, Poland and Russia,” said Mario Colamarino, the president of the Mario Mieli Circle of Homosexual Culture. “We need to be better, more vigilant and unite against this nationalism and to protect civil rights. Meloni is not a phenomenon built in a day but a dark cloud that has been hovering over us these last 10 years, and now she’s in power.”\n\nGiven that Meloni, 45, is calling the shots in the coalition, one of the biggest threats to the stability of her government could come from Salvini, a political chameleon who will not only have to renounce his desire to become prime minister but could be stopped from returning to the interior ministry.\n\n“He is arrogant, and you never know if what he says today he will repeat tomorrow,” said Sofia Ventura, a politics professor at the University of Bologna. “It will be a difficult relationship, but they need to stay in power, and so maybe their negotiations will be contained.”\n\nLuisa Rizzitelli, a spokesperson for Rebel Network, a women’s group, said she was more angry with the leftwing alliance led by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) over its lacklustre campaign and failure to come up with a strong enough opposition to the right. The PD leader, Enrico Letta, said on Monday that he would step down at the party’s next congress, which he said would be held soon.\n\n“It’s shocking for me that we’ve once again managed to vote for a political formation that doesn’t take a distance from those who deny human rights, like the Vox party [in Spain] and Orbán,” Rizzitelli said.\n\n“But if you analyse it from the Italian political reality, it’s not so surprising because the PD is so far removed from civil society, and has distanced itself so much from part of a population that needed another response. Italy is not only made up of a cultural elite that sides with the PD, but of ordinary working people who more easily understood what Meloni had to offer.”",
    "Italy veers right and away from EU’s centre of power": "This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter, exceptionally free to read today. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday and Saturday morning\n\nGood morning and welcome to Europe Express.\n\nItalians followed Giorgia Meloni’s advice and made history at the polls yesterday, securing her rightwing bloc a comfortable victory of more than 40 per cent of the total vote. While waiting for the final result, which will define the balance of power within the ruling coalition, we’ll look at how Meloni’s relationship with the EU is shaping up in comparison with that of her predecessor, Mario Draghi.\n\nOver the weekend, EU ambassadors held their group “confessionals” with European Commission officials testing the red lines, wish lists and possible landing zones for a new round of Russia sanctions. The centrepiece of this package was thought to be a price cap on Russian oil, in line with G7 plans, but diplomats are now uncertain that the legal text will be ready this week.\n\nEqually uncertain is the outcome of Friday’s extraordinary energy council, even though it is seen as the last chance to come up with solutions to the energy crisis in time for the heating season. We’ll bring you the latest on the REPowerEU funding quarrels.\n\nAnd later today, agriculture ministers are having their own showdown about pesticides, with eastern member states demanding extra studies that will take into account the war and this summer’s drought.\n\nUpheaval in Italy\n\nFor anyone who had any doubts left, yesterday’s Italian election confirmed that Giorgia Meloni is the complete opposite of her predecessor Mario Draghi. A worsening relationship with the EU is likely to be one of the results, write Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan and Valentina Pop in Brussels.\n\nExit polls put Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party ahead at 22-26 per cent of the vote, compared with only four per cent at the last election in 2018. When counted together with the other rightwing parties, Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini’s League party, Meloni’s coalition is expected to secure between 42 and 49 per cent of the total vote.\n\nLong gone are the days when Draghi shaped the bloc’s response to the Russian aggression, having US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen on speed dial or co-authoring op-eds with France’s Emmanuel Macron.\n\nInstead, an early glimpse of Italy’s diminished role on the EU stage was offered late last week in a question-and-answer session at Princeton University, when EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen put Rome in the same basket with Budapest and Warsaw.\n\n“If things go in a difficult direction,” she said when asked about the Italian elections, “I’ve spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools”. This was a reference to the rule of law disputes and funding freezes that both countries have experienced.\n\nThis sparked outrage in Rome, particularly in the rightwing camp, and online in the MIGA (“Make Italy Great Again”) circles, where von der Leyen was accused of interfering in the election. ​​Salvini, leader of the rightwing League party, said that von der Leyen should either apologise or resign for “threatening a sovereign country on the eve of an election”.\n\nMeloni herself was more measured, saying: “I don’t think she referred specifically to Italy, or it would be an unprecedented interference,” though she did point to the risk of the commission losing credibility.\n\nBut the ultimate proof that Meloni, who doubles as the president of the European Conservatives and Reformists party that includes Poland’s ruling party, Law and Justice (but not Hungary’s Fidesz), is the antithesis of the soft-spoken, apolitical central banker, came yesterday. Given that campaigning was banned on election day, 45-year-old Meloni took to TikTok and Instagram, where she posed with two cantaloupes (Meloni in Italian means melons, but is also slang for breasts), winking and saying “25 September, I said everything”. Draghi she most definitely is not.\n\nChart du jour: IMF record\n\nThe IMF’s lending to troubled countries has hit a record high, amid simultaneous crises that have pushed at least five countries into default — with more expected to follow.\n\nLast chance council\n\nWith the winter “heating season” fast approaching, the stakes at Friday’s emergency energy council could not be higher: if ministers fail to come to an agreement, action may materialise too late to help consumers and businesses on the brink, writes Alice Hancock in Brussels.\n\nRevisions by member states to the commission’s plan to bring down energy prices leave more wriggle room for national plans, according to the latest draft seen by Europe Express. EU governments can decide not to implement the so-called “solidarity contribution” on oil and gas-fired power plants if they already have a similar measure in place.\n\nWhen it comes to the revenue cap on non-gas power generators, allowances have been made for coal, which has become an important source of energy for Germany and eastern European states as they have been steadily cut off from Russian gas.\n\nBut the EU is already falling well behind on its existing scheme for overhauling the bloc’s energy sector — namely the REPowerEU plan, announced in May.\n\nHuge REPowerEU banners were unfurled over the commission’s headquarters last week (replacing the NextGenerationEU advertising for post-pandemic recovery funding). But implementing the measures is proving much harder than giving an advertising company more work.\n\nThe EU commission’s headquarters were redecorated last week to signal a shift in priorities © Valentina Pop\n\nOne key question is where find the €210bn to fund REPowerEU as member states continue wrangle over it. An original plan to fund €20bn of REPower through selling permits that cover carbon emissions (pushing down the cost of polluting) has caused outcry among climate conscious member states.\n\nA revised proposal by the Czech EU council presidency, seen by Europe Express, suggests that part of that €20bn should come from selling extra emissions allowances but part should also come from the EU’s innovation fund, which is meant to put money towards low-carbon technologies.\n\nUnofficially the Czechs have suggested 80 per cent could come from the innovation fund and the remaining fifth from the emissions permits, according to two EU diplomats.\n\nBut “too large a group for the presidency to ignore” is against using the reserve emissions allowances in the format currently suggested, one of the diplomats said. The other said more than 20 countries were in favour of using part of the innovation fund.\n\nThe document also proposes a revision of the way that the overall money — which otherwise comes from leftover recovery and resilience funds set up during the pandemic — is allocated.\n\nUnder the original legislation, financing would be granted on the basis of how badly a member state had suffered economically during the pandemic. This meant that although Germany received about half of its gas from Russia, it would only receive about 8 per cent of the Covid recovery funding.\n\nThe Czechs have instead suggested an allocation based on a calculation that includes the share of fossil fuels in energy consumption, which would favour Germany but leave Italy, Spain and other southern European states out of pocket. Given the conflicting interests, finding a compromise solution will be quite an achievement.\n\nFans of pesticides\n\nMember states opposed to an EU crackdown on pesticides will launch a fresh assault on the proposal at today’s agriculture council, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.\n\nA draft regulation on “sustainable use” of pesticides under discussion seeks to reduce the chemicals by half across the bloc by 2030. But a group of 10 member states are demanding a fresh impact assessment for the proposal.\n\nThe countries, mostly eastern members including Poland and Romania, say the commission’s original assessment predates the war in Ukraine and the drought this summer, which has reduced food supply and increased prices.\n\nAccording to their position paper seen by Europe Express, they want a fresh analysis of:\n\nthe impact on food production in the EU\n\nthe increased dependence on food imports\n\nthe reduction of the EU’s resilience to crisis events disrupting supply chains, such as war in Ukraine, the pandemic or the severe drought\n\nthe impact of banning any use of plant protection products in sensitive areas like parks and nature reserves\n\nthe impact of phasing out some active substances categorised as “harmful” given the lack of alternatives\n\nthe differences in climate, crops and pests between member states\n\nThe policy paper criticises the decision to measure pesticide by kilogrammes per hectare rather than toxicity levels. Organic farmers use natural substances that are less damaging, but sprayed in larger quantities.\n\nAn EU official said there was no procedure to revisit an impact assessment so the real motive might be to torpedo the proposal altogether. Its passage through the council of member states has already been slowed and will stretch at least into next year.\n\n“We have a common goal of the reduction of inputs [such as pesticides]. But we are facing a difficult situation. We need to find a balanced approach between reduction and production,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nWhat to watch today\n\nECB chief Christine Lagarde speaks in the European parliament Agriculture ministers meet their Ukrainian counterpart in Brussels European parliament presents candidates for Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\n. . . and later this week\n\nVoting in the so-called referendums organised in the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia ends tomorrow Economy ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the single market emergency instrument on Thursday Energy ministers meet for another emergency council on Friday\n\nNotable, Quotable\n\nWe have communicated directly, privately at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia\n\nNuclear contingencies: US and its allies are increasing their nuclear vigilance and deterrence, even as western officials believe that Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats are unlikely to materialise.\n\nLNG für Deutschland: The United Arab Emirates has agreed a deal to supply liquefied natural gas to Germany during a visit by chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is seeking to drum up alternatives to Russian energy.\n\nFT webinar: Italy’s 2022 election\n\nJoin FT correspondents and guests tomorrow (1-2pm UK) for a subscriber-only virtual briefing on the Italian election results and what’s in store for Italy and Europe.

    "Italian lawyer vows to fight gender-segregated electoral voting queues": "A lawyer has pledged to fight in court a decades-old Italian election law that in widespread implementation on Sunday led to thousands of voters, including trans people, being forced into gender-segregated queues.\n\nHundreds of LGTBQ+ activists denounced discrimination at polling stations in Sunday’s general election. Many told of their experiences on social media, citing how the binary queues failed to consider the “complexity of thousands of voters in Italy whose identity cards do not reflect their gender” and forced them to publicly identify themselves as trans people.\n\n“Gender-segregated queues are a violation of privacy of all those who are making a gender transition,” said Cathy La Torre, an LGTBQ+ activist and lawyer. “Enough is enough. I am not a trans person and I cannot sue the state for violating my privacy, but I am a lawyer and I can launch a battle to change this law.”\n\nVoting procedures in Italy are regulated by a law dating front 1967 that allows for the infrequently implemented separation into men-only and women-only queues at polling stations and states that electoral lists must also be divided by gender. The law, which has never been repealed, also provides for a married woman to be identified at a polling station with her husband’s surname.\n\nLa Torre said she asked her polling station to make an official record in their minutes of her belief that the “subdivision in lists of men and women is a violation of privacy rights and personal dignity”, but while the police accepted her request, one ballot counter insulted her by calling her “crazy” in front of other voters. La Torre has sued him for defamation.\n\nCathy La Torre attending the 79th Venice International Film Festival in September Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty Images\n\n“Thousands of trans people are forced to stand in a queue different from their gender and therefore forced to let everyone present know that they are trans people,” La Torre said. “And if you ask the authorities why, the answer is always the same: it has always been like this. And for those who tell me that these are trifles, I say feeling humiliated is never a trifle.”\n\nLa Torre said her goal was to take the case to the constitutional court and ask for the abrogation of the law. Italian trans people have previously campaigned against the 1967 law, and a petition to repeal the law was first launched in 2018.\n\nGender-segregated queues are not a regular feature of Italian elections and many on Sunday reported being asked to stand in them for the first time.\n\nElectoral authorities have not given an official explanation, but according to some sources, the decision to implement them was intended to better manage long queues at polling stations with waits of an hour or more to vote.\n\nMedia reports suggested the sluggishness was due to the “anti-tampering sticker”, a system devised to counter the possibility of switching the ballot while voting. The perforated and rectangular sticker has an alphanumeric code and is applied to a corner of the ballot. An authorised worker at the polling station removes it before inserting the ballot in the ballot box.",
    "The Italy That’s Revealed by Italians on Social Media": "Italy is, in part, a photographic invention, a mirage of tourist snaps and magazine spreads of decadent Venetian palazzi, sauvage Sardinian beaches, and almost pornographic closeups of creamy Roman carbonara. “Pictures from Italian Profiles,” a project born on Facebook and recently published as a book with the same title, shows us something different: what its creator, Stefano Frosini, refers to as “a marginal Italy,” moving beyond “the glossy rhetoric of the Belpaese that ends up cannibalizing all other possible narratives.”\n\nAs its title suggests, the project gathers images from the social-media profiles of Italians and, as the page’s following has grown, images submitted from photo albums and personal collections. The photos are selected by Frosini, a twenty-nine-year-old teacher from Pistoia, in Tuscany, for their strangeness or improbable beauty, for their absurdity or grotesqueness. These are photographs without pretensions, even “made in error or with no particular ambition,” Frosini told Emiliano Ceresi in an interview. He chose an English name for the group to avoid the impression that he was somehow guided by smug patriotism, and these pictures do more to satirize and complicate any national myths than to reinforce them.\n\nSome are obviously Italian self-mockery, like the tableau of the policeman taking a moment away from his official duties (or perhaps eminently fulfilling them) to lift up caution tape so that a woman and her child can carry home some pizzas, a rare shot that Frosini says was taken by a professional journalist—or the various pictures of babies with cigarettes in their hands (in one case, on the lap of a priest). Some are baffling, like an unforgettable picture of a man in a Spider-Man T-shirt, staring with feigned astonishment at the camera, next to a bed on which sit dozens of eggs. But many are Italian in a way that only grows more meaningful, and more nuanced, as you spend time in the untouristed places where most people actually live, and experience for yourself the christenings and funerals, the smell of the pine trees by the seaside, the eerie emptiness of the big cities on the Ferragosto holiday in mid-August, and everywhere the weight of the past. The pictures exhibit the earthiness of proverbs rather than the shiny facility of stereotypes.\n\nFrosini’s eye gravitates toward the kinds of pictures that his parents and grandparents used to look at in the lazy hours after a holiday meal. His page collects the stuff of family albums, anonymous yet vivid pictures of “school trips, New Year’s Eve parties, Easter Mondays, last-minute birthday parties, small town festivals,” the occasions at which, Frosini writes, “the person who takes pictures does so sincerely, renouncing the techniques of aesthetic sublimation that flatten his or her taste to a single norm, seen elsewhere and consciously reproduced.” Although Frosini’s project was made possible by social media, it is not quite of it.\n\nRather, “Pictures” revels in the kind of uninhibited sharing that took place in the early days of posting photos online, before every image became an act of self-fashioning. The pictures are marked by the carelessness of the disposable camera and, Frosini has said, an earlier era of digital photography, when it was easy and cheap to take hundreds of pictures, but before the scripts, postures, and carefully considered iconography of social media had solidified. Though all the photographs are anonymous, Frosini was drawn to the photography of digital non-natives, those people we all know who tend to overshare both online and in person, and who, in Italy, often flavor their language with dialect as they recount the forgotten story of some roguish uncle or a now entirely unfunny joke or an obscure local feud whose causes you just can't get straight.\n\nThere’s nostalgia in this approach, but also more than a dash of mockery: at first, Frosini would visit the comments section of online newspapers, find “the most extreme and caps-locked” comment, and look through the Facebook profile of the person who made it, “because language is always a good place to start,” he told Ceresi. (Frosini himself writes in a markedly careful, correct, and occasionally bookish Italian.) Though he rethought his methods when the group became popular, above all to insure the privacy of those portrayed, “Pictures” is not without its ugly moments, particularly in its portrayal of the elderly; sometimes, the total artlessness of a picture makes it seem as if we’re merely being invited to make fun of both the photographed and the photographer. But, at its best moments, “Pictures” is marked by the wit, the gentle pathos, and the stranger-than-fiction unexpectedness of Diane Arbus.\n\nAlthough the chronology of the book is wide, extending from the black-and-white era through the grainy early days of digital to the twenty-two-megapixel present, most of the pictures date from the nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, when Frosini was a little kid. (He was born in 1993.) Frosini might as well be the boy chowing down on some pasta in his messy bedroom while “Futurama” plays on TV, beneath a poster of the Azzurri, Italy’s national soccer team, with a box of ACE juice on the windowsill and a little Charizard decal on the side of his desk. Photos like these are “all abysses of our country’s collective nostalgia, objective correlatives of entire phases of youth,” Frosini has explained. He’s said that, at the beginning, he’d include a picture just because of “the marked resemblance of an unknown person with someone I knew,” and it could easily be one of his friends who, responding to a dare or just egged up on youth itself, flies from a swing past the crooked arm of a gnarled old tree, off into the future.\n\nA recurring preoccupation is the contrast of old age and youth—the defining social dynamic in Italy, where there are two elderly people for every child. In one unforgettable image, which sits near the center of Frosini’s printed collection, an elderly woman holds a PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy X on the table with both hands, a bemused expression on her face. In the background, a young girl—presumably her granddaughter—smiles and gives two thumbs up. In the hazy, washed-out Polaroid image, whose very coloration evokes a lost world, the old woman stares out from what feels like the deep past. She may well have no idea what she’s holding or why it’s important. The image is amusing in the way that the foibles of the elderly can be. But, at the same time, it’s ominous. In a country increasingly under the burden of its elderly, and where the eighty-five-year-old Silvio Berlusconi is vying for yet another term in national office, nostalgia can be mixed with fear, anger, frustration, and disgust.\n\nThe nonni of these pictures are sometimes charming but just as often grotesque; they often sit uneasily with the youth around them, and with the presumably youthful viewer. The bare-chested, white-haired man eating Bolognese for lunch doesn’t look like he’s saying anything particularly nice; the white tiles on the wall and floor, and the white door behind him, only bring out his red-flushed face and sunburned chest. In another photo, a slightly confused-looking old man, wearing his trilby indoors, sits and holds a handwritten note reading “non devi morire”—“you don’t have to die.” Frosini generally does not comment on the images he posts, and here this image, though perhaps funny at first glance, quickly slides into an uncomfortable ambiguity.",
    "The Italian Far Right Is About to Meet Italian Bureaucracy": "“They knew how to get things done—and we didn’t,” Fioramonti recalled. “They would be the ones writing the laws, changing the laws—they were the real doers.” He began to perceive this malign influence as a manina, or “little hand,” that would act under the auspices of his ministry without his own say. “There were bills and norms that were written that we were not even aware of,” he said. In the end, he was able to enact precisely none of the policies the party had campaigned on. He quit within four months.\n\nFioramonti rapidly discovered what happens to idealism in the Italian political establishment. Over the first weeks of government, he gradually became aware of a vast and entrenched technocratic civil servantry, mediated through an elaborate web of veteran chiefs of staff assigned to inexperienced new ministers. He watched helplessly as, slowly but surely, the bureaucrats overtook him, assuming direct responsibility for his own ambitious mandate. Each of his attempts to enact flagship policies was quietly amended, stalled, or killed.\n\nIt was 2019, and Lorenzo Fioramonti, the new Italian minister of education, had big plans and bold ideas. The Five Star Movement, an Italian political faction making waves with an almost impossibly broad brand of populism, had entered government the previous year with a far-reaching supposedly radical mandate. Fioramonti, a left-leaning political scientist, believed this was as good a chance as any to nurture the ailing Italian political system back to good health through courageous reform and the application of clear and honest principles.\n\nIt was 2019, and Lorenzo Fioramonti, the new Italian minister of education, had big plans and bold ideas.

In the end, he was able to enact precisely none of the policies the party had campaigned on. He quit within four months.\n\nFioramonti was somewhat rare among Five Star politicians in that he actually wanted to implement something. The country’s politics have generally become a superficial, hopeless affair, a competition among violinists to scratch out the loudest tune over the din of a sinking cruise ship.\n\nThis month’s Italian elections made for a timely case in point, pitting an alarming far-right alliance headed by Brothers of Italy, a party with deep fascist roots and a set of far-right policy proposals—which include defending Italy’s onerous blood citizenship laws and proposing an anti-immigrant “naval blockade” of the Mediterranean—against a bumbling and divided center-left.\n\nIn the Sept. 25 election, the Brothers of Italy-led alliance is projected to have secured 42.7 percent of the vote, and it will almost certainly form a government. But despite the prospect of the far right in power, the political mood felt pretty much the same as ever during the election period. Identitarian posturing trumped careful economic planning. Internal strife dominated headlines. Losers competed to see who could humiliate themselves the quickest via an alliance with the enemy. This year, it’s the right-wing League party allying itself with its rival Brothers of Italy; last election, it was the anti-establishment Five Star allying itself with the entire establishment.\n\nMeanwhile, though Brothers of Italy has a clear path to government, it will, as others have before it, quickly come to discover that its ideas are essentially impossible to implement—thanks to an entrenched civil servantry, an implacable economic status quo, and, inevitably, the likely reality that it never had any ideas in the first place.\n\nItaly has been effectively written off by its electorate as unchangeable—and it produces parties unwilling to even make the attempt. It’s not hard to see why. Since at least the 1970s, politicians have had to subordinate fiscal decisions to the will of international markets—first through the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, then through the European Central Bank, both of which demanded precise control over spending. Then, in the 1990s, widespread corruption scandals tainted the entire political class.\n\nThen there’s the power of the manina that Fioramonti referred to. In a widely read book published in 2020 called Io Sono il Potere (“I Am the Power”), an anonymous public official traced the roots of Italy’s civil servantry back to the late 19th century. Ever since then, he said, occupants of the powerful sinecures of state—including courts, universities, and political departments—have stood as the sole link between the political class and the massive bureaucracies they preside over.\n\nA large portion of Italian society is in thrall to ancient fonts of institutional power. Only in 2021, courts ordered homeowners in a Southern Italian town to shell out back pay to a baron who claimed ownership over what was still technically a “fief”; incredibly, the noble won the case using a legal precedent dating back to the Middle Ages.\n\nThis double whammy of deep disempowerment and stagnation has served to kill off faith in politicians—first in their competence, then in their virtue. Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the early League, founded in 1991, capitalized on this mid-1990s political apathy, producing what we see today: a ceaseless proliferation of half-baked parties that build their success on attacking corrupt elites, before the public lumps them into that category themselves. Political debate has steadily conformed to the diminishing scope of possibility, focusing on partisan, identitarian issues over economics.\n\nThe new parties keep coming, however, sustained only by the Italian public’s hatred for the old. Fioramonti, the disillusioned former Five Star minister, said that from this perpetually defeated national psyche springs a kind of misplaced optimism. “Italians’ nature is to believe in magic—the leader who’s going to get things done,” he said. “That means they’re way more way more prone to believing in these populist parties, and even though they fail, Italians are keen to keep voting for them.”\n\nThe exemplar of this doomed roundelay of political failure is Five Star itself, which after four painful years in office is now frozen out of government, having collapsed from a high of around 30 percent of the vote share to 16 percent today. Though many of its politicians have been ambitious and well-meaning, its general platform was always “populist” in the most superficial way possible—and it couldn’t be anything but.\n\nAs chronicled in investigative reporter Jacopo Iacoboni’s L’Esperimento, the movement debuted in the wake of the financial crisis as an expression of popular anger against an amorphous class of politicians and journalists: the center-left stalwart Democratic Party, the major TV networks.\n\nBut Five Star made few gestures toward the real architects of that crisis, failing to recognize that many of the ills endemic to Italian society—spiraling debt, cycles of underinvestment, dangerously unsupervised and over-integrated financial markets—were the result of policies implemented by politicians long gone. It was little surprise, then, that its iconoclasm quickly deteriorated as it entered government.\n\nFrom 2018, it presided over a series of abortive coalitions with its historical rivals: first the League, then the Democratic Party, then the establishment figure par excellence Mario Draghi, all of whom had a hand in worsening the country’s malaise. Its politics were spotty and contradictory, appealing at once to progressives in Piedmont, industrialists in Milan, and right-wing cardinals in Rome. It focused above all on its unique style of governance, a heady tech-infused online voting platform, over political substance.\n\nThis combination of weakly held principles and a destructive instinct born of an impotent rage at an irremediable socioeconomic reality all came back to bite the movement. In July, it collapsed the Draghi coalition and annihilated the last vestiges of its credibility among allies on the center-left, leaving ample room for a reactionary government.\n\nAhead of this grim scenario, Five Star inaugurated its electoral campaign with a pedantic internal debate over some ancient party principle about candidates running for third terms: the final triumph of the idealized “form” of good policymaking over its mere content. It then alienated its only viable political ally, the Democratic Party, arguably costing the center-left the election.\n\nAnd yet Five Star went on to run a surprisingly successful summer campaign, grounded in the defense of its broadly popular “citizens’ income,” a program that was instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic and lifted countless people out of poverty. That gambit won the party votes in the depressed south, and Five Star emerged from the election much better than expected. But it was too little, too late: Years of dithering had ensured the party would not be able to profit from its lone policy accomplishment.\n\nThink this is a one-off? Take a look at the other unfortunates who participated in the September elections, a gloomy roster of rudderless knockabouts if there ever was one. There were the center-left stalwart Democrats, whose platform was a continuation of the legacy of recently ousted premier Draghi—but, crucially, without Draghi. Support in the Democrats’ traditional heartlands dissolved, in no small part due to an electoral law that the party itself had enthusiastically drawn up while in office.\n\nBerlusconi’s Forza Italia, meanwhile, won a pittance of votes on a bid for lower taxes and nostalgia for its namesake’s halcyon days, while Matteo Salvini’s League was overwhelmed by the fallout from its participation in the Draghi coalition and saw most of its base practically run off in horror. Both nevertheless reluctantly signed on as junior coalition partners to the far more popular Brothers of Italy, whose rise was largely down to its decision to not participate in the Draghi coalition—an expression of principle that it is already undermining.\n\nBrothers of Italy has its roots in the Italian Social Movement, a party founded by wartime Mussolini loyalists. Its leader, Giorgia Meloni, offers culture war palliatives: She has demanded fewer foreign faces in classrooms and proposed a wide-ranging crackdown on crimes supposedly perpetuated by migrants.\n\nOn the more tangible causes of Italy’s ills, however, Meloni is disappointing. Once a bellicose champion of Italian Euroskepticism, Meloni is now at pains to present herself as a sensible guardian of European interests, and her proposed economic and education reforms are generally in service of the demands of industry: lower taxes, for instance, and schools that focus exclusively on so-called vocational subjects. She’s more in line, as Italian newsweekly L’Espresso put it, with the interests of employers’ federations than disaffected voters. Even her fascist roots are passe and unremarkable; way back in the early aughts, Berlusconi’s own winning coalition included Brothers of Italy’s post-fascist forerunner.\n\nNotably, the Brothers also seek a rollback of Five Star’s citizens’ income program. The newest candidate of change is going after the policies of the last one.\n\nThe overwhelming mediocrity of Meloni’s platform was made painfully evident on Sept. 22, three days before her victory, at a garrulous rally held in Rome’s antique Piazza del Popolo. Before swelling crowds and diaphanous Brothers banners blowing in the wind, the trio of Berlusconi, Salvini, and Meloni took to the pulpit to cover the usual ground: anti-wokeness, tax cuts, a big “No!” to drugs. The rest was a roll call of weak compromises and lowbrow right-wing grievances: Meloni blasted the left and the mainstream newspapers, while Berlusconi offered enthusiastic reassurances that the winning coalition would be on good terms with the United States. The activists gathered were not exactly inspired.\n\nAnd though the right-wing alliance now has its majority, it was a marginal victory. Voter turnout was a low 64 percent, down from over 70 percent at the last election. And with Meloni and her counterparts’ eagerness to pay lip service, as Five Star did, to two incontrovertibly opposed groups—the disillusioned electorate and the powers that disillusioned it—this populist coalition du jour is likely to meet the same fate as its predecessors. The manina will continue to steer its relentless course.",

Yesterday's vote saw Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy emerge as the single largest party. Her coalition of right-wing parties will be able to form the next government. And Meloni is expected to become Italy's first female prime minister. The move comes as the European Union struggles to remain united as Russia's invasion of Ukraine fuels economic turmoil in the continent.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Joanna Kakissis is following all of this from Rome, and she joins us now.\n\nGood morning, Joanna.\n\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: Is this result a surprise in Italy, or had things been leaning in Meloni's direction for a while?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah. Things had been leaning her way for quite a while. For weeks now, in public opinion polls, her party had been leading. Her party, the Brothers of Italy - they ran as part of a coalition that includes the hard-right, anti-immigrant party called the League, which is run by former interior minister Matteo Salvini, and Forza Italia, which is run by three-time prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. But make no mistake; Salvini and Berlusconi - these are fading political figures. Meloni is the big winner now and the new star of Italian politics.\n\nMARTIN: So before we talk about the consequences of that and this far-right party coming into power, just tell us about the woman at the center of this. Who is she?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah. Meloni is young. She's 45 years old. And she grew up in this working-class neighborhood in Rome that's actually known for left-wing politics. Yet when Meloni was a teenager, she joined the local youth chapter of a movement founded by supporters of Benito Mussolini after World War II. And she stuck by this ideology for years. But she also had big ambitions. When she took over the brothers of Italy in 2018, it was a minor party. Now it's number one. And she made this happen in part by rehabilitating her own image, transforming from this young firebrand with a scary past into this reasonable everywoman fighting to save Italy's identity.\n\nMARTIN: So she made a...\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: ...Transformation of herself, her political identity, but also her party's, clearly, in some way.

He says Meloni is a gifted politician who can read the room and learn from her mistakes. And that's how she campaigned.\n\nDOMENICO FRACCHIOLLA: She was selling herself as a moderate, a defender of the family values, as ardent supporter of Ukraine and also of NATO, and as she likes to say, as a woman, mother and Christian.\n\nKAKISSIS: And we stopped by her old neighborhood, Garbatella, this leftist neighborhood. And I even met voters who just shrugged off Meloni's past.\n\nHere's advertising manager Tiziana Pipistrello.\n\nTIZIANA PIPISTRELLO: (Speaking Italian).\n\nKAKISSIS: She's saying, \"Enough with this fascism business already. That's all in the past.\" You know - but many others, you know - they told me that, you know, they worry Meloni will roll back abortion rights or crack down on immigrants and the LGBT community.\n\nMARTIN: So Italian politics, Joanna, as you know, are such that prime ministers don't necessarily like this that long. Governments can crumble...\n\nKAKISSIS: That's right.\n\nMARTIN: ...Really fast. How is she going to prevent that?\n\nKAKISSIS: So, yeah. So she is going to prevent that by trying to unite the country. And she says that her aim is to bring together Italians. And she alluded to that in her victory speech last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGIORGIA MELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nKAKISSIS: And she's got a lot of uniting to do because only 64% of Italians voted on Sunday.

    "Opinion | Britain has replaced Italy as Europe’s problem economy": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nAt the start of this month, doom-mongers looking for the next financial crisis in Europe were pointing at Italy. Just as the pessimists predicted, Italians have elected a populist coalition led by the post-fascist Brothers of Italy party. But a funny reversal has occurred. Italy’s economy seems provisionally stable. Britain has emerged as the weak power in Europe.\n\nWhat gives? Intellectual fashion has been running against globalization for several years, so it’s easy to miss the answer. But the Italy-Britain inversion underlines an old lesson. Sacrificing some sovereignty and submitting to the rules of international organizations are not necessarily bad things. If the rules work reasonably well, doing so can be an advantage.\n\nDespite junking the responsible government led by economist Mario Draghi, and despite replacing him with an unsavory populist coalition, Italy is in reasonable shape because of the European Union. However loudly the populists used to denounce Europe’s Germanic orthodoxy, they now promise to implement the economic plan drawn up by Draghi and approved by the E.U. — not least because it comes with almost $200 billion of post-pandemic recovery aid from Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nItaly’s populists also want the European Central Bank in their corner. Over the summer, fearing another euro-zone crisis triggered by the price shocks from the Ukraine war, the central bank created a bond-buying program to protect wobbly countries from short-selling hedge funds. To retain access to this support, Italy has to avoid crazy policies.\n\nIn short, this is not the Europe of a dozen years ago. Rather than reacting belatedly and grudgingly to signs of stress, the continent is trying to preempt problems. Italy has deep structural fragilities, ranging from demography to debt, and much could still go wrong. But for now the smart money is on its stability.\n\nMeanwhile, having left the E.U., and having never been a member of the euro zone, Britain is in the opposite position. The new Conservative government led by Prime Minister Liz Truss faces almost no constraints. She was expected to be bold. She is turning out to be bonkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sign came with her response to soaring natural gas prices. To protect low-income Britons from a choice between heating and eating, Truss had to deliver subsidies. But she opted for a monstrously expensive remedy, trampling her party’s reputation for budgetary prudence. The Truss subsidies are due to last for fully two years. They are especially generous to the rich. By the U.K. government’s own estimates, they will cost more than $60 billion in the next six months, a whopping 4.7 percent of GDP over the period. Because of their design, they will end up costing even more if natural gas prices experience another upward hit.\n\nBut that was just the rehearsal. On Friday, in a Reaganesque bid for higher growth, the Truss team announced a ruinous package of unfunded tax cuts. It did this despite the obvious danger that the stimulus would add to inflation, which is at 9.9 percent and expected to rise. It did this despite the impact on Britain’s national debt, which is forecast to hit 90 percent of gross domestic product in 2024-2025, up from 75 percent before the pandemic. And it did this without allowing the government’s Office of Budget Responsibility to model the impact of its giveaways.\n\nNot surprisingly, financial markets panicked. Interest rates on two-year government bonds hit 4 percent, up from 0.4 percent a year ago, adding to the government’s prospective debt burden. The pound fell 3.4 percent against the dollar by day-end Friday, its steepest drop in two years. Over the weekend, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng signaled that he might cut taxes some more. The pound promptly fell a further 4.7 percent when Asian markets opened Monday, sinking briefly to its lowest level since the system of floating currencies began in 1971. The pound then rallied on the hope that the Bank of England would step in to stabilize it. When the bank said it would not hold an emergency meeting, the currency headed down again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did the Bank of England disappoint the traders? It has only a modest stockpile of foreign currency reserves, so it cannot prop up the pound by stepping in to buy a ton of it. Its only option is an emergency interest rate hike, on top of the 0.5 percent it delivered last week. This would help the pound, and by dampening import prices it would mildly restrain inflation. But higher interest rates would drive the economy into a ditch and raise the cost of servicing the national debt. Given the Truss team’s reckless bent, it might lash out against the central bank and undermine its independence.\n\nWhen the Brexit referendum damaged Britain’s access to its key export market, an economic penalty was inevitable. But this is the first time that being in the currency union has looked more attractive than being outside it. The European Central Bank is in a far stronger crisis-fighting position than the Bank of England.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "How a party with neo-fascist roots won big in Italy": "The Brothers of Italy party, which won the most votes in Italy’s national election, has its roots in the post-World War II neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.\n\nKeeping the movement’s most potent symbol, the tricolor flame, Giorgia Meloni has taken Brothers of Italy from a fringe far-right group to Italy’s biggest party.\n\nA century after Benito Mussolini’s 1922 March on Rome, which brought the fascist dictator to power, Meloni is poised to lead Italy’s first far-right-led government since World War II and become Italy’s first woman premier.\n\nHow did post-fascism begin in Italy?\n\nThe Italian Social Movement, or MSI, was founded in 1946 by Giorgio Almirante, a chief of staff in Mussolini’s last government. It drew fascist sympathizers and officials into its ranks following Italy’s role in the war, when it was allied with the Nazis and then liberated by the Allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1980s, the MSI remained a small right-wing party, polling in the single digits. But historian Paul Ginsborg has noted that its mere survival in the decades after the war “served as a constant reminder of the potent appeal that authoritarianism and nationalism could still exercise among the southern students, urban poor and lower, middle classes.”\n\nThe 1990s brought about a change under Gianfranco Fini, Almirante’s protégé who nevertheless projected a new moderate face of the Italian right. When Fini ran to be mayor of Rome in 1993, he won a surprising 46.9% of the vote — not enough to win but enough to establish him as a player. Within a year, Fini had renamed the MSI the National Alliance.\n\nIt was in those years that a young Meloni, who was raised by a single mother in a working-class neighborhood of Rome, first joined the MSI’s youth branch and then went on to lead the youth branch of Fini’s National Alliance.\n\nDoes that mean Meloni is neo-fascist?\n\nFini was dogged by the movement’s neo-fascist roots and his own assessment that Mussolini was the 20th century’s “greatest statesman.” He disavowed that statement, and in 2003 visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel. There, he described Italy’s racial laws, which restricted Jews’ rights, as part of the “absolute evil” of the war.\n\nMeloni, too, had praised Mussolini in her youth but visited Yad Vashem in 2009 when she was a minister in Silvio Berlusconi’s last government. Writing in her 2021 memoir “I Am Giorgia,” she described the experience as evidence of how “a genocide happens step by step, a little at a time.”\n\nDuring the campaign, Meloni was forced to confront the issue head-on, after the Democrats warned that she represented a danger to democracy.\n\n“The Italian right has handed fascism over to history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws,” she said in a campaign video.\n\nHow did Brothers of Italy emerge?\n\nMeloni, who proudly touts her roots as an MSI militant, has said the first spark of creating Brothers of Italy came after Berlusconi resigned as premier in 2011, forced out by a financial crisis over Italy’s soaring debt and his own legal problems.\n\nMeloni refused to support Mario Monti, who was tapped by Italy’s president to try to form a technocratic government to reassure international financial markets. Meloni couldn’t stand what she believed was external pressure from European capitals to dictate internal Italian politics.\n\nMeloni co-founded the party in 2012, naming it after the first words of the Italian national anthem. “A new party for an old tradition,” Meloni wrote.\n\nBrothers of Italy would only take in single-digit results in its first decade. The European Parliament election in 2019 brought Brothers of Italy 6.4% — a figure that Meloni says “changed everything.”\n\nAs the leader of the only party in opposition during Mario Draghi’s 2021-22 national unity government, her popularity soared, with Sunday’s election netting the party 26%.\n\nBut what about the party’s logo?\n\nThe party has at the center of its logo the red, white and green flame of the original MSI that remained when the movement became the National Alliance. While less obvious than the bundle of sticks, or fasces, that was the prominent symbol of Mussolini’s National Fascist Party, the tricolor flame is nevertheless a powerful image that ties the current party to its past.\n\n“Political logos are a form of branding, no different than those aimed at consumers,” said Rutgers University professor T. Corey Brennan, who recently wrote “Fasces: A History of Rome’s Most Dangerous Political Symbol.”\n\nHe recalled that when Almirante made his final MSI campaign pitch to voters in the 1948 election at Rome’s Spanish Steps, he put the party’s flame symbol on top of the obelisk and illuminated it with floodlights.\n\n“You can make whatever you want out of a flame, but everybody understood that Almirante was making a deeply emotional appeal to keep the spirit of fascism alive,” he said.\n\nHow do Italians feel about it?\n\nIn general, the party’s neo-fascist roots appear to be of more concern abroad than at home. Some historians explain that by noting a certain historical amnesia here and Italians’ general comfort living with the relics of fascism as evidence that Italy never really repudiated the Fascist Party and Mussolini in the same way Germany repudiated National Socialism and Hitler.\n\nWhile Germany went through a long and painful process reckoning with its past, Italians have in many ways simply turned a willful blindness to their own.\n\nHistorian David Kertzer of Brown University notes that there are 67 institutes for the study of the Resistance to Fascism in Italy, and virtually no center for the study of Italian Fascism.\n\nIn addition, Mussolini-era architecture and monuments are everywhere: from the EUR neighborhood in southern Rome to the Olympic training center on the Tiber River, with its obelisk still bearing Mussolini’s name.\n\nThe Italian Constitution bars the reconstitution of the Fascist party, but far-right groups still display the fascist salute and there continues to be an acceptance of fascist symbols, said Brennan.\n\n“You don’t have to look very hard for signs,” Brennan said in a phone interview. “Fully a quarter of all manhole covers in Rome still have the fasces on them.”\n\nDoes that mean Italians support fascism?\n\nIf history is any guide, one constant in recent political elections is that Italians vote for change, with a desire for something new seemingly overtaking traditional political ideology in big pendulum shifts, said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute of International Affairs.\n\nTocci said the Brothers of Italy’s popularity in 2022 was evidence of this “violent” swing that is more about Italian dissatisfaction than any surge in neo-fascist or far-right sentiment.\n\n“I would say the main reason why a big chunk of that — let’s say 25-30% — will vote for this party is simply because it’s the new kid on the block,” she said.\n\nMeloni still speaks reverently about the MSI and Almirante, even if her rhetoric can change to suit her audience.\n\nThis summer, speaking in perfect Spanish, she thundered at a rally of Spain’s hard-right Vox party: “Yes to the natural family. No to the LGBT lobby. Yes to sexual identity. No to gender ideology.”\n\nBack home on the campaign trail, she projected a much more moderate tone and appealed for unity in her victory speech Monday.\n\n“Italy chose us,” she said. “We will not betray it, as we never have.”",
    "Italy’s League: sovereignty without constraints, with EU money": "Ahead of Italy’s snap election on 25 September, EURACTIV Italy takes a closer look at how the party programme of Matteo Salvini’s League party relates to the EU.\n\nRead the original article in Italian here.\n\nThe programme presented by the League party presents a nationalistic and anti-EU position that is in line with the party being part of the far-right Identity and Democracy group in the European Parliament, and it ignores the pro-EU and pro-Western stance it presented to get into the government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nStill, the programme reaffirms Italy’s participation in the EU and NATO, but only dedicates three of 202 pages to the EU.\n\nIn its programme, League portrays the EU as an “increasingly bureaucratic and distant reality for the people” and takes particular aim at EU climate policies – like the Green Deal and Fit for 55 – which the party says targets the “Made in Italy” brand and is “a danger to the competitiveness of businesses and the lifestyle of Italian citizens.”\n\nThe programme does not mention Next Generation EU but only parts of the national recovery plan, even though Italy is the largest beneficiary of these funds.\n\nStill, the party makes the bold statement that no Italian government was able to influence EU institutions in the past 20 years despite League being part of the government during many of those years and many Italians, like former European Commission President Romano Prodi and the EU’s former top diplomat, Frederica Mogherini, obtaining top spots at EU level.\n\nOn the economy, the programme also lacks references to the single currency or the Economic and Monetary Union despite negotiations on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and European economic governance being set to start in autumn. This comes as a surprise since League’s head of economics, Alberto Bagnai, and Claudio Borghi before him, both oppose the Euro. This omission could be explained by League’s fear of losing votes if it were openly against the euro, or that such an announcement could impact the markets and thus increase public debt – which was the case when Italy was under the helm of the eurosceptic and euro-critical first Conte government.\n\nOn Russia’s war in Ukraine, League calls for a peace conference without saying if it is favour of maintaining sanctions against Russia or providing Ukraine with military assistance along with the rest of the EU and NATO.\n\nOn extending the EU’s competences and putting an end to unanimity voting procedures, as proposed by the Conference on the Future of Europe, League says it is in favour of preserving unanimity and opposes increasing the competences and powers of the Union.\n\nTo face the US, China and Russia, League says joint EU action is not necessary, and instead calls on Italy to revive its role “to safeguard the national interest” – a concept the party does not clearly define in its programme.\n\nHowever, some of the programme’s sections, notably on the economy, implicitly refer to the EU, and in particular to the national recovery and resilience plan, EU structural funds and EU programmes more generally, as these would be essential to fund League’s proposals.\n\nIn what appears to be a somewhat contradictory programme, League wants Italy to regain absolute sovereignty without EU constraints, but still considers EU funds to be necessary for the implementation of its proposals, and is even proposing to strengthen Italy’s permanent representation in Brussels and to create better coordination between the representation, the ministries, the national Parliament and Italian MEPs.\n\nIn short, the League despises the EU, but implicitly recognises that Italy cannot do without it.",

    "The Man Who Explains Italy": "In the middle of August, my wife and our two small children went to visit her family in Milan. We arrived at Malpensa Airport at dawn and proceeded to passport control, where the immigration officer, as is customary with public servants in Italy, seemed vaguely put out that we’d interrupted whatever important business he was conducting on his phone. My wife handed over two Italian passports, for herself and our five-year-old, and two American ones. The officer’s mood immediately improved: now we were no longer simply an unwelcome distraction from his private affairs but in the much more interesting category of people he was legally obligated to reprimand. Our two-year-old, he explained gravely, was in violation of the law. As he was an Italian citizen by birth, he required an Italian passport; American passports, he went on, do not carry the names of the parents, and thus he had no way to know that the child, who has my surname, was in fact hers.\n\nMy wife, long accustomed to such bureaucratic snares, produced a scan of our son’s birth certificate. The process of obtaining an Italian passport, she explained with a series of complex hand gestures, was so arcane and so onerous! Our two-year-old was born in the first year of the pandemic, she went on, and you know how Italian administrative procedures were: you had to go to one office to get this form, and then another office to get the proper stamp, and the consulate in New York seemed only to be open for such services on every third Wednesday. The man at last permitted himself a commiserative smile: he knew how it was. Look, he allowed, he was a nice guy, so he was going to let us through this time. But we needed to be careful! If we had the misfortune to encounter a more severe officer on our way out, we might be denied exit from the country. When we departed, some two weeks later, we encountered another unusually availing guy willing, of course, to bend the rules just this once.\n\nLord Byron once remarked that, in Italy, “there is, in fact, no law or government at all; and it is wonderful how well things go on without them.” Today, Italy has a large government with a dazzling number of laws—more than ten times as many as Germany—and the country is full of bright, industrious people who spend an enormous amount of time and energy creatively breaking them. This problem has been a recurring theme for Francesco Costa, a thirty-eight-year-old journalist, who has, over the last few years, become a new-media phenomenon. The Italian media, like the Italian government, is largely made up of stodgy, insular institutions—places more interested in themselves, and the preservation of their own status, than they are in their readers. Costa, who began as an outsider blogger and podcaster, has been credited as a modernizing influence on the role of the reporter in Italian civil society.\n\nCosta’s daily podcast, “Morning,” which is pronounced with a non-rhotic “R” and a phantom vowel at the end, attracts an intensely devoted audience, especially (but not exclusively) among the country’s liberal élite. The show, which appears under the auspices of Il Post, the news site where Costa serves as deputy editor, is subscriber-only—a rarity in a country where media properties have been slow to adopt new business models that have become common elsewhere. The young Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico told me, “There are journalists who have been caught copying pieces from elsewhere who are still writing front-page editorials in the main newspapers—it’s such a different culture that it’s hard even to explain. Costa’s journalism would be at a high level in the U.S., but in Italy it’s way above what ninety-nine per cent of the other outlets offer. It’s like he appeared from outer space.” The conceit and the operation of the podcast are simple: Costa’s alarm goes off at 4:45 A.M., he reads up to ten daily papers in the next hour and a half, and he sits at his home computer to record a summary, with dry but opinionated commentary, of the day’s news. He edits out the ambulance sirens from outside his apartment, cuts the episode to thirty minutes, and exports the file himself. “The goal is to come out at 8 A.M.,” he told me recently. He continued, with the national shrug, “Sometimes it’s eight, sometimes it’s five minutes early, sometimes it’s five minutes late.” In a country riven by intergenerational frustration, he has an unusually broad subscriber base: he is at once respected by boomers and parasocially stalked by the youth. (When my wife texted her group chat of Italian expat professionals to say I was writing about him, the response was a flood of heart-eye emojis.) Luca Sofri, one of Italy’s first prominent bloggers and now a colleague of Costa’s at Il Post, told me that it is chiefly Costa’s singular talent that gives what seems like a mere press review such an unusual sway over his audience. “Francesco is simply bravissimo,” he said.\n\nIn a perpetual moment of Italian political turmoil, Costa not only aggregates and processes perplexing news—about gas prices or electoral procedures—with rare clarity but also comes at national politics from oblique directions, speaking to the country’s spiritual state with candor and dark humor. I had arrived in Milan at the tail end of the August holidays, when anyone of means abandons the cities to the tourists, and Costa dedicated the prefatory remarks of his podcast one morning to a typical story of Italian coastal melodrama. The episode was called “No Need for a Law for Everything.” Law enforcement had recently begun a “blitz,” scouring the public beaches for illegal “reservations”—places where vacationers have arrived before dawn to put down their towels or umbrellas before going home to sleep until midday, such that people who arrive at the beach at a reasonable hour can’t find a place to take the sun.\n\nThe story, he went on, provoked him to consider the activity of law-enforcement personnel who had to conduct these “blitzes.” It wasn’t just the time that they spent finding the offenders but the tremendous waste to follow:\n\nAn enormous amount of paper, of signatures, of stamps, of authorizations, of service orders to seize fifteen umbrellas, and then for each of these fifteen umbrellas imagine the amount of senseless paperwork required to say, “We have seized on date X an umbrella with a design of little hearts and flowers,” and imagine this entire operation repeated for every single umbrella, towel, and beach chair that had been seized, on every single beach where the forces of order, instead of dedicating themselves to things we would call much more important, had to devote themselves to these inspections?\n\nImagine all of that, he instructed his listeners over their morning brioche and coffee, “multiplied for all the other superfluous, redundant, costly bureaucratic operations we’re forced to confront on a daily basis.” His voice, though still dry and deadpan, took on increasing urgency. “We have a law that simply says you can’t put your umbrella on the beach at night but that you can after 6 A.M. But is there a need for a law—must there be a law for us to adopt a comportment of banal manners, that is, don’t occupy a place you’re not using, on a free beach, and do it neither the night before nor at 6 A.M.?” He continued, “Does law enforcement in Norway have to carry out such ‘blitzes’?” He asked, “Or does it not happen because it doesn’t occur to anybody to do such a thing?”\n\nHe begged his listeners’ pardon for something that might seem so irrelevant, but he hoped that he had been understood in the spirit he intended. “We’re in an election campaign, every day we’re confronting and adjudicating promises to approve this or that other law,” he said. In the background, “Morning” ’s theme, “Gimme Shelter,” began to play. “Are we sure that all of this comportment—matters of civility and banal good manners—could or should have to be imposed by a law?” Couldn’t it just be up to us, he concluded, “to avoid a situation where law enforcement has to go to the beaches to verify who put his umbrella, or her beach chair, or his towel, on a public beach to unduly occupy a place? In other words, why not just try to regulate ourselves? This is ‘Morning.’ Let’s begin.”\n\nA day or two after that episode aired, I met Costa, who is slender and bald and speaks with a pronounced Sicilian accent, one morning for coffee. We sat at a bar not far from his office, in Milan’s Zona Tortona, an old industrial district renovated to support the fashion and design sectors. He told me, “You can tell we’re journalists because we’re the worst-dressed people at lunch,” though he himself has adopted an offhandedly smart Milanese style. Unlike traditional Milanese brass-and-marble bars—where you can get a coffee in the morning and a drink at night, or vice versa—this was an airy, high-ceilinged space with large tables set out for the laptop cohort.\n\nCosta was raised and educated in Catania, at the base of Mt. Etna. In 2008, he dropped out of journalism school in Rome and pitched a tent in a lakeside holiday community, where he blogged about Obama’s first campaign with unqualified enthusiasm. He sent out letters of inquiry to dozens of newspapers, but at the time he lacked the personal connections necessary to join the media class. Like many other young people of ambition from the impoverished south, he moved in his twenties to Milan, where he mixed with an entrepreneurial cohort of migrant upstarts. He developed a reputation as a young journalist who explained America to his generation of Italians. (His third book about the States, on the problems facing California, came out last week, and is already atop the best-seller lists.) In relatively short order, he was able to sustain his blogging with crowdsourced donations. Inspired by the success of shows such as “Serial,” he turned to audio, first with “Da Costa a Costa” (“From Coast to Coast”), a pun on his name, which became Italy’s first native podcast sensation.\n\nLast year, he started “Morning,” which he describes as a side gig to his role at Il Post, an online-only news organization whose motto is “Cose spiegate bene”—or “Things explained well.” Though he noted that the site, which Sofri founded in 2010, predated the establishment of Vox by four years, he told me that his innovations were nothing new. “I wasn’t being a genius. I was just in touch with what was happening in the U.S., on blogs and in podcasts, and just copied what was working elsewhere.” In Italy, however, this came as a revelation. It was taken for granted that the establishment media wrote largely to and for itself. “They use jargon that people never use and don’t understand,” he said. “They provide no context.” Publications routinely made errors, which they rarely bothered to apologize for or correct. More important, they made no secret of their political affiliations—a center-left senator once described La Repubblica as “our Pravda”—and rarely dwelled on the routine hypocrisy that’s long been endemic to Italian political life. The business model of Il Post was basic precision, firmness, and comprehensibility. “We set out to explain everything like the listener is five years old,” Costa said. It did not take long for him to become one of the few sources that Italians could turn to for straightforward explanations of the deliberately illegible machinations of national politics. In July, the generally popular caretaker government of Mario Draghi—the third unelected banker-technocrat recruited to run the country since the nineteen-nineties—was brought down by the abrupt (and, given that almost all of the parties are now running on a continuation of his economic policies, largely pointless) withdrawal of support by the junior coalition partners, and overnight Costa found himself delivering daily coverage of the snap elections, which are to be held on September 25th.\n\nFor anyone who has paid even passing attention to the Anglophone press’s treatment of the political situation in Italy, Costa’s riff on umbrellas and banal good manners might seem like a glib reaction to an impending crisis for European democracy. In the past decade, Italy, along with many of its peer countries, has been destabilized by populist movements on the right and the left. Now it seems to many foreign observers that Italy’s next government will be a Fascist one. Polling has been stable, and a decisive victory is almost assured for a so-called center-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni, who would be Italy’s first female Prime Minister. It’s not hard to gather why Meloni brings Fascism to mind. The Party that she co-founded, Fratelli d’Italia, arose from the ashes of Italy’s Movimento Sociale Italiano (M.S.I.), the postwar reconstruction of Mussolini’s base. Her party occupies M.S.I.’s former headquarters in Rome, she has retained its symbolism—a tricolored flame—and she frequently refers to “Dio, patria, famiglia,” or “God, country, and family.” Many of her followers have taken up the stiff-armed Roman salute associated with Il Duce, on the flimsy pretext that it’s a hygienic development in the wake of COVID. Mussolini’s granddaughter Rachele is a Party member, and a member of Rome’s city council.",
    "Pope urges Italians to help migrants as far right tipped to win election": "Pope Francis has urged Italians to help migrants as voting proceeded in a general election widely expected to bring an anti-immigration rightwing coalition into power.\n\nSpeaking at the end of an open-air mass in the southern Italian city of Matera, the pope recalled that Sunday coincided with the Catholic church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. “Migrants are to be welcomed, accompanied, promoted and integrated,” he told the assembled faithful.\n\n“Let us renew our commitment to building the future in accordance with God’s plan: a future in which migrants and refugees may live in peace and with dignity.”\n\nFrancis made no direct reference to the election, but his message rang loud and clear throughout the country as millions of Italians queued to elect a new government.\n\nMigration has been a central theme in the electoral campaign of extreme right parties, led by the leader of Brothers of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who could become the country’s first far-right leader since Mussolini and who once said Italians needed to “repatriate the migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them”.\n\nThis summer, Meloni and another of her coalition leaders, Matteo Salvini, a former interior minister who made high-profile moves to block the arrival of asylum seekers at Italian ports, have rallied against what they described as fake refugees and portrayed the arrival of people seeking asylum in Italy as an “invasion”.\n\nMeloni, whose party has roots in neo-fascism, said that if she becomes prime minister, she intends to put in place a naval blockade in the Mediterranean to stop migration to Italy.\n\n“May the Kingdom of God be realised with them, without exclusion,” said the pope. “And we can thank these ‘brothers and sisters’ as they can help our communities grow and flourish economically, culturally and spiritually.”\n\nIt is not the first time the pope has criticised far-right parties and their anti-migration stances. Francis has previously criticised former US president Donald Trump and the “new culture of defending territories by building walls”, which has “brought so many headaches and so much suffering”. He has also urged Hungary to “extend its arms towards everyone” in an apparent veiled criticism of Viktor Orbán’s anti-migrant policies.\n\nLast year, returning from a visit to Lesbos, the Greek island long at the centre of Europe’s refugee crisis, Francis attacked Europe, citing its indifference and cynical disregard while people continue to die during sea crossings.\n\nOn Sunday, Francis also asked Italians to have more children. “I’d like to ask Italy: more births, more children,” he said. Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world and Francis has frequently lamented its “demographic winter”.\n\nThe 85-year-old Francis appeared tired during the visit, which was scheduled before Italy’s snap elections were called and came a day after he made a separate trip to the Umbrian hilltop town of Assisi. Francis has been using a cane and a wheelchair this year due to strained knee ligaments that make walking and standing difficult.",

    "Mussolini: the master of Italy – archive, 1922": "Fascist activities\n\nFrom our own correspondent\n\nThe Observer, 24 September 1922\n\nRome\n\nThe Fascisti are continuing their activities all over Italy, and if they use despotic methods it must be admitted that their despotism is sometimes attended with good results. How far and how long an extra-state despotism can continue to exist side by side with the legal constitution is the problem that will have to be faced in the near future by both Italy and the Fascisti.\n\nThey are now preparing a campaign in the south of Italy where, so far, fascismo has penetrated very little. The National Congress of Fascisti takes places at Naples in October, and will be the signal for the “black shirts” to start their propaganda. They have already established National Syndicates to take the place of Communist Labour Chambers in the provinces of Bari and Foggia, formerly strongholds of socialism. These syndicates aim at federating workers of all classes, instead of separating the social strata and producing the harmful class strife which has hitherto been the hallmark of Italian socialism.\n\nIn Sicily fascismo has better ground to work on than in the Neapolitan provinces. As an article in the Popolo d’Italia truly observes, there is no real socialism in Sicily; there are only discontented people, who will gladly join any association that promises to ameliorate their lot. In Messina, fascism is already thriving. In Sicily, generally, memories still linger of Garibaldi and his band of heroes, and the tradition of the “red shirts” will pave the way for the new expedition of the “camicie nere.”\n\nIn central Italy the Fascisti are championing ex-soldiers in the country districts by occupying the villas or these landowners who refuse to give them work. A few days ago 300 of them swarmed over the Villa Borghese in the Mugello, near Florence, and continued the pressure of their presence until the owner, the Duca di Bomarzo, consented to employ a reasonable number of ex-servicemen on his estate.\n\nThe village of Bacchereto, also in Tuscany, has just been occupied by Fascisti, who announce their intention of remaining on the spot until the parish priest has been removed. The obnoxious cleric is accused of uttering libels against fascismo from the pulpit, and of being generally guilty of anti-national feeling. His parishioners are, it seems, thoroughly in agreement with the Fascisti, and are grateful to them for their help. The priest declares that he is innocent of the sentiments attributed to him, but it is rumoured that he intends to resign the living of Bacchereto sooner than fight it out with the Fascisti.\n\nThe master of Italy: Mussolini and his programme\n\nFrom our own correspondent\n\nThe Observer, 1 October 1922\n\nFlorence\n\nLast week both the nominal and the virtual leader of Italy made speeches and were honoured in different ways and in very different measure. The banquet given at Pinerolo, in Piedmont, to celebrate the completion of 30 years of the prime minister’s political life, was attended by numerous ministers, innumerable deputies and three Italian ambassadors, besides a crowd of other distinguished guests, who had come, not only because Facta is personally liked and much respected, but because an important speech was expected, given the gravity of the political situation. Delusion wits bitter. “Verba non Facta,” exclaimed one wag, and the phrase will serve as cenotaph for this amiably dignified and ineffectually upright minister who has failed to impress his countrymen, and is only used as a hyphen between one ministry and the other. He has purred about peace and order at home, and respect for Italy abroad, but has not known which card to play.\n\nThe subtle Italian mind adores a man of action, a man of elemental force. Mussolini, “the Thunderer,” whose words became deeds as they drop from his mouth, has swept most of young Italy off their feet, and for the time being holds them in the hollow of his hand. He at any rate has no difficulty in finding cards to play; he shows them with tempestuous promptitude in answer to the stirred curiosity of his anxious countrymen, and no one can complain that his game lacks variety. His whole life, from a revolutionary socialist to a revolutionary fascist, is made of cinema shifts of stirring interest and significance.\n\nAt Udine on 20 September Mussolini made the most important of his speeches, which had for its watchword, “Rome”. “The march on Rome,” however symbolic as a term (and, given the necessity, Mussolini will turn symbols into deeds), means nothing less than that Italy is to be fascista and governed either by Mussolini or by those who will suit their policy to his. In the very near future we may see a Giolitti-Mussolini ministry – age and exuberance grappling with, perhaps, the most subtly difficult situation an Italian cabinet has ever had to deal with.\n\nDiscipline\n\nIn the Udine speech Mussolini made a vigorous call for discipline to be the mainspring of his army and of Italy. “We must subject ourselves,” he said, “to an iron discipline or else we would have no right to impose it upon the nation. Discipline alone will enable Italy to make her voice heard among other nations. Discipline should be accepted; if not accepted, it must be imposed … We are an army, and because we have chosen that special constitution, our life and our actions must be founded upon discipline … “Italy’s voice to be heard among other nations” – there you have another foundation stone of Mussolini’s programme.\n\n“Black Shirts” at Cremona\n\nThe very day that the prime minister’s 3,000 distinguished guests were eating their excellent dinner and exchanging “bei complimenti,” Mussolini was taking peaceful possession of enemy country. The beautiful little city of Cremona, lying in the rich Lombard plain close to the gliding waters of the Po, awoke to find her population suddenly doubled by the advent of 30,000 fascists – youths in black shirts and black fezes, skull and crossbones as their emblem, their motto “Me ne frego” (“Je m’en fiche”); and young girls in short black skirts, white blouses, and jockey caps made of tricolour.\n\nMussolini in Rome, February 1927. Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG/Getty Images\n\nThe “loggie” flanking the cathedral were soon crowded with people, boys sat astride on the grim medieval lions and heads looked out of the small windows above the giant sundial, while thousands of Black Shirts streamed into the piazza for an hour and half in well-ordered formation. With his habitual quiet rapidity, Mussolini suddenly appeared in the stone pulpit affixed high up against a pier of the Communal Palace whence demagogues of old had swayed the people of Cremona. There was a roar of welcome “Il nostro Duce,” and the banners were raised on high and waved above the crowd.\n\nMussolini as orator\n\n“How like he is to a Roman tribune,” exclaimed one officer, as Mussolini stretched out his arm to the crowd, saluting the people in the Roman manner adopted by the fascists. His powerful head was thrown back, his stern eye fixed them all as one person. I was more impressed by the religious silence which fell upon the multitude when Mussolini began to speak than by the indescribable enthusiasm when cheering broke loose. He is a great speaker, not an orator. He dominates his audience more by sheer force of his volcanic personality, which is well under control, than by the force of his words. The young men in Italy, full of intense zest for life, and of truculent patriotism, would follow him anywhere at the lift of a finger. In this absorbing love for Italy and pride in her lies their strength, their virtue, and their danger.\n\nThis is an edited extract. Read the article in full.",
    "Why Italy is on verge of electing its first far-right leader since second world war": "A hundred years after the rise of Italian fascism was heralded by Mussolini’s 1922 march on Rome, the country is on the verge of electing a party with its roots in neo-fascism.\n\nWith just over a week to go until polling day, the smiling face of Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy, is emblazoned on thousands of posters from the heel in the south to the Alps in the north.\n\nWhen polls close on the evening of 25 September, Meloni is expected to emerge triumphant, making her Italy’s first far-right leader since the second world war.\n\nMeloni has always distanced herself from fascism and recently declared that the Italian right had “handed fascism over to history”. Her current political success owes much to her decision, unlike that of Matteo Salvini and his Northern League, to keep her party out of the outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi’s, cross-party government. The move cemented her as an opposition voice and has given her the leading position in a rightwing electoral coalition, that includes the League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, now polling in excess of 45%.\n\nBut she has been reluctant in campaigning to shed the political slogan Dio, Patria, Famiglia (God, Homeland, Family), widely used in the fascist era, and her party retains apparent fascist visual references. It shares its party logo, an Italian tricolour in the form of a flame, with the now defunct Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party formed in 1946 by supporters of Mussolini’s regime and former high-ranking members of his fascist party. Some supporters of her party have performed the fascist salute during public commemorations.\n\nGiorgia Meloni campaigning in Ancora, Italy, with her party’s flag-flame logo, shared with a defunct neo-fascist party, behind her. Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Images\n\nHow can it be that Italy, which lived through Mussolini’s bloody regime and passed discriminatory laws against its Jewish citizens, is close to electing as prime minister the leader of a party with these associations, who in a recently surfaced video from 1996 said of the fascist leader: “Mussolini was a good politician. There have been no other politicians like him in the last 50 years”?\n\nPaolo Berizzi, of La Repubblica, has been asking such question for years. The journalist, who has written extensively about the extreme right in Italy, has received numerous threats from neo-fascist and neo-Nazi groups and now lives under police protection. “Italy is a country that never came to terms with its fascist past,” he said. “Fascists didn’t die in 1945; they’ve always been around.”\n\nTo find some answers, one must go back to the immediate aftermath of the second world war, when the first issue for Italy to address was national unity. The toppling of Mussolini in 1943 was followed by bloody civil war between a Nazi-backed puppet state and the partisans of the Italian resistance, so when peace came to Europe, fears of aggravating civil tensions overrode the purging of fascists from Italian institutions and prosecuting them for war crimes. While the Nuremberg trials against prominent members of the Nazi party began in Germany in November 1946, Italy, in part concerned about growing numbers of communists, on the brink of the cold war, had from June of that year run an amnesty programme, releasing thousands of fascists from prison.\n\nIf Mussolini were to return, Italians would re-elect him Antonio Scurati, author on Mussolini\n\nMany took jobs in the postwar administrations: Ettore Messana, a fascist official whose name appears in a UN list for war crimes, was appointed inspector general for public safety in Sicily; Gen Giuseppe Pichè, who carried out counter-espionage for Mussolini, was nominated director general of the Civil Protection Agency.\n\n“After the war there were a lot of Italians who thought that, despite the conflict, Mussolini hadn’t done so badly after all,” said Salvatore Lupo, a professor of contemporary history at Palermo University.\n\nGiorgio Almirante, a culture minister in the Nazis’ short-lived puppet state, founded the MSI with former members of the Italian Fascist party in this climate of tolerance. By 1948, three neo-fascists sat in the Italian parliament. It is from this heritage that the Brothers of Italy would later emerge.\n\nThe neo-fascist MSI, meanwhile, remained sidelined from mainstream politics until the early 1990s, when a nationwide judicial investigation into political corruption resulted in the disappearance of many traditional political parties and gave it an opportunity. Its members formed the National Alliance party in 1995, maintaining the tricolour flame as their symbol, and, presenting themselves as neoliberal conservatives, found in Berlusconi’s Forza Italia their first ally in national government.\n\nIt was Berlusconi who, during a political rally in 2019, boasted about having been the first to engage with neo-fascists. “The parties that governed Italy from the beginning of the First Republic had never allowed the fascists to enter the government”, he said. “We let them in for the first time. We legitimised them.”\n\nBerizzi said: “It was in those years that the criminal revisionism of fascism, as I call it, began, fuelled by talkshows and many newspapers. Fake news began to circulate around fascism, which still today is presented as a regime that ‘did many great things’.”\n\nMany Italians today are convinced that Mussolini introduced public housing in Italy, when in reality it had begun in 1903, nearly 20 years before his rule. The enduring cliche is that Mussolini made the trains run on time, but during the fascist period trains were chronically late. Unable to resolve the problem, the regime instead forbade people from discussing it, because to do so would be “dishonourable to the homeland”.\n\nMore than 70 years after Mussolini’s death, thousands of Italians started to join self-described fascist groups in a surge of support antifascists blame on the portrayal of the refugee crisis, and Italy’s economic and political instability. In this context, in 2012 Brothers of Italy was founded, largely from the ranks of MSI and National Alliance. Two years later, Meloni, previously an activist in the MSI’s Youth Front, rose to become its leader.\n\n“Meloni became the leader of her party in a period in which fascism in Italy was almost normalised and getting popular among young people,” Berizzi said. “Statuettes of Mussolini and calendars of the Duce are on sale in kiosks and shops. The fascist salute […] has become an almost folkloric gesture.”\n\nBenito Mussolini addressing crowds in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome in 1936. Photograph: George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nAntonio Scurati, the author of M, an international bestseller about Mussolini’s rise to power, said: “While in Germany there was a long process of overcoming the past, which had as a prerequisite that of making all German people reflect on the co-responsibility of the crimes of nazism, in Italy this process has never taken place. Whenever we speak about the war and racial laws in Italy, we always identify ourselves with the role of victim and anti-fascists, and this has prevented us from admitting to ourselves that we were fascists.”\n\nMeloni has “unambiguously” condemned “the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws”, emphasising that her party has nothing to do with fascism and is a conservative champion of patriotism. She told Corriere della Sera after local elections there were no “nostalgic fascists, racists or antisemites in the Brothers of Italy DNA” and she had always got rid of “ambiguous people”.\n\n“Let’s believe that Meloni is not a fascist. Let’s believe that technically her party is not neo-fascist,” Berizzi said. “You still can’t deny that in her ranks there are numerous fascists […] If Meloni wins the election, fascism may not be back, but our democracy will be at risk.”\n\nJust as the far right is moving forward, some Italians have compared the current situation to a satire movie released in 2018, which imagines Mussolini returning to Italy and being acclaimed by people.\n\n“If Mussolini were to return, Italians would re-elect him,” Scurati said. “In fact, Italians, Europeans, North Americans and Brazilians have already elected several ‘neo’ Mussolinis.”",
    "Italy braces for far-right victory in elections": "Italy braces for far-right victory in elections\n\nItalians head to the polls Sunday in what could be a pivotal election with far-right candidate Giorgia Meloni poised to be Italy's first female prime minister.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAnd now to Italy, where voting is set for tomorrow in one of the most consequential elections for the country in decades. Public opinion polls show that a far-right party, the Brothers of Italy, is expected to win the most votes. Its leader, a young firebrand named Giorgia Meloni, seems poised to be Italy's first female prime minister and the first to come from the far right since fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. NPR's Joanna Kakissis is in Rome following developments, and she's with us now. Joanna, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Michel.\n\nMARTIN: So Giorgia Meloni - tell us a little bit about her and her background.\n\nKAKISSIS: Right. So Giorgia Meloni is 45. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Rome that is staunchly leftist. But instead, she joined the youth chapter of the Italian Social Movement, which was created by the supporters of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the aftermath of World War II. This youth group was heavily influenced by fantasy novels like J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord Of The Rings,\" and Guido Calderon (ph), a journalist who covers the far-right in Italy, he told us why.\n\nGUIDO CALDERON: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKAKISSIS: So he's saying that reading Tolkien gave these young people new ways to talk about their ideology, where they were not the bad guys, where they lived in a community whose traditions they were protecting.\n\nMARTIN: That's really interesting. So the views of the young Meloni, does she still hold them?\n\nKAKISSIS: Now, Meloni was much more explicit about her hardline views in her youth. But, you know, as she has grown, she's tried to maybe mute them a bit. At the start of this campaign, for example, she took pains to reassure Italians and the world of her party's pro-European and pro-Atlantic stance. But in some closing rallies in the last few days, her tone and content has been much more stridently nationalistic. And I should note here that her party, the Brothers of Italy, is not set to govern alone. They're expected to form a coalition with at least two right-wing parties, and one of them is led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nMARTIN: How are people reacting to all this and her views in particular to the election and sort of more broadly? What are people saying?\n\nKAKISSIS: So yeah - so we wanted to find out. So we checked out the public mood at the Trionfale market in an upscale neighborhood in Rome. All the shoppers, they seemed unhappy at the prospect of a right-wing coalition in power. Middle-class professionals like Simona Romeo (ph), who works in the movie industry, was one of them. She called Meloni divisive and exclusionary.\n\nSIMONA ROMEO: She is a new evolution of fascism. I mean, Giorgia Meloni and her entourage is going to be like in United States, like in your country, when, you know, Trump - and people is angry. That's the mood.\n\nKAKISSIS: But the Romans running the stalls at the market called Meloni a hero. And Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini, who leads another party in her coalition, they call those two the two angels at her side. And those are the words of Manuela Ciarrone (ph), who sells gourmet mushrooms.\n\nMANUELA CIARRONE: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKAKISSIS: So Ciarrone is saying Meloni will be focused on caring for Italians, not migrants, and that she will fight for the working class by pushing to provide better health care and lower electricity prices.\n\nMARTIN: So let's go back to something you mentioned earlier, her relationship to Europe. Is that a factor in the campaign? I mean, she does blame the EU for watering down the national identities of member nations like Italy. How is that whole issue playing out?\n\nKAKISSIS: Yeah, we heard a lot of concern about that in the market from the shoppers, of course. One person I spoke with said Italy really needs Brussels with all the debt the country has. And Guido Calderon, the fascism expert, he told us that Italians are also concerned that Meloni could take Italy down the path of illiberal democracy like Viktor Orban's Hungary. He says that may not be the fascism of Mussolini, but it is a very real threat that may soon present itself in Italy.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Rome. Joanna, thank you.\n\nKAKISSIS: You're welcome, Michel.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "‘Left on the streets’: migrants in Italy face fresh hostility as election looms": "For the weary Kurdish family and the young people from Eritrea, Mali and Ivory Coast outside Ventimiglia train station, life is like Groundhog Day, an itinerary invariably made up of repeated attempts to cross the border into France and of scrambling for food and finding somewhere to sleep.\n\nThe northern Italian coastal town, popular with tourists for its Friday market, has been a perennial waiting room for migrants for more than a decade, most of whom have made the perilous journey to Europe by boat, landing in southern Italy before making their way north.\n\nBut as a conservative coalition promises to clamp down on mass immigration as it charts its path to victory in general elections on 25 September, a fresh humanitarian crisis is playing out in Ventimiglia, a situation exacerbated by a combination of careless policies from both sides of the political spectrum, and dysfunctional European measures.\n\nIbrahim, from Mali, said he had tried to enter France four times, twice by train and twice by walking along a motorway, only to be sent back by French police. “He’s tried it 23 times,” he said, pointing to his friend from Ivory Coast. “All we want is to be able to live.”\n\nThe pair have been sleeping in cardboard boxes outside the train station. Others bed down for the night among piles of rubbish under a bridge by the Roia River, in the park or on the beach.\n\nThe migrants arriving in Ventimiglia – about 100 a day, according to charity workers – have been left homeless since a council made up of the coalition of two far-right parties, Brothers of Italy and the League, and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, elected in 2019 and heading for national power, fulfilled its promise of closing the city’s only shelter, called Roia.\n\nThat council, however, was not made to last, with Ventimiglia rudderless since June after the mayor, Gaetano Scullino, an independent backed by the three parties, was forced to resign after losing a confidence vote.\n\nThe northern Italian coastal town of Ventimiglia, popular with tourists for its Friday market, has been a perennial waiting room for immigrants for more than a decade. Photograph: Tibor Bognar/Alamy\n\nBy then, enough damage had been done, with Scullino also closing off a fountain used by immigrants and homeless people to wash.\n\nThe only source of food and healthcare assistance comes from charity associations including the Church-run Caritas.\n\n“The situation has got so much worse here,” said Christian Papini, who runs the Caritas centre close to Ventimiglia train station. “People have been left on the street, there is nothing close to hospitality here.”\n\nTwenty-seven people are estimated to have died while trying to enter France since 2017, either by drowning, being hit by a car or walking along the so-called “passage of death”, a mountain trail used by Italian Jews fleeing Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime during the second world war.\n\nSince French authorities tightened border controls in 2015, French police have been accused of using aggressive tactics to ward off people trying to cross the border. In June, an Egyptian man died after being shot in the head by a French officer. The man had reportedly been travelling in a van that rammed its way through an immigration checkpoint in a French border town.\n\n“You also have people who beat immigrants up, or steal money from them, pretending to take them to France only to leave them stranded at the border or elsewhere,” said Papini.\n\nThe situation wasn’t much better when Ventimiglia was in the hands of the leftwing mayor, Enrico Ioculano, who banned residents from feeding migrants.\n\n“He did this ‘decorum’ decree which was in place for several years, with the excuse that some citizens might have tried to poison the food,” said Delia Bonuomo, who ran Bar Hobbit, a bar that was a solidarity hub for immigrants until closing in December last year. “The truth was he didn’t want the issue of migrants in the city. Some of us carried on giving food all the same, risking getting fined.”\n\nBonuomo, nicknamed “Mamma Africa”, opened her bar to migrants at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015, providing them with food, clothes and a place to wash. But as growing numbers of people queued outside, the initiative didn’t please nearby businesses or her Italian customers, who stopped frequenting the bar, a catalyst for its closure. Bonuomo has also been spat at in the street by people blaming her for the crisis.\n\nAnother victim of his own humanity was Father Rito Alvarez, a priest who helped hundreds of people passing through a shelter set up at Saint Antonio church until Ventimiglia authorities closed it down in 2017. Alvarez was later transferred to a mountain parish, where he wouldn’t have the opportunity of helping migrants.\n\n“We helped many vulnerable people but because of the politics, we were forced to close,” said Rito. “The problem was there was no alternative, apart from the Roia shelter, but then that closed too, leaving people abandoned.”\n\nRito said he was worried about the upcoming election, recalling the hardline measures introduced by Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, during his stint as interior minister in 2018-19. The measures included blocking migrant rescue ships, closing shelters and stripping people of two-year permits that had enabled them to work.\n\nMeanwhile, Giorgia Meloni, the Brothers of Italy leader who could become prime minister, has called for the navy to turn people back to Africa.\n\n“These are all worrying policies, but we have always said that the immigration crisis is not only a national one, but a European one,” added Rito.\n\nSeveral protests have been held in Ventimiglia calling for France to open its border, while charity associations have long called for the Dublin agreement, a controversial EU measure that stipulates that those applying for asylum must do so in their first country of arrival, to be scrapped.\n\n“The right says it will close off ports, while it was the left that made an inhumane agreement with Libya to keep migrants there,” said Papini. “Neither side has a desire to resolve it, so the only way to do so would be to get rid of the Dublin agreement and oblige France to open its border.”",
    "Italy election: Energy woes prompt voter apathy, anguish": "The prospect of a harsh winter is overshadowing the Italian vote, with many worrying about how to pay the bills.\n\nRome, Italy – Loredana Longo has little time for Italy’s September 25 election. What is dominating her thoughts instead is how she will be able to pay her sky-high gas bills in the coming winter months. “The situation is catastrophic,” she said.\n\nA teacher at a nursery school in Ciampino, on the outskirts of Rome, Longo makes 1,000 euros ($990) a month. With more than half of her salary going to a mortgage, the 48-year-old single mother of a teenage son has long struggled to make ends meet – but was always able to get by.\n\nNow, with an energy crisis gripping Italy – and the whole of Europe – caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Longo faces difficult choices.\n\n“I have to decide whether to put food on the table, or pay the bills,” she said. Her case is not an isolated one. According to the European Union’s statistical office, Eurostat, nearly 12 million Italians are on the brink of falling below the poverty line – meaning those whose salary is 60 percent lower than the median income.\n\n“This segment of the population is at risk,” said Nunzia De Capite, a sociologist and researcher for Caritas, a leading Catholic charity active across the country. De Capite said that this group, at risk of joining the already 5.6-million poor in the country, include those belonging to the middle class, with small savings and daily jobs, but who are struggling to pay bills and can’t afford any economic shocks.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, combined with Italy’s huge dependency on Russian gas which accounted for 40 percent of imports, is proving the perfect unforeseen storm. The price of electricity for an average household increased by 94 percent in the first trimester this year compared with 2021, while the cost of gas jumped by 131 percent compared with the same period, data from the Italian energy regulator ARERA shows.\n\nThe energy crunch has significantly hurt families’ purchasing power and slowed down industrial production in what could be a worrying mix, Gianfranco Viesti, a professor of applied economics at the University of Bari, told Al Jazeera.\n\nInflation has climbed to nine percent, the highest in decades, hitting the most vulnerable. Studies show that low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on domestic energy costs due to less efficient housing and the use of cheaper but more energy-consuming electricity appliances.\n\n“It is the poor who pay for this energy crisis, not the rich,” Viesti said, sounding the alarm over the risk of a social breakdown. “The number one challenge of the future government will be how to preserve social stability in a tired and discouraged country after 20 years of anaemic growth, with huge inequalities,” he said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, candidates have sparred about the best strategy to tackle the crisis.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy whose coalition is expected to win the elections, has pledged not to increase Italy’s already record-high debt – following the monetary policy of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Italy is the second-most indebted country in the eurozone, with the Bank of Italy recording the country’s highest debt in its history at more than 2,700 trillion euros ($2,635 trillion) this year.\n\n“I won’t ask for more money,” she said during her closing campaign rally in Rome on Thursday. She insisted, once again, on the need to cap gas prices and decouple the price of gas and energy, two proposals that also mark a continuity with the approach of the current government.\n\nMeloni has toned down her Euro-scepticism since the prospect of becoming prime minister became more concrete, in an attempt to reassure markets that she will not be a danger to the European Union’s stability.\n\nBut Meloni’s coalition partner, the hardline and anti-migrant chief of the League party Matteo Salvini, has been pushing for a 30-billion-euro ($29bn) state subsidy to help businesses to cap energy costs – a move that critics warn would make Italy more vulnerable to financial markets and to higher interest rates. The League was polling at nearly 13 percent, according to the latest polls on September 10, nearly half of what Meloni’s Brothers of Italy was predicted to win, suggesting that her policy proposal might prevail.\n\nEnrico Letta, the leader of the Democratic Party, is also in favour of capping gas prices, as well as providing needy families with tools and funding to produce energy from renewable sources, increasing tax credit to compensate for a non-domestic energy price rise and to incentivise businesses to invest more in renewable energies.\n\nBut many Italians are not convinced by the options available. As the pool of people slipping into poverty has increased throughout the years, so has the number of those disenchanted with politics.\n\n“You know what, I am going to write a poem on the voting card,” said Mauro Spadolini, age 21, while serving coffee at a bar in Rome’s working-class neighbourhood of Garbatella. Nearby, Liliana Cortellesi, the owner of a small grocery store, snaps back: “I’m gonna write Draghi across it,” the 72-year-old said, explaining she had no idea who to vote for.\n\nThey are just among the millions of people – more than 40 percent of the eligible people according to a September survey – who say they will abstain from the ballots or are still undecided about who to vote for after a chaotic electoral campaign.\n\nDraghi’s tenure, in power since February 2021, was widely perceived as a moment of stability in Italy’s usually tumultuous politics. But it collapsed in July, becoming the latest government to fall victim to political infighting. Italy has had three governments in the last four years – seven in the last 11 – and this, experts say, has further disenfranchised the populace.\n\n“The public opinion thinks the vote is not that useful considering what parties then do with it,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco, the founding partner of polling firm YouTrend, adding that voter turnout is expected to be the lowest in the history of Italian elections.\n\n“My hands are trembling,” Meloni said when asked how she felt about governing during the campaign. My hands are shaking too, Longo said. But she was thinking about the upcoming winter bills.",
    "Brothers of Italy suspends candidate after online post praising Hitler found": "The far-right Brothers of Italy party has suspended an election candidate after it was discovered he had praised Adolf Hitler and described the group’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, as a “modern fascist”.\n\nCalogero Pisano, a coordinator for Brothers of Italy in the Sicilian province of Agrigento, wrote on Facebook in 2014 that the Nazi leader was “a great statesman”.\n\nThe post, which sparked condemnation from Italy’s Jewish community, emerged in a story by La Repubblica newspaper days before Italians go to the polls in general elections.\n\nThe newspaper found another post by Pisano, written in the same year, saying he supports the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, while the words referring to his party’s leader were written in 2016.\n\nBrothers of Italy, a descendant of the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), leads a coalition that is forecast to win a comfortable victory in the elections on Sunday, paving the way for Meloni to potentially become prime minister.\n\nMeloni has tried to distance her party from its neofascist origins, saying in August that it had “handed fascism to history decades ago”. However, she refused calls to remove the party’s tricoloured flamed symbol, which had come from MSI’s official logo.\n\nWithin a few hours of Pisano’s social media posts reappearing, Brothers of Italy issued a statement saying he had been suspended with “immediate effect”.\n\n“From this moment on, Pisano no longer represents Brothers of Italy at any level and is prohibited from using the symbol,” the statement said, adding that Pisano would be “referred to the party’s supervisory board” for any further action.\n\nPisano said: “Years ago, I wrote things that were deeply wrong and deleted my personal profile on Facebook because I was ashamed. I don’t know how La Repubblica found the posts, but I unambiguously condemn those expressions and apologise to anyone offended by them.”",
    "What is the legacy of outgoing Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi?": "Italians are fairly satisfied with the way Mario Draghi, the country's outgoing technocratic prime minister, navigated the COVID-19 crisis, the war in Ukraine and the consequences both have had on the economy, but as he prepares to leave the Chigi Palace, his legacy appears quite fragile.\n\nAccording to a poll by the Centro Italiano Studi Elettorali released earlier this month, 62.4% of the country's electorate view Draghi's actions over the past 17 months positively.\n\nYet pollsters also predict that the next government will be made up of a right-wing coalition led by the far-right, neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party that will also include the right-wing populist Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Go Italy after Italians head to the polls on Sunday.\n\nOn many issues, these parties stand on opposite sides of the spectrum from Draghi.\n\nThe 75-year-old former head of the European Central Bank is unashamedly pro-EU, has called for tough sanctions on Russia and for strong financial and military support to Ukraine. He's also known as \"Super Mario\" for his leadership at the central bank during the euro crisis.\n\nSo after just a year and a half in office, what is Draghi's legacy in Italy likely to be?\n\nDraghi's COVID-19 recovery package\n\nDraghi was tasked with forming a government in February 2021 following the collapse of a coalition led by the populist Five Star Movement (MS5) that also included the right-wing Northern League party.\n\nAt the time, his main task was to steer the country through the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the vaccination campaign and the country's economic rebuilding.\n\nItaly, like France and Spain, was plunged into recession in 2020 as economic activities all but ground to a halt due to lockdowns and border closures.\n\nAfter establishing a so-called \"big-tent coalition\" that gathered together leftist, centrist and right-wing parties, he quickly set to work on building a plan the EU Commission would approve on how the country would spend the €190 billion it would receive from the bloc's €809 billion resilience and recovery fund.\n\nThe plan he put forward, which includes tough reforms in a reform-reticent country, is perhaps his best chance at a lasting legacy.\n\nThese reforms include modernising the country's public administration and justice system as well as liberalising competition rules and updating fiscal policies. The first two have been passed but now need to be implemented but the other measures have few fans.\n\n\"In practice, it's always possible for the next government to refuse to make the reforms,\" Leila Talani, Director of the Centre for Italian Politics at Kings' College London told Euronews.\n\nBut there would be a big catch. The disbursement of these EU funds is tied to the roll-out of these reforms with a tight timetable in place.\n\n\"The Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni, has already said that there cannot be big changes (to the resilience and recovery plan) — only cosmetic changes — and that means that if the reforms are not implemented, they will not get the money,\" she explained.\n\nDraghi's foreign policy chops\n\nBut COVID is not the only crisis \"Super Mario\" has had to steer his country through.\n\nTwelve months into his tenure, Russia launched a full-scale military attack on its neighbour, unleashing dramatic consequences for Ukraine but for Europeans too as it sent energy prices soaring, and pushed inflation to record levels.\n\n\"Ukraine is probably the dossier in which he made the single biggest difference,\" Luigi Scazzieri, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER), told Euronews.\n\nItaly has deep economic ties with Russia which had until now usually translated into a more conciliatory stance towards Russia on foreign policy matters than other Western EU member states.\n\nYet, Draghi was instrumental in getting France and Germany, which were much more sceptical on the issue, to back granting EU candidate status for Ukraine. He was also at the forefront of the effort to boost support for the war-torn country and to impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"He was significantly ahead of Italian public opinion in saying so and definitely in terms of his support for Ukraine,\" Scazzieri said, in particular when it comes to arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nHis clout at the European and international level, which allowed him to table ideas including a cap on Russian gas prices, something that the EU appears to be slowly moving towards despite first ruling it out as too difficult, is meanwhile attributed to \"his gravitas and the fact that he had already been well known, and was very respected.\"\n\nThis — Italy punching above its weight in the EU — is however likely to end with him as Draghi \"was very constructive. He was able to play the game.\"\n\nA more eurosceptic government, such as one helmed by Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni could be more confrontational with the EU and would make it \"harder for her to be included in the at the heart of the more important debates before the choices are made,\" he said.\n\nWhat that means for EU sanctions against Russia, which have to be unanimously approved by the 27 member states, is unclear.\n\nItaly, Talani said, has a close relationship with the US and NATO so even a more pro-Russia right-wing coalition is likely \"to vote for the sanctions because we really do not want to be marginalised so much.\"\n\n\"But still, it could be a matter for discussion, a debate, and we will weaken our position in Europe by doing something like debating or discussing whether or not there should be sanctions,\" she added.\n\nDraghi 'did all he could'\n\nDraghi is unlikely to leave much of a mark on domestic politics despite managing to wrangle all the warring political parties in a grand coalition. His departure is therefore expected to spell the end of Italy's short-lived political stability and a return to the status quo.\n\nWhen asked why Italian voters approve of Draghi yet are likely to elect a right-wing coalition, Scazzieri said that \"at some stage, you need to return to a prime minister that's elected and to a more normal political life.\"\n\n\"There's also the perception that this grand coalition is somewhat unnatural because it was so much riven by infighting that there's the feeling it's better to have a clean either left-wing or right-wing coalition,\" he added.\n\nItaly has had 11 prime ministers since the turn of the century as coalitions are made and implode. The country's next government may not be able to fare much better.\n\n\"There is the possibility that internal contradictions in the centre right will explode and even if they don't explode, they have a lot of internal contradictions. Believe me, they are not really as united as they look out from outside,\" Talani said.\n\nStill, Draghi achieved essentially everything he wanted to, according to Scazzieri.\n\n\"There's this idea that somehow an individual can come and fix all of a country's issues. And there was a lot of that rhetoric with him just because of how competent he was. And I think he was perhaps more realistic in what he thought he could achieve and wanted to try to tie future governments to this reform path.\n\n\"He, realistically, did all he could and now it's down to others to try to collect the baton,\" he said.",
    "Weather tracker: Deadly floods batter Italy’s Adriatic coast": "European countries around the Adriatic Sea were experiencing extreme flooding towards the end of last week.\n\nThe Italian region of Marche was particularly badly affected after a thunderstorm on Thursday afternoon strengthened into the night. Some areas faced more than 400mm of rain, with much of the deluge falling in a couple of hours.\n\nTen people have been confirmed dead in the aftermath of the floods and three others are missing. Satellite images showed the extent of the disaster with flood water flowing into the sea, turning the normally pristine turquoise Adriatic coast brown.\n\nCroatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina were among the other countries to experience thunderstorms on Thursday and Friday, which caused floods and landslides.\n\nAlthough thunderstorms are not caused by the climate crisis, it is estimated that for every 1C of warming, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture. As a result, a warming world increases the chances of extreme rainfall, which heightens the risk of catastrophic flooding.\n\nThe hot and humid conditions during these thunderstorms has been replaced by a northerly chill that has plunged temperatures below average across most of Europe.\n\nParts of the Alps have reported snowfall accumulating below 1,500 metres, unusual for this early in the season.

    "How Italy is facing a crucial election": "This is an audio transcript of the Rachman Review podcast episode: How Italy is facing a crucial election\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nHello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s edition is about Italy, which faces a crucial election on September the 25th. At the moment, the polls suggest that the largest single party will be the Brothers of Italy and that therefore the party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, will be prime minister. That’s causing consternation in some quarters because the Brothers of Italy has roots in the fascist-influenced politics of postwar Italy. My guest this week is Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs, a think-tank based in Rome. So what does the rise of the Italian populist right mean for Italy and for Europe?\n\nBenito Mussolini\n\n[Speaking in Italian]\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nThe oratory of Benito Mussolini captivated many Italians in the interwar years. But after the war, the vast majority of Italians repudiated Mussolini and fascism. But not all of them. There was a small post-fascist movement. And as a young woman, Giorgia Meloni once praised Mussolini as a good politician. She’s since repudiated these remarks and now likens her political position to that of British conservatives.\n\nGiorgia Meloni\n\nIn these decades, our nation has experienced an unprecedented social and economic decline, with a progressive deterioration of public finances, the quality of life of citizens, and the competitiveness of our businesses. With the left in power, the state has turned hostile to citizens and businesses, increasingly violating individual liberties. Yes, freedom. Freedom is for us, the most precious wealth. This compass guides our historical judgment. The Italian right has handed fascism over history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nEven so, the European Union authorities and the financial markets will be watching events in Italy with attention. It’s not just the rise of the populist right that’s a concern. It’s also that the outgoing prime minister is Mario Draghi, who’s widely respected internationally and often described as the man who saved the euro during his tenure as head of the European Central Bank. So when I got Nathalie Tocci on the line from Rome, I started by asking her about Draghi. What will his departure mean for Italy and the EU?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nIn Europe leadership in many ways is — and has been for a while now — in short supply. And Draghi certainly contributed to filling that vacuum. You know, he brought with him, obviously, you know, the credibility and reputation of what he had done in the past. But I think, you know, sort of also during his tenure as Italian prime minister, he played an extremely important role in, you know, sort of formulating sanctions on Russia, particularly as far as sanctions on the Russian central bank. He was playing an important role currently in the midst of the energy crisis with ideas on energy price caps. He has plenty of ideas and was contributing to them together with Emmanuel Macron on the revision of the growth and stability pact. So he brought with him sort of, you know, competence and credibility and in a sense sort of, you know, it was no longer the France and Germany alone. It was, you know, sort of perhaps if we just kind of recall the image of, you know, sort of Macron, Scholz and Draghi on that train to Kyiv, all of a sudden, the sort of political geography of Europe was changing. And I think it had started also to rejig and change certain old assumptions, you know. It used to be, and particularly now in the context of the Ukraine war, you know, sort of the tendency of east versus west. And in many respects, Italy’s Draghi sort of broke many of those assumptions, you know. It was Draghi that supported very strongly Ukraine’s EU candidacy that I think played an important role in persuading particularly Germany as well as France on accepting that. So in a sense, it was the sort of Italy that was playing a rather unusual role and it was kind of breaking these stereotypes of divisions, which I think particularly at this point in time are just so damaging to the union.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nSo Draghi was seen as a pillar of stability in Brussels and elsewhere. But obviously there will now be concerns about the nature of the new government, particularly given that it’s sometimes described as far-right, the Brothers of Italy, which apparently are likely to be the largest party. Is that how it’s looking?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nYes, it is. But perhaps before I sort of move on to Brothers of Italy, I think a sort of broader comment about what the next Italian parliament may look like. And in a sense, this is a sort of reassuring message. The current parliament has probably been the maddest parliament that Italy has ever had, particularly if we think about exactly Italy’s international positioning, attitudes towards the United States, Europe, Russia indeed. You basically had a 60 per cent of parliament. If we put together Five Star Movement, Lega, and I would argue Forza Italia as well — Berlusconi’s party — that had taken rather friendly attitudes towards the Kremlin, towards China, Eurosceptic attitudes and, you know, sort of on and off when it comes to the transatlantic relationship. But if we take current polls as an indication, basically the support of those three parties taken together is going to be halved. Now moving on to Brothers of Italy, Meloni’s party, what does it mean and what does it not mean? I think as far as the transatlantic relationship is concerned, broadly speaking, the Euro-Atlantic orientation of Fratelli d’Italia, I’m not worried. Meloni has taken consistently a very strong position against Russia and in support of Ukraine. She has very close relations with the United States, particularly obviously with the Republican party, traditionally never had, if you like, relations with the Kremlin. That doesn’t worry me particularly. I think what’s more worrying is in a sense what you know and where she stands as far as Europe and the European project is concerned. But in terms of, you know, why is it that she’s doing so well? I think this really comes down to probably a couple of things. I mean, I think, firstly, it is simply change. I mean, the Italian public is amazingly fickle, you know. It’s, if you just take the last few years, it’s essentially taken Matteo Renzi from 40 per cent support down to, well, if he’s lucky, 2 per cent now. It’s taken the Five Star Movement from 32 per cent to now probably around 10 per cent. Salvini’s Lega from, you know, 40 per cent down to, you know, 12, 13. It wouldn’t surprise me if Meloni does amazingly well, simply because she was the only party, hers was the only party in opposition. But it wouldn’t equally surprise me if in a couple of years time she’s not, she’s polling half that size, you know, half that size. So I think there’s an element of change. But then, I think there’s also something to be said about the fact that she is a very, very smart communicator, and her communication differs widely. If you compare the way in which she’s talking to international audiences as opposed to how she’s talking domestically. Domestically, you know, she kind of puts on her, you know, sort of Garbatella Roman accent. And she speaks in an incredibly fiery way that sort of hits people, you know, right in their, you know, guts. You know, she has this extremely direct way of communicating and internationally, she’s just kind of putting a very, very moderate face on. Now, you know, it sort of remains to be seen what happens after the election, you know, which of these two souls eventually emerges?\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nYeah. I mean, we should talk in a minute about her coalition partners as well. But just sticking with Meloni for a moment, I mean, I think that many people outside Italy are slightly perplexed by the way in which there hasn’t been a sort of total repudiation of Mussolini across the spectrum. And look, she did say these positive things about him, albeit a long time ago now. But what does it mean when people say the Brothers of Italy has its roots in post-fascism or in the more fascist, sympathetic people after 1945? Is that still an important thing?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nWell, you know, there are elements that sort of stem from that ideology, which, you know, sort of mutatis mutandis in the 21st century, you know, still raise eyebrows, you know. It is definitely a nationalist party with a very strong social agenda. So I guess that is, sort of, you know, you can trace the roots of the party and fascism in that respect. She has made some kind of rather odd comments about, you know, having to address youth deviations through, you know, sport. And you can see, you know, sort of, again, where the fascist roots and that kind of thinking sort of lie. Obviously and, you know, this is the kind of most evident thing, you know, the anti-migration stance, sort of adherence to replacement theories. And this links back to the strong connections also with the Republican.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nReplacement theory being the argument that Muslim migration to Europe is so high at the moment that it’s almost like a conspiracy to displace white Italians.\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nPrecisely. Which is, you know, exactly the kind of argument that you kind of hear in, in the United States, you know, amongst the Republican, the sort of Trumpian Republican right. And so you can see where also those connections come from. And then obviously, you know, the sort of anti-LGBTQ stance. So I would say that there is both, if you like, sort of post-fascist roots that come from this nationalist social agenda, but also with the sort of 21st century twists that mainly revolve around migration and LGBTQ.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nAnd you said that you were reasonably confident that she would be pretty conventional on the transatlantic stuff and on Ukraine. But you had a question mark about the European Union. There have been Eurosceptic politicians in power or close to power in Italy before, and yet they’ve always sort of tended to tack back to the EU. I think for whatever reason, maybe it’s just too economically damaging for Italy to take a Eurosceptic position. But where do you think she would actually position herself in the EU? Might she, for example, look to people like Orban, to the Polish government and so on, that populist right section?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nWhat I meant is that whereas on the transatlantic relationship, I think she genuinely believes in the west and the idea of a strong transatlantic relationship. I think she genuinely, what she believes deep down is, you know, she’s a nationalist. She’s Eurosceptic almost by definition. Now, having said this, what does it mean to be Eurosceptic in 2022, 2023, as opposed to 2011, 2012, in the midst of the eurozone crisis or 2015 in the midst of the migration crisis? Well, you know, in a post-pandemic Europe with next-generation EU funds sort of coming in to Italy and over 200bn coming into Italy, you know. A Europe which is associated not with austerity, but, you know, not with giving money, but receiving money at a time in which, you know, for all the attempts being made at hyping up migration, this has actually not been a major issue in the election, you know. This is about the energy crisis. It’s not about migration and energy crisis to the extent that it’s obviously linked to the war in Ukraine. You know, context matters. And so I think that whereas, you know, there’s no love lost on the European Union, I think that she will probably not take a particularly Eurosceptic stance. And then this also connects to the other part of the question, which is indeed, you know, who are her allies going to be? You know, she probably would have loved a world in which there was a sort of cohesive Visegrad group with whom she, you know, particularly the sort of nationalist, populist side of which she had established very strong relations with. But at the moment, there is no such thing in many ways. And, you know, the war in Ukraine has kind of shattered that. And so, you know, to be friends only with Viktor Orbán, well, that’s not a lot of company around the European Council. So if she’s smart — and I think she is smart — she will necessarily have to make other friends, which I think largely explains why she is essentially putting this moderate look in a sense, in the way in which she talks to international audiences. You could then argue whether this is kind of, you know, genuine or not, is almost, you know, beside the point. The point is how is it that she’s going to act? And I think, as your question was suggesting, she may actually not have much of a choice and she will have to adapt to what the context is.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nShe is going to be in coalition, as you pointed out, with the . . . probably with the League and with Berlusconi, both unpredictable elements in their own right. And although, as you point out, she’s been pretty pro-Ukraine, Salvini — the leader of the League — was famously in league with Putin, once wore a Putin t-shirt, I believe, outside the Kremlin. So how big a factor is he going to be and how big a factor will Berlusconi be?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nYes, they will be in government, but then one should also add that they are in government now. You know, Salvini has been in two of the three governments of the current legislature. Berlusconi has been in one — the current one — Draghi’s government. If you end up having, you know, Salvini, that goes down from his current 17 per cent in parliament to 12, 13, and if Berlusconi also goes down to around, I would argue probably between eight and probably not even 10, well, then the weight is actually going to be reduced compared to what it is now. So all this to say that the problems that we’ve seen in the attitudes of these parties are going to remain, you know, especially when it comes to Salvini, I think it’s extremely worrisome what those ties to the Kremlin are. But it’s a problem today and it will continue to be a problem tomorrow. I don’t expect it to be a bigger problem tomorrow compared to what it has been up until now.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nAnd, of course, one of the reasons that these parties will be in government is not just their own political strength, but also the weakness of the centre-left, which seems to be in real trouble. And this also seems to be becoming . . . I don’t know whether it’s a Europe-wide pattern, but it’s certainly very analogous to what’s happened in France, where the left collapsed in the presidential election. How parlous a state is the Italian centre-left in and what do you account for it?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nFratelli d’Italia’s polling at around 25 per cent. The Democrat party is polling at 24 per cent. So actually it’s not doing that badly at all. The problem is, and this i, and perhaps this is the kind of main problem of the left, is that it just tends not to agree with each other. And so whereas in the case of the right, you have Fratelli d’Italia, Berlusconi and Salvini together and therefore collectively come to probably again, according to polls, 48 per cent, according to the latest polls. The centre-left is fragmented in at least three groups. So there is the Democrat party at around 25 per cent. There is the Five Star Movement. I mean, who wants to get together with them after they got Draghi to fall? But they are still polling at around 10 per cent. And then you have this third poll, which basically is a kind of, I would say, more of a liberal-centre rather than left, Calenda, Renzi. And they’re polling at around, you know, six, seven per cent. So if you actually took those three together, they’re polling more or less the same as the right. But the problem is that they are not together. And a third of the seats in parliament are determined by first past the post. So whereas the two-thirds that are proportional representation will see all this being reflected into seats, but the third that is allocated through first past the post is obviously gonna give, you know, the prize to the coalition and yeah, there’s only one coalition and that’s the rightwing one and not one to the left.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nI see. So that is the picture that seems likely to make Meloni prime minister. But just to sort of conclude, I mean, one has to wonder whether it’s a real poisoned chalice for her. I mean, it’s a question I have, you know, in the UK where we’re about to have a new prime minister. Presumably, Italy also has this energy problem and as well, some hints that it may be once again in danger of being sucked into a debt crisis if interest rates rise and if the markets lose confidence. So how do you see the economic situation that Meloni and her colleagues will have to handle?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nWell, it’s dire. And, you know, I mean, I’m not in her head, obviously, but my guess was that actually, she would have been quite happy for Draghi to carry on until next spring. It wasn’t actually Fratelli d’Italia that made Draghi fall. It was the Five Star Movement and Lega and Berlusconi. And I think the reason why she would have much rather had Draghi carry on through this absolutely dreadful autumn and winter and spring that will come is precisely because of, you know, we are already in an energy crisis, it’s already beginning to unleash an economic crisis. And she doesn’t have, obviously, the credibility that Draghi has. You know, it would have been hard for Draghi as well. It would have been hard for anyone, but let alone someone that has to, you know, sort of build up her credentials and has a lot of scepticism, obviously, surrounding her, given her background. So yes, indeed, she’s going to be at an extremely complicated predicament and I think this largely explains why she’s actually being very cautious in terms of, you know, not talking too much about how she would like to renegotiate the recovery fund. Actually coming out very explicitly against the idea of . . . in Italian, we say, [speaking in Italian]. So basically issuing more debt. And on this, there’s actually an axis between her and Draghi, which, you know, sort of may come across as slightly odd bedfellows. But, you know, precisely because she is the one that knows that most likely she will have the responsibility of government. Unlike other parties, she has taken a very firm stance on the budget. Now, the question is, you know, is all this going to be enough, you know, because indeed, the depth of the crisis that we’re in and we will be in is, you know, as I said, it would have been probably almost impossible even for a Draghi to face, let alone Meloni. So big question marks there.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nIs there a sense of crisis, do you think, amongst the public yet? Obviously, those of us who spend our time worrying about sort of debt-GDP ratios or price rises to come are concerned. But do you get the sense that people are concerned, as they are in the UK, that they may not be able to pay their bills, that really hard times are ahead?\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, this is all people talk about. The fact that milk went up to €2. The energy crisis, I mean, this is literally all people talk about. It is all, you know, sort of a switch on also any television. Essentially there is this huge mismatch between the energy crisis and everything connected to it, and this kind of, at times, slightly surreal election campaign in which, you know, just recently, all of the major, sort of, candidates beyond obviously using obsessively, sort of, all platforms have now also, sort of, made that big entry on to TikTok. So there’s this kind of, you know, real mismatch between a crisis that indeed is very much felt and an election campaign that makes at times surreal promises about, you know, abolishing VAT and makes all sorts of sort of, you know, surreal promises at a time in which, you know, not only people feel they’re on the verge of a precipice, but that we’re already falling.\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nAnd Italy, just to conclude, I mean, it’s particularly vulnerable in some respects, isn’t it, because it was particularly dependent on Russian gas and also has this very, very high debt level, which is manageable when interest rates are low, but less manageable when inflation is rising and interest rates are rising.\n\nNathalie Tocci\n\nThe debt issue is the real problem. I would say, you know, it was manageable when there were low interest rates and it was manageable when there was a Mario Draghi that literally could have got away with almost anything with the markets. A completely different scenario, the one that we’re gonna be in after the 25th of September, whoever, you know, whatever happens, and whoever wins. I think when it comes to the dependence on Russian gas, actually, and perhaps that, to conclude on a slightly more positive note, Italy really has made miracles over the last few months. You know, our dependence, as you were saying, used to be 40 per cent. It is now around 10 per cent. And this is not only because of the reduction of flows from Russia, but it’s also because of the additional gas that is coming in, particularly from Algeria, as well as obviously LNG and Azerbaijan. There’s a lot of work that has been, you know, sort of, going on over the last months, particularly vis-à-vis north Africa, Caucasus and sub-Saharan Africa, that has actually placed Italy in a very different predicament in this respect, if we compare it to Germany. Geography helps. You know, we have infrastructure. We have pipelines that Germany doesn’t have. It has one, and it is being shut down. It’s kind of connected to the wrong source. Italy is not in that situation. But, you know, to give, you know, real credit to the Draghi government, this is something that this, I think is probably its biggest success and probably the biggest reason why there was so much joy in the Kremlin when he ultimately fell.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nGideon Rachman\n\nThat was Nathalie Tocci ending this edition of the Rachman Review.

    "Will a right-wing win push Italy towards Russia?": "Italy’s national election on Sunday will likely bring to power parties with historically friendly ties to the Kremlin.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin won a fourth term in 2018, some right-wing leaders in Italy were quick to convey their congratulations.\n\n“The will of the people in these Russian elections is unequivocal,” Giorgia Meloni, the head of the Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party, said on social media at the time.\n\nThat remark has resurfaced in recent weeks, with Meloni poised to become Italy’s first female prime minister, after the collapse of Mario Draghi’s government triggered a national election scheduled for Sunday.\n\nBrothers of Italy party is likely to emerge as the largest political camp and forge a right-wing coalition government with Matteo Salvini’s League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.\n\nThe prospect of a coalition with parties that have historically friendly ties to Russia is increasing fears that Rome could nudge closer to Moscow, at a time when Europe is doing all it can to end the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“This debate is a legitimate one,” Aldo Ferrari, the head of the Russia programme at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), told Al Jazeera. “But the importance of [their ties with Moscow] is being blown out of proportion and used in the electoral campaign as a topic to brandish against the adversary.”\n\nMeloni’s main opponent did not hesitate to sound the alarm.\n\nEnrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, portrayed himself as a candidate fighting “for an Italy that will be in the heart of Europe”.\n\n“On the international stage, those who would be happiest if Giorgia Meloni won would be Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and, in Europe, Viktor Orban,” Letta said, referring to the former US president, Russian leader and Hungary’s nationalist, Moscow-friendly premier.\n\nMeloni has sought to soothe concerns by condemning Russia’s “unacceptable large-scale act of war” and stressing Rome’s ties with the European Union and NATO.\n\n“We will be guarantors, without ambiguity, of Italy’s positioning and of our uttermost support to the heroic battle of the Ukrainian people,” Meloni said at her party’s headquarters last month.\n\nAccording to ISPI’s Ferrari, Meloni has “kept a clear stance on Ukraine” and concerns about Russia relations are inflated.\n\n“I don’t see a shift on her positions as likely,” he said.\n\nDisinformation campaign\n\nMeanwhile, the election follows suggestions that foreign actors might have attempted to meddle in voting campaigns.\n\nCOPASIR, the parliamentary committee that oversees national intelligence agencies, raised the possibility of disinformation, cyberattacks and political and economic pressure emerging from Russia, saying Italy was at risk of becoming “the lock pick with which to break Europe’s Atlanticism.”\n\nA report drafted by the committee warned of a “low-intensity war” being fought alongside the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“This is a hybrid warfare within the cyberspace that justifies adopting every measure to protect our digital system,” it said.\n\nFabio Giglietto, who heads the Mapping Italian News research programme at the University of Urbino, said while disinformation was not new, it bears fruit in electoral times.\n\n“We are particularly concerned about strategies that are difficult to observe because they take place away from the political realm,” Giglietto told Al Jazeera.\n\nAmong them are Facebook groups that purport to be apolitical – such as religious groups – but that are used to reach malleable voters.\n\n“If I attempt to reach people who are already politically engaged, it will be difficult for me to change their opinion. Whereas if I have a page dedicated to religion, people are more likely to be receptive and I can reach them when they are less prepared to defend themselves from external influence,” Giglietto said.\n\nAccording to him, fake Facebook accounts are less of a problem than the spread of fake or misleading information.\n\nWhile Brothers of Italy adopted a more conciliatory tone in its official campaign, the ideas circulated on social media by its supporters often match those of the “alt-right” nationalist movement such as a deep distrust of politicians, fears of a left-wing cultural hegemony, and the “war” on free speech.\n\n“Regardless of how they present themselves, these calls point to their ideas being those of the extreme right rather than its moderate wing,” said Giglietto.\n\nMurky past\n\nWhile the Brothers of Italy has tried to blend into the cultural and political mainstream, critics point to the party’s origins, which trace back to the Italian Social Movement founded in the aftermath of World War II by supporters of executed leader Benito Mussolini, the founder of the National Fascist Party.\n\nIn a campaign video message, Meloni affirmed that Italy’s political right had “handed fascism over to history”.\n\nYet, the party is represented to this day by a neo-fascist symbol, a tricoloured flame, and counts some of Mussolini’s descendants as direct allies, including Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, a great-grandson of the leader, who was a Brothers of Italy candidate at the European Parliament in 2019.\n\nMeloni’s allies have also come under the spotlight following allegations of illicit financing from the Kremlin.\n\nSalvini has repeatedly denied wrongdoing after a recording was leaked in 2019 of one of his aides discussing a secret oil deal in Moscow.\n\nBerlusconi, who is set to make a reappearance after a ban preventing him from holding public office was lifted, is known to be friends with Putin, the pair having stayed in each other’s holiday homes.\n\nIn the aftermath of Draghi’s demise in July, foreign minister Luigi Di Maio alleged the Russian leadership was at work to “destabilise Italy and Europe.”\n\nItalian newspapers reported that Salvini’s League and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia were in touch with the Russian embassy weeks before they withdrew support for Draghi’s government, a move which ultimately led to its collapse, prompting speculations that the Kremlin may be meddling in Italian politics. Both denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLast week, a US intelligence report claiming Russia gave $300m to political parties in more than 12 countries jolted Italy’s election campaign and prompted right-wing leaders to swiftly deny receiving clandestine cash.\n\nAdolfo Urso, a senior Brothers of Italy politician who also heads COPASIR told state broadcaster RAI that “at the moment” there was no indication Italy was among the recipients.\n\nAccording to ISPI’s Ferrari, Draghi’s fall was “undoubtedly welcomed” by Russia.\n\nBut while right-wing parties in the past found an ally in Russia on positions including national sovereignty, the current political climate is remarkably different.\n\n“The invasion of Ukraine has now rendered a shift towards Moscow untenable,” he said.",
    "Berlusconi claims Russians ‘pushed’ Putin into Ukraine war": "Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s three-time former prime minister, whose party is forecast to return to government after the general election on Sunday, has sparked a row after defending the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe 85-year-old billionaire told Italian TV that Putin, an old friend of his, was pushed to invade Ukraine by the Russian people and by ministers who wanted Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration replaced with “decent people”.\n\nBerlusconi, who has condemned the war, told the chatshow Porta a Porta that separatists had gone to Moscow and told the media that Ukraine’s attacks had caused 16,000 deaths and that Putin was doing nothing to defend them.\n\n“Putin was pushed by the Russian population, by his party and by his ministers to invent this special operation,” Berlusconi said. “The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv within a week, replace Zelenskiy’s government with decent people and then leave. Instead they found resistance, which was then fed by arms of all kinds from the west.”\n\nBerlusconi’s Forza Italia is the junior partner in a coalition led by Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right Brothers of Italy and including Matteo Salvini’s League that is forecast to comfortably win the election. Berlusconi is running for senator in the ballot.\n\nDuring his time as prime minister, Berlusconi nurtured close relations with Putin, praising his leadership and helping to forge energy deals that some blame for Italy being so dependent on Russian gas today.\n\nForza Italia and the League supported sending arms to Ukraine when they were part of Mario Draghi’s broad coalition, which collapsed in July, as did Brothers of Italy. As a coalition, they have promised to continue Italy’s support of Ukraine.\n\n“The war has lasted more than 200 days,” Berlusconi said. “The situation has become very difficult. I feel ill when I hear of the dead because I have always believed that war is the greatest madness of all.”\n\nEnrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party, said Berlusconi’s remarks were scandalous and “legitimised Moscow”.\n\nHe said: “Those comments demonstrate that in part of our electoral system, on the right but not only, there are those who, in short, say: ‘Let’s stop this war, let’s give Putin what he wants.’ I find that unacceptable.”\n\nSalvini has also nurtured ties with Russia, heaped praise on Putin in the past and criticised the economic sanctions against the country over its war in Ukraine for “bringing Italy to its knees”.",
    "The Guardian view on Italy’s resistance anthem: sing it loud, sing it proud | Editorial": "The trashing of a song – however illustrious its history – is a minor issue compared with the social divisions that a future government led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy and Matteo Salvini’s League would foment. But the radical right’s targeting of the Italian liberation anthem Bella Ciao during the current election campaign is nevertheless instructive.\n\nOver the years, this ballad of a young partisan who says goodbye to his lover and heads for the mountains to fight Hitler and Mussolini has become an international hymn to liberty. Yves Montand, whose family fled fascist Italy for France, enhanced its fame by recording it in 1964. The folk singer Mercedes Sosa, having escaped the clutches of Argentina’s military junta, gave a famous rendition in Milan in 1983. More recently, in the Middle East, Kurdish fighters adopted it as they fought Isis.\n\nEach year on 25 April, as Italy commemorates its liberation from fascist dictatorship in 1945, Bella Ciao is sung at parties and gatherings across the country. But for obvious reasons – its celebration of the defeat of Mussolini’s Italian Social Republic, the rump fascist state established in northern Italy in 1943 – the song has never featured on the playlists of the Italian far right. Directly after the war, supporters of Mussolini founded the Italian Social Movement (MSI), which saw the dictator’s demise as something to mourn rather than celebrate. Throughout the postwar decades, such views were robustly relegated to the margins of national life, but lingered on in a twilight world of post-fascist nostalgia.\n\nIn recent years, however, Italy’s modern radical right has felt emboldened to wage a culture war against one of the world’s favourite freedom songs. In recent years, far-right politicians have questioned the use of Bella Ciao in schools and described it as a recruitment tool for the politically correct left. During the current election campaign, the sledging appeared to pay off when a well-known singer, Laura Pausini, refused to sing the song on the grounds that it was “too political”. This week, Mr Salvini hailed Ms Pausini’s decision as a victory against leftwing propaganda. “The left will be saying Bella Ciao to power after the election,” he said.\n\nBella Ciao is not a leftwing song; it is not leftwing to oppose fascism and insist on universal human rights and freedom from oppression. But it is a song that draws uncomfortable attention to past connections the modern far right wants to airbrush out of history. Brothers of Italy comes from the same political tradition as the MSI and its successor, the National Alliance. Its logo still carries the MSI’s tricolour flame.\n\nA Brothers of Italy election candidate has just been suspended by the party, after a Facebook post was discovered in which he praised Hitler and described Ms Meloni as a “modern fascist”, a claim she denies. As the party seeks to enter the respectable mainstream, the true propaganda is coming from those who seek to undermine and confuse Italy’s collective memory of the horrors of fascism and the political forces that were responsible.",
    "Nations League: England relegated after defeat in Italy – as it happened": "3d ago 17.06 Gareth Southgate doesn’t make it out in time to talk to Channel 4, who must be thinking they’ve been sold a right pup with this England deal. That’s five matches they’ve shown. Three defeats, two draws, and the only goal England have scored is a Harry Kane penalty. Not sure they’ve transmitted anything as relentlessly downbeat since the days of Murun Buchstansangur.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.56 Gareth Southgate went over to applaud the England travelling support at the end of the match. He was greeted with audible booing. There’s now nothing riding on the Germany game at Wembley on Monday night … and yet so much depends on it. The mood music isn’t great with one match and two months to go until England start their World Cup campaign. Another loss would really set the alarm bells ringing. What England could do with a first win since March, and a little breathing space. Big game coming up!\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.50 England are in a dark place right now. That’s a third defeat in their last five games. Their winless sequence is five, their worst run since 2014 under Roy Hodgson. They’ve gone over seven and a half hours without scoring a goal in open play. The World Cup is just around the corner. “It’s obviously disappointing,” Declan Rice tells Channel 4. “Every tournament we set out to win the group and progress and win every game. Obviously in the Nations League we’ve slipped below our standards. But I didn’t think it was all bad tonight. One chance, one goal, we controlled the game but lacked that cutting edge. But it’s coming, and that’s a much better performance than the summer. It’s not as though we’re not creating the chances. I see it in training, there’s goals for fun. Trust me, we’re going to be good!”\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.45 ALSO FULL TIME: Germany 0-1 Hungary. Hungary remain top of Group A3, now with ten points. Italy leapfrog Germany into second place on eight points. Germany sit third on six, while England prop up the group with two points. That means … Hungary will win the group and make the finals if they hold Italy in Budapest on Monday\n\nItaly can still win the group and make the finals if they beat Hungary\n\nGermany can no longer win the group or make the finals\n\nEngland are relegated to tier B\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.40 FULL TIME: Italy 1-0 England The whistle goes. A deserved victory for Italy. England are relegated to tier B. The final whistle blows as England are relegated from their group. Don’t worry, the World Cup is only eight weeks away. Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 19.00 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.39 90 min +6: James shovels a cross into the Italy box from the right. It’s a fine delivery that finds Bellingham six yards out. Bellingham heads over. That’s surely England’s last chance to save themselves.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.38 90 min +5: Gnonto turns on the jets down the left, and draws a foul from James. The clock ticks on, and Italy look in control. On the touchline, Southgate looks pensive, hands in pockets, staring glumly ahead.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.37 90 min +4: Grealish is booked for deliberate handball. That means he’s suspended for the Germany match. Jack Grealish gets a yellow. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nUpdated at 16.51 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.36 90 min +3: Rice swans in from the left and a little bit of space opens up. He aims a curler towards the bottom right, but it’s telegraphed, and an easy gather for Donnarumma.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.35 90 min +2: England press forward, but Italy hold their shape on the edge of the box.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.35 90 min +1: The first of six added minutes. A doofus comes onto the pitch and runs about like a galoot, so expect seven at least now.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.34 90 min: Gnonto slaloms into the England box from the left, only for his shot to be blocked by Dier.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.32 89 min: Dimarco makes way for Frattesi, while Jorginho is replaced by Emerson.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.31 88 min: Di Lorenzo sashays in from the right and rolls across for Cristante, in acres on the edge of the D. He’s got to work Pope at the very least, but flays wildly over. Will Italy regret their profligacy?\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.29 85 min: Gabbiadini breaks clear down the inside-left channel and hammers a shot straight at Pope. The Italian takes up possession again and slips a pass down the left for Dimarco, who creams a shot across Pope and off the base of the right-hand post. Shaw does well to avoid deflecting the rebound into the net, shifting his feet adroitly to turn and hack clear. Italy inches away from sealing England’s fate. Federico Dimarco hits the post as Italy are so close to a second goal. Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 16.34 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.26 83 min: Bellingham makes a bit of space down the inside-left channel, his twists and turns earning himself the right to shoot. He aims for the top left, but he’s leaning back, and the ball’s always flying over.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.25 82 min: With ten minutes to go in Germany, it’s still 1-0 to Hungary. With less than ten to go in Milan, England are heading for tier B. As things stand.\n\nUpdated at 16.50 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.24 81 min: Before it can be taken, the goalscorer Raspadori is replaced by Gabbiadini. James then sees his free kick dispatched safely by Donnarumma.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.23 80 min: Di Lorenzo is booked for a fairly agricultural block on Grealish, just to the left of the Italy D. A free kick in a dangerous position.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.22 78 min: England continue to press Italy back, albeit without making another chance. They’ve looked a bit brighter since the introduction of Grealish. “Watching with a mixed assortment of Neapolitans and English here in Naples,” reports Colum Fordham. “Massive reaction by Neapolitan contingent to the superbly taken goal by Raspadori, Napoli’s new young striker.”\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.20 76 min: Nor will this. Foden, Grealish and Bellingham shuttle the ball left to right across the face of the Italy box. Bellingham slips one down the channel for Kane, who pearls low and hard towards the goal. Donnarumma parries brilliantly. Kane tries again. Donnarumma blocks again. Italy clear. That’s England’s best move of the match. Jack Grealish goes to ground. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP\n\nUpdated at 16.32 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.18 74 min: Kane tries to close down Donnarumma. The Italy keeper sees him off with a cheeky Cruyff Turn. That’s unlikely to have improved the England captain’s foul mood.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.15 72 min: Southgate responds by sending on Grealish and Shaw for Saka and Walker.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.15 71 min: James floats a free kick in from the right. Dier can’t get his header on target. Miles wide right.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.13 70 min: Walker afforded Raspadori far too much space and time there. None of the other England defenders seemed particularly switched on, either. As things stand, England will be relegated from the top tier.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.12 GOAL! Italy 1-0 England (Raspadori 68) Out of not very much at all, a wonder goal! Raspadori takes delivery of a speculative pass down the inside-left channel. He brings it down from the sky, takes a touch to the left, drops a shoulder back to the right, sending Walker off to the shops, and whips a sensational shot across Pope and into the right-hand side of goal. One hell of a finish! Giacomo Raspadori scores a rasper to put Italy ahead. Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 16.22 EDT\n\n3d ago 16.10 66 min: A corner on the right leads to another on the left. Dimarco takes. Pope punches clear again, and this time England clear their lines. Bellingham is clipped by Cristante causing Kane to sound off in the referee’s face. A little bit of edge coming into this game.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.08 65 min: Di Lorenzo rolls a flat-footed Maguire down the right, drawing a foul. England don’t clear the resulting free kick, and Raspadori ends up shooting from a tight angle on the right. Pope punches out for a corner.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.07 63 min: Italy make a double change, replacing Scamacca and Barella with Pobega and Gnonto.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.06 61 min: From the corner, Bellingham goes up for a high ball with Barella. The pair collide with Bellingham in mid-air, and the England man falls on his back. He’s winded. England claim a foul – it was right on the edge of the penalty box – but both referee and VAR rule it a 50-50 accident. There was no malice on Barella’s part, but it was a clumsy challenge, and you’ve seen fouls given for less. Jude Bellingham takes a tumble.

Sterling hopes to get on the end of it by the left-hand post, but Toloi flicks out for a corner, just in time.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.03 59 min: Bellingham romps down the middle and sprays a pass wide left for Foden, who tries to find Kane at the far stick. Acerbi gets in the road to flick out for a corner, but the flag goes up for offside.\n\n\n\n3d ago 16.01 57 min: Raspadori rolls a cute pass down the left for Dimarco, who rolls the ball into the box for Barella. He’s got to score from ten yards, with only Pope to beat, but slides his effort wide right. What a miss! His blushes are spared when the flag goes up for offside.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.59 55 min: Kane takes matters into his own hands and wanders back on anyway. The referee comes across to give him a small bollocking, but doesn’t add insult to injury by booking him for insubordination.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.58 54 min: Kane is good to continue, yes, but he’s not been allowed back on yet. He’s fuming, but it looks like he’s still bleeding, and so the assistant ref isn’t allowing him back on. Ouch! Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nUpdated at 16.02 EDT\n\n3d ago 15.56 53 min: Replays show Toloi accidentally nutting Kane slap bang in the mouth. There’s a fair bit of blood but the physio mops it up, stems the flow, and the England captain will be good to continue.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.54 51 min: James hits the cross long. Kane goes up with Toloi. The ball sails over their heads and out for a goal kick. Kane meanwhile crashes to the floor holding his face. On comes the physio.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.53 50 min: Kane makes his way down the inside-left channel before hitting a cross-cum-shot that’s deflected out for a corner by Bonucci. James to take.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.52 49 min: James tries to whip-curl the free kick into the top-right corner. The ball nestles in the top-right corner of the stand behind.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.51 48 min: … but then the game springs to life at last! Dimarco curls in viciously from the left. Scamacca can’t quite get on the end of the low cross to fire home. England immediately counter through Sterling, who dribbles down the inside-left channel and draws a cynical foul from Bonucci. A yellow card for the Italian captain, and a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.50 46 min: A scrappy start to the half, with both teams shipping possession far too easily. It doesn’t augur well.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.48 Italy get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.44 Half-time postbag. “Dear Christ, this is awful, isn’t it? Two games from a World Cup? Yikes.” Ben Watson there, with an email that reads even more glumly if you come at it from an Italian perspective. Meanwhile in lieu of meaningful action at San Siro, Kári Tulinius reports: “The first half of Finland v Romania has been decently entertaining. The latter have probably been the better team, but Teemu Pukki is a forward who can reliably shoot the ball hard and hit the target, so despite Romania having more and better chances, the Eagle-Owls lead 1-0. Enjoy the 2nd half!” We’ll try.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.36 ALSO HALF TIME: Germany 0-1 Hungary. Adam Szalai with the only goal so far on 17 minutes. As things stand, Hungary will win Group A3 and make it through to the finals.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.33 HALF TIME: Italy 0-0 England The referee blows up on 44 minutes and 59 seconds. You can’t blame him. That wasn’t much of a spectacle. Channel 4 aren’t getting much bang for their buck from this England deal, are they.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.31 43 min: Another Foden free kick from the left. This one’s better, towards Rice on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. Bonucci is forced to eyebrow out for a corner, but that’ll never be taken, because the whistle goes for shoving. Rice really didn’t do too much wrong there, and looks understandably incensed.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.29 42 min: Kane is given an absurd amount of space to run into. He strides down the middle, thinks about passing, thinks again, then blooters over the bar from 30 yards. Donnarumma calmly watches the ball sail away.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.27 40 min: Italy push England back. Acerbi threatens down the inside-left channel, but then Foden nips in the road and wins a free kick. The pressure on England is released.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.26 38 min: Scamacca knocks a long ball down for Cristante, who creams a first-time shot goalwards. It deflects away from danger, off the back of his own man Scamacca.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.24 37 min: Bellingham meets the corner on the edge of the box, but can only send a weak bouncer through to Donnarumma. England have suddenly taken it up a notch.\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.23 36 min: Bellingham works his way down the right and earns England a corner. James takes. More bagatelle. Dimarco is forced to hack out for another corner on the same side. James to take again.\n\n",
    "Italy elections: Who has spent the most money on Facebook ads?": "With just days until Italy’s general election, campaigning has intensified with parties holding rallies across the country.\n\nParties and candidates have also invested heavily in online ads, in addition to posters and billboards on the street.\n\nA number of party leaders and candidates, including Go Italy (Forza Italia's) Silvio Berlusconi, notably set up Tik Tok accounts in the run-up to the polls to appeal to younger voters.\n\nIn Italy, the biggest online audience may be found on Facebook, with around 38 million users, according to Statista.\n\nUsing Facebook’s own Ad Library, Euronews has investigated which parties and candidates have spent the most money on Facebook Ads in the last 30 days, from August 22 to September 20.\n\nThe Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d’Italia) – led by Giorgia Meloni and currently first in the polls – are the biggest spenders. The right-wing party has spent €119,311 on 73 political advertisements on Facebook its official page, more than €43,000 more than any other party or organisation.\n\nAfter initially spending less than their political rivals, they have ramped up their online spending by targeting voters in central and southern Italy.\n\nMeloni, in particular, is one of the most followed Italian party leaders on Facebook (having over 2.4 million) and a further €21,411 has been spent on Facebook Ads on her own official page.\n\nIn total, Brothers of Italy has spent more than €140,00 on Facebook ads in the last 30 days, more than humanitarian organisations such as Save the Children, Emergency and Unicef Italy.\n\nThe regions where all parties spent the most money on Facebook ads were Lombardy (€263,004), Sicily (€259,358), and Campania (€231,581).\n\nLombardy is the richest and by far the most populous region of Italy. Sicily and Campania, historically known for voting for right-wing parties, were mostly won by the Five Star Movement (M5S) in Italy’s last election in 2018.\n\nOther members of the centre-right coalition in Italy also spent heavily on Facebook ads.\n\nWhile the League's official page invested only €6,000, the official page is its leader Matteo Salvini spent €62,655 on ads alone. Salvini is the most followed politician in Italy on Facebook and regularly spends money on online ads.\n\nSeverino Nappi, a regional councillor for Salvini’s party in Campania, has also spent €25,987 since August 22.\n\nSimilarly, Forza Italia spent five times as much money on ads for their leader Berlusconi than they did on the party's official page.\n\nMeanwhile, Coraggio Italia – a member of the Us Moderates group – spent a huge €59,305 on ads in the last 30 days\n\nIn total, the centre-right coalition spent more than €292,000 on Facebook Ads on the official pages of their parties or party leaders.\n\nBy contrast, the centre-left coalition invested around half as much in the same period (less than €149,000).\n\nThe More Europe (+E) party were the centre-left coalition's biggest spender at €57,234, while the Democratic Party (PD) invested a total of only €46,540 and no money at all on the Facebook page of their leader Enrico Letta.\n\nAmong the leaders of major parties in Italy, Letta has the fewest number of followers on Facebook.\n\nHowever, an unofficial Facebook page for PD supporters spent a further €27,603 on 8 Facebook ads in the last 30 days, while one PD candidate, Antonio Misiani, spent another €13,006 on online Facebook advertising.\n\nThe centre-right Civic Movement (IC) of Luigi di Maio and the populist M5S of Giuseppe Conte spent far more money on ads on their leader's Facebook pages than their own.\n\nIn fact, the official page of the Five Star Movement has not invested in advertisements in the last 90 days.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of Italexit -- Gianluigi Paragone -- whose party does not have an official Facebook page, spent €7,364 on ads in the last 30 days.\n\nItaly's Data Protection Agency has recently asked Facebook to clarify its information campaign that targets potential Italian voters.\n\nMeta says the initiative aims to counter interference and remove content that discourages voting, in collaboration with independent fact-checking organisations.\n\nThe social network will have to provide \"detailed information\" on their data processing methods to ensure the initiative only affects users aged 18 and over, the watchdog said.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said that the company's Italian election tools have been \"expressly designed to respect users' privacy\" and comply with the EU's strict data protection rules (GDPR).\n\n\"We are cooperating with the Italian Data Protection Authority to explain how we are working to help protect the integrity of the Italian election and to connect people with reliable election information from the Ministry of Interior\", the spokesperson added.",
    "Italy appears likely to elect its most right wing leader since World War II": "Italy appears likely to elect its most right wing leader since World War II\n\nItaly heads for a historic election. If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party wins Sunday's election, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nItalians vote on Sunday. It seems likely they'll elect the country's most right-wing government since World War II. If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy Party comes out on top, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister. Adam Rainey reports from Rome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGIORGIA MELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nADAM RAINEY, BYLINE: Giorgia Meloni's Twitter feed is full of scenes like this, taking the stage in Italian cities across the country. They all look similar - dozens, sometimes hundreds of people waving flags for her Brothers of Italy party as she sprints to the stage. Milan, Palermo, Genoa - the feed is like a map of Italy meant to show her national, not just nationalist appeal. Although her party has roots in Italy's postwar neo-fascist movement, Meloni, who is 45, is making great pains to distance herself from fascism.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: Speaking on one of Italy's main evening newscasts, Meloni sarcastically jokes that her opponent on the left don't seem to realize that fascism ended 30 years before she was born. Just this week, though, her party suspended a member after an Italian newspaper revealed he had made statements supporting Adolf Hitler on social media eight years ago. The fascism label may trouble Meloni. Hard-right positions clearly don't. Here she is in August.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: She's saying her party supports a naval blockade to stop illegal immigration from North Africa. And here she is, fired up on stage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMELONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: She says she has a dream that Italians won't have to lower their heads in shame or worry they'll lose their jobs for their political beliefs, a clear message to people who support her party's pro-Catholic, anti-immigrant, anti-woke positions, as she has called them. Some Italians fear a Meloni government would move to outlaw abortion, legal in Italy since 1978. But she has gone on the record saying she has no plans to do so. She also says she has no plans to go soft on Russia. Meloni has long been a Eurosceptic but has repeatedly promised she'll work with the EU and can be trusted as a steady hand to manage 200 billion euros in European pandemic recovery funds. It's Meloni's opposition to immigration that has animated her and her base.\n\nLORENZO CASTELLANI: She is proposing herself as a sort of defender of the borders - so a very Trumpian approach.\n\nRAINEY: That's Lorenzo Castellani, a historian at Rome's LUISS University.\n\nCASTELLANI: The real majority of people who are concerned about illegal immigration are scared, and they are using this fear very well to convince people to support their political agenda.\n\nRAINEY: Political writer Federico Fubini is a Meloni critic but says she is politically astute for having refused to take part in the national unity government that just collapsed.\n\nFEDERICO FUBINI: The main reason why she's leading in the polls is because she's perceived as the one that was not in power for the last 10 years.\n\nRAINEY: Meloni's party won't win anything near a majority of seats in parliament alone. But her coalition with two other right-wing parties, including Forza Italia, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSILVIO BERLUSCONI: (Speaking Italian).\n\nRAINEY: ...Heard here trying to reach out to young voters on TikTok, is expected to win a clear majority. If Meloni's coalition wins and she is named prime minister, she'll take office almost exactly 100 years after Benito Mussolini took the reins of power in Rome. She says his ideology is in the past. Many Italians and Europeans hope she'll stick to her word. For NPR News, I'm Adam Rainey in Rome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MULATU ASTATKE'S \"KASALEFKUT-HULU\")\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia, file)\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) — Italy’s European Union partners are signaling discomfort, even vigilance, after Italy, one of the bloc’s founding members, swung far to the political right. The result of Italy’s latest election raises troubling questions about whether Rome will maintain its commitments to EU principles, laws and ambitions.\n\nThe French prime minister on Monday said her government, along with EU officials, would be watching to ensure that basic human rights are guaranteed in Italy after Giorgia Meloni’s neo-fascist far-right Brothers of Italy Party topped the vote count in Sunday’s parliamentary election.\n\n“In Europe, we uphold some values and obviously we will ensure, and the president of the commission will ensure, that these values — on human rights, the respect of other people, especially the respect of the right to abortion — will be respected by all (member states),” Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told French broadcaster BFM TV.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch statements among the longtime EU partners are highly unusual and follow European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s pre-election warning that Europe “has the tools” to deal with any country — and that means Italy too — if things go “in a difficult direction.”\n\nThe 27-nation European Union is already beset by challenges, including rising inflation and energy costs, and it does not need the threat that a far-right Italian leader might joint a strident nationalist bloc, including Hungary and Poland, that has repeatedly assailed EU democratic standards.\n\nEuropean leaders will be watching to see which Meloni emerges: the firebrand who has railed against LGBT rights, Islamist violence and mass migration as well as Brussels’ bureaucrats, or the one who has toned down her rhetoric in recent weeks and has backed EU support for Ukraine.\n\n“It is too early to tell what will change for the EU and its balance of power,” said Arturo Varvelli, from the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank.\n\nOn the one hand, Varelli said, Meloni’s focus on Italy’s national interests will not help strengthen European sovereignty.\n\n“However, Meloni has also changed her political line in recent months, for example, with regard to policy toward Russia,” he said. “This contributes to the unpredictability of the pro-European line of the future Italian government.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe likelihood that a euroskeptic will head Italy, the EU’s third-largest economy, is a potential blow for a European project already struggling with nationalism. It also comes just weeks after a party founded by extremists became the second-largest one in Sweden’s parliament.\n\nPredictably, right-wing parties across Europe were fortified by the result.\n\n“Sweden in the north, Italy in the south: Left-wing governments are so yesterday,” tweeted Beatrix von Storch, a leading member of the Alternative for Germany party.\n\nPortugal’s populist Chega said Italy’s shift to the right heralds a “political reconfiguration” in Europe. After the election outcome in Sweden, the party said, it is “Italy’s turn to send a clear signal that the European continent is undergoing deep change.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders tweeted an image of the Italian flag with the words: VIVA ITALIA and a heart emoji.\n\nBut of most immediate concern at EU headquarters in Brussels is probably whether Meloni will link with Hungary and Poland to target one of the key pieces of European legal architecture: that EU treaties and law must have primacy over national law.\n\nHungary and Poland have used Europe’s top court to challenge the EU’s legitimacy on issues including migration policy and judicial independence. Hungary, notably, is blocking sanctions against Russia, but is also a thorn in the EU’s side in many other areas ranging from tax policy to foreign policy statements.\n\nWith Italy on board, things could be far more complex for the EU, given the routine need for unanimous votes from the 27 member countries.\n\n“One of the EU’s basic dilemmas — unity versus ambition — has become much more difficult following the Italian elections,” tweeted Janis Emmanouilidis at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre think tank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere has also been concern about whether Meloni’s likely coalition partner, right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini, will return to Italy’s interior ministry, from where he once led a crackdown on migrant arrivals from northern Africa and any charity groups that might try to help them. Meloni herself has called for a naval blockade to prevent migrant boats from leaving African shores, and both she and Salvini want Europe to screen potential asylum-seekers in Africa.\n\nBut even without a shift in position in Italy, the EU is already deeply divided over asylum policy and focused on outsourcing its migration challenges to the countries people leave or transit to get to Europe.\n\nMeloni also has suggested that she wants to renegotiate parts of the pandemic economic recovery package agreed with Brussels, which is worth close to $200 billion to Italy — a significant amount given its massive debt problem. Political opponents at home have raised concerns about her ability to properly administer the funds, a perennial issue for Italy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Brussels, the EU commission declined to comment on the election result or the fact that many voters had chosen anti-European parties. “We of course hope that we will have constructive cooperation with the new Italian authorities,” spokesman Eric Mamer said.\n\n___\n\nBarry reported from Milan.

    "Italy’s Salvini fires up base in northern fiefdom": "Italy’s anti-immigration leader Matteo Salvini, who is trailing the far-right’s Giorgia Meloni in the polls ahead of next week’s general election, sought on Sunday (18 September) to galvanise his hard-right, populist, eurosceptic base.\n\n“This is Italy, full of hope and dreams and looking to the future,” Salvini told the crowd in the northern town of Pontida, which has for three decades been the venue for the annual mass gathering of the far right.\n\nOn Sunday it was awash with the flags representing Italy’s provinces and the banners of the General Labour Union (UGL), founded in 1996 from the ashes of the neo-fascist CISNAL union.\n\nSalvini’s League party claimed 100,000 people had turned up, many bussed in to hear “Il Capitano”, drink beer and buy T-shirts bearing Salvini’s name and the slogan “Italians first”.\n\nThe League is trailing Meloni’s post-fascist Brothers of Italy (FDI), polling at 12% to the FDI’s 24.\n\nSurveys suggest immigration is less of a concern for Italians than the rampant inflation squeezing already stagnant wages.\n\nSalvini hailed the result of the Swedish general election, where voters “sent the left packing” and ushered in an alliance of the right and far right.\n\nHe conceded Americans had rejected former US president Donald Trump and his cry of “America first” in favour of Democrat Joe Biden. “That’s democracy,” he said.\n\nSalvini said the League’s top six priorities were to curb soaring energy prices and develop nuclear power, give more decision-making powers to the regions, make tax and legal reforms, guarantee retirement at 41 years of service and stop immigrant boats landing on Italy’s shores.\n\nHe also proposed scrapping the TV licence fee, defended women’s right to have an abortion and “traditional values” around gender and the family.\n\n‘A lion entering the arena’\n\nThe League, FDI and former leader Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia form a coalition seen as favourites for the 25 September poll.\n\nThe League’s current estimated vote share of 12% would represent a notable decline from its performances in 2018 and 2019 as it participated in successive governments while FDI remained in opposition.\n\nLeague activist Anna Valdotta, 67, told AFP some supporters had not forgiven Salvini and left, but she remained loyal to the man she compared to “a lion entering the arena”.\n\nStefano, a 27-year-old postman, praised Meloni’s leadership and said she had won votes rather than Salvini losing them.\n\nThe League has toned down its secessionist aspirations for Lombardy, focusing instead on what it calls a European Union dominated by Germany and France “that declares war on Italian farmers and fishermen”.\n\nThe mainstream left-wing Democratic Party (PD) held a rally in nearby Monza, where its leader Enrico Letta criticised the Italian right’s links to populist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.\n\nPD is predicted to arrive in second place with 21% of the votes and has no major support among the left and centre.",
    "‘Vote for us to never see her again’: fury after Italy politician’s video with Roma woman": "A politician with Italy’s far-right League has sparked outrage after implying that the party would rid the streets of Roma people if it wins general elections later this month.\n\nAlessio Di Giulio, a League councillor in Florence, filmed a video of himself walking up to a Roma woman and, speaking to the camera, said: “Vote for the League on 25 September and you’ll never see her again.”\n\nDi Giulio made the clip as he walked along a busy street in the centre of Florence, and the woman happily waved before realising his intention. “No, don’t say that,” she responded. “I am not afraid.”\n\n00:21 ‘Vote for us to never see her again’: Italian politician's video with Roma woman sparks fury – video\n\nThe League, led by Matteo Salvini, is part of a three-way coalition including its far-right counterpart Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italy that is forecast to win the elections.\n\nClamping down on the Roma community by conducting a census and expelling those living in Italy illegally was among Salvini’s pledges in the 2018 national vote.\n\nDi Giulio’s video was condemned by Enrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party.\n\n“Some shocking things are happening in this election campaign,” said Letta, referring also to Giorgia Meloni, the Brothers of Italy leader and the country’s possible next prime minister who last month shared a video of a Ukrainian woman being raped by an asylum seeker in an Italian city. “How much further will they go?”\n\nDi Giulio defended himself against accusations of racism by Dario Nardella, the mayor of Florence, arguing that he has a Nigerian girlfriend and simply wanted to denounce “the crime of begging”. While there are some restrictions, it is not a crime to beg in Italy.\n\nSalvini said the video was “dumb”. “You resolve problems with the forces of law and order, with resolutions, not with videos taking it out on one person,” he added.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her party leads the rightwing coalition and edged up to almost 26% in an opinion poll on Tuesday, widening the gap with the Democratic party, which polled at 21.4%.\n\nTraditional supporters of the League, especially business owners in its northern strongholds, are turning their backs on the party as a result of Salvini’s contribution to the collapse of Mario Draghi’s government in July and his stance on sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSalvini, who has previously heaped praise on Vladimir Putin, said on Monday that rather than hurting Russia the sanctions were damaging the countries imposing them. His position clashes with that of Meloni, who sought to reassure international observers that if the coalition enters government, it would support Ukraine and abide by the EU and Nato line on Russian sanctions.",

    "The exclusive Italian favourite that's surprisingly great for children": "It is fitting the finale of Casino Royale was filmed at suave, sophisticated Lake Como: if James Bond were a place, this diamond of the Italian lakes would be he.

Some of its hotels are exceptionally family-friendly and it is well worth seeking them out.\n\nThe family-run Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, for example – a favourite of Queen Victoria, Al Pacino, George Lucas and Winston Churchill, to name a few – could not have been more welcoming when I visited this summer with my husband and four children (aged 20 months, five, seven and nine).

    "Euro crashes to record low against dollar as Italy's Giorgia Meloni and far right win": "The euro slid to a fresh 20-year low on Monday, falling below 96 cents against the US dollar ― the steepest decline in two decades ― after the rise of a far-right party in Italy's election rattled investor confidence.\n\nThe single currency, which came into physical circulation in 2002, slumped to $0.9550 against the greenback, before rising again. It was trading at $0.9613 at 9.21pm UAE time.\n\nThe euro has been trading below or near parity since mid-August amid a historic energy crisis in Europe compounding the effects of surging inflation. The currency has dropped by more than 15 per cent against the dollar this year.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, who heads the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party, could become Italy's first female prime minister.\n\nMs Meloni has campaigned on an anti-European platform and her coming to power would mark the first far-right-led government since the Second World War.\n\nThe elections took place on Sunday after the collapse in July of Mario Draghi’s government, which had restored Italy's influence and credibility. His resignation prompted Italian bonds yields to rise as prices fell.\n\n\"The euro has been shattered this morning,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\nThe rise of Ms Meloni and her right-wing alliance with Matteo Salvini's League party and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia was \"the terrible consequence of the pandemic, the war and the energy crisis\", Ms Ozkardeskaya said.\n\nThe euro \"will certainly remain under pressure as the Italian yields will likely detach from the rest of the eurozone and run toward the north. The wider yield spread between Italian and German bonds will likely continue pressure the euro lower\", she said.\n\n\"As a result, the European Central Bank should get more aggressive on its rate policy to stop the euro’s crumbling. But it may not get the euro’s back fast enough to avoid inflation spiral higher.\"\n\nMonetary tightening by central banks around the world to tame inflation and a strengthening US dollar that has reached a record high this year has also put pressure on the euro and other major currencies.\n\nItaly has, as of April, about €2.75 trillion ($2.65tn) of sovereign debt, the world's third largest after the US and Japan. It faces higher debt costs as the ECB raises interest rates.\n\n\"Fiscal policy under Italy’s next government will have to adapt to higher interest rates and the energy crisis if public debt is to be reduced,\" Fitch Ratings said in a new report this month.\n\nFitch estimates that if 10-year sovereign bond yields stay close to 4 per cent, higher primary balances would be needed to keep the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio on a downward path. If yields remain at about 4 per cent, debt would remain stable at about 150 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe ECB raised its key interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points on September 8 and indicated further increases were coming as Europe is likely to slide into a recession.\n\nThe euro area annual inflation rate was 9.1 per cent in August 2022, up from 8.9 per cent in July. A year earlier, the rate was 3.0 per cent. EU annual inflation was 10.1 per cent in August 2022, up from 9.8 per cent in July.\n\nWeak economic indicators and the anticipation of a right-wing win in Italy's polls piled pressure on the currency and markets on Friday.\n\nThe EuroStoxx index fell by 2.3 per cent on Friday. It is down by about 23 per cent this year.\n\nThe release of the eurozone purchasing managers index (PMI) on Friday showed that business conditions deteriorated further in September.\n\nThe S&P Global flash eurozone composite PMI fell to a 20-month low, sliding to 48.2 from 48.9 in August. This is the third consecutive reading below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. A reading below 50 indicates deteriorating conditions.",
    "Right-wing populism is becoming the mainstream in Europe, as Italy’s new government shows": "Far-right parties in Europe that have long been ostracised are now gaining ground across the continent, as their anti-immigration and Eurosceptic ideology becomes the mainstream.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the leader of the Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party that has neo-fascist roots, is to become Italy’s first female prime minister at the head of its most right-wing government since the Second World War.\n\nThis comes only weeks after the Sweden Democrats, a far-right anti-immigration party, won the second-largest share of the votes in the Scandinavian country’s elections on Sunday 11 September.\n\nIt coincides with the increased support for right-wing populism seen elsewhere in Europe in the past decade, with the Law and Justice in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary permeating mainstream ground with their anti-immigration and pro-nationalist narratives to become the ruling parties.\n\nProjections based on votes counted from some two-thirds of polling stations showed the Brothers of Italy ahead of other contenders in Sunday’s election, with 25.7 per cent of the votes, up from only 4 per cent in the last election in 2018.\n\nMs Meloni looks set to become Italy’s first female prime minister at the head of its most right-wing government since the Second World War (Photo: Gregorio Borgia/AP)\n\nSimilarly, the Sweden Democrats expanded its vote share from 5.7 per cent in 2010, when it made its electoral breakthrough on a national level, to 20.5 per cent this year.\n\nWhile support for these parties has increased beyond their core support groups, it’s what they represent that’s winning the votes.\n\n“The point is that it’s not that they are becoming mainstream, their ideas are,” said Andrea Mammone, a historian and expert on fascist politics at the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\n“In much of the West, if not much of the globe, there’s appeal of some politicians on the far right who exploit people’s fears. Certainly, there’s an overall fear across Europe that immigration and Europeanisation will undermine the identity of the people.”\n\nAll these movements use similar terms but go into power in different ways, Professor Mammone added.\n\nHe pointed to the relatively “new” parties created in former Soviet states after the fall of communism that have shifted their positions on the political spectrum. The Law and Justice and Fidesz parties, for example, were on the centre-right but have been “radicalising and going strongly towards the far right”.\n\nSee more Le peuple italien a décidé de reprendre son destin en main en élisant un gouvernement patriote et souverainiste.\n\n\n\nBravo à @GiorgiaMeloni et à @matteosalvinimi pour avoir résisté aux menaces d’une Union européenne anti-démocratique et arrogante en obtenant cette grande victoire ! — Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) September 26, 2022\n\nThe Brothers of Italy, however, was forged from the legacy of the neo-fascist party the Italian Social Movement, which was formed shortly after the Second World War by supporters of dictator Benito Mussolini. His granddaughter, Rachele Mussolini, is a party member and serves as a councillor in Rome.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats, meanwhile, was founded by neo-Nazis and skinheads in the 80s. Their party symbol of a burning torch mirrored that of the neo-fascist group the British National Front before it was replaced with a flower.\n\n“They were far-right from the start,” Professor Mammone told i , adding that they have since rebranded or downplayed their post-fascists roots in a bid to shake off stigma.\n\nMs Meloni has rejected claims that her party is fascist and described having “shared values” with the British Conservative Party.\n\nBut the line between what is the mainstream right and what is the far right is becoming harder to distinguish, Professor Mammone argued.\n\n“With immigration, what’s the difference between the Tories and Giorgia Meloni? It’s close to zero,” he added, saying that the British government’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda was an example of a radical right-wing policy.\n\nThe EU is concerned with how a Meloni-led government would impact Italy’s relationship with the bloc. In her campaign, Ms Meloni criticised EU officials as being overly bureaucratic and vowed to protect Italy’s national interests if they clash with EU policies.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said it’s “within Europe that we will overcome our common challenges”, while France’s Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said the EU would be closely watching to ensure human rights and values such as women’s access to abortion are guaranteed in Italy.\n\nFellow eurosceptic politicians were among the first to celebrate Ms Meloni’s victory – France’s National Rally, headed by Marine Le Pen, hailed the result as a “lesson in humility” to the EU, while Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s Vox party, tweeted that “millions of Europeans are placing their hopes in Italy”.\n\nMs Meloni’s coalition government is unlikely to be installed before the end of October and there are already tensions between the alliance’s three main parties – including Matteo Salvini’s League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia – over the EU and the war in Ukraine.\n\nExperts have described right-wing populism in Europe as a broad phenomenon but said “there is no single success formula”.\n\nProfessor Mammone agreed, saying that he does not believe Italy’s far right success will be replicated in Spain, Austria or Germany.\n\n“There will be gains but I don’t think there will necessarily be any huge victory,” he said.",
    "This Italian Island Will Pay You $15,000 To Move There": "If you’ve ever dreamed of living in Italy, your wish is about to come true. And even better: You could get paid to move to Italy.\n\nThe stunning Mediterranean island of Sardinia is prepared to pay people €15,000 each (approximately $14,976) to move there. It’s hard to imagine that a place so beautiful would need to pay people to relocate to its shores, but the intention is to attract new residents in order to combat dwindling population numbers.\n\nAnd the Sardinian government is serious about it, setting aside €45 million—enough to subsidize 3,000 grants of up to $15,000 each.\n\nOther parts of Italy are using similar promises of money to lure a new population, from the region of Calabria—which is giving a handful of new residents about $33,000 each—to the village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio, which offered people up to $52,500 in grants to move there and work.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been similar programs, with regions and cities and states paying people to move there.\n\nThe Italian island of Sardinia is paying people to move there. Pictured here: a Costa Paradiso ... [+] landscape. getty\n\n“We have created the conditions for young people to decide to stay and [develop] the economic fabric of the most fragile territories,” said Christian Solinas, Sardinia’s president. “There can be no growth without a real enhancement of the territories, of the interior and most disadvantaged areas, which must pass through new policies for their repopulation.”\n\nSo what do you need to know? As with any of these programs, there’s a catch. To be eligible, you have to move to a Sardinian town with a population of less than 3,000 residents. The money must also go toward renovating a home. You must live there full-time (sorry, no vacation villas allowed). And within 18 months, you need to register Sardinia as your permanent residence.\n\nA view of the village of Bosa in Sardinia, Italy. getty\n\nBut what a pay-off it is. The second largest island in the Mediterranean, Sardinia is famous for its clear waters, bronze-age ruins and delicious food like locally caught lobster. It has more than 1,200 miles of coastline dotted with sandy beaches and a mountainous interior lined with hiking trails.\n\nSome of the charming little villages that qualify for the program include Galtellì (popular for hiking) and Calasetta (which is known for its spectacular white-sand beaches).\n\nLa dolce vita, indeed.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n• Want To Move Out Of The US?

    "I Am Tired of Watching People Go to Italy": "Everyone is in Italy this year — including Alison Roman, whose new cooking series will, like half the people my Instagram feed, take us on a tour of the Amalfi Coast. CNN announced yesterday that Roman’s four-episode (More Than) A Cooking Show, which was originally slated for the now-defunct CNN+, will hit CNN this fall. The show will invite audiences into Roman’s New York kitchen and to join her on her travels abroad. Sure, that sounds fun, if a bit familiar.\n\nBetween Bobby and Giada in Italy; Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy; episodes of Chef’s Table, Somebody Feed Phil, Top Chef, and Salt Fat Acid Heat, I can’t help but feel a little Italy-ed out in recent years, like I’ve hit my capacity for watching clips of cheesemaking or people eating perfectly crisped Neapolitan pizza. (And that doesn’t even include Italy’s dominance over fictional food-adjacent shows like Netflix’s upcoming From Scratch and the second season of HBO’s hospitality-themed The White Lotus.) Now, I’m no stranger to dreaming up my own Eat Pray Love spaghetti scene, and the green-eyed monster and I were in close company this summer as I scrolled past so many friends and influencers’ Lake Como weddings and rented villas.\n\nYet it’s all starting to feel repetitive, especially when one considers how infrequently this in-depth treatment is given to other countries. Italy and France, for that matter, are countries and cuisines whose regionality is given its due in the food landscape of the United States — while so many places in the world remain simplified in the culinary imagination: a visit in a food series episode here and there, usually relying on the same biggest-name cities and chefs.\n\nIt’s as though major networks, wanting a guaranteed hit, see the success of all this Italy-centric TV and think, great, let’s do that again — which is almost certainly what’s happening (streaming overload led Time to claim last year, “Welcome to TV’s era of peak redundancy”). CNN is a perfect example of that: Not only is Roman’s Italy show dropping this fall, featuring the Amalfi Coast, but so is the continuation of Tucci’s, which will explore Italy’s regions further after going to Tuscany, Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Rome, Bologna, Milan, and Sicily last year.\n\nIt all feels a little safe: Showing potential travelers from the U.S. food that is already pretty familiar, in a country that feels like a safe bet, thus reinforcing Western expectations about which cuisines are valuable and which countries worth traveling to. I’m happy to imagine Italian beach moments a la The Talented Mr. Ripley, but what other daydreams could we have if food travel shows dared to delve deeper into places less frequently depicted?",

A cut in excise taxes on fuel at the pump will stay in place until November instead of Oct. 17.\n\nTo discourage firms from closing plants in Italy, the government decree revokes any state benefits already received if they move production abroad and fire 40% or more of their staff, Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said.\n\n($1 = 1.0019 euros)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEditing by Valentina Za and Gavin Jones\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
