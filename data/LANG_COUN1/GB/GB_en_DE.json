    "Lindner raises doubts on Germany’s gas levy": "German Finance Minister Christian Lindner questioned whether the gas levy would lead to lower energy prices for consumers | John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner has questioned if efforts to help the country's energy companies tackle soaring energy costs would lead to lower energy prices for local consumers.\n\nSpeaking to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Lindner, the head of the country's liberal Free Democratic Party, said the so-called gas levy, the plan to charge Germans a fee to compensate energy companies for skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because of the war in Ukraine, may not be the best way to handle the global energy crisis.\n\n\"We have a gas levy that increases the price,\" Lindner said in an interview published on Sunday. \"But we need a gas price brake that lowers the price.\"\n\nThe gas levy, which is due to come into force on October 1, became a political hot potato between members of Germany's coalition government as soon as it was first proposed by Robert Habeck, the country's energy minister and member of the Green party.\n\nDespite rising cost-of-living concerns for average German voters, the levy was designed to help profit-making energy companies, some of which have recorded blockbuster income amid rising global prices for natural gas. Estimates suggest an average German four-person household will pay €480 more a year to cover the planned levy.\n\nLindner raised concerns about whether such a surcharge would have the designed effect of helping to support those energy companies, often smaller outfits, that were struggling to pay rapidly increasing wholesale energy prices.\n\n\"It's less a question of law when it comes to the gas levy, but more and more of a question of economic reasoning,\" Lindner said. \"A gas price brake must help everyone in the economy quickly.\"",

    "Germany: September Ifo sends more recessionary signals": "Recession remains inevitable\n\nAs in the rest of Europe, with the end of the summer, recessionary forces have come to the fore. While the services industry benefitted from a post-lockdown boost, industry saw some relief in global supply chains and backlogs being reduced. In recent months, however, order books have started to shrink, and high energy and commodity prices are weighing on demand and putting pressure on profit margins. Companies can no longer pass through higher costs to consumers as easily as in the first months of the year.\n\nLooking ahead, the German economy continues to approach a perfect storm. The war in Ukraine has probably marked the end of Germany’s very successful economic business model: importing cheap (Russian) energy and input goods, while exporting high-quality products to the world, benefitting from globalisation. The country is now in the middle of a complete overhaul, accelerating the green transition, restructuring supply chains, and preparing for a less globalised world. And these things come on top of well-known long-standing issues, such as a lack of digitalisation, tired infrastructure, and an ageing society, to mention a few.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, these longer-term changes will be overshadowed by shorter-term problems: high inflation, surging energy prices, ongoing supply chain frictions and weakening global demand. A recession is inevitable. However, contrary to previous recessions like the financial crisis or the pandemic, the German economy doesn’t look as if it is dropping like a stone but rather sliding into a long winter recession.",
    "Germany sued over air pollution levels": "German citizens are suing their government over its failure to bring down air pollution levels to limits recommended by the world's leading scientists.\n\nThe seven claimants, supported by environmental organisations ClientEarth and Deutsche Umwelthilfe [German Environment Help], last week launched the case in the Federal Administrative Court — Germany's highest court.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThey argue German law breaches their fundamental rights, since it allows air-pollution levels to be four to five times higher than those the World Health Organization (WHO) deems acceptable.\n\n\"Air pollution may not often be named the official cause of death, but it claims lives — and causes long-term diseases, including cancer, heart problems, shortness of breath and strokes,\" said one of the claimants from Munich, who suffers from asthma.\n\n\"I am now suing for my right to breathe clean and healthy air.\"\n\nThe claimants all come from the country's four most-polluted cities: Berlin, Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt.\n\nWhile the EU set legally-binding air quality standards to tackle air pollution in 2015, the WHO lowered its levels in 2021 — prompting campaigners to urge the EU to align its legislation with science.\n\nThe EU is currently reviewing its main air-quality law, with a proposal expected to come in October.\n\nBut its implementation will not be immediate, meaning EU member states will not be obliged to comply with more strict thresholds for several years.\n\nOver 90 percent of the EU's urban population is exposed to high levels of fine-particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone above those recommended by the WHO, according to the European Environment Agency.\n\nAnd it is estimated that reducing air pollution to WHO-recommended levels in the EU could prevent 51,213 premature deaths each year.\n\nThere are currently ongoing infringement procedures against 18 member states for failing to implement current EU air-quality rules — including referrals to the European Court of Justice against Romania, Greece, Malta, Italy, and Austria.\n\n\"What's needed here is simple — alignment of national air quality laws with the science laid out by the world's leading experts. This is the bare minimum our leaders should be doing to protect people,\" said Irmina Kotiuk, a lawyer from ClientEarth.\n\nIn the past, climate litigation has successfully led to a reduction in air pollution in Germany.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were reduced in several German cities where legal cases over air pollution had been undertaken by environmental groups.\n\nIn the EU, over 400,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of breathing toxic air.",

    "Putin is mobilizing. Germany and France are unlikely to step up": "John R. Deni is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute and a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He’s the author of “Coalition of the unWilling and unAble.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s recent decision to partially mobilize Russian reservists represents a significant escalation in his war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, this could inject as many as 300,000 additional Russian troops into the Kremlin’s war effort — and just as Ukraine has achieved some battlefield success. Increased Western assistance is now vital for Kyiv to leverage and expand its gains and build up defensive positions, before additional Russian forces enter the fight. But not all Western powers have been pulling their weight in this regard — especially Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe Franco-German engine has powered the European Union for over 70 years. Today, however, that engine has stalled in the face of the greatest challenge confronting European security since the end of World War II. The Continent’s most powerful economy and its most powerful military are failing to meet the moment. And, unfortunately, odds that either will change course within the timeframe necessary to help Kyiv achieve its objectives are low.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top political leaders in both France and Germany appeared to recognize the scale of the crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately highlighted the damage Russia had done to European peace and stability, noting that in its response, the West would “be without weakness” in the military, economic, and energy domains. Meanwhile, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Putin had destroyed the European security architecture, arguing that the Russian invasion had marked a turning point, and it was now time to support Ukraine to “the best of our ability.”\n\nSince those early days, though, the actions of Europe’s political dynamic duo have failed to match their own rhetoric. Germany has been dragging its feet on sending the kinds of military equipment other allies have been providing Ukraine for months. After promising to deliver multiple launch rocket systems, self-propelled howitzers and air defense systems, the glacial pace of delivery has cast doubt on Berlin’s commitment. Moreover, Germany’s sheer unwillingness to send heavy armored forces — like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — has prompted criticism from Ukrainian leaders, who accuse Berlin of backtracking.\n\nMeanwhile, France has been willfully curtailing its assistance in hopes of playing the role of neutral arbiter when the shooting stops. Macron irreparably damaged his claim to European leadership when he called on Ukraine to avoid humiliating Putin, and from an operational perspective, while the country has provided offensive weapons to Ukraine, it has reportedly sent less than even Germany, and trained an extraordinarily small number of Ukrainian troops compared to others like the United Kingdom.\n\nClearly, these leading European countries have both failed to rise to the occasion — but for two very different reasons.\n\nFor over a half century, Germany has pursued a cooperative change-through-trade approach to Russia. Now, having finally woken up to Moscow’s zero-sum approach — and its corresponding disdain for cooperation with the West — Berlin is attempting to reverse its long-standing strategy. But change is never easy, especially in Germany, so the effort to overcome entrenched, conventional national security wisdom goes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFor France, however, the dynamic in question isn’t change but the opposite — status quo.\n\nResidual illusions of French grandeur lie at the heart of Macron’s efforts to walk an elusive middle ground between the West and Russia. Across much of the Continent, France’s leading role in pursing European “strategic autonomy” in recent years has been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to resuscitate French greatness and promote the country’s own interests. However, in trying to position France as a practically minded, neutral arbiter between Ukraine and Russia, Macron has instead undermined Paris’s reputation as a defender of Western values and interests.\n\nUnfortunately, as this French pursuit of greatness continues to endure and 50 years of German foreign policy won’t be changed overnight, neither of these European powers is likely to play a leading role in helping Ukraine in the short run. This is particularly problematic at the moment, as Kyiv is eager to keep up the momentum after the serious battlefield success realized by its forces.\n\nAlthough the news from the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has been remarkably positive for Kyiv in recent days, there are still many reasons to think Russia is far from being knocked out of the conflict.\n\nFor one thing, Ukraine’s progress in the south — where it had begun shifting resources from Kharkiv — remains slow and arduous. Additionally, Moscow retains the ability to conduct precision long-range strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Most importantly, though, Russia still holds both qualitative and quantitative military advantages over Ukraine in terms of both manpower and equipment.\n\nFor all these reasons — especially given Putin’s partial mobilization — the war will most likely continue to unfold over the coming months, if not years. Ukraine is unlikely to remain in the fight without significant long-term Western aid, precision weaponry in particular, which they have already been using to good effect, targeting Russian supply lines and logistics. But they will need more — particularly if outmatched in troop numbers later this year.\n\nThe United States, the U.K., Poland, and other allies are all currently providing substantial training, equipment, expertise and intelligence. And in response to Putin’s mobilization, both France and Germany have an opportunity to do so as well — but whether and when they will fulfill their potential remains to be seen.",
    "What I learnt about Germans at the first post-pandemic Oktoberfest": "On leaving Germany, I’m asked to fill in an online form, which requests my reason for departure. I write “Lederhosen”.\n\nIt’s not that they look silly (though they do). It’s not that they mark me out instantly as a tourist (they don’t, actually; plenty of locals are wearing them). It’s – and I’m sorry, there’s no non-invasive way of saying this – the chafing.\n\nFortunately, there is a lubricant-cum-emollient-cum-anaesthetic available, in one-litre (two-pint!) doses, as I’m attending the opening weekend of Oktoberfest 2022. Munich’s is the original and beeriest – founded in 1810 to mark the marriage of King Ludwig (God knows what his stag do was like) – and this year’s is being billed as potentially the wildest ever, since it swaggers back after a two-year disco nap necessitated by eine kleine deadly pandemic.\n\nThat global party-pooper is still making its presence felt in Munich: masks are compulsory on all public transport, and (rule-respecters that the Germans are) everyone complies. But the mask slips rather once you hit Theresienwiese, the 100-acre home of Oktoberfest. Here, I discover, the vibe is punters packed in 10-to-a-table, embraces from strangers, and generally partying like it’s 2019.",
    "Germany still confident about World Cup hopes despite lean run of form": "A proud footballing nation on a lean run of just one win in six games. A humiliating defeat at home against Hungary. And above all, a sense of stasis and frustration, a lack of creativity, the suspicion that for all the talent and trophies in this team, it remains considerably less than the sum of its parts.\n\nGermany and England may share a common predicament, but as they prepare to meet on Monday night only one of these nations is currently racked by existential crisis. And curiously, it’s not the one that has bombed out of its last two international tournaments.\n\nAs Germany slipped to defeat in Leipzig on Friday night, the mood was defined more by indifference than insurrection. The few pockets of boos were drowned out by the sizeable Hungarian contingent, celebrating their first competitive win over Germany since 1985. Nobody was calling for Hansi Flick’s head on a platter. Nobody was writing off the World Cup. Instead, an implacable calm reigned, a sense that whatever their travails, this team will inevitably come good when it matters. “The coach has it under control,” Joshua Kimmich insisted.\n\nNot that there wasn’t a certain disgruntlement at the defeat, Germany’s first under Flick. It took 37 minutes to register a shot on target, and even if they improved later on, chances remained cherishably rare. “The first half was just shit,” admitted Jonas Hofmann with impressive bluntness. Flick, for his part, was prepared to take his share of the blame for a bold tactical experiment in which Hoffman – normally an attacking midfielder – played at right-back. “It didn’t work that well,” Flick conceded.\n\nBut the most telling comment of all came from the stand-in captain Thomas Müller. “You notice that many of us are not going through the easiest phase at our club,” the veteran forward said. “We did not bring our power on to the pitch.” All of which essentially confirmed what many outside the camp have long suspected: that when Bayern Munich sneezes, Germany gets a cold.\n\nWere he minded to do so, Flick could draw his entire front six from the current champions: Müller, Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sané and Jamal Musiala in the forward positions, Kimmich and Leon Goretzka behind them, with Manuel Neuer in goal. In practice Musiala is more likely to be an impact substitute. Neuer and Goretzka were absent on Friday with Covid issues. But the Bayern influence is indelible, not least in the form of Flick himself, who coached the club to their most recent Champions League in 2020.\n\nThomas Müller was part of the Germany side that lost in the last 16 to England at Euro 2020 Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP\n\nMüller’s words were the first real admission of what many outside the camp have long suspected: that the problems at Bayern under Julian Nagelsmann, where the champions have gone four games without a win, are beginning to bleed into the national team. The lack of a focal point up front. The inability of wingers Sané and Gnabry to hit a consistent run of form. A certain slowness in the build-up. An imbalance between defence and attack, with Kimmich often the man caught out.\n\nAnd with just two months until Germany begin their World Cup campaign against Japan, perhaps the most pressing question remains unanswered: who starts up front? Timo Werner? Kai Havertz? Nobody? Werner is currently the man in possession – Flick is a fan of his speed, his work-rate and aggression off the ball – but has scored in just one of his last six games. Lukas Nmecha of Wolfsburg is highly rated but not (yet) a consistent scoring threat. Which is why there is increasing speculation that there may still be time for a late bolter such as Niclas Füllkrug of Werder Bremen or Nils Petersen at Freiburg to make the plane.\n\nNone of which, curiously enough, seems to have made the slightest dent in Germany’s confidence. There appears to be a broad assumption that once the minor issues have been tweaked and the tournament mentality kicks in, Germany will be fine. “They are all competitive players, all winners,” trilled Oliver Bierhoff, now the team director at the German FA. Flick was of a similar mind: “Maybe the defeat came at the right time, rather than at the World Cup,” he observed.\n\nThere is a stark contrast here to England’s wall of wailing, and perhaps it is one that speaks to the respective footballing maturity of these two nations. In England we remain essentially incapable of analysing the national team without resorting to the register of crisis, hyperbole and ultimacy: he’s done, she’s finished, they’ll never win a thing, it’s coming home.\n\nImagine if it were Southgate who had failed to reach the quarter-finals in 2018 and 2021, who had been drawn in a group with Spain, who still didn’t have a recognised striker, who was dangerously beholden to a single struggling club. By contrast, you sense Germany are perfectly happy to leave the worrying to others.",
    "Germany takes baby from gay foster parents after Türkiye intervenes": "A Turkish-German family hailed Germany's decision to scrap the decision for adoption of their baby by gay parents after Türkiye intervened in the case following the family's opposition.\n\nIn May, the 10-month-old boy was handed over to Jugendamt, the German child welfare office, on the grounds that the mother, allegedly suffering from psychological problems was unfit for parenting and the infant was underdeveloped. Despite parents’ protest, the office did not retract the decision and the case was widely covered in Turkish media. The family, who lives in Duisburg, has said their child was given to a gay couple living near Cologne. They claimed that it was not an isolated case and that many other Turkish families had the same problem. A.K., the mother, has claimed she was allowed to see her son only once a month and called upon Turkish authorities to help her.\n\nA.K. said after the decision that Jugendamt apparently “felt the pressure” after media coverage of her case. “(Türkiye’s) Family and Social Policy attache’s office in Düsseldorf found us a lawyer and Minister of Family and Social Policy Derya Yanık personally took interest in the case,” she said, expressing her gratitude. A.K. stated that she also received many messages of support on social media. “We hope Jugendamt does not make another mistake and places my son at least with a Turkish family so he would not be deprived of the opportunity to learn Turkish culture and language,” she said.\n\nTurkish Ministry of Family and Social Policy had suggested two Turkish volunteer foster parents for E. earlier. The ministry has said in a recent statement that they hoped their request would be considered. The ministry also said that they attached importance that host countries considered lifestyle choices based on cultural and moral norms in such cases while assessing the foster care process for Turkish children.\n\nThe ministry, whose work was largely confined to Türkiye, had expanded its activities abroad in recent years. It seeks to promote the adoption of Turkish children in expat communities abroad by Turkish foster parents. Minister Derya Yanık has recently announced that some 200 Turkish children have been returned to their biological parents since 2015 in Germany thanks to the work of their attache offices in the European countries. First lady Emine Erdoğan also spearheads efforts to promote the foster parenting process among Turkish families abroad. Her campaign has seen 599 families volunteering to be foster parents in European countries.\n\nIn force since 1924, the Jugendamt was established to protect children but has become notorious for targeting the children of immigrant families. It gets paid by the German state according to the number of children it takes care of, and some foster parents manipulate childcare issues for their own economic interests. Such factors undermine the operation of the institution, which was originally founded with goodwill. Immigrant families in the country are scared to take their children to the hospital or psychologists because sharing their problems may mean they will inform the Jugendamt, which takes the custody of the children from their families. For instance, the child of a Turkish family with the surname of Toprak was forcibly taken when they took him to a hospital after he had chips stuck in his throat, while other families’ children were taken away because they allegedly spoiled their children and showed excessive attention. Germany currently hosts the largest number of Turkish immigrants, mostly descendants of \"guest workers.\"",
    "Russia and Germany to fall into recession as global economic outlooks darkens, OECD predicts": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring energy bills and record-breaking inflation have thrown the global economy into disarray, triggering an \"extended period of subdued growth,\" according to the latest forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nGermany, the EU's industrial powerhouse, is projected to fall into recession next year.\n\n\"The global growth outlook has darkened,\" the OECD said, in a report titled \"Paying the Price of War\"released on Monday morning.\n\nThe study paints a bleak picture of the world economy: business confidence, disposable incomes and household expenditure all plummet while the costs of fuels, food and transportation surge.\n\nInflation has become \"broad-based\" and will gradually ease throughout 2023, but still remain exceptionally high, as tighter financial conditions resulting from steep hikes in interest rates slowly yield results.\n\nFor Europe, the forecast is particularly gloomy in the event of a colder-than-usual winter: underground gas storage would be depleted and energy prices would soar, prompting shortages and industrial paralysis.\n\n\"This would push many countries into a full-year recession in 2023,\" the OECD says in the event of winter disruptions and enforced gas reductions.\n\nThe organisation also warns of the possibility that the sanctions against Russian oil, one of Moscow's top revenue sources, could prove \"more disruptive than anticipated.\"\n\nThe EU-wide embargo will take effect at the end of the year, taking about two million barrels per day of Russian crude and refined products off the market.\n\nIf Russia is unable to reroute these supplies to other regions, international prices will shoot up, adding even more pressure on the already-volatile energy supply chains.\n\n\"The global economy has lost momentum this year,\" the report notes. \"After bouncing back strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to a more normal economic situation appeared to be in prospect prior to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia and Germany head into recession\n\nOf all the countries analysed in the report, Russia is by far the worst-hit: the country, which has been hit by unprecedented Western sanctions, is projected to contract by 5.5% in 2022 and by 4.5% in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany will end this year with a 1.2% positive expansion but will decline by 0.7% next year. Recession fears are looming large over the country, which until early this year was a large consumer of Russian gas and is now scrambling to find alternative suppliers.\n\n\"The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying,\" Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said last week.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe other European economies included in the OECD's study fare slightly better. France, Italy and Spain will see modest growth rates in 2023, at 0.6%, 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, which means they could too fall into recession at one point but still end the year with moderate positive growth.\n\nThe eurozone will expand by 3.1% in 2022 and by a meagre 0.3% in 2023. Inflation will average 6.2% next year, over three times the 2% target desired by the European Central Bank.\n\nThese pessimistic estimations could deteriorate if the energy crisis takes a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Significant uncertainty surrounds the projections. More severe fuel shortages, especially for gas, could reduce growth in Europe by a further 1.25 percentage points in 2023,\" the OECD says.\n\nSpeaking before the European Parliament on Monday afternoon, ECB President Christine Lagarde also struck an ominous note and warned \"uncertainty remains high.\"\n\n\"The outlook is darkening,\" she told MEPs. \"We expect activity to slow substantially in the coming quarters.\"\n\nBeyond the bloc, the OECD expects the United States to grow by 0.5% next year, while the United Kingdom will post a 0% rate, meaning it will neither expand nor contract.\n\nJapan, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico will all see limited rates, below the 2% mark.\n\nChina, a driving engine of the world economy that is pursuing a strict zero-Covid policy, will expand by 3.2% in 2022 and then speed up to 4.7% in 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia appears to enjoy an economic boom, \"buoyed by high energy prices.\" The oil-rich country is estimated to swell by almost 10% this year and 6% next year.\n\nOverall, the world economy will grow by 3% in 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, a downward revision compared to the previous OECD estimate.",

    "Germany Considers Price Caps As Energy Crisis Worsens": "Germany looks to cap the prices of electricity and natural gas to help households and businesses reel from the soaring energy prices, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, quoting German government officials.\n\nAccording to the Journal's sources, the plan for price caps in Europe’s biggest economy could become official in the coming weeks if the EU doesn’t agree on a price cap for the entire bloc.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, in the UK, for example, there is a price cap on energy bills that energy providers can charge to customers. The new UK has just announced that it would cap the annual energy bills for households at $2,700 (£2,500) for two years.\n\nUnlike the UK cap on prices, and a similar measure introduced in France, the cap in Germany would rather impose a levy on electricity-generating firms that charge more than a certain amount, yet to be determined, the Journal’s sources say. The money collected from the levy on producers would be later distributed to the operators providing energy to the end users, which would allow for lower power prices for end users.\n\nMany energy-intensive industries and companies in Germany are already feeling the pinch from the soaring natural gas and electricity prices.

Now with 14 games under their belt, the former shopkeeper's side still boast an impressive run of results (W9, D4, L1) and they again look a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWatch: Tireless Thomas Müller\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that Flick served as Löw's assistant when Germany claimed a fourth world title in 2014.\n\nSince taking the big job, the national team have scored in 13 of those 14 matches and hit four or more goals on six occasions, including a 9-0 demolition of Liechtenstein as Germany made light work of qualification for Qatar.\n\nOption 1\n\nAs was the case during his spell in the Bayern hotseat, Flick has settled on a 4-3-2-1 formation for all but one of his games in charge, instead opting for a 3-4-2-1 in the 1-1 draw with England in June.\n\nInterestingly, versatile defender Thilo Kehrer has started most frequently under Flick, with the former Schalke man beginning on the right and left of Germany's defence four times apiece and at centre-half in his three other starts.\n\nHe's clearly a player trusted by his coach and his versatility will be a major asset in tournament football, but Kehrer is most likely to start from the bench when Germany are at full strength.\n\n- /\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?

On the opposite flank, Leipzig left-back David Raum is in pole position ahead of Robin Gosens and Christian Günter.\n\nIn front of them, Kimmich has been partnered in equal amounts by Leon Goretzka and Ilkay Gündogan, and it appears a straight shootout between the latter two as to who lines up alongside Bayern's No. 6.\n\nFlick's tenure so far has suggested that Müller and Sane are fairly certain of starting berths, but there is such fierce competition for places that the attacking spots remain up in the air.\n\nFormer Bayer Leverkusen starlet Kai Havertz hasn't yet nailed down a spot of his own but his ability to play anywhere in attack, coupled with the fact he is naturally left-footed, could help his cause.\n\nWatch: The best of Manuel Neuer\n\nSerge Gnabry scored four times in Flick's first four matches but has started just two of Germany's last nine.\n\nConsidering Gnabry's previous success under Flick for club and country, as well as his record of a goal approximately every 125 minutes in international football, and his more natural ability to operate from the flanks, you would imagine he and Sane would line-up either side of Müller in an all-Bayern supporting cast.\n\nIf fellow Bayern attacker Jamal Musiala continues his fine early season form, however, he could well get the nod from Flick, although Gnabry’s greater experience is likely to be valued highly at the World Cup, with Musiala set for a role as an impact substitute.\n\nGnabry has also operated through the middle for his country, but it looks far more likely that Werner and Havertz will vie for the opportunity to lead the line. On current evidence, Werner's movement off the ball and lighting pace look the better fit.\n\nWatch: Timo Werner - RB Leipzig take II\n\nOption 2\n\nGermany's strength in depth is remarkable, with world-class options in reserve at every station on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona custodian Marc-Andre ter Stegen has filled in for Neuer when the captain hasn't been present, and the long-standing back-up will surely be next in the pecking order in Qatar, his shot-stopping qualities and ability with the ball at his feet making him a reliable alternative.\n\nWith Hofmann having elbowed his way into the starting XI at right-back, West Ham’s Kehrer is next in line on the right of defence. The sheer number of times he has been picked by Flick indicating a place on the plane is virtually assured.\n\nFlick named Süle as a guaranteed starter against England in the Nations League at the end of September in Rüdiger’s absence, indicating that he will be among the first XI at the World Cup. If the 57-year-old’s tenure at Bayern is anything to go by, he likes to keep a settled team and avoid too much rotation in terms of personnel and formation, so a Rüdiger-Süle axis looks to be Germany’s centre-back duo in November.\n\n- /\n\nConsequently, Schlotterbeck is first in line as a replacement, alongside Freiburg’s Matthias Ginter, whom Flick recently praised for being “in very good shape”. At left-back, Gosens looks slightly ahead of Günter for the first reserve berth, although that could all change over the coming weeks with Gosens’ playing time limited at Inter, while Günter continues to shine for Freiburg in the Bundesliga and Europa League.\n\nGoretzka has struggled with injury in the early part of 2022/23 but is a high-calibre alternative for central midfield, with Wolfsburg’s Maximilian Arnold a reliable option – and a left-footer to boot, although he is slightly more defensive-minded.\n\nOnce again it is in the attacking third that Flick is really spoiled for choice. He singled out Musiala for praise ahead of the Nations League tie with England, hailing the 19-year-old’s development over the last couple of years.\n\n“From the first time he trained with the first team at Bayern you could see how talented he was,” the tactician said. “His progress has been great and he is brilliant in tight spaces. He’s got a good feeling for space and is a really good dribbler. He’s very good defensively and wins a lot of balls for us. I’m happy he plays for Germany.”\n\nWatch: All of Musiala's Bundesliga goals so far in 2022/23\n\nMusiala has usually been the first attacking substitute under Flick, although Kai Havertz and Marco Reus will likely have something to say about that in Qatar. The latter, in particular, will be raring to go as he is currently on the sidelines for a few weeks with an injury sustained against Schalke on Matchday 7. And we all remember how he missed the 2014 triumph due to an injury right before heading to Brazil.\n\nLukas Nmecha offers a different threat to Werner up front. Whereas the Leipzig forward is a blur of pace and movement, his Wolfsburg counterpart brings greater physicality at 6’1” and is equally lethal with either foot: last season he scored three with his left, three with his right and two headers for the Wolves.\n\nOption 3\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Flick has only employed a 3-4-2-1 formation once in his 14 games at the helm, but he is a pragmatist unafraid to change if necessary.\n\nIn this variation, Schlotterbeck’s composure in possession and ability to play accurate, raking diagonal balls from the back would fast-track him into the starting XI. Hofmann and Raum would be given license to explore the final third of the pitch, albeit with the brief to stay wide and drag deep-lying opposition defenders out of position in the absence of a more traditional winger like Sane or Gnabry.\n\nGündogan would play higher up than Kimmich to overload the centre alongside Müller and Musiala, who probe on the edge of the area looking for gaps to exploit Werner’s speed.\n\n- /\n\nOption 4\n\nAll of which leaves us with a purely hypothetical fourth option. Injuries to any of the above would open the door to a number of squad regulars, who could form an imposing side in their own right.\n\nKevin Trapp’s star rose in the wake of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Europa League triumph in May, Lukas Klostermann and Jonathan Tah have plenty of experience at the highest level for Leipzig and Leverkusen respectively, while former Bochum defender Armel Bella-Kotchap has impressed since his summer move to Southampton and recently received his first senior call-up.\n\nFurther forward in central midfield, Florian Neuhaus and Anton Stach are experienced Bundesliga pros, if slightly green at international level, while the likes of Julian Brandt, Julian Draxler and Karim Adeyemi would normally be the first names on the teamsheet in almost any other national side.\n\n- /\n\nFor Flick the only remaining question would be who to take as a third striker? Niclas Füllkrug has been consistently good for Werder Bremen over the past 18 months and is currently the leading German scorer in the Bundesliga. His aerial threat should not be overlooked, particularly if the side are chasing the game late on.\n\nIt is perhaps a coin toss between him and Dortmund teenager Youssoufa Moukoko. While still raw, he has pace to burn and former BVB teammate Erling Haaland once even claimed he was better than him at the same age. He would be familiar with the Dortmund contingent already in the squad but a handy wildcard to have nonetheless: attacking players with the ability to produce a moment of magic from nothing are highly prized commodities.",
    "Germany loses another glacier as warm temps melt Alpine ice": "Germany lost one of its few remaining glaciers this summer as exceedingly warm weather ate away Alpine ice at a faster pace than feared, a scientific report released on Monday showed.\n\nThe Bavarian Academy of Sciences said the state's Southern Schneeferner had lost its official status as a glacier due to rapid melting of its once sprawling ice sheet.\n\n\"The Schneeferner's ice thickness shrank significantly in large swathes and in most places no longer measures even 2 meters (6.5 feet),\" the academy said in its latest findings.\n\nIt said even the thickest spot was now diminished to less than 6 meters compared to around 10 meters in 2018. The surface area of the glacier halved during the same period to about one hectare.\n\n\"That leads us to conclude that the remaining ice will completely melt away in the next one to two years,\" the academy said.\n\nIt said that the dramatic shrinkage meant that the periodic measurements carried out by the academy since 1892 would now be suspended.\n\nThe loss means Germany has only four remaining glaciers: Northern Schneeferner and Hoellentalferner on its highest mountain, the Zugspitze, and Blaueis and Watzmann in the Berchtesgaden Alps.\n\nRapid glacier melt in the Alps and elsewhere, which experts say is being driven by climate change, has been increasingly closely monitored since the early 2000s.\n\nBavaria's Environment Ministry said last year in a bombshell report that Germany could lose its last glaciers within the decade as climate change gathered pace.\n\nScientists had previously estimated the glaciers would be around until the middle of the century.\n\nA global study released in April 2021 found nearly all the world's glaciers are losing mass at an ever-increasing pace, contributing to more than a fifth of global sea level rise this century.",
    "Nord Stream 2 pipeline pressure collapses mysteriously overnight": "Authorities in Germany are trying to establish what caused a sudden drop in pressure in the defunct Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, with a spokesperson for its operator saying it could have been a leak.\n\nThe pipeline has been one of the flashpoints in an escalating energy war between Europe and Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February that has pummelled western economies and sent gas prices soaring.\n\nNord Stream 2’s operator said pressure in the undersea pipeline dropped from 105 to 7 bar overnight.\n\nThe Russian-owned pipeline, which was intended to double the volume of gas flowing from Vyborg, Russia, under the Baltic Sea to Germany, had just been completed and filled with 300m cubic metres of gas when the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, cancelled it shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nEuropean countries have resisted Russian calls to allow Nord Stream 2 to operate and accused Moscow of using energy as a weapon. Russia denies doing so and blames the west for gas shortages.\n\n“We are currently in contact with the authorities concerned in order to clarify the situation. We still have no clarity about the causes and the exact facts,” said a statement from the German economy ministry.\n\nThe pipeline’s Swiss-based operator, which has legally been wound up, said it had informed all relevant authorities and that the leak, if that were the cause, could not have been at the landing point in Lubmin, northern Germany. “If it were in Lubmin, you’d have heard it,” the spokesperson said.\n\nGazprom referred questions about the incident to the Nord Stream 2 operator.\n\nGermany has informed the Danish authorities about the incident and is trying to establish whether the drop in pressure occurred in German waters. Danish authorities have asked ships to steer clear of a five nautical mile radius off the island of Bornholm.\n\nRussia has cut off gas supplies to several countries and halted flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, accusing western sanctions of hindering operations.\n\nThe suspected leak did not have an immediate impact on gas trading amid signs that Vladimir Putin’s efforts to disrupt energy supplies in Europe this winter will be thwarted.\n\nThe price for British wholesale gas for delivery this weekend dropped nearly 24% to 160p a therm on Monday, with the price for delivery on Tuesday down 17% at 190p a therm.\n\nPrices have tumbled in recent weeks as Europe has made progress in filling up storage facilities for this winter and intervened in the energy market to protect consumers.\n\nThe day-ahead price has fallen sharply since the 589p a therm seen a month ago after Russia’s Gazprom began to throttle flows through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\nAsked about the potential leak in Nord Stream 2, Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, said: “In terms of European supply, no one in the market seriously thinks it could become operational and a route to market for Russian gas, so it should have no impact on the price. It’s not a lost supply route – it’s a lost white elephant.”\n\nAnalysts said the fall back in prices was due to a collection of factors including progress in filling up storage facilities. Prices have also fallen due to an increase in wind power generation and signs that routine annual maintenance on Norwegian gasfields has gone to plan without need for further outages.\n\nMarzec-Maser said: “The fact that wind generation has kicked in and there’s plenty of wind power across the continent has eased the pressure on the amount of gas-fired generation required, particularly given the issues with hydro and nuclear.”\n\nLow water levels in southern Norway have disrupted supply of hydroelectric power, while French nuclear power stations have faced problems, including the rising temperature of river water.\n\nMarzec-Maser said concerns remained over how Europe would be supplied next year when storage facilities are likely to be empty and Russian gas is potentially unavailable, unlike earlier this year when efforts to import more gas began.\n\nThe fall in wholesale gas prices should reduce the cost to the UK government of its cap on energy bills. The government has set a £2,500 limit on average household bills, a policy that could cost more than £100bn.",
    "England v Germany and a probable two-month long social-media tantrum": "THE NATURAL NATIONAL ORDER\n\nWales are off to their first World Cup in 64 years. Norn Iron have finally won, actually won, a game in the Nations League. And Scotland are currently on a three-match winning tear-up, dangerously close to significant achievement for the first time since 1872. What is all this? Do none of the old certainties apply any more? The Fiver feels so old and confused. Imagine how thankful we are, then, for the recent efforts of Gareth Southgate and his England team. The last few years of success and excitement haven’t sat well with us at all, you see. It’s been extremely discombobulating. So it’s very comforting to see England drifting back towards their old sweet spot, a couple of notches above rank incompetence, hovering just below the middle, between underwhelming and meh. Ah, that’s better. Like sinking into an old armchair with no seat cushion, or a tepid bath.\n\nNot that everyone is as chuffed as The Fiver with the way England are carrying on at the minute. Jude Bellingham was the only player who bothered to turn up for the game against Italy on Friday night, and yet another Nations League defeat was inevitable against 11 men. After England’s relegation from League A was confirmed, Southgate went over to thank the travelling support only to be met with two words: trenchant abuse. All of which means that, while Monday’s Wembley showdown with old pals Germany is now technically academic – Germany can’t win the group, while England are doomed – everyone knows full well how much is riding on it. Can England put on a show to avert an 80,000-strong lid-flipping catastrophe and two-month-long social-media tantrum?\n\nWe’re betting heavily on Perhaps Not. Southgate goes into England’s final game before their Human Rights World Cup campaign full of his trademark positivity, promising to “keep doing the right things every day to keep improving. For me, it’s a great challenge to lead the team through a moment like this.” Whether he’d have hand-picked the Germans for the game that will dictate the national mood for the entirety of autumn is another matter. Germany may have just lost at home to Hungary, but they also recently put five past Italy. Should England be unable to snap their five-game winless sequence against a team who have only lost one of their last 14, the pressure on Southgate could become almost unbearable. Most of the noise will certainly be unlistenable. Good luck, then, England: here’s to a morale-restoring win. See, The Fiver might be on board with blissful mediocrity, but we’re not sure we can put up with an eight-week national sulk.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Scott Murray at 7.45pm (BST) for minute-by-minute updates on England 1-2 Germany.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“I don’t like to swear usually but I did in that moment.

    "Germany nationalises biggest gas importer to avert supply crisis": "Germany has agreed to nationalise its biggest gas importer, Uniper, to avert a crisis as it battles energy shortages resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe deal builds on a rescue package agreed in July, when Berlin took a 30% stake in the company, and includes a capital injection of €8bn (about £7bn) of government money.\n\nUniper had been controlled by the Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum, which welcomed the announcement. It said Berlin would buy its shares for €500m, giving the state a 98.5% stake in the gas company.\n\nFortum’s chief executive, Markus Rauramo, said: “Under the current circumstances in the European energy markets and recognising the severity of Uniper’s situation, the divestment of Uniper is the right step to take, not only for Uniper but also for Fortum.\n\n“The role of gas in Europe has fundamentally changed since Russia attacked Ukraine, and so has the outlook for a gas-heavy portfolio. As a result, the business case for an integrated group is no longer viable.”\n\nHe said Uniper’s losses caused by Russia’s limiting natural gas supplies to European countries supporting Ukraine had reached almost €8.5bn. Missing deliveries from Russia have had to be replaced with expensive supplies from the open market, where prices for gas have risen sharply.\n\nUniper, which also owns the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, posted an overall loss of £12bn in August, and has seen its share price collapse by 90% in the past year.\n\nEurope is reliant on gas to heat homes, and to generate electricity to power factories, raising fears of business closures, rationing and a recession as the weather turns cold.\n\nCountries across the continent have scrambled to counter soaring gas and electricity prices, to help households and businesses, and to secure their energy supplies for winter, including by filling their natural gas storage.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia": "Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week.\n\nThe German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships.\n\nParty insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”.\n\nSupporters of Wagenknecht, a controversial but prominent figurehead, are already hatching plans for a breakaway party to compete in the 2024 European elections, the German newspaper Taz reported this week.\n\nSuch a split would be likely to spell the end of Die Linke, 15 years after it was founded in a merger between the successor to East Germany’s Socialist Unity party and former Social Democrats disillusioned by their party’s direction under Gerhard Schröder, and just under a decade after it formed the largest opposition force in the Bundestag’s 2013-17 term.\n\nIn her speech last Thursday, Wagenknecht had called chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-leaning governing coalition “the stupidest government in Europe” because it imposed sanctions on Russia, which supplied over half of Germany’s gas needs before the start of the war in the spring.\n\n“Yes, of course the war in Ukraine is a crime”, Wagenknecht said. “But how dumb is the idea that we can punish Putin by pushing millions of German families into poverty and destroy our economy while Gazprom makes record profits?” The speech was greeted with applause not only by the Linke leadership but also by delegates of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\n\nWagenknecht no longer holds any official positions in Die Linke, but was nominated to be its sole speaker in the recent parliamentary session on the national climate budget.\n\nIn the run-up to the speech, Die Linke’s parliamentary co-chair Dietmar Bartsch had reportedly urged Wagenknecht to avoid calling for an opening of Nord Stream 2, the Russian gas pipeline project that was halted shortly before the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhile the 53-year-old did not mention Nord Stream 2, her “economic war” comments proved incendiary. Even though the German government has used similar language to describe its standoff with the Kremlin over gas deliveries, Wagenknecht suggested that the act of aggression in this conflict had been initiated by the west.\n\n“The thesis that the federal republic of Germany is leading an economic war against Russia reverses cause and effect”, said Bodo Ramelow, the Left party state premier for Thuringia. “The phrase ‘the USA’s economic war against Russia’ is Kremlin propaganda”, said Martina Renner, a former deputy leader of the leftwing outfit.\n\nWhile Die Linke has broadly opposed the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, it voted in favour of economic sanctions against Russia in May, and a party congress in June condemned Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine as “imperialist”.\n\nSplits in the leftwing party, present since Die Linke’s founding, have become increasingly entrenched in recent years.\n\nThe biggest and most bitter split is between reformists who see the party’s future in a space where different union and social justice movements overlap, and those more traditional, nationalist leftists gathered around Wagenknecht, who accuse what they call the “lifestyle left” of having betrayed the party’s traditional working-class base.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the party’s parliamentary status in a fine balance, there have until now been few attempts to rock the boat by seeking an open conflict.\n\nWagenknecht had ended her speech by calling for the resignation of the minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck. Instead, her contribution triggered the resignations of two high-profile members.\n\nUlrich Schneider, the head of the German welfare association Der Paritätische, on Monday announced via Twitter he had handed in his membership over the party letting Wagenknecht take the podium. “That was too much”, said Schneider, who heads Germany’s largest umbrella organisation of self-help initiatives in the area of health and social work.\n\nFabio di Masi, a former Linke MP who had remained its most prolific financial expert even after standing down as an MP last year, said a day later he was also handing in his membership, as he no longer wanted to bear responsibility for the “blatant failure of key actors in this party”.\n\nThe draining of support is reflected at a grassroot level. According to internal party figures seen by the Guardian, Die Linke has lost more than 3,000 members – or 5.5% of its total membership –in the first half of this year.\n\nAfter gaining 4.9% of the vote at federal elections last September, the leftwing party has failed to make it over the electoral threshold at five consecutive state elections.",
    "Germany lags far behind on gender equality in agriculture, study finds": "Germany is lagging far behind its EU counterparts when it comes to the share of farms being managed or passed on to women according to a new study, which points to the far-reaching consequences this has on their financial security.\n\nRead the original German story here.\n\nOnly 11% of farms in Germany are managed by women, according to a recent nationwide study conducted by the Thünen Institute and the University of Göttingen on behalf of the German agriculture ministry.\n\nOn top of that, only one in five of the people set to inherit or otherwise take over farms are women, the study added.\n\n“The results show that women in rural areas are performing tasks of systemic importance, but are at the same time often not very visible in terms of financial matters,” explained Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir at an event where the results of the study were presented on 22 September.\n\nSpecifically, the study points to an imbalance between women’s far-reaching responsibilities on farms and how this is reflected legally.\n\n83% of the women farmers surveyed said they work on their family’s farm, while almost three-quarters said they are also involved in strategic and entrepreneurial decisions. But only in very few cases is this contribution also reflected legally, as evidenced by the low proportion of female farm managers.\n\n“In contrast to many other countries, de facto joint farm management is not recorded statistically in Germany,” according to the report.\n\nFinancial insecurity\n\nThe consequences on the financial security of women farmers are far-reaching.\n\nThe report’s authors point out that divorce, separation or the death of their partners could plunge female farmers into financial insecurity, stressing that this has ramifications for women’s healthcare and old-age provision.\n\nIn case of divorce or death, for example, “the risk of female old-age poverty is significantly higher and still too few are covered by contracts or wills,” President of the German Rural Women’s Association Petra Bentkämper stressed in a statement.\n\n“These risks must be talked about openly,” she added.\n\nThe study’s authors are thus urging women on farms to start taking care of social security coverage, together with their partners, at an early stage.\n\nAt the same time, the report calls on insurance providers to “examine the risk of possible pension gaps for women with different employment histories” and to draw their attention to solutions for this.\n\nIn France, for example, the government passed a pension reform at the start of February that is set to benefit women farmers.\n\nGerman women still face 'greater hurdles' in EU farm fund access German women tend to benefit less than men from the support programmes of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Juliane Vees, the first vice-president of the German Association of Women in Agriculture, told EURACTIV Germany in an interview.\n\nTackling gender inequality\n\nTo tackle the root cause of gender inequality in the agricultural sector, the study’s authors stress it is necessary to address underlying barriers to entry such as outdated gender images and traditional inheritance practices.\n\n“In order for more women to take over and manage farms, a fundamental change in agricultural traditions is necessary, coupled with more educational work at agricultural educational institutions,” explained Janna Luisa Pieper from the University of Göttingen at the study’s presentation.\n\nIt is important that the educational work is not only directed at women, said Pieper: “Gender-equitable agriculture concerns everyone.”\n\nIn addition to counselling, education and mentoring services, the experts also believe that support programmes must be created or adapted to make it easier for women to start their own agricultural businesses even without inheriting a family farm.\n\nBut while Germany does support young farmers in setting up their own businesses, it is not doing enough for female entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn its observation letter on Germany’s National Strategic Plan for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the EU executive said the country needed to pay more attention to issues such as the “income gap between the sexes” or “the gender gap among farm managers, especially young farmers.”\n\nMore detailed data needed\n\nHowever, data on the income gap in Germany’s agriculture sector is very scarce.\n\nThe report presented last week, for example, is the first nationwide study on the situation of women in agriculture for which associations, like the LandFrauenverband, had long campaigned for.\n\nThe authors are thus calling for collecting more detailed data on the topic to identify better and address women’s obstacles in the field.\n\n“Even if we have been aware of many things for a long time, we need figures and evidence to be able to initiate changes politically,” said LandFrauenverband’s Bentkämper.\n\nWomen farmers 'essential' for future, says French agriculture minister An increasing number of women in France are entering the agricultural world, dominated by men for so long. EURACTIV France takes a closer look at the role of women farmers in the country.\n\n[Edited by Natasha Foote/Nathalie Weatherald]",
    "Only Britain can save France from German domination": "Are Britain and France at the dawn of a new Entente Cordiale? It’s reported that France will be the destination for the first state visit of King Charles, and in New York this week Liz Truss and Emmanuel Macron took a break from the UN General Assembly for 30 minutes of ‘constructive’ talks.\n\nThere are many in France who long for a closer relationship with Britain and, at the same time, for a gradual decoupling from Germany.\n\nI wrote in April last year of the growing French scepticism towards Germany; of how in the words of one current affairs magazine, France has for decades been ‘fleeced’ by its eastern neighbour economically.\n\nRare were the politicians who pointed this out. One exception, Marine Le Pen, a long-standing critic of Germany, declared in 2021 that were she ever to become president she would seek a ‘divorce’ from the Franco-Germany couple in favour of establishing a closer relationship with Britain.\n\nHers is no longer a lone voice because the energy crisis has taken the French scepticism mainstream.\n\nTwelve months ago the European think tank, the Jacques Delors Institute, published a policy paper that praised Germany’s energy strategy of energiewende (energy turnaround). The paper concluded that in rejecting nuclear energy, ‘Germany is thus successfully completing the “energy turnaround” that began more than 20 years ago.’\n\nAnyone who dared challenge this orthodoxy was mocked, as Donald Trump was at the UN General Assembly in 2018 when he warned the Germans that they were making a serious mistake in becoming ‘totally dependent on Russian energy’. As the Washington Post reported, the reaction among most delegates was one of mirth and the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas ‘could be seen smirking alongside his colleagues’.\n\nLast week Olivier Marleix, the leader of the centre-right Republicans in the National Assembly, wrote an op-ed in Le Figaro that savaged Germany’s energy policy and also criticised Emmanuel Macron for going along with it.\n\nMarleix expressed his anger at EU president Ursula von der Leyden’s proposal earlier this month to introduce a price cap on countries that produce renewables, hydropower and nuclear energy, and whose production costs are lower than those of coal and gas power stations. This levy on revenues would subsidise member states who have to buy gas to produce electricity, such as Germany. ‘Taxing the good performers to give back to the bad performers is a surprising idea,’ remarked a sardonic Marleix.\n\nTaking an opposite stance to the Jacques Delors Institute, Marleix said Germany had only themselves to blame for their plight because over many years they had made a series of ‘wrong choices’ over their energy strategy.\n\nMarleix is a protégée of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, an advocate of nuclear energy during his time in office. In September 2007, shortly after he was elected president, Sarkozy met Angela Merkel in Berlin where he advised the Chancellor not to forsake Germany’s nuclear energy. ‘We cannot remain in a situation in Europe where, a century from now, there will be no more gas, where in 30 or 40 years, there will be no more oil,’ said Sarkozy. ‘No one can imagine that wind turbines will be used to power all of Europe.’\n\nSarkozy wanted France and Germany ‘to have energy ambitions in the same direction’ but his advances were spurned by Merkel. Indeed, four years later the Chancellor accelerated the phasing out of all 17 German nuclear reactors, while at the same time initiating a campaign to pressurise France to follow suit.\n\nThis strategy was laid bare in a recent book published by Bernard Accoyer, a former Republican MP who served as president of the National Assembly under Sarkozy. Subtitled ‘The attempt to scuttle the French nuclear industry’, the book describes how France’s nuclear energy programme, launched in 1974 under president Georges Pompidou, gave it not only cheap electricity for households and businesses, but a competitive advantage over Germany.\n\nThis was resented by Merkel who – with the support of Brussels and the French Greens – conspired to introduce legislation to reduce EDF’s dominance in the EU electricity market by forcing it to sell a quarter of its nuclear electricity production to its competitors at knockdown prices. ‘Everyone knows that Germany cultivates the art of using the European institutions to increase its influence and develop its efficiency,’ wrote Accoyer.\n\nThat they’ve been able to get away with it is because of the servility of Sarkozy’s successors, François Hollande and Emmanuel Macron, ‘who are trying hard to imitate a German energy strategy that serves Berlin's interests but harms our own’.\n\nMacron believe the price cap proposal is a good idea. ‘We will show solidarity [with Germany] by strengthening our exchanges of gas and electricity,’ he tweeted on September 5. ‘We will defend the implementation of a European mechanism which will involve energy producers whose production costs are well below the market price.’\n\nMacron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have agreed a deal whereby from next month France will send 5 per cent of its gas reserves to Germany through the winter and in return they will receive electricity from their neighbour. France should have no need of electricity from Germany but 32 of its 56 nuclear reactors are not functioning, and one of its principal plants, Fessenheim, was closed by Macron in 2020 with the encouragement of Germany. The German Environment Minister at the time, Svenja Schulze, declared that the closure would make Germany ‘safer’, and she promised to keep lobbying France to phase out all its reactors, saying ‘Nuclear power is not a climate saviour’.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has exposed other cracks in the Franco-German relationship. In June the economist Bruno Alomar and the Republican senator Cédric Perrin wrote an op-ed in Le Monde in which they accused Germany of acting unilaterally in announcing its commitment to increase defence spending by €100 billion.\n\nNot that this was the first time Germany had made a decision without consulting its EU partners, noted the authors, citing as other recent examples the decision to phase out nuclear energy and its migration policy in 2015 that ‘pushed a decisive fringe of the British population towards Brexit.’\n\nLike Marine Le Pen, Alomar and Perrin concluded that the Franco-German couple has run its course and it is time France looked for other European partners. By which they mean Britain.\n\nIt is no longer Perfidious Albion that the French distrust, but perfidious Allemagne.",
    "The politics of Germany’s Zeitenwende": "Germany’s Zeitenwende still has a long way to go Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nAn economic downturn could threaten support for reducing a trifecta of dependencies: energy imports from Russia, exports to China and the United States for security.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrive for a press conference on August 20, 2021, in Moscow. In 2021, the last of Ms. Merkel’s 16 years as chancellor, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia. In the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s use of energy as a political weapon, Berlin wants to drastically reduce this dependency. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Germany faces difficulties undoing the mistakes of the Merkel-Schroeder eras\n\nDefense spending, despite increases, remains short of NATO’s 2 percent goal\n\nHigher energy prices may weaken the public’s willingness to support Ukraine\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz’s speech in the Bundestag on February 27, 2022, was a watershed event in German history.\n\nMr. Scholz spoke of a “turning point” – Zeitenwende in German – triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world after that is no longer the same as the world before,” the German leader said. The statement gave the impression that Germany had suddenly become aware of its responsibilities. From now on, the nation of 83 million people, with Europe’s largest economy, would no longer entrust its security to the United States alone, its energy supply to Russia and its economic growth to exports to China.\n\nThis turnaround is primarily about German-Russian relations, the need to strengthen defense capability and deterrence, and secure energy supplies. Mr. Scholz announced he would provide the Bundeswehr with a credit-financed special fund of 100 billion euros. That is a significant amount, but to meet the expectation that NATO members invest at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in defense, an additional 25 billion euros would have to be spent annually, adjusted for inflation.\n\nMajor overhaul needed\n\nThe change required is enormous. In 1989, Germany invested 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product in national security, and by 2014, it was only 1.1 percent. Only since 2017 has the share risen again – in 2021, it was 1.5 percent. However, 41 percent of this was spent on personnel and pension entitlements. In France, 26.5 percent of defense funds go to equipment; in Germany, only 16.87 percent do. On the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bundeswehr Inspector Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, the highest-ranking officer of the German Army, said that the army had been severely weakened after years of austerity and is no more up to the task.\n\nUnder Mr. Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schroeder (1998-2005) and Angela Merkel (2005-2021), German foreign and security policy assumed that the nation was surrounded only by friends. This misjudgment led to a security policy recklessness that manifested itself in the neglect of the Bundeswehr. When the U.S., the United Kingdom, Poland and other NATO partners supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, the Bundeswehr was already in such a deplorable state that it could not comply with the Ukrainian government’s requests.\n\nHowever, national security is only one of the many ruins Ms. Merkel has left to the Scholz government. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat to cut off gas supplies would not be nearly as effective if Germany had not done everything it could to make itself economically blackmailable. Udo Di Fabio, a former judge with the Constitutional Court, delivered a devastating verdict on German energy policy:\n\nNo country with a keen sense of the mechanics of foreign power relations would have actively promoted or passively accepted such a massive energy dependence on Russia as Germany under chancellors Schroeder and Merkel. Criticism from the U.S. of projects such as Nord Stream 2 was politely forbidden, criticism from the Baltic states was not taken seriously. The Federal Republic pursued an almost romantic energy policy.\n\n× Facts & figures Germany’s 3 major vulnerabilities In trade, defense and energy, Germany has been highly reliant on three nations – China, the United States and Russia, respectively. But the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to overhaul Germany’s natural security strategy to reduce dependencies in each area. (Sources: International Energy Agency, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.) © GIS\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds\n\nReduced Russian oil and gas supplies are hitting Germany particularly hard today because rising global demand is accompanied by a politically engineered shortage that began long before the sanctions against Russia. Germany has been suffering from the consequences of self-inflicted economic wounds that have dominated energy policy since Ms. Merkel embraced the positions of the Greens.\n\nIn 2011, she used the destruction of four reactor units in Fukushima, caused by an earthquake and a tidal wave, as a pretext to order Germany’s withdrawal from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The nuclear and coal-fired power plants were gradually shut down, and domestic gas extraction by fracking was dispensed with, citing possible environmental damage.\n\nAnother concession with which the chancellor drew the left-wing opposition to her side was the opening of borders during the migration crisis of 2015-2016. Compared to the Greens, the party Die Linke and the left wing of the Social Democrats, she thus distinguished herself as an ally in the “fight against the right.” The informal party coalition on which the chancellor relied ranged from the left-wing fringe to the Greens to deep into the CDU, which lost its conservative and Christian-democratic brand core.\n\nRevising wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nToday, German parties have to say goodbye to a series of apparent certainties that have been questioned for more than 20 years only on the fringes of the party spectrum branded as populist. To revise wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nThe three parties in the Scholz government had helped shape Germany during these two decades. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens governed under Mr. Schroeder of the SPD from 1998 to 2005. Twice, from 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to 2021, the SPD belonged to a grand coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Ms. Merkel. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) had been Ms. Merkel’s junior partner in the black-yellow coalition from 2009 to 2013. All three parties of the “traffic light” coalition and the CDU, as the largest opposition party, played a part in the drama that turned the economically strong and politically self-confident Germany of Helmut Kohl (who served from 1982-1998) into a less reliable and crisis-prone partner for the Western world.\n\nThe conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.\n\nRectifying misguided policies\n\nThe responsibility for the mistakes and omissions of the Merkel era lies first and foremost with the CDU. Friedrich Merz, who emerged from the turmoil as Ms. Merkel’s successor as the new CDU chairman, had been the chancellor’s most prominent opponent within the party for years. So, it was not too difficult for him to support the turnaround that Mr. Scholz announced in the Bundestag. To prevent conflicts in the party, however, he has so far avoided criticizing the former chancellor, who had shaped the profile of the CDU and still enjoys significant support in it. To stand openly against them would be understood as a concession by the new CDU chairman to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the only party in the Bundestag to have opposed them on almost all issues.\n\nMs. Merkel’s popularity was evident in a poll conducted three weeks before the federal election in September 2021. In it, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of her job. That judgment reflects the economic upswing experienced by Germany during her chancellorship.\n\nRobust German growth had been the result of an exceptionally favorable combination of several factors, led by cheap energy from Russia. But other factors contributed to the boom times: an upswing in the global economy, particularly from rising demand in China, the wage restraint of German workers and the weak external value of the euro. The higher tax revenues financed the expansion of the welfare state, the energy transition and a climate policy that was executed without regard for the industry’s concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The International Monetary Fund revised downward its growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023. In May 2022, it estimated Germany’s 2022 growth at around 2 percent; by July, the projection was only 1.2 percent. Numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the tourism and gastronomy sectors, have had to close due to the Covid lockdowns. It is feared that many companies will not survive the increased energy prices and the reduction of gas supplies in autumn and winter.\n\nTo relieve consumers, the government has thus far made 30 billion euros available. On September 4, the German chancellor announced an additional 65 billion-euro relief package, with Mr. Scholz finally acknowledging the obvious: “Russia is no longer a reliable supplier of energy.” It represents a sharp departure from the failed strategy of “change through trade.”\n\nThe situation has kept changing dramatically. On September 5, the German government even agreed to continue operating until April 2023 two of the remaining three nuclear power plants that had been scheduled to close at the end of the year. Also on that day, the Kremlin said it is stopping gas supplies to Europe through Nord Stream until Western sanctions are lifted against Russia.\n\nSee also\n\nWill support for sanctions hold?\n\nNevertheless, the party Die Linke and the AfD are planning a “hot autumn” for the government. There were violent protests when Chancellor Scholz wanted to explain the federal government’s plans at a citizens’ meeting in Neuruppin on August 18. Unlike Ms. Merkel, who largely eluded debate, Mr. Scholz strives to establish contact with the citizens. However, he lacks charisma, and he keeps as many options open as possible in his statements. The chancellor is wary of the tense relations in the coalition with the Greens and the FDP and tries not to provoke the left in his own party, whose influence has increased after the Bundestag election.\n\nMeanwhile, the approval ratings of the traffic light coalition are falling. In a survey at the beginning of August 2022, only 14 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with the government’s work, while 37 percent said they were “very dissatisfied.” Satisfaction with the chancellor has also slumped. Recent polls also show his SPD party losing popularity as the Greens gain.\n\nOpposition to supporting Ukraine is particularly strong in the SPD. Not only Mr. Schroeder but Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and numerous other Social Democrats are known for their pro-Russian stance, which was not questioned in the party until after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. If the energy crisis in winter leads to mass social protests, the pressure on the government to lift or at least mitigate the sanctions against Russia is likely to increase, as demanded by Die Linke and the AfD.\n\nIn the CDU, too, more voices want to force a change of course. The spokesman of this current movement is Saxon Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, who is pushing for quick negotiations to “freeze” the war because sufficient Russian gas flows in the coming years are essential to keep social peace in Germany. There has been a debate even in the FDP since Wolfgang Kubicki, vice president of the Bundestag, proposed activating the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as possible. The FDP chairman Christian Lindner and numerous other politicians of the party have spoken out vehemently against it.\n\nOnly the Greens have thus far resisted the temptation to question the turnaround in Russia policy announced by Mr. Scholz in the Bundestag. Among the German parties, only they had spoken out against Nord Stream 2 from the outset. In the German Bundestag, the Greens campaigned even more than the CDU and FDP to support Ukraine against Russia with the supply of heavy weapons.",

Such figures confirm the region’s position as representing the biggest growth from an Asian source market.\n\nWhile tourism numbers may not have returned to pre-pandemic levels yet, the promising growth demonstrates the countries strong recovery as it continues to attract tourists.\n\n“The GCC is the top Asian source market, therefore it’s unsurprising with our recent campaigns that there has been such a strong increase,” said Yamina Sofo, director of sales and marketing at the German National Tourist Office, the regional office of GNTB. “Pandemic recovery has long been top of mind and it’s encouraging to see that both longstanding and first-time travellers are increasingly keen to explore everything that Germany has to offer.”\n\nOverall, the Asian source markets have recorded a 252.3 per cent increase in overnight visitors, a jump from just over 217,000 to just under 800,000 in 6 months. The surging increase demonstrates a dedication and determination to travel internationally, despite some countries continuing to implement travel restrictions during the first half of the year.\n\nTo further drive interest in travel to Germany in the remainder of 2022, GNTB has announced the launch of its ‘Feel Good’ campaign, which encompasses a plethora of guiding tips highlighting the country’s eco initiatives that provide conscious tourists with adequate tools and information to reduce their carbon footprint during their travels.\n\nA recent survey by D/A, the Dubai-based consumer insights company, revealed the UAE’s interest in travel has shifted post-pandemic, with relaxation in natural surroundings proving most popular, followed by cultural experiences. The German.Local.Culture campaign, which has been running across the GCC from 10 March, put a focus on driving awareness of the huge number of traditional experiences Germany has to offer, including national crafts and customs, local fare, and the diversity of the history-rich cities, while the Embrace German Nature which ran from 21st April highlighted the plethora of outdoor, nature-focused activities. Aligning with market wants, the campaigns directly attributed to higher footfall from the GCC, said Sofo.\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘Feel Good’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/feel-good/sustainability.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘German.Local.Culture’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/campaign/german-local-culture/home.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s ‘Embrace German Nature’ campaign: www.germany.travel/de/trade/marktbearbeitung/globale-kampagnen/embrace-german-nature.html\n\n*2022 inbound figures to Germany from GCC compared to 2019 figures are -36.7 per cent.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout the GNTB\n\nThe German National Tourist Board (GNTB) is Germany’s national tourism organisation. It works on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action to represent Germany as a tourist destination and is funded by the Ministry in accordance with a decision taken by the German Bundestag. Working closely with the German travel industry and private-sector partners and trade associations, the GNTB develops strategies and marketing campaigns to promote Germany’s positive image abroad as a tourist destination and to encourage tourists to visit the country.\n\nThe GNTB has a three-pronged recovery strategy for overcoming the challenges of the restart after the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nRaising awareness of the Destination Germany brand and enhancing the brand profile with a focus on sustainability and climate change mitigation\n\nSupporting the travel industry, which is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, through relationship management and the sharing of knowledge\n\nDeveloping evidence-based action plans on the basis of targeted market research and ongoing analysis of changing customer demand.\n\nFocus on sustainability and digitalisation\n\nThe GNTB promotes sustainable and forward-looking tourism in line with the objectives of the German government. The focus here is on sustainability and digitalisation.\n\nSustainability has been a core topic for more than a decade and we engage with it as a strategic issue across all areas of the organisation. Our organisation follows a three-pillar strategy that combines the sharing of knowledge with external partners and a supporting communications strategy with our internal sustainability initiative. The GNTB promotes responsible tourism, a key growth area, by showcasing Germany as a sustainable and inclusive destination in the international travel market. This is particularly important as the pandemic has accelerated the global shift in travellers’ values towards greater social and environmental responsibility.\n\nThe GNTB is a pioneer when it comes to using immersive technologies (virtual, augmented and mixed reality), voice assistants and other conversational interfaces, and artificial intelligence applications such as chatbots.

On the once-white plaster of the gymnasium, someone has written \"SVS Merkstein,\" the name of the local sports club, in black paint.\n\nBut no sports activities are taking place here at the moment. Instead, the hall is being used to house refugees from the war in Ukraine. In early August, partitions were used to set up temporary accommodation for 80 people. Now the space is full — as are all the other accommodation facilities for refugees in Herzogenrath.\n\nPastor Frank Ungerathen and his team help the refugees in the small community of Herzogenrath\n\nAbout a kilometer down the road from the hall, the refugee advice team sits together for a meeting at the Protestant parish of Lydia. Pastor Frank Ungerathen has just told his colleagues that a second gymnasium will be converted this week. He learned this from the city's social welfare office, which is responsible for taking in and caring for the refugees.\n\nHe and his team had hoped that the situation would not again reach the point it did during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016, when people also had to be accommodated in gym halls and even tents. But there is simply no more housing available in the small city of about 50,000 residents.\n\n\"The housing market has totally dried up,\" said Mahkameh Robatian, who leads the advice center. Private offers to take in refugees are also rare. \"The high prices of gas and electricity mean that people often decline because it becomes too expensive for them,\" said volunteer Olga Meier.\n\nIn any refugee accommodation in Aachen, at least two people share a bedroom\n\nHelpers overwhelmed\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine and the first refugees from the war arrived in Germany, the advice center has been working nonstop. Its staff hold talks, make phone calls to authorities, help fill out forms, organize language courses, look for apartments and arrange cooking classes and meetings over coffee and cake. They encourage, advise, comfort and, when necessary, also look after children.\n\nA city like Herzogenrath normally received about 50 to 60 new refugees per year, estimated the pastor. \"Now, 400 war refugees from Ukraine arrived in the space of three months — and we currently have 530,\" he said. In addition, about 850 people who fled from 20 other countries have also arrived. \"Some have found jobs in the meantime, many have not — and the need for integration does not stop there.\" The municipality cannot cope with this on its own.\n\nIn Aachen, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, the situation looks no better. At the start of August, Mayor Sibylle Keupen pulled the emergency brake and announced that the city would not accept any more war refugees or asylum-seekers for the time being. All emergency accommodation centers were full, including eight gym halls.\n\nAachen Mayor Sibylle Keupen has said many refugees are here to stay, and need permanent accommodation\n\nMost of the more than 4,000 Ukrainian refugees who are registered in Aachen and receive financial support have found accommodation privately. This is also because Aachen already had a relatively large Ukrainian community before the war.\n\nIt is mostly people from African countries, along with a few Syrians and a handful of Ukrainians, who live in a \"container village\" made of prefabricated buildings that were set up on a former sports ground in the city's south in 2016. The small rooms, each with their own cooking facilities, showers and toilets, are in hot demand because they offer privacy. Up to 120 people can live there, but a third of the containers are currently leaking and therefore uninhabitable. Attempts are underway to repair them.\n\nThe city authorities in Aachen are working flat out to convert vacant commercial properties into accommodation. The plan is that the refugees should have moved out of the gyms in a few months, by the end of autumn.\n\nA Dutch company sets up makeshift accommodation to house refugees\n\nLocal authorities feel abandoned\n\n\"We are now in a situation where we realize this war will probably go on for a long time yet — the people will stay here, and they need something other than a sports hall,\" said Keupen. \"These are families, these are different ethnic groups, different age groups, who all clash together there — that is also an explosive social force that we must moderate. That is very difficult if we do not have more small-scale accommodation options.\"\n\nThe mayor supports the demand from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, which represent the interests of city and district authorities, for a refugee summit. The federal government must better control the distribution of people across the country, as well as step in financially, she believes.\n\nUkrainian children go to school in Germany\n\n\"We need an orderly system to really provide people with — and this is the important thing for me — not just a roof over their head and a bed, but more. They need a place at school, or day care: they also need psychosocial care, especially when it comes to families and children who are dealing with war-related trauma,\" she said.\n\nThese are all things that throughout Germany are just as hard to come by as an available apartment — for which the refugees are competing with the rest of the population.\n\n\"Most landlords say no straight away, or hang up when they hear about refugees,\" said Michaela Lee, who is responsible for administration at the refugee help center in Herzogenrath.\n\n\"I am always so glad when I manage to find an apartment for a refugee,\" she added. \"Or an apprenticeship, after I have helped write hundreds of applications.\" That is her motivation.\n\nThis article was originally written in German\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Can Germany’s economy minister keep the lights on this winter?": "That Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister in his recent, pre-ministerial life, wrote a children’s book in which a girl called Emily experiences “how exciting a night-time power cut can be” may yet come back to haunt him.\n\nThese days, Habeck is charged with the daunting task of ensuring that the lights do not go out in for real in Europe’s largest economy. And even if Germans have been hoarding candles and camping stoves, just as not so long ago they were doing with toilet paper and pasta, they consider the prospect of a blackout and cold homes to be scary rather than exciting. Reports of people illegally felling trees for fuel have brought back memories of postwar squalor, when Berlin’s Tiergarten park was stripped bare as Germans tried to keep warm.\n\nBut a blackout is not so unrealistic since Moscow closed down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline more than a week ago. Habeck was in danger of appearing more than a little triumphalist when he remarked to the Bundestag on Thursday that “we’ve now been independent of Russian gas for a week”; it was not him, or Germany, but Putin who reduced Moscow’s leverage on Europe via energy supplies.\n\nWhile the cutoff may perhaps have helped to ease a little the conscience of many Germans who have felt that every time they turned on the shower they were supporting Russia’s war, more responsibility lies on Habeck’s shoulders right now than any other minister, even Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He must also try to keep the economy going amid gloomy predictions that owing to soaring energy costs and high inflation the country will slide into recession next year.\n\nBakers in northern Germany on Thursday turned off their lights in protest at the way they had been excluded from the government’s unwieldy sounding Energiekostendämpfungsprogramm, to provide help towards the bills of energy intensive industries, from glass to wallpaper manufacturers. “Lights today, ovens tomorrow?” was the slogan posted on the door of a bakery in the well-to-do Hamburg district of Blankenese. “Bread could yet become a luxury good that only rich people can afford,” the owner said, desperate for recognition that her gas provider had cancelled her contract and she was facing a monthly gas bill that had gone from €3,800 (£3,300) to €8,000.\n\nJust a few months ago many people were regularly glancing at the coronavirus figures. These days it’s the Gasspeicher-Füllstand – gas storage filling level – that attracts feverish attention. On Friday the 47 subterranean facilities around the country were 87% full, thanks to imports from other countries, namely Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. It sounds high but is only part of the picture as when full, the facilities hold just 28% of the total amount of gas Germany uses in an average year. The aim is for 95% capacity by 1 November, but a harsh winter or any technical mishaps could cause the stores to empty well before winter is out. And there is also next winter to think of, when the stores will probably be empty with no Russian gas in sight.\n\nIndustry has already reduced its usage by more than a fifth (but with consequences – ammonia production is down by about 70%) and is currently “saving” about 300 gigawatt hours a day. Considering gas use can shoot up to 5,000 GWh on cold winter days, this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nEnergy specialists say that despite Scholz’s insistence that Germany would have enough energy to get through the winter, it is too early to be optimistic. Already in a colder than usual September, consumption has been higher than expected.\n\nHouseholds are being urged to reduce their consumption by about 20% but the expected higher household bills that might encourage savings have in many cases not yet landed on the doormat. The government, careful not to appear alarmist, has done little so far to encourage domestic saving and the focus has instead been on turning swimming pool temperatures down or switching off illumination of the Brandenburg Gate. Habeck has frequently made a point of saying that he has reduced his showers to a minimum and fitted a water-saving shower head, but is also wary of appearing condescending.\n\nHope lies in the liquid gas that Germany expects to receive via two state-chartered floating terminals at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, due to go into operation at the turn of the year, and a third by a private consortium in Lubmin. Energy market experts warn however that demand for LNG could be fierce in winter, particularly from Asia.\n\nA mild winter could have a significant impact but pressure is now growing on the coalition government from within its own ranks – the pro-business FDP – and the opposition conservatives, for a reversal of Angela Merkel’s 2011 commitment made in response to the Fukushima disaster to withdraw from nuclear power.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision has attracted ridicule and scorn: Green supporters are wary this might mark the slow return to nuclear and, added to the schlamassel, a Yiddish-derived term for a mess, one of the plant’s operators has called the plans “technically unworkable”. Some have said the operator is simply angry at the financial loss that being in “standby” rather than fully operational mode means for his company.\n\nBut in immediate terms, Germany now faces nothing less than weighing up which is greater – its angst over atomic power or a blackout.",
    "Germany Announces €10 Million in New, Additional Funding to Support Education Cannot Wait’s Education Response in Ukraine, Bringing Total Contributions to €330 Million - Ukraine": "24 September 2022\n\nNEW YORK/BERLIN\n\nIt is our common responsibility to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality education.’ – Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has severely impacted access to education for approximately 7 million children. In response to that, the Government of Germany announced today €10 million in new, additional funding to Education Cannot Wait at the Global Citizen Festival.\n\nGermany is the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, with almost €330 million in total funding to date.\n\n“The international community urgently needs to increase its investments in education. Global Citizens, thank you for raising your voices to call for more support for Education Cannot Wait, so that all young people everywhere in the world will have access to quality education: this will enable us to end extreme poverty - now,\" stated Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany.\n\n“Thank you, Germany! Your inspiring leadership and strong support has taken Education Cannot Wait to the next level. Education is the most crucial investment to make today, to build a more equal, prosperous and peaceful future for all! Through global and local partnerships, we can deliver on our promise of quality education for crisis-affected children and youth, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait.\n\nThe new contribution connects to Education Cannot Wait’s First Emergency Response grants in Ukraine. The current investments are managed by Save the Children and UNICEF and focus on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys, while also ensuring continuous access to education and psychosocial support.\n\nSchools across Ukraine have been the target of repeated attacks throughout the seven-month war. Recent government reports indicate that as many as 2,300 educational institutions had been hit, and over 280 have been destroyed. Millions of refugees have fled into neighboring countries, straining resources, ripping families apart, and denying children and adolescents to their inherent human right to 12 years of quality education.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine, massive displacement in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the compounding impacts of the climate crisis, and global economic uncertainty, the world is facing a worsening global education crisis.\n\nShocking new analysis from ECW indicates that 222 million crisis-impacted girls and boys are in need of urgent education support – up from previous estimates of 75 million in 2016.\n\nIn response to the global education crisis, ECW launched its Case for Investment and 2023-2026 Strategic Plan during this year’s United Nations General Assembly. To make good on promises outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG4 – Education For All), Safe Schools Declaration and other international accords, the Fund is rallying donors and strategic partners to mobilize US$1.5 billion in funding to reach at least 20 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents over the next four years through its #222MillionDreams campaign.\n\nEducation Cannot Wait’s High-Level Financing Conference will take place in Geneva in February 2023. Hosted by Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait – and co-convened by Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan – through the 222 Million Dreams campaign, the conference calls on government donors, private sector, foundations and high-net-worth individuals to turn commitments into action by making substantive funding contributions to ECW.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nAbout Education Cannot Wait (ECW):\n\nEducation Cannot Wait (ECW) is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises. We support quality education outcomes for refugee, internally displaced and other crisis-affected girls and boys, so no one is left behind. ECW works through the multilateral system to both increase the speed of responses in crises and connect immediate relief and longer-term interventions through multi-year programming. ECW works in close partnership with governments, public and private donors, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and other humanitarian and development aid actors to increase efficiencies and end siloed responses. ECW urgently appeals to public and private sector donors for expanded support to reach even more vulnerable children and youth. The Education Cannot Wait High-Level Financing Conference, co-hosted by ECW and Switzerland, and co-convened with Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan, will take place February 16-17, 2023, in Geneva.\n\nOn Twitter, please follow: @EduCannotWait, @YasmineSherif1, @KentPage\n\nAdditional information available at: www.educationcannotwait.org\n\nFor press inquiries:\n\nAnouk Desgroseilliers, adesgroseilliers@un-ecw.org, +1-917-640-6820\n\nKent Page, kpage@unicef.org, +1-917-302-1735\n\nFor other inquiries: info@un-ecw.org\n\nPress Office of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\n\nPhone: +49 / (0)30 / 18 535-28 70 or -24 51\n\nEmail: presse@bmz.bund.de",
    "Pressure mounts on Germany’s Scholz to send tanks to Ukraine": "The warning shots are getting closer and louder.\n\nIn a heated parliamentary session on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received stark signals from his coalition partners that they expect him to ramp up weapons supplies to Ukraine at what is becoming an increasingly critical inflection point of the war.\n\nWhile his government coalition bought him a little more time in the Bundestag debate and temporarily fended off a critical parliamentary motion expressing a lack of faith in his military support for Ukraine, it is now looking more and more likely Scholz will have to respond to the calls for Europe’s biggest economy to pull its weight when it comes to arming Kyiv more decisively.\n\nWitheringly, opposition lawmaker Florian Hahn from the center-right Christian Social Union fumed that Germany was only “number 18 in the world” when comparing its military aid for Ukraine relative to the economic output. Hahn noted that Estonia was far ahead of Germany in supplying arms instead of keeping them for national defense, “even though they have a direct border with the Russian Federation.”\n\nThe center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) opposition block had requested a vote on a Bundestag motion that urges the government to “immediately” allow the export of German battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. That would have been tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in Scholz’s Ukraine strategy, since the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out such deliveries as long as other Western allies don’t deliver similar heavy gear.\n\nThe opposition’s maneuver was particularly dangerous for Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) because leading politicians from his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), have also demanded the delivery of German Leopard battle tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nTiming is now of the essence. Ukraine is appealing for more weapons as it launches bold counter-offensives against the Russian invaders in the east and south of the country, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is vowing to throw hundreds of thousands of new soldiers into the conflict and is holding fake referendums in occupied territories to incorporate them into Russia.\n\nA vote on weapons deliveries in the Bundestag would have risked revealing fatal cracks in the government unity and could even have led to a defeat of Scholz in parliament.\n\nFollowing a heated 50-minute debate, however, the majority of SPD, Greens and FDP lawmakers voted to send the opposition’s motion to the foreign affairs and economic affairs committees for further discussion. That effectively delays a plenary vote on the text for a few weeks.\n\nStill, the government now also faces the risk of renewed pressure next week as the opposition “could request a plenary vote” on another tanks-for-Ukraine motion that the CDU/CSU initially put forward in June but which was also delayed at the time by delegating it to committee level, the CDU’s Roderich Kiesewetter told POLITICO.\n\nThe SPD’s foreign policy spokesperson Nils Schmid argued that Thursday’s delay of the vote was justified because the opposition was merely orchestrating a political attack, hoping to weaken the government’s unity.\n\nScholz, who was not present at the debate, had said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that Germany would support Ukraine “with all its might: financially, economically, with humanitarian aid and also with weapons.”\n\nPressure from coalition partners\n\nThe most striking part of Thursday’s debate was the intensity of criticism from within the ranks of Scholz’s own coalition. Senior lawmakers from the Greens and FDP expressed clear disapproval of the chancellor’s position and stressed that they want Germany to send more heavy arms.\n\n“As Free Democrats, we believe that in the current military situation, in which Ukraine is reclaiming its territory, piece by piece, we must supply at least the Fuchs armored transport vehicle and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle — and if the situation requires it, the Leopard main battle tank as well,” said the FDP’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag’s defense committee.\n\nCrucially, Strack-Zimmermann cited the “Zeitenwende” — a historic shift in German foreign and security policy that Scholz announced in February in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — to argue that Scholz shouldn’t justify his reluctance to send tanks by arguing that other allies like the U.S. weren’t sending modern tanks to Ukraine either.\n\n“Zeitenwende doesn’t just mean doing more for the German armed forces, it also means taking leadership and not waiting for our partners to take uncomfortable decisions from us,” she said.\n\nThe Greens’ co-leader Omid Nouripour delivered a broadside against concerns among Social Democrats that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine could trigger an “irrational” escalation by Putin — a fear that was most recently expressed by the SPD’s Secretary General Kevin Kühnert.\n\n“There are arguments that I cannot follow,” Nouripour told the Bundestag. “That our weapons would lead to an escalation presupposes that the Russian side needs excuses for escalation. That is grotesque. Of course they don’t need excuses, the aggression is there,” Nouripour said in reference to Putin’s announcement on Wednesday to mobilize up to 300,000 reservists.\n\nSpent cartridges at a former position of Russian troops in the Kharkiv area, Ukraine, September 22, 2022 | Oleksandr Ratushniak/EPA-EFE\n\nMoving up from No. 18\n\nGermany has so far sent 30 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 10 Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers and three Mars multiple rocket launchers, as well as various lighter weapons, to Ukraine, according to a government list.\n\nFollowing growing pressure at home and from allies, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced last week that Berlin would also send 50 “Dingo” armored vehicles and two more Mars rocket launchers — contradicting her own arguments from a few days earlier that Germany could not spare any further weapons in support of Ukraine.\n\nStill, despite these increases, Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, argued that Germany had a historical and moral obligation to step up its support for Ukraine.\n\n“If, in the light of mass graves in Bucha and Izium, we are serious in saying: ‘Never again! Germany must ensure that something never happens again’ — then we have to go a decisive step further here,” he said.",

    "Former Southampton super-kid happy with decision to represent Germany over England": "FORMER Southampton super-kid Jamal Musiala still gets messages about his decision to play for Germany instead of England and takes it as a compliment that fans are frustrated.\n\nThe 19-year-old is considered one of the greatest prospects in world football having flourished for European giants Bayern Munich since breaking through in 2020.\n\nMusiala joined the perennial Bundesliga champions from Chelsea the previous year but also spent time in the Southampton youth set-up and local side City Central after his family moved from Germany to England when he was seven.\n\nThe midfielder predominantly represented the Young Lions at youth level, going on to feature for England Under-21s before last year confirming he would play for his country of birth.\n\nMusiala prepares to face his former side (Pic: PA)\n\nIt means there will be a feeling of what might have been on Monday night as Musiala starts for Germany against Gareth Southgate’s side at a sold-out Wembley in the Nations League.\n\n“From my time with England in the youth level, they have amazing talents and I was playing with many of them as well – the Under 21s, 19s,” Musiala said.\n\n“There was many players which can have an amazing career and I think England’s youth system is very good for that, to build on these talents and make sure they get better.\n\n“When you said (about) breaking hearts, some of my friends message me here and there when they see me saying I should have played for England and stuff.\n\n“We joke around but I think they’re still happy for my decision.\n\n“I’m sure some England fans won’t be happy but I think that means I’m doing good if it upsets some people that I didn’t choose their country.”\n\nMusiala seamlessly flicked between German and English at Sunday’s pre-match press conference in the bowels of Wembley – a stadium he dreamt of lining up at as a kid.\n\n“It’s kind of crazy to think about things like that,” said Musiala, who came on as a stoppage-time substitute under the arch in last year’s Euro 2020 last-16 loss to England.\n\nMusiala faces his former side (Pic: PA)\n\n“I think when I was younger it was always my dream to play at Wembley or being part of one of these big games. For me, it was not exactly where I was, I just loved playing football.\n\n“That was my dream to be involved in such big games and be part of a squad where I can contribute a lot. I’m just happy where I am right now.”\n\nMusiala said choosing to represent Germany was not an easy decision but the right one for someone who clearly has a lot of affection for England.\n\nHe still keeps in contact with the likes of Jude Bellingham and Saints star Tino Livramento and fondly remembers meeting Southgate as a kid.\n\n“That was at my primary school, Corpus Christi,” he said. “I saw him there, I had a picture. It’s not on me right now, but we took a picture together. It was nice seeing him.“\n\nBut now it is about the future and helping Germany recover from their shock loss to Hungary against an England side hoping to snap a five-game winless run before the World Cup.\n\n“England have a lot of quality,” Musiala added. “I think we can say it’s a perfect game for both of us because we both will need this game to go into the World Cup with confidence.\n\n“I think England have an amazing squad, amazing players. That’s why everyone’s a bit shocked with their results right now.\n\n“I feel like this game is perfect for the both of us.

Berlin's proposal is to ban EU citizens from the boards or supervisory boards of Russia’s government-owned companies.\n\nRead also: Zelensky appoints new ambassador to Germany\n\nThe German authorities argue that in this way, it would be possible to hinder the Kremlin's attempts to increase political pressure on the EU member states and restrict corruption.\n\nAt the same time, the ban is not expected to extend to the European-based subsidiaries of Russian companies.\n\nIt should be recalled that the ex-Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder, had worked as the head of the board of directors of Rosneft until he quit in May 2022. Schroeder is considered Putin’s “friend,” while his work for the Russian regime bore reputational costs for Germany.\n\nAs reported earlier, the eighth package of sanctions is unlikely to include a cap on Russian oil prices.",
    "Can the NHS learn from Germany’s health system?": "The German system is better staffed and stocked than the UK, relative to the population. Analysis by Nuffield Trust shows in 2019 the UK had around nine nurses per 1,000 people, while in Germany there were about 14. The disparity in bed numbers was wider - with Germany's eight beds per 1,000 patients more than three times higher than the UK figure.",
    "Germany and France put energy diplomacy at the top of their agendas": "European governments are entering the final stretch of the race against the clock as they compete against Putin for a winter of reliable energy security. This last quarter of 2022 is witnessing a strong prioritisation of energy diplomacy by EU executives, as evidenced by the upcoming visits of the Macron government's Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne to Algeria and this weekend's visit to the Middle East by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nFrom Berlin, the Social Democrat chancellor once again promised to control electricity and gas prices this winter. The nightmare of Scholz's government since he took office has been Germany's energy supply, which has been deeply dependent on Russia for decades. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the German leader's poll ratings have plummeted, not least because of the links of several members of his team to the Russian government - links that the German government has worked to deny by firmly supporting Ukraine in the conflict, supplying major arms packages, including Gepard anti-aircraft systems among other weapons systems.\n\nPutins Krieg stellt auch uns vor viele Herausforderungen: Hungersnöte verhindern, Energieversorgung sichern, die hohen Energiepreise abfedern und für #Entlastungen bei den Bürgerinnen, Bürgern und Unternehmen sorgen. All diese Aufgaben lösen wir gemeinsam. #KanzlerKompakt. pic.twitter.com/FFMMDhYDGB — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) September 24, 2022\n\n\"We want to ensure that electricity prices are brought down again by changing the market model. And we want to see to it that gas prices come down,\" Scholz said in a video published in the chancellery's media on Saturday. The German government has been juggling for months between sanctions against Russia and the search for new ways of obtaining gas supplies. Already earlier this summer, the Scholz government's energy minister, the Green Robert Habeck, travelled to Qatar to meet with his counterparts and reach agreements to increase the supply of non-liquefied gas to Germany. The Middle East solution seems more promising for now than the Medcat pipeline, which remains blocked by France despite the intention of Spain, Portugal and the European Commission to implement it.\n\nScholz has a busy weekend ahead of him with plans to visit the Arab Gulf states. According to information from Birgit Jennen for Bloomberg, citing sources in Scholz's cabinet, the German chancellor is all set to finalise the signing of several LNG and hydrogen supply deals during his tour.\n\nThe visit will take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, accompanied by a \"high-level\" business delegation, of which the German government has not provided many more details. According to the same Chancellery sources, Germany has been trying for months to reach a long-term agreement to open up supply channels with Saudi Arabia.\n\nPHOTO/Presidencia de Rusia - Russian President Vladimir Putin receives German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Kremlin amid the crisis in Ukraine, 15 February 2022\n\nIt was also revealed that negotiations with the United Arab Emirates are very close to concluding another hydrogen supply agreement to reduce dependence on Russia in the long term. If these prognoses come true, Scholz would keep his word and the Social Democratic leader could regain some of those points lost in the public eye behind closed doors.\n\nElizabeth Borne back in Algiers\n\nFrom Paris, the Matignon hotel, the headquarters of Macron's prime minister, it was reported that Elizabeth Borne will travel with a large delegation to Algiers on 9 and 10 October. This is the fifth meeting between the French and Algerian governments since Macron's state visit in August.\n\nThis time, the Prime Minister will discuss the gas dossier, which is why she will travel in the company of senior officials from ENGIE, the public gas company, and will meet with delegates from Sonatrach, as well as the Prime Minister of Tebboune, Aïmane Benabderrahmane. The French government announced last week that significant progress would soon be made in negotiations to increase gas supplies to France from Algeria.\n\nPHOTO/GOUVERNEMENT FRANÇAIS - EHitherto Prime Minister Jean Castex passes the baton to the new head of government Élisabeth Borne during the ceremony at the Matignon Palace\n\nAccording to French channel Europe 1, Borne's visit to Algiers could lead to a 50 per cent increase in Algerian gas exports to France. According to French public data, the French energy mix is 20% dependent on gas. In this distribution, Algerian gas represents between 8% and 9% of the total, figures that could change if Europe 1's information is true.\n\nIf these new agreements are approved, France advocates transporting gas by sea, the same method that experts close to the Elysée recommend using instead of investing in the Mecat pipeline.",
    "England and Germany involved in mad 3-3 draw in Nations League": "Gareth Southgate's substitutions inspired an incredible comeback from England, but Nick Pope's mistake handed Germany a draw in the Nations League.\n\nLoading…\n\nEngland went into Monday night's game in their worst form since before Southgate took over as manager, with real pressure mounting on him for the first time.\n\nLast week's loss to Italy had seen them get relegated from the Nations League top group, after failing to win their opening five games.\n\nThe match against Germany was to be their last before the World Cup, and they were in need of a huge boost, having only scored once from open play in recent games.\n\nThe hosts had slightly the better of the first half, with Luke Shaw's excellent ball creating the best chance for Raheem Sterling, but the teams went into the break at 0-0.\n\nIt was Germany who took the lead in the 52nd minutes after Harry Maguire, selected despite lots of criticism, gave away a penalty with a sloppy challenge on Jamal Musiala.\n\nAnd the Manchester United captain was criticised again in the 67th minute, when he lost possession high up the pitch, which eventually saw the visitors double their lead, with Chelsea's Kai Havertz scoring.\n\nEngland however then scored three times in 12 minutes to complete what was an incredible comeback, thanks to Southgate's substitutions.\n\nLuke Shaw pulled one back for the Euro 2020 finalists, his first international goal since that final 15 months ago against Italy, kicking off a mad spell. S\n\nubs Bukayo Saka and Masoun Mount combined for the second, the Chelsea man scoring the equaliser, after incredible work from the Arsenal winger.\n\nHarry Kane then netted the third from the penalty spot, after Jude Bellingham was fouled on the edge of the box, by Borussia Dortmund teammate Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nIf Southgate and the players, thought they'd finally get their win they were very much mistaken, with Hans Flick's side still having seven minutes of normal time to get an equaliser of their own.\n\nThey only needed four, with Havertz doubling his tally for the night in the 87th minute, but it was all down to a keeping error from Nick Pope.\n\nSerge Gnabry shot from outside the area, and it looked a relatively simple save for the keeper, but the Burnley number one was only able to parry the ball back into Havertz path, with the Chelsea forward tapping in for the equaliser.\n\nThe Newcastle United number one was only deputising in goal due to Jordan Pickford's injury, though it may still inspire some, especially Arsenal fans, to call for Aaron Ramsdale's inclusion in the starting line up.",
    "Germany must shake off its habit of finding excuses for inaction": "A German decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin, Constanze Stelzenmüller writes. This article originally appeared in the Financial Times .\n\nLife: it’s unfair. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht gave a long-prepared speech in Berlin on Monday, in which she laid out her thinking on strategy. She asserted confidently that Germany was destined by “our size, our geographical location, our economic power, in short our heft” to be a “leading power in Europe, whether we like it or not.”\n\nThe strategic adversaries uppermost in Lambrecht’s mind are, however, at home. She is striving to assert her authority at a time when the Foreign Ministry is writing Germany’s first ever national security strategy. It does not help that leaders of her Social Democratic Party (SPD)’s parliamentary group are vocal skeptics of what some pointedly refer to as “chic bellicism,” or a fashionable taste for war.\n\nLambrecht’s task is to remind them forcefully that the Zeitenwende, or turning point, promised by SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a landmark speech after Russia’s attack on Ukraine needs to be sustained and funded. Especially for the armed forces.\n\nUnfortunately, her audience — including Germany’s allies — was interested in a different question: how Berlin’s destiny to lead relates to Ukraine’s urgent requests for more heavy weapons. Contrary to the fears of many — and the hopes of some — across the west, Kyiv’s armed forces have achieved an astonishing rout of the invaders, regaining more territory in a week than Russia captured in five months.\n\nCaution remains warranted. But for the first time, a Russian defeat appears possible if Ukraine can press its advantage across the long frontline. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, this is impossible without armored infantry carriers and battle tanks.\n\nLambrecht, echoing Scholz, parried that no other ally had delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks; that this would deprive NATO allies of German protection; and that Germany would never “go it alone.” Also, such weapons deliveries would represent an “escalation” — meaning Russian President Vladimir Putin could then consider Germany a direct participant in the conflict. This is the brightest of red lines for Scholz’s three-party ruling coalition.\n\nCue yet another fierce Berlin brouhaha over heavy weapons deliveries. Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Scholz’s Greens coalition partner, tweeted that “the time for hesitancy is over.” Parliamentary defense committee chair Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the Free Democrats, the third coalition partner and herself something of a lethal weapon, demanded immediate deliveries of German Marder infantry carriers and Leopard 2 tanks.\n\nMore unusually, the U.S. Embassy in Berlin waded in with a three-part tweet thread: the U.S. appreciates German contributions; allies should support Ukraine “as much as possible”; each country is free to decide on the manner of its support (this last part blew up a smokescreen deployed for months by the German government).\n\nTranslated from diplo-speak: love you, Berlin, but please, please grow a pair and stop pretending we’re telling you what to do.\n\nIn truth, the government’s position is untenable. Other allies have sent armored infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. Some have sent tanks, mostly modernized Soviet-era versions. The 24 Gepard armorred air defense systems and 10 Panzerhaubitze 2,000 howitzers Berlin has sent to Ukraine, plus much other kit, have, by Kyiv’s admission, made a real difference in its counteroffensive. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is asking allies to prioritize deliveries to Ukraine. As for red lines, the Russian ambassador opines they were crossed a while ago.\n\nThe only serious concern about Leopard 2 tanks is that they are sophisticated machines which would require three or four months of training. But the Ukrainians are fast learners and Russia still occupies a fifth of their territory. Deciding to send the tanks now would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin that Germany won’t be intimidated.\n\nDuring the Cold War, leaders of a partly sovereign West Germany intoned a trinity of compelling reasons (Zwang) why they absolutely could not do something: rules, allies, and facts (Normzwang, Bündniszwang, and Sachzwang). Usually, it meant they absolutely didn’t want to.\n\nMore than 30 years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the regaining of full sovereignty, it’s a disingenuous habit Germany needs to shake off. It’s certainly unworthy of a country that aspires to leadership in Europe.",
    "As winter looms, Germans increasingly turn to wood for heating": "Amid skyrocketing prices of gas, oil and electricity, Germans are increasingly turning to wood to heat their homes, causing prices to nearly double compared to last year.\n\nFor weeks, gas has stopped flowing through Nord Stream 1, Germany’s nuclear power plants are set to shut down, and the government is bailing out energy companies left and right.\n\nDespite warnings of potential blackout scenarios, consumers continue their rush to buy electric space heaters. The Germans are anxious.\n\nRecent political statements have contributed to anxiety. “Germany could get through the coming winter well” provided “we have luck with the weather” and saved enough gas, explained Robert Habeck, vice-chancellor and minister of economy and climate action, on 19 September.\n\nIn Germany’s political discourse, this was interpreted as the government’s number two highlighting the need for good fortune to make it through winter.\n\nIn that context, the momentous spike in wood prices is unsurprising. “Some people find it weird that the price of wood pellets increases. I don’t. When the price of a good increases, people substitute away, driving up the price of substitutes,” said Lion Hirth, energy markets professor at Hertie School in Berlin.\n\nAccording to data comparing firewood prices in August 2022, Germans are spending significantly more money on wood to heat their homes.\n\nWood pellets and firewood prices are up 85.7% compared to last year. The most drastic price increase concerned wood flakes and pellets, which went up 133.3%. Meanwhile, the average price increase of consumer goods in the same timespan was a mere 7.9%.\n\nThe German statistical office cites multiple causes for the extraordinary spike, attributing it to “increased demand” and “increased acquisition and transport costs in the wood industry.”\n\nThe country’s growing demand for wood has also depressed exports, which went down 30.3% compared to last year.\n\nWhile high domestic energy costs have hampered the production of wood ovens for home heating, which went down by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2022, imports of ovens increased. By July, an extra 60,000 ovens were imported in Germany, 62.4% of them coming from China. Simultaneously, oven re-exports to EU countries went down by 28.8%.\n\nFew German homes are heated using solely wood. Instead, wood is a popular source of secondary heat. Common examples include an indoor fireplace. 11.8% of newly-built homes in 2021 are capable of using wood for heat.\n\nThis is despite warnings against the climate and health impacts of fireplace wood, which is now regulated in cities like Paris for air quality reasons.\n\n“Wood burning is the biggest source of the particulate pollution that already kills over 1,000 people in the EU every day,” explained Karl Wagner, a biologist and NGO campaigner, in a recent op-ed for EURACTIV.\n\nThe false promise that burning forest wood can replace Russian fossil fuels Using forest wood to replace Russian fossil fuel imports would not only be disastrous for the environment, it would also not be a credible energy alternative, writes Karl Wagner.\n\n[Edited by Frédéric Simon]",
    "OECD: Ukraine War Will Hurt Global Economy More Than Expected": "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says Russia's war in Ukraine, now in its eighth month, will have a greater impact on the global economy than previously expected.\n\nThe OECD said on September 26 that it had slashed its growth forecast for the global economy to 2.2 percent in 2023 from a previous estimate of 2.8 percent.\n\n\"The world economy is paying a high price for Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable, and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,\" the OECD said in a regular report updating its economic outlook.\n\n\"With the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic still lingering, the war is dragging down growth and putting additional upward pressure on prices, above all for food and energy. Global GDP stagnated in the second quarter of 2022 and output declined in the G20 economies,\" it added.\n\nThe report said that high inflation is persisting for longer than expected and that in many economies, inflation in the first half of 2022 was at its highest since the 1980s.\n\n\"With recent indicators taking a turn for the worse, the global economic outlook has darkened,\" the OECD said.\n\nRussia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nBy RFE/RL\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "‘What is Berlin afraid of?’ Ukraine presses Germany for more military kit": "Ukraine has ramped up the pressure on Germany to deliver more military hardware as Kyiv pursues its counter-offensive in the east and south against Russian forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the German government of ignoring Kyiv’s requests for Leopard tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nHe said Berlin had only given “abstract fears and excuses” over why it was not providing more equipment.\n\nKuleba tweeted: “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now, to liberate people and save them from genocide.\n\n“Not a single rational argument on why these weapons cannot be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?”\n\nHe was speaking on Tuesday after a meeting with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, in Kyiv at the weekend.\n\nThe Green party politician, who had travelled by night train for her second visit as foreign minister to the Ukrainian capital, pledged further support from Germany, saying the advances made by the Ukrainian army in pushing Russian forces back were a “good argument” for the west’s delivery of weapons.\n\nBut when pushed by Kuleba to specifically support the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, Baerbock said: “We’re already delivering heavy weapons.”\n\nShe then listed the weapons systems Germany had already sent to Ukraine, referring to its multilateral exchange programme and the agreements it has with other western partners, adding: “I know that time is of the essence.”\n\nBaerbock is believed to want to step up German participation but must first win the support of the other parties in the three-way coalition government.\n\nOthers in her party, led by the co-leader Omid Nouripour, backed calls for a speedy delivery to Ukraine of Leopard tanks. “Everyone in the government knows that even more would be possible,” Nouripour told a German newspaper.\n\nAnton Hofreiter, a leading member of the Green party, said in an interview with Mediengruppe Bayern: “Sooner or later, we will have no other choice than to deliver modern, western battle tanks to Ukraine.”\n\nHe said Russia had largely destroyed Ukraine’s armaments industry. At the same time, the old Soviet tanks that Ukraine possessed offered “bad protection” against Russian attack, Hofreiter added.\n\n“I believe we should be delivering Leopard tanks as quickly as possible in order to prevent Ukrainian soldiers from dying unnecessarily,” he said.\n\nMembers of the pro-business Free Democratic party and the opposition conservative CDU/CSU alliance have also backed the calls.\n\nOnly the Social Democratic party of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is seen to be hesitant. He has repeatedly said there should be no “deutscher Alleingang” (meaning Germany going it alone), which has been the backbone of Germany’s foreign policy since the second world war, but is increasingly being interpreted, from Kyiv to Washington, as potentially hazardous and feeble indecision in the current circumstances.\n\nScholz’s hesitation is seen by some as a wariness over further exacerbating tensions with Moscow and nervousness about an energy crisis that is being used by groups on the left and right to turn some of the electorate away from supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, Scholz insisted that the weapons Germany had delivered – including Gepard anti-aircraft guns, howitzers and Mars rocket launchers – “are actually contributing to the fact that it is now possible in the battle on the eastern front to change the outcome just in the way that we are seeing right now”.\n\nEven as initial reports of the Ukrainian counter-offensive were trickling in last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, ruled out increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine, saying Germany’s stocks were depleted and that it needed to keep supplies to ensure the country can defend itself until it could use a €100bn (£87bn) package pledged by Scholz in February to purchase more equipment.\n\nAmy Gutmann, the US ambassador to Germany, urged the German government on Sunday evening to commit to sending more weapons, telling the public broadcaster ZDF that while she welcomed and admired how Germans had supported Ukraine so far, “my expectations are even higher”.\n\nBerlin has repeatedly pointed to Washington’s hesitancy in delivering certain types of weaponry – from tanks to fighter jets – to defend its own restraint.",
    "Southampton's Armel Bella-Kotchap is turning heads and could make Germany debut vs England tonight": "Inspired by Rio Ferdinand and potentially wanted as a long-term successor to Virgil van Dijk. For a young centre half making his way in English football, they aren't bad names to be linked with.\n\nIt's only a little more than three months since Armel Bella-Kotchap moved to Southampton for £10million from Bundesliga side VfL Bochum, but he's faced up and risen above every challenge in his path so far.\n\nThe defender was fast-tracked into Germany's senior squad this month after just six appearances in the Premier League, and he could make his full international debut against England tonight, aged just 20.\n\nSo who is the wonderkid already reminiscent of his 'hero' Rio Ferdinand, on whom he models his game, was identified by former Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick as a top emerging talent, and is already being eyed up by Liverpool?\n\nBelow, Sportsmail profiles Bella-Kotchap, the man who could be lining up against the likes of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling at Wembley.\n\nArmel Bella-Kotchap could make his Germany debut against England at Wembley tonight\n\nThe Southampton defender has impressed since a £10m Premier League move this summer\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Paris to Cameroon international Cyrille Florent Bella, Armel bounced around the youth teams of five German sides before eventually settling at Bochum aged 16.\n\nHe broke through at the second-tier outfit aged 16, signing his first professional contract in April 2019 and making his senior debut one month later against Erzgebirge Aue.\n\nThe following campaign yielded just 14 appearances in all competitions, but obviously proved a valuable learning experience as the teenager then became a regular starter in 2020-21, helping the Blues gain promotion under Thomas Reis.\n\nIn his first season in the Bundesliga, Bella-Kotchap once again took the step up in his stride, making 22 league appearances and helping his side stay up with ease, finishing nine points above the relegation zone.\n\nCentre half Bella-Kotchap began his career with German side VfL Bochum as a teenager\n\nAlthough there were mistakes along the way, he helped Bochum gain promotion in 2020-21\n\nIdentified by Ralf Rangnick\n\nRealising his talent early, Chelsea reportedly tried to sign him in 2020 - and they weren't the only big English club on his tail.\n\nAccording to The Sun, then-Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick identified Bella-Kotchap as one of several top talents in Germany, along with Florian Wirtz, Luca Netz and Eric Martel.\n\nGerman boss Rangnick, now head of the Austria national team, is renowned for spotting promising youngsters.\n\nAs it turns out, United waited until new manager Erik ten Hag was installed this summer before backing him in the transfer market, sanctioning a £55m outlay on Ajax centre half Lisandro Martinez and backing out-of-form captain Harry Maguire.\n\nThe Red Devils may well be regretting the decision not to stump up the cash for Bella-Kotchap now.\n\nFormer Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick identified him as a top emerging talent\n\nImpressing at Saints\n\nThe Saints, who bet their Premier League survival on raw, unproven players like Romeo Lavia, Gavin Bazunu, Samuel Edozie and Juan Larios from Manchester City and Sekou Mara from Bordeaux, were not going to make that mistake.\n\nThey snapped Bella-Kotchap up for around £10m and, aside from a 4-1 defeat in the season opener against Tottenham, which involved an ill-fated back five including Yan Valery, their new signing has been ever-present alongside Mohammed Salisu.\n\nAfter his arrival, manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: 'He is a player who fits our profile very well and has a huge amount of potential. But, with the number of senior games he has already played, he can help us immediately.\n\n'I think he has made the perfect choice in wanting to join us and we will now work with him to make sure he reaches his potential both for himself and for the team.'\n\nBut even the club would have been surprised at how quickly he has settled. The imposing 6ft 3ins cuts a strapping figure and has the physicality - pace, explosive power, and strength - to succeed in the rough-and-tumble Premier League.\n\nNot only that, for a 20-year-old his mental attributes look good too, with a composed demeanour and fine understanding of match situations proven in a brilliant 2-1 win against Chelsea.\n\nSuperb highlight-reel moments - a last-ditch flick to dispossess Raheem Sterling, a brilliantly timed challenge to deny Anthony Elanga against United, an eye-catching burst forward against Leeds - only serve to persuade fans of his precocious talent.\n\nEmulating Rio and linked to Liverpool\n\nUpon arriving at St Mary's, Bella-Kotchap said: 'I read Rio's book, I think it was (an autobiography), it's quite interesting. Yes (he is one of my idols), because I know him personally and he's a very, very good guy with a big career.\n\n'(We met) through friends in Germany, he came to watch one of my games, after that he asked to speak to me. He was very happy about my move to England as well. He's a hero for me and I try to copy him a bit.'\n\nThere are worse players you can study.\n\nAlthough genuine comparisons are premature, there are traits one can see in both their games. The lithe figures, the decisiveness of their actions, the economy and elegance of their movement.\n\nBella-Kotchap admits his 'hero' is United legend Rio Ferdinand, whose game he tries to 'copy'\n\nLiverpool are reportedly interested in him as a long-term successor to Virgil van Dijk (centre)\n\nIt might be no surprise, then, that Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are reportedly keeping an eye on his situation.\n\nSpanish outlet Fichajes claims Real and Bayern see him as long-term partners for Eder Militao and Matthijs de Ligt, with Liverpool eyeing up a future replacement for Van Dijk, who at 31 has endured some surprisingly poor form this season.\n\nWith fellow Reds centre-halves Joel Matip both 31 and injury-prone, and Joe Gomez and Nat Phillips seemingly out of favour, an all Parisian-born centre half duo of Ibrahima Konate and Bella-Kotchap would strike fear into the hearts of opposition attackers.\n\nCalled up by Germany\n\nHis reward for his fine form? Well, only six games into his Southampton career, Germany manager Hansi Flick has called up him up to the senior side.\n\nExperience through the country's youth levels, with nine caps for the Under-21 side, means Flick evidently feels Bella-Kotchap is ready for the step up.\n\nGermany manager Hansi Flick has fast-tracked him into the senior squad - whether Bella-Kotchap (above) plays or not in the Nations League on Monday, his stock is only going one way\n\nPreferred to experienced operators like Mats Hummels, Jonathan Tah and Robin Koch left out of the squad, he is still competing with the likes of Real star Antonio Rudiger, Niklas Sule, Nico Schlotterbeck and Thilo Kehrer for a spot. Which is tough.\n\nHe was an unused substitute in Germany's 1-0 Nations League loss against Hungary on Friday.\n\nBut in a final group match against England on Monday that is a dead-rubber for both sides - albeit being the final competitive game for both teams before the World Cup - Flick may be tempted to blood Bella-Kotchap against an ailing Three Lions attack.\n\nIf he does, you wouldn't put it past him to continue England's goalscoring woes. Yet whether he plays or not, his stock is only going one way.",

    "Far-right German politicians accused of pro-Putin ‘propaganda trip’": "Politicians from a far-right party in Germany who are on a visit to Russia, and plan to travel to Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, have been accused of supporting Vladimir Putin’s war and of undertaking a “propaganda trip”.\n\nThe five Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) politicians said their aim was to “see for ourselves in situ the humanitarian situation”, but were asked to provide details of their visit to the party leadership, which apparently knew nothing about it in advance. The deputy leader of the party, Peter Boehringer, said the trip was not taking place on behalf of the AfD.\n\nThree of the group are members of state legislative assemblies, two from Saxony-Anhalt and one from North Rhine-Westphalia. In a statement posted on his Facebook and Telegram accounts, Christian Blex of the AfD in North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the travellers, posted a pin showing an intertwined German and Russian flag.\n\nChristian Blex posted a pin showing the intertwined flags. Photograph: Christian Blex / Facebook\n\nThe daily TAZ newspaper called it “especially perfidious”, in light of the recent reports of mass graves discovered in Izium, that the party chose to describe its visit as a humanitarian research trip.\n\nThe US-based Robert Lansing Institute for Global Threats and Democracies Studies (IGTDS), which describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit public policy research organisation, said the journey was taking place under the auspices of the Russian military secret service, members of whom would be accompanying the politicians to Donbas. The institute was the first to release the information.\n\nHans-Thomas Tillschneider, co-head of the Saxony-Anhalt branch of the AfD, and Daniel Wald, also a member of the Saxony-Anhalt state legislative assembly, released a statement via the AfD faction in the assembly stressing the party wanted to “see for its own eyes” beyond the reporting from the mainstream media reports, “especially those of the public service broadcasters”, which it said it viewed critically.\n\nAccording to the IGTDS, the politicians’ visit was taking place between 20 and 28 September. They were due to fly into the Russian port city of Rostov-on-Don and to travel from there to the occupied Donbas region.\n\nThe AfD has a reputation for its pro-Russian, sometimes also pro-Putin, stance. The travelling politicians are well-known for their backing of maintaining German-Russian relations despite the war, including scrapping sanctions against Russia. They have also voiced their support for opening the Nord Stream II pipeline, which was meant to provide a new supply of gas from Russia to Germany in addition to the flow from Nord Stream I, before it was scrapped by Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, just before the start of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTillschneider has described Putin as an “authentic bloke, a real man with a healthy framework of values”.\n\nAndriy Melnyk, the outgoing ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, shared the IGTDS’s report on Twitter before its official publication. He accused the politicians of supporting Russia’s “war of annihilation” with their journey, urging the head of Germany’s federal office for the protection of the constitution, Thomas Haldenwang, to “act now” and take steps against the politicians. Melnyk accused the AfD’s Saxony-Anhalt branch head, Martin Reichardt, of being “Putin’s fifth column in Germany”.\n\nThe AfD leadership appeared to be deeply critical of the journey, but its expressions of outrage were restricted to the failure of the group to register it, or get approval from them, in advance, rather than the fact they had travelled to Russia. It called upon the group to “comprehensively disclose” the organisation behind the journey and its execution.\n\nIt is not the first such visit of its kind. Blex travelled to Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, AfD politicians have frequently given interviews to Russian state media. In one such interview, Eugen Schmidt, an MP in the Bundestag, referred to Germany as an “illegitimate state”.",
    "A local’s guide to Lübeck, Germany: maritime gem full of history and club culture": "Food\n\nSchiffergesellschaft is the oldest restaurant in town, founded 500 years ago by captains of the Hanseatic League, who met there to debate, eat and drink. Soak up the maritime atmosphere at the long, weathered dining tables and try the famous northern dish Labskaus – beef stew with sweet-and-sour garnish, fried quail’s egg and chopped salted herring. It may look a bit strange but it tastes great. In the winter months, traditional pork and kale plates are a speciality.\n\nIn the Fleischhauerstrasse area, Erbse specialises in vegan dishes, Soulmates is a boutique ice-cream parlour offering flavours such as black forest cherry, and Nitsche serves delicious veggie deli bowls. Excellent coffee can be found at Cycle Roasters, and the best breakfast – homemade bread, coffee and croissants – is at Konvent, a really nice spot next to the Aegidien church.\n\nInspiration\n\nBook a tour to climb the stairs of the Marienkirche, the “mother church of brick gothic” – the model for the other brick gothic churches around the Baltic – and one of the tallest churches in the world. From the top, there are magnificent views over the old town island with its seven spires, which is a Unesco world heritage site. For an alternative view, take a cruise on the waterways that encircle the old town (Boat Now, €44 for an hour). You can even take the helm yourself if you want.\n\nThe Kulturwerft Gollan is the modern cultural hub of the city. It’s a renovated 19th-century shipyard that hosts concerts and festivals. Inside there’s a really cool brewery called Sudden Death, and a DIY design centre, MachBar, offering workshops, such as sewing for beginners.\n\nGreen space\n\nThe Drägerpark lies on the banks of River Wakenitz, and it’s where I go with my friends to swim in the natural open-air pool, the Marli, where there’s a three-metre diving board, water slides and paddleboards and canoes for hire. There’s plenty of space for a picnic, a large playground and a kiosk selling drinks and snacks.\n\nAbout an hour’s train ride away is the beach at Travemünde, with its extensive sands, characteristic wicker-roofed beach chairs and lots of stalls selling fish sandwiches along the harbour.\n\nAn amphibious bus takes to the water in Lübeck. Photograph: Wolfgang Diederich/Alamy\n\nNeighbourhood\n\nMy favourite neighbourhood is the area right next to the Drägerpark, Jürgen-Wullenwever Strasse and its surrounding streets. You can see the status the city enjoyed in former times in the enormous old houses of its former traders. Some of these are still owned by the descendants of the trading families, while others have been divided into apartments. It’s an exclusive area to live in but the abundance of trees and varied architectural styles make it pleasant to walk through. You will pass through this area when walking from the old town to the Drägerpark and taking the Moltkestrasse route crossing the River Wakenitz.\n\nNightlife\n\nLübeck’s students tend to meet in Clemensstrasse, which gets really crowded at weekends. Dietrich’s is a cosy little bar with a great range of gins, while Torrios is an American-style cocktail bar which sells its own craft gin, and La Havanna is a small club where Hector puts on salsa dances. Sounds is the most popular club in town, with live bands on Friday nights, and A1 is the biggest and puts on theme nights, such as Sounds of Goa. Over summer weekends, Drehbrückenplatz features musicians and outdoor parties.\n\nStay\n\nThe Ringhotel Jensen (doubles from €130) is on the banks of the River Trave, with some rooms and suites facing Lübeck’s medieval brick gothic Holstentor gate. The hotel dates from the 14th century and is in the “patrician villa” style, with rooms that are tastefully furnished and comfortable.\n\nTristan Wilken is co-owner, with Constantin Teichert, of Lübeck modern seafood restaurant Fangfrisch\n\n",
    "England’s ’10 German bombers’ song should be consigned to the dustbin of history": "Over the last few years, England has witnessed a boom in wartime nostalgia. “Keep calm and carry on”, that motivational message used to maintain public morale in 1939 as the a world war approached for the second time in a generation, has now warped into a twee greeting card slogan or hung on country kitchen walls, where “Keep calm and drink Prosecco” is now the sickly-sweet call to arms.\n\nDuring Covid-19, the nation was urged to summon up its archaic “blitz spirit”, extolled by leaders in place of leadership to a public that struggled to cope with the horrors such propaganda was intended to smother. “Blitz spirit” is not a state of mind; nor is “stiff upper lip”. They are fake concepts that bely a lack of choice but to face the impending nightmare.\n\nBetween September 1940 and May 1941, 12,000 metric tons of bombs were dropped on London. People did not whistle while they worked; they lived in fear of terrible news of loved ones abroad who in turn were kept awake by the fear of whether they would get home and what version of England they would discover if they did. It was a tool of national control.\n\nWar, therefore, was something to be forgotten, pushed to the back of the mind because society had not constructed means of support nor the understanding of mental disturbance to offer solutions even if it had. An entire generation did carry on and they did do their best to keep calm, but only through necessity rather than choice. When war was used as a cultural cornerstone, it was usually done in gentle mocking tones: Fawlty Towers and Dad’s Army both famously chose to focus on the conflict for comedic effect, either as the basis of the script or for memorable scenes.\n\nThe same was true in the national sport. In the 1960s and early 1970s, despite England facing Germany in a World Cup final, World Cup quarter-final and a two-legged European Championship quarter-final, explicit references to the war were kept to a minimum. It seems unlikely that it was deliberate, purely natural: when most of those who fought in the conflict were still alive and many of them football supporters, who on earth would want the reminders? If those contests may have had added rivalry fuelled by modern history, England and Germany faced as purely sporting opponents. Sport was intended to be an escape, not a reminder.\n\nBut, beginning in the 1980s, a newfound anti-German rhetoric swelled and football became the easiest battleground – where else, at what else, did England and Germany meet each other head on? Wartime nostalgia was used not as misguided consolation or deliberate propaganda, but to rile simmering aggression. The two chants – “10 German bombers” and “Two World Wars and one World Cup” – both previously sung with an upbeat tone, now gained an unpleasant edge. Their use played into England’s football isolationism: we invented the game and gave it to the world. Without success, was it any surprise that some relied on heritage more than was healthy?\n\nSee more STORY: FA writes to #ENG fans urging them not to \"disrespect\" #GER at Wembley, concerned that the national anthem will be booed and they will sing about Ten German Bombers. Fans identified previously chanting it have have banned. Details @iPaperSport: https://t.co/e1ijAxbo0w — Sam Cunningham (@samcunningham) June 29, 2021\n\nThe links with the rise in hooliganism during the 1980s is inescapable, not least because it often pitched English and German supporters against one another. England fans were attacked at Euro 88 and responded in kind at Euro 2000, both leading to a high number of arrests. In between, some fans of both countries behaved appallingly at World Cup 98. After West Germany beat England on penalties at Italia 90, 500 people were arrested as foreign-registered cars were overturned. In Brighton, police locked 300 German students in a nightclub to protect them and English youths chased young German students through the streets.\n\nIf the media could have played a role in de-escalation, they often chose the opposite strategy. During the 1980s, the tabloid circulation war often resorted to hyperbolic jingoism on its front pages, particularly around the Falklands War. The back pages, hardly wanting to be left out, equated sport to conflict. For the fixtures against Germany, there was a natural avenue to explore.\n\nWhen England met West Germany in 1982, The Sun’s back page read “Achtung Stations”, a clear reference to the two world wars. By the 1990 World Cup, the same paper urged England to “Help Our Boys Clout The Krauts”. At Euro 96, 30 years after the World Cup final and with jingoism exploding beyond all reason, the Daily Mirror’s infamous “ACHTUNG! SURRENDER!” was published ahead of the semi-final. But they were not alone: “Blitz Fritz” said The Sun; “Watch out, Krauts, England are gonna bomb you to bits at Wembley” roared the Daily Star. Lamentable slurs had become the norm. They stirred up resentment.\n\nIf those headlines were evidently unhelpful, they were also playing into a new form of ultra-nationalism and anti-EU feeling. Germany became the poster country of that sentiment, based on historic conflict and by now regular high-profile sporting contests.\n\nEngland’s football matches became the natural home for that ultra-nationalism. This was a team that was, by its very definition, English and not British and who often faced continental opponents. England had long been the loser in recent contests, which only stirred ill-feeling. Germany became our football nemesis, jingoism inevitably spilled over and references to the war became a stick with which to laud English dominance, no matter how much one-eyed oversimplification that required.\n\nAs then German culture minister Michael Naumann said: “There is only one nation that has decided to make the Second World War a sort of spiritual core of its self-understanding and pride.” Nauman presumably shook his head at the pictures of England supporters dressed in RAF uniforms with inflatable fighter planes at the 2010 World Cup last-16 fixture in Bloemfontein.\n\nEngland’s players, managers and Football Association have spent 15 years trying to make it stop. It started with Sven-Goran Eriksson asking England supporters to refrain at the 2006 World Cup – although newspaper columnist Tony Parsons still believed it should be encouraged; rhetoric lived on. In 2017, Gareth Southgate described “10 German bombers” as “completely unacceptable ahead of a friendly. By 2021, the FA and Uefa agreed that the chant should be banned, thus allowing punishments to be handed down to those found guilty of singing it – still it could be heard outside Wembley Stadium. In Munich in June, riot police were goaded with the same song and arrests were made for Nazi salutes.\n\nWhat reason is there for its continuation, despite polite and then more urgent requests to stop? For some the answer is simply the Law of Banter – to joke about global conflict is fair game because there is nothing that isn’t when you are trying to score points. For others, the song might reflect the continued rise of isolationism and turbo-nationalism displayed before, during and after the Brexit vote and the UK’s departure from the EU. To those, this is a song that marks their celebration. We are English and you are not – that makes us better.\n\nFor the rest, this is simply bad behaviour through performance. They sing “10 German bombers” with no thought of its context, neither through outright hatred nor selective nostalgia, but because it gets a reaction. And when that reaction comes, it only makes them more likely to persevere.\n\nThankfully, we are now discussing a small minority, at England games and in pubs. Thankfully too, the obsession with Germany does appear to be waning. If the greatest impact of the Euro 2020 victory was not taking England into a quarter-final but persuading those supporters that they need not treat this as the latest instalment of a historic grudge, it was a more magnificent win than we first thought.\n\nBut on Monday evening, at Wembley and around the country, the bizarre infatuation will continue in pockets. England are playing Germany, and thus the rules of engagement are set. They will reference a conflict that even their parents may not remember. They will warp support for their country’s football team into hostility to the opponent, to this opponent. And they will not listen to those who wish they would stop because why should they, they say. Keep calm and carry on offending."
