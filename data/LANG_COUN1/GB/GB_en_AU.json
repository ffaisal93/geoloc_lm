    "Australian business schools count on return of international students": "Australia’s higher education system has been one of the country’s worst hit sectors during the pandemic, as the stifling effects of border closures on international student numbers cut its revenue in half.\n\nCovid-19, and the government’s response of strict border controls — part of its “Fortress Australia” policy — choked off the flow of overseas students. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, revenue from that vital resource for universities shrank to A$20.2bn ($13.8bn) in the year to June. That compared with A$38.7bn for the same period in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\n\nUniversities and their business schools were quick to switch courses online and devise ways to maintain engagement with students who were locked down and with no way of returning to their home countries. Nonetheless, enrolment from overseas slumped.\n\nGovernment data show there were 956,773 international students enrolled in Australian universities in 2019, with more than 750,000 of them paying full fees on a student visa. That number has dropped to roughly 446,000 this year.\n\nEliza Littleton, an economist with the Australia Institute public policy think-tank, says the sector had become “increasingly reliant on international student fees, casual employment, and the underpayment of staff — dysfunctions which were exacerbated by the pandemic”.\n\nShe notes that Australian universities recorded revenue declines for the first time in eight years in 2021 which led to 35,000 job cuts — almost one in five — across the higher education sector.\n\nInternational students at University of Sydney say online classes meant they ‘lost the real meaning of studying abroad’ © Loren Elliott/Reuters\n\nRoy Green, emeritus professor and former dean of the business school at University of Technology Sydney, says this added pressure on academic staff to increase their teaching workload. Meanwhile, research projects — often funded from international student fees — have been cut, prompting many postdoctoral students and early-career researchers to move overseas. “It led to a demoralisation in the higher education sector,” he adds.\n\nThe geopolitical tension between Australia and China has also hit universities that had depended on a steady flow of international students.\n\nXiao Qian, China’s ambassador to Australia, was keen to stress the importance of the educational ties between the two countries, in a speech in June at the University of Technology Sydney. He pointed out that there were 131,400 Chinese students in Australia, accounting for 28 per cent of the country’s international student population.\n\n35,000 Number of job cuts in Australia higher education prompted by the pandemic\n\nThat number, according to Australian government data, is up to 20 per cent lower than in the previous year — which is a steeper decline than that for students from other countries.\n\nHowever, there are now signs that Chinese students could be returning in force. Jon Chew, global head of insights at consultants Navitas, says visa data for the first six months of the year suggests there has been a “full recovery” in the number of Chinese students. Roughly 40 per cent of those were returning students.\n\nBut Chew adds that the auditor-general in New South Wales has highlighted this dependence on Chinese fee-paying students. Seven out of 10 of the universities in the state now report that China is the leading source of overseas student revenue, creating a concentration risk.\n\nThe drop in Chinese students has been less acute for business schools, though, as the growing number of Indian, Nepalese and Indonesian students enrolling in recent years has reduced the reliance on Australia’s largest trading partner for revenue.\n\nMoreover, domestic demand unexpectedly soared during the pandemic. Mark Barnaba, who sits on the board of University of Western Australia Business School and was its chair for almost two decades, says business schools proved the unlikely beneficiaries of the country’s strict lockdown protocols.\n\n“The domestic market increased as people isolated at home [and] opted to study during lockdown,” he says. “Companies looking to retain labour also encouraged that and helped with fees. It was an unusual dynamic that, overall, benefited Australian business schools.”\n\nAndrew John, associate dean of the Melbourne Business School, points out that, while its executive education business declined during lockdown, the institute had one of its largest ever intakes for part-time students from September 2020. “This did not surprise us,” he says.\n\nThe main change for Melbourne Business School has been a slowing “study rate”, with fewer students taking two subjects at once. “We are not sure if this is temporary, perhaps reflecting the pressure and burnout that, at least anecdotally, is being felt across the workforce in Australia, or whether it is a permanent shift,” John says.\n\nAustralia’s aim is to draw more international students back to its shores, with plans to cut visa complexity — not only to boost numbers, but also to tempt more of them to become permanent citizens.\n\nDeparting students have become a source of concern, for the higher education sector and the wider economy. If Australia loses its best students overseas but also fails to retain international students after study, it risks a ‘brain drain’. At the same time, with unemployment at near-50 year lows, the country faces a labour shortage.\n\nThe government has responded with proposals to lengthen visa durations and extend the right to stay and work for student visa holders — a key attraction for more international students to enrol.\n\nAnd Barnaba, who is also deputy chair of mining group Fortescue and sits on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia, believes the strict lockdown measures that froze out so many international students could even prove a boon, now that borders have reopened.\n\n“Australia’s strict Covid restrictions kept fatalities low,” he says — “and, combined with the strength of the economy and general view of being a safe and enjoyable country to live in”, this could make Australia appear an attractive country in which to study.\n\nDespite the “background noise” of geopolitical tension, Green suggests Chinese students will continue to have an important role in Australia and the funding of the higher education sector. “It’s like iron ore,” he says. “If someone said ‘let’s not deal with China,’ then the economy would go down the spiral. It’s the same in higher education.”",
    "UN Rights Body Rules Australia Failed to Protect from Climate Change": "Click to expand Image A woman walks past palm trees on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait, August 9, 2006. © 2006 Andrew Mears/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee on September 23 found that the Australian government had violated the rights of Indigenous Torres Strait Islanders by failing to adequately protect them against the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nThe groundbreaking decision of the committee, an independent expert body that monitors state compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), establishes important protections under international human rights law for climate-affected communities.\n\nThe complaint was the first legal action brought by climate-vulnerable inhabitants of low-lying islands against a state. Eight Australian nationals and their children, Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait region, alleged that Australia failed to implement an adaptation program to ensure the long-term habitability of the islands.\n\nThe committee heard that changes in weather patterns harmed the Islanders’ livelihoods, culture, and traditional way of life. Severe flooding caused by tidal surges destroyed family graves, while heavy rainfall and storms degraded the land and reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming.\n\nThe committee found that despite construction of some seawalls on the islands, the Australian government had not taken sufficient steps to protect the Islanders’ homes and livelihoods. The committee also found that that the government had not provided the Islanders with a way to maintain their traditional way of life and transmit their culture to their children.\n\n“States that fail to protect individuals under their jurisdiction from the adverse effects of climate change may be violating their human rights under international law,” said Hélène Tigroudja, a committee member.\n\nUnder the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, states have an obligation to provide those whose rights have been violated with an effective remedy. The committee ruled Australia should pay adequate compensation to the claimants and secure the communities’ “continued safe existence” on the islands.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee decision paves the way for further legal action and compensation claims by other climate-affected communities around the globe. It sends a clear warning to all governments that they need to protect citizens from climate harm, and failure to do so may make them legally liable. To avoid similar violations in the future, the government should immediately adopt robust and rights-respecting climate mitigation and adaptation policies consistent with the best available science.",
    "To Save Its Renowned Nature, Australia Invests More in Indigenous Management": "Australia is a continent that faces unique pressures, particularly from introduced species and catastrophic wildfires exacerbated by rapidly changing climate. Indigenous Australians have lived throughout the continent for millennia and know best how to manage many of those pressures. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have developed an intimate understanding of their homelands’ nature and seasons, including the role that fire has in the natural world’s regeneration and preservation.\n\nIn recent decades, the Australian Government has been moving toward recognising the knowledge and leadership Indigenous Australians have shown in protecting more of their lands through the highly successful Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) program. Under the program, which started in 1998, the country has designated 81 IPAs covering more than 85 million hectares of land and 4 million hectares of sea country.\n\nBut with more than 20% of Australia held, in some form, by Indigenous peoples, more IPAs are needed. These land and sea areas include some of Australia’s most exceptional natural environments, rich with native plants and animals—including many threatened species—that require ongoing care to survive. These areas are also home to some of the oldest artistic and cultural sites in the world.\n\nFortunately, the Australian Government recently announced new funding commitments for IPAs and for the country’s Indigenous Ranger Program—a welcome step toward ensuring both programs’ continued success.\n\nIPAs are partnerships led by Traditional Owners (Aboriginal people with certain rights and responsibilities in relation to land or sea) and supported by the Australian Government. They build community and strengthen local governance—for example, by supporting people in applying Indigenous ecological knowledge, fostering cultural ties within Indigenous groups, passing knowledge from Elders to younger community members and protecting sacred sites.\n\nDecision-making, conservation planning, and management work within IPAs is led by Traditional Owners through their local land and sea management organisations, in agreement with the Government. IPA plans also prioritise the management of key Outback environmental threats, such as feral animals, invasive weeds and destructive wildfires. Work can also include protecting rock art, collaborating with researchers, managing fires for the best outcomes for people and nature, and welcoming visitors.\n\nFurther, IPAs typically create a highly productive means for Traditional Owners to develop and strengthen partnerships with state and federal agencies and other stakeholders, such as non-profit conservation groups, local industry and research organisations. As the leaders and primary managers of IPAs, Traditional Owners are the central drivers of key decisions applying to their estates.\n\nIn September 2021, the Government announced consultation funding to develop 7 new IPAs encompassing 3.7 million hectares. The proposed IPAs stretch from the Torres Strait and Cape York regions of Queensland across to the Kimberley and Pilbara areas of Western Australia; developing full management plans will take several years.\n\nOver the coming years, with millions of more hectares of IPAs planned, these areas are expected to make up more than 50% of Australia's National Reserve System and will be key to the country meeting its domestic and international responsibilities to manage nature and protect important cultural values.\n\nLong-term work by the Country Needs People partnership of more than 40 frontline Indigenous land and sea management groups has backed the growth and development of the IPA network, community-based Indigenous ranger jobs and protected area co-management initiatives around Australia. The Pew Charitable Trusts is proud to be a key supporter of Country Needs People.\n\nIndigenous rangers are funded principally through the Australian Government’s Indigenous Ranger Program, which supports Traditional Owners in combining Indigenous traditional and local knowledge with other techniques to protect and care for the land and sea.\n\nIn a separate but related move, in March 2022 the Australian Government committed to doubling Indigenous ranger jobs throughout Australia, over time, with a $636 million investment in the program. The ambitious commitment to doubling ranger jobs by 2030 and increasing funding for IPAs was reiterated by the newly elected government in May, as part of its longstanding policy position.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia are driven by a strong will to sustain culture and connection to Country. Their work managing pressures on the landscape through locally driven organisations and initiatives such as Indigenous ranger programs are key to ensuring a viable future for sustainable management of Australia’s land and sea.\n\nIndigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous rangers are world-leading examples of how governments and others can partner with Indigenous leadership in land and sea management. These programs are vital to local communities—for cultural, economic and environmental reasons—and Pew applauds the Australian Government for its continued commitment to these programs’ success.\n\nMichelle Grady directs Pew’s Outback to Oceans program in Australia.",
    "Australia plans privacy overhaul after huge telecom data leak": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says reforms would allow banks to ‘protect their customers’.\n\nAustralia will overhaul its privacy rules to allow banks to be informed of data breaches in the corporate world, following a huge leak of personal information from the country’s second-biggest telecom.\n\nSpeaking on local radio on Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the hacking of No 2 telecom Optus was a “huge wake-up call” that necessitated reforms that would alert financial institutions to cyberattacks and allow them to “protect their customers.”\n\nUnder the planned changes, businesses would be required to alert banks of data breaches involving customers so that lenders could monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\n\nCybersecurity Minister Clare O’Neill said over the weekend that details of what “steps need to be taken in the future” would be announced in the coming days.\n\nOptus disclosed last week that the personal details of up to 10 million users may have been compromised following one of the biggest data breaches in Australian history.\n\nThe carrier, which is owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has said the compromised information includes names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and driver’s licence and passport numbers.\n\nA self-identified hacker has since posted messages online threatening to expose information obtained in the leak unless Optus pays a ransom of $1m in cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough Optus has not identified who is behind the cyberattack, the telecom has said the attacker’s IP address can be traced to a number of countries in Europe.\n\nTrevor Long, a technology industry analyst based in Sydney, said the proposed reforms did not go far enough.\n\n“Customers are angry, they are talking about leaving Optus, and we still don’t truly know the size of the issue as Optus are not releasing numbers,” Long told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The government needs to put in place a simple credit-blocking mechanism for people to use to turn off the ability for credit to be applied for under their name. Turn it on when you want a loan or credit card, turn it off when you don’t. That off switch effectively cuts off any fraudsters at the first hurdle.”\n\nThe data breach at Optus is the latest in a string of cyberattacks this month involving leading companies, including Samsung, North Face, American Airlines and Uber.",

    "When asked about China, Australians tend to think of its government, not its people": "Official relations between Australia and China have been strained in recent years. The two countries have been involved in a trade dispute since 2020, when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and China responded by imposing new tariffs. The worsening relationship has also been evident in public opinion surveys: Australia saw the sharpest increase in negative views of China of any country surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2020, and those negative views remain widespread in Australia today.\n\nTo better understand how Australians think about China, the Center asked Australians in a 2021 survey to describe – in their own words – the first thing that comes to mind when they think of China. Researchers then analyzed the 1,127 responses with a focus on the first five topics that Australians mentioned.\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to get a better sense of Australians’ attitudes about China at a time of tension between the two countries. The analysis examines responses from Australians who were asked to describe, in their own words, the first things that come to mind when they think about China. To do this, we surveyed 1,127 Australians from March 15 to 29, 2021, and coded their responses. We coded the first five mentions in each open-ended response using a researcher-developed codebook. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAustralian adults most frequently mentioned the political system when thinking about China (29%). Some specifically critiqued the government. For example, one Australian man said, “Chinese leadership is a threat to the rest of the world.”\n\nOther Australians listed government actions, such as one woman who referenced “punishment for those who speak out about the government.” Some comments about the government were more neutral, such as “Different forms of government need to be respected.”\n\nA public focus on China’s government – rather than its people – is consistent with other recent Pew Research Center findings about China, including in the United States. The Center has also found a similar pattern in survey respondents’ views of countries other than China: Americans, for example, are more likely to have a negative view of Israel’s government than its people.\n\nIn Australia, the share of respondents who brought up China’s political system in their open-ended responses included 15% who described how political power was distributed across or exercised in the country. Many simply used labels such as “undemocratic,” “authoritarian” and “oppressive.” One Australian man called it a “totalitarian one-party state.” An Australian woman described a “strongly focused government that will seek conformity from citizens.” Another 9% of respondents specifically pointed to communism or the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which is set to convene its National Party Congress in October, when President Xi Jinping is expected to assume a third term.\n\nA country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you. Australian woman\n\nIn other responses to the Center’s survey, nearly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%) mentioned some perceived threat that China poses to the world, their region, Australia or China’s own people. Most responses in this category focused on China’s general quest to be the most powerful country (7%) or its perceived poor international conduct (7%), including mentions of manipulation and bullying on the world stage. One Australian woman said she thought of China as “a country that ignores rules and gets away with it. A country that wants to dominate the world. A bully that has used Australia as an example to other countries that if you cross them they will punish you.”\n\nThreats were more commonly top of mind for Australians ages 60 and older, as well as those who support Australia’s governing party – which, at the time of the survey, was the Liberal-National coalition, led by former Prime Minister Scott Morrison. (The current prime minister is Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party.)\n\nFor some Australians, China poses an economic or military threat (referenced by 4% each). Perceived economic threats included “working their way into different countries by lending,” using “trade sanctions to try and force their way or take revenge,” or simply “economic manipulation.” Mentions of China’s military included phrases such as “military strength,” “a military threat” or “military expansion.”\n\nFor roughly a quarter of Australians who volunteered an answer (23%), human rights abuses were one of the first things to come to mind when thinking of China, and 11% specifically mentioned lack of freedoms in the form of government repression and censorship. One man described the country as “a powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition.” Words like “conformity” and “thought control” also came up, as well as mentions of restricted freedom of expression for Chinese citizens.\n\nA powerful, growing empire with a bad human rights record that uses a surveillance state and heavy censorship to keep its government in power with no real opposition. Australian man\n\nThe share of Australians who mentioned human rights included 4% who mentioned the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghur people, an ethnic minority group in the Xinjiang region of northwest China. Some explicitly used the word “genocide,” and others referenced “concentration” or “re-education” camps. One Australian woman said, “I have grave concerns about the Uyghurs and the way they are being rounded up and put into the so-called re-education centers. It seems as if there is another holocaust happening with these people.”\n\nRoughly a fifth of Australian adults who offered an answer (18%) brought up the economy when thinking about China, including 4% who described the current state or growth of its economy. An Australian man referred to China as an “economic powerhouse that managed to bring a billion people out of poverty in a few decades with cheap labor.” Others focused on China’s manufacturing prowess (3%), including an Australian woman who called China “the world’s factory.” An equal share of Australians (3%) mentioned trade, including China’s tariffs on some Australian goods. Fewer mentioned topics such as cheap or poorly manufactured products, or China’s status as an economic powerhouse.\n\nAbout one-in-ten Australians who provided an answer (8%) mentioned the size of China’s population in their responses. For example, one woman said, “Big population,” and another referenced “population overflow.”\n\nA similar share of Australian respondents (7%) offered generally positive evaluations of China. Some of these respondents identified things associated with China, such as one woman who wrote, “pandas, the wall of China, dumplings.” Others mentioned China’s culture and history, including another woman who mentioned China’s “rich artistic, economic, trading and scientific history.” Positive responses were more common among Australians ages 18 to 29 than those 60 and older. When it comes to overall favorability of China, younger Australians also have more favorable views of China than older ones.\n\nAustralia called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020, and a small share of Australians who volunteered an answer mentioned COVID-19 in their answers (6%). This included references to the origins of the coronavirus with mentions of “wet markets” and “Wuhan,” as well as references to China’s response to COVID-19. Others said they held China responsible for the pandemic due to insufficient containment efforts or alleged that the Chinese government engaged in a cover-up to conceal the country’s role in the spread of the virus. One woman said, “The first thing that comes to mind is selfish! If they had come forward when they were first aware of the risks of the virus and shut their borders to contain it, the world would not be suffering the way it is now.”\n\nThe people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry. Australian woman\n\nAnother 6% of Australians who offered their views about China brought up the Chinese people. One woman said, “The people themselves are lovely, but the government is power hungry.” Another woman said, “[I] have worked with some lovely Chinese people but have concerns about the attitude of the country’s ruling party towards other countries and their policies.”\n\nSome specifically referenced Chinese nationals abroad – especially those living in Australia – and a perception that they failed to assimilate to local culture. Others spoke to the long-standing history of people of Chinese origins living in Australia, such as one woman who said, “[There are] many Chinese living in Australia and have been for a long time and are part of our history. White Australia has often been racist towards Chinese.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government received largely negative evaluations in Australians’ responses, only 1% of responses expressed negative views of the Chinese people (compared with the 4% of responses that described the people of China in a positive light). Negative responses included words such as “selfish” and “unsympathetic.” In contrast, positive sentiments mentioned traits such as “hard-working,” “ingenious” and “family oriented.”\n\nA small share of Australian respondents (3%) brought up China’s environmental impact. One woman said she’s “been to China on business & for personal reasons. I’ve been north, south, east and a reasonable way west. I’ve never seen the horizon, because of the ever-present pollution.”\n\nAnother 3% of respondents spoke about China as a general or political world power. These included an Australian woman who called China a “world power with serious potential.”\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nTopic China Global Image",

Over the next decade, Australia’s old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to the working-age population) will change from about four workers to three workers for every retiree.\n\nLower tax receipts and higher spending on pensions, health and aged care may cost around $40bn every year (about 8% of the budget).\n\nGiven concerns about debt levels and budget repair, government revenues must better align with outlays if Australians want continuation of expected benefits, cost-of-living relief and expenditure on ameliorating the rising costs of more frequent climate change induced weather events.\n\nAustralia’s overall taxation level at 28% of GDP is below the OECD average of 34% and at least 10%% less than that of Germany, France and Scandinavia.\n\nAddressing the tax take and how it is raised is a pressing issue.\n\nAustralia’s tax base is narrow, dependent on personal income taxes which at 42% of all federal tax revenues is also below the OECD average of 49%, after adjustment for social security payments which many countries levy to fund unemployment support, age and disability pensions.\n\nGiven Australia’s reasonably progressive tax scale and a highest marginal tax rate of 47% (including the Medicare levy), scope for increases is limited if the country wishes to attract and retain skilled talent.\n\nCorporate taxes (about 17% v the OECD average of 10%) are difficult to increase because of Australia’s industrial structure and high overseas ownership of businesses (about 79%) with earnings accruing overseas.\n\nA side-effect of globalisation and Australia’s open economy is that personal and corporate income tax increases need to stay globally competitive in what is increasingly a race to the bottom. This may make increased consumption and wealth taxes unavoidable.\n\nAustralia’s GST, at about 12% of total tax revenue, is below the OECD average of 20%. Increases in the rate and coverage are one alternative.\n\nAs at March 2022, total Australian household wealth reached $14.9tn ($574,807 a person). Since March 2020, it has risen 35%, due to increases in residential property values (up 40%) and superannuation balances (up 22%). Since the abolition of death duties in 1979, this wealth accrues largely tax free except for concessional capital gains imposts.\n\nWhere to raise more taxes?\n\nOptions include revising the capital gains tax regime and introducing inheritance taxes – Australia is one of few countries that does not tax bequests.\n\nUltimately, primary residences and superannuation balances will need to be taxed or applied against post-work aged care and healthcare expenses. Wealthier Australians cannot continue to use their homes and superannuation as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle with the capital preserved at death for beneficiaries.\n\nIrregularities and anomalies need to be reduced.\n\nGovernment support must be targeted to ensure intended recipients benefit.\n\nAustralia’s childcare subsidies, for example, are available to families with income up to $356,756. Frequently distortionary, regressive and expensive concessions for investment in equipment that would be bought anyway, dividends, capital gains, superannuation and property must be reconsidered.\n\nSimplification of Australia’s complex tax code of tens of thousands of pages is essential. It enables legal structuring of affairs to minimise tax liabilities. A simpler principle rather than detailed rule-based system and allowing retrospective penalties, where the legislative policy or intent is ignored, would reduce tax planning opportunities.\n\nBut significant tax changes in Australia are difficult.\n\nWill Labor make the move?\n\nThe GST, ultimately introduced by stealth, took decades. The ALP attributes its loss at the 2019 election to modest proposed alterations to taxation of dividends and negative gearing, since abandoned.\n\nUnwilling to attempt serious tax reform, governments rely instead on bracket creep – increased tax revenue from rising nominal incomes due to inflation which put taxpayers into higher tax categories. This has pushed up the average personal income tax rate from 24% in 2016-17 to about 27% now. Inflation indexing thresholds would force governments to be transparent about tax revenues. Understandably, it faces bipartisan opposition.\n\nComplexity facilitates pork barrel politics with governments tweaking concessions and provisions to placate different constituencies.\n\nA large tax advice industry of questionable productive value resists simplification as an existential threat. Voters are likely to reject proposals that adversely affect them financially.\n\n\n\nWithout radical tax reform, Australia faces an insoluble public finance problem – demand for spending which cannot be met by taxes. The only other course of action is to wind back the country’s cherished welfare net.\n\nAs the old pre-metric saying goes: “You can’t get quarts out of pint pots.”",
    "Analysis: Australia - a land of promise and hurdles for offshore wind developers": "A fence is seen in front of wind turbines that are part of the Infigen Energy Capital Wind Farm located on the hills surrounding Lake George, near the Australian capital city of Canberra, Australia February 21, 2018. REUTERS/David Gray\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies Net zero push stokes hopes for offshore wind projects\n\nVictoria state aims for 9 GW offshore wind by 2040\n\nSector needs new regulations, to lure technology suppliers\n\nIndustry also set to face environmental, landowner concerns\n\nMELBOURNE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Under a new government, Australia is shaping up to be the next big market for offshore wind developers, attracting interest from the likes of Shell, Denmark's Orsted and Norway's Equinor. But the industry, starting from scratch Down Under, faces a slew of challenges.\n\nAfter more than a decade of weak climate action under conservative leaders, Anthony Albanese's new Labor government has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 - a goal that aligns with states' renewable energy goals.\n\nTo meet that target, the country will need 96 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2035, replacing coal-fired plants that are set to close, and offshore wind will have to be part of that mix, Shell's (SHEL.L) Australia chair Tony Nunan told Reuters in an interview.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nOnshore wind power accounts for 10% of Australia's electricity needs but the groundwork needed for offshore farms - which are much bigger and far more productive - is only just starting to fall into place after a law setting out a framework for their development was passed late last year.\n\nThe government has, however, moved quickly to launch a process for identifying offshore zones to be opened up for licenses. The first area proposed is off Victoria state's Gippsland coast, with a final decision expected before the end of the year.\n\n\"We're at the fairly early stages and a lot has happened in the last few weeks much faster than people expected and that's attracted a lot of global attention,\" said Tim Sawyer, chief international officer at Flotation Energy, which has a proposed project off the Gippsland coast.\n\nTo many in the industry, Australia could well become the next boom market for offshore wind.\n\nEquinor (EQNR.OL), for example, sees Australia as one of its top three Asia-Pacific markets for offshore wind, behind Japan and South Korea and plans to use its South Korean projects as a template for Australia, said Lars Nordli, Equinor's vice president for business development renewables Asia & Pacific.\n\nTHE HURDLES\n\nHowever, the sector will need new regulations and beefed-up government departments to handle licensing and approvals. It will also have to develop a supply chain as well as workers' skills for thousands of jobs in construction, operations and maintenance, industry executives said.\n\nProjects, which typically take eight to 10 years to complete, will likely also need to overcome potential opposition from landowners concerned about transmission lines needed to hook into the grid onshore.\n\nCommunity concerns about the impact of wind turbines on bird life, such as orange-bellied parrots, and sealife, such as fish and whales, are also expected.\n\n\"Each project will be assessed individually to make sure we protect our precious biodiversity while we harness our world-class offshore wind to generate clean energy,\" Victoria's energy minister, Lily D'Ambrosio, said in comments emailed to Reuters.\n\nThe industry must also lure suppliers of vessels, turbines and other related technology away from rapidly growing offshore wind markets in Europe and Asia - suppliers who may only come if there are several projects being developed around the same time.\n\n\"There's only a limited number of vessels in the world that can be used for erecting turbines offshore. So you need to attract those vessels to Australian waters,\" said Charles Rattray, CEO of Star of the South, the country's most advanced proposed offshore wind project.\n\nFlotation Energy sees opportunities to speed up development and cut costs by using oil and gas assets that are coming to the end of their lives in waters off Victoria, such as vessels that will be deployed for decommissioning oil and gas platforms.\n\n\"There's a lot of opportunities from a petroleum industry that's got 50 years of heritage in the region...to take part of that and evolve it into offshore wind,\" Sawyer said. \"I'd prefer we're not taking 10 years to build a project.\"\n\nFOCUS ON VICTORIA STATE\n\nShell (SHEL.L), Orsted (ORSTED.CO) and France's ENGIE (ENGIE.PA), through its Ocean Winds venture with EDP Renewables, said they are watching the Victorian process closely.\n\nVictoria state's Gippsland coast first in line\n\nThe state, which has spearheaded the country's offshore wind push, plans to procure 2 gigawatts (GW) of offshore capacity with supply due by 2032, enough to power 1.5 million homes. It is also targeting 4 GW by 2035 and 9 GW by 2040.\n\nThe 2.2 GW capacity Star of the South, on the drawing board for 10 years and now majority owned by Danish wind giant Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, aims to be up and running in 2028.\n\nNew South Wales has also sought bids for renewable energy projects for the Illawarra region south of Sydney, attracting eight offshore wind proposals with 12.9 GW of capacity worth A$35 billion ($23 billion).\n\n\"New South Wales has got much better options. It's got much bigger electricity demand. All the coal is closing in the next 10 years, so you've got incredible grid infrastructure opening up,\" said Oceanex Energy CEO Andy Evans, who was a Star of the South co-founder.\n\nOceanex, which has lined up Equinor as a partner, hopes to start producing power off New South Wales by 2030, he said.\n\n($1 = 1.5378 Australian dollars)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Sonali Paul; Additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing": "Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says.\n\nThe country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export.\n\n“We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.”\n\nRenate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms.\n\n“You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.”\n\nThe Covid pandemic helped spur demands for more local manufacturing capability when Australia struggled to secure supplies of vaccines and medical equipment.\n\nOngoing supply chain disruptions, particularly as China maintains its Covid-zero policies, have given added impetus to calls for more domestic production capability.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand buy most of our consumables from overseas, particuarly China. And China is the dominant world supplier for many of our key imports. In the case of computers and phones, China also makes up over 40% of world supply. #ausecon @madelinedunk @DavidPlank12 pic.twitter.com/Jw02qfGh0c — ANZ_Research (@ANZ_Research) September 21, 2022\n\nA spokesperson for the industry and science minister, Ed Husic, said solar was “clearly going to be a big part of Australia’s renewable energy future”.\n\n“The Albanese government will deliver dedicated support through Powering Australia – a $3bn co-investment stream as part of the National Reconstruction Fund,” he said. “A big part of its focus will be on renewables component manufacturing and low-emissions technologies, including production of batteries and solar panels.\n\n“By 2030, the government aims to have 82% renewables in the national electricity market. To achieve that, we will need to produce much more solar capacity on shore as well as having a diversity in our international supply chains.”\n\nThe present trade tensions between Australia and China exacerbated “the potential threat to supply restrictions or sudden price changes”, the APVI paper said.\n\n“Adding to this risk is the growing concern over the possible use of forced labour in parts of China, where much of the silicon, wafers and steel used in PV components are produced,” it said.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The country wouldn’t need to make all of the components in modules but could specialise.\n\nLocal firms could make glass, aluminium frames, polymers or the electronics such as inverters, while leaving production of polysilicon – a key raw material – to others.\n\n“I think it’s at the top end of silicon refining and then module assembly,” Egan said. “We need to be making some smart decisions and deploying at scale.”\n\nThe paper cited existing suppliers including Selectronic – one of the world’s oldest makers of inverters.\n\nSunDrive is a firm considering commercial-size silicon-based solar cell fabrication in Australia, while 5B is aiming at fast low-cost PV deployment to supply some of the multi-gigawatt-sized solar farms planned for northern Australia.\n\n“To succeed on a global scale, these emerging companies would benefit from market certainty and a coordinated effort to reach scale,” the paper said.\n\nCustomers could include Sun Cable, a venture supported by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, that aims to build a 12,000-hectare solar precinct in the Northern Territory with 17-20GW capacity and 36-42GW-hours of energy storage.\n\nForrest’s Fortescue group said last week it was planning 2-3GW of renewable energy using solar and wind plants between 2024-28. It was also working to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the global supply of decarbonisation technologies and was building the world’s largest electrolyser facility for the production of hydrogen in Gladstone as part of that effort.",
    "Australia Pushes Ahead With Central Bank Digital Currency, Announces Pilot Timeline": "Australia is pushing ahead with central bank digital (CBDC) currency research. On Monday, Australia’s central bank said in a whitepaper that the country’s CBDC pilot should be completed by mid-2023.\n\nThe plan, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), is to research the use cases for a CBDC in Australia and try it out in an experiment using Quorum, an enterprise-grade, private variant of Ethereum.\n\nToday’s whitepaper said that the pilot—which kicked off in July and is being run in partnership with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Center (DFCRC)—doesn’t mean the RBA will necessarily release a CBDC.\n\nA CBDC is a digital version of a country’s fiat currency—in this case the Australian dollar. Today’s whitepaper said Australia’s CBDC would be called eAUD.\n\nCBDCs are different from other digital currencies like Bitcoin because they are centralized. Bitcoin is decentralized meaning no central party has control of it. But CDBCs like the eAUD are controlled by the state’s central bank.\n\n“The project is seeking to facilitate ideation and innovation in use cases, and in turn use those results to better understand the case for introducing a CBDC in Australia,” the whitepaper said, adding that it was expecting industry participants like financial institutions, fintechs and established businesses to contribute to the research.\n\nIt noted that the research does not mean the RBA wants to wean Australian citizens off using cash.\n\nCountries around the world are in different stages of researching or releasing CDBCs. China is fast pushing ahead with its digital yuan by letting citizens try it out in a growing number of provinces.\n\nLast week, five speakers at a hearing for the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services voted in favor of the U.S. developing a digital currency in some form, citing concern that it may be falling behind China.",
    "The safeguard mechanism: Australia’s emissions trading scheme in all but name": "Climate policy can sometimes seem like it is being spoken in a different language. Take the issue of the moment in Australia: the safeguard mechanism.\n\nFor people deeply embedded in the mechanics of how governments plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the safeguard mechanism has become a reasonably familiar subject since it was introduced by the Coalition six years ago – even though the Morrison government and its predecessors didn’t like to talk about it much.\n\nIts relevance increased significantly in May, when the Albanese government was elected promising to make it a centrepiece of its pledge to ramp up climate action. But I suspect for most people, even those paying regular attention, the details are hazy.\n\nFrom the time it was created under then prime minister Tony Abbott, the story of the safeguard has been one of obfuscation and marketing.\n\nIts awkward name is a relic from the era when Abbott and his environment minister, Greg Hunt, were pledging “direct action” on climate change. Their promise was that farmers and businesses would be paid by the government to store carbon dioxide, mostly in vegetation and soil. The cash would be drawn from an emissions reduction fund, then worth $2.5bn.\n\nThe safeguard mechanism was meant to stop pollution at industrial sites from increasing and cancelling out any cuts paid for through the fund. It set a baseline – a limit – on the biggest 215 polluting facilities based on their historic emissions. The idea was the limits would safeguard the reductions bought by the government.\n\nPolluters that emitted more than their baseline would have to pay, either by buying carbon offsets or facing a fine. Hunt’s plan was that this would eventually evolve into an emissions trading scheme. Polluters that emitted below their limits would earn carbon credits and could sell them to companies that pumped out more than their limit, creating an incentive to act.\n\nIn 2015, Hunt declared the safeguard would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. But his Coalition colleagues didn’t agree, and the evolution never happened. Instead, companies were often allowed to increase emissions without penalty. RepuTex, the firm that modelled Labor’s climate policies, found industrial emissions under the safeguard jumped 7% under the Coalition. Which, not unreasonably, led industry leaders and climate activists to wonder what the point was.\n\nLabor decided there could be a point, and last year promised to transform the safeguard mechanism into something that actually cut pollution. The ALP didn’t necessarily believe the safeguard mechanism was the best possible policy. It made a political decision about how it could minimise the chance of a dishonest scare campaign over climate before the election, and give it something to work with if it won. So it adopted a suggestion by the Business Council of Australia that it should take the failing Coalition policy – an emissions trading scheme in all but name – and make it functional.\n\nAchieving that will likely mean withstanding the sort of rent-seeking claims by industry that hindered Labor’s development of carbon pricing systems more than a decade ago.\n\nThe good news is the world has moved significantly since then. A majority of industrial polluters now have commitments to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Are they going to argue they need handouts or carve outs to protect them change they have already promised? Almost certainly, but it will be a harder case to make.\n\nThe climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has set a short deadline to revamp the scheme, promising a new model will be in place by July. Submissions to the government from experts and interest groups are rolling in, and setting out a long list of difficult issues to unpick. But a few stand out.\n\nThe government says it expects emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism to be reduced by between 3.5% and 6% a year by gradually reducing baselines. A major question will be who carries this load, and who doesn’t.\n\nThe Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents funds that manage more than $3tn, is one of several groups arguing that the cost will be higher on everyone else if unsustainable industries that will inevitably shrink in a net zero economy – coal and gas mining and production – are protected from short-term action on the grounds they compete in overseas markets.\n\nThey say assistance should be mostly limited to industries that have a future - renewable energy, critical minerals and green steel, hydrogen and aluminium – and designed to drive transformational change that starts now, rather than delays it.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will Labor’s changes guarantee that industrial emissions start to come down?\n\nThe government appears to favour a design that sets a limit for polluting facilities based not on their absolute emissions, but their emissions intensity – that is, how much they emit per unit of production. At first blush, this sounds a bizarre step, given it could lead to companies that expand operations increasing their emissions even if they become more efficient. But there are arguments for it.\n\nMany companies have had baselines set well above what they actually emit. Resetting baselines based on emissions intensity could be a relatively simple way to remove this “headroom” and ensure limits are real before a path is set to reduce them to zero. An emissions intensity baselines also mean companies are not rewarded if pollution falls due to a slump in production. Instead, they would have to make genuine changes in how they operate to stay within their limits.\n\nThe downside is that it could still lead to emissions increases in the short-term. The Australian Conservation Foundation argues a way around this would be to set two baselines for each facility – one based on emissions intensity and the other absolute emissions – and require companies to meet whichever was lower or pay for their excess pollution.\n\nA third substantial issue is what to do about new coal and gas developments. There are several fossil fuel proposals in the pipeline, and Labor has rejected calls for a moratorium. An alternative put forward by some groups would be to set sector-wide emissions limits that are reduced over time so that any new project would have to fit into a declining industry total, not add to it. Otherwise, hopes of meeting emissions targets could quickly evaporate.\n\nManaging these and other thorny questions about the safeguard’s design – including the extent to which companies should be allowed to rely on carbon credits, rather than cut pollution onsite – will be politically challenging.\n\nThe ultimate test, though, will be whether the final model is robust enough to help Australia play its part in meeting the goal that Bowen stressed in a speech in the US on Friday - limiting the rise in global heating since pre-industrial times to as close to 1.5C as possible.\n\nThat will require it to be able to be ratcheted up to deliver faster cuts in emissions than currently proposed. We will get a sense pretty soon whether it is up to the task.",

Treasurer Jim Chalmers (pictured right with wife Laura) said the upcoming October 25 budget - Labor's first since May 2013 - would be delivered during a time of global economic uncertainty\n\nDr Chalmers said the Australian economy would take a hit from a worsening global economic conditions, but suggested it was possible to avoid a recession.\n\n'First of all, I think we do need to recognise that the global situation's deteriorating and the challenges in the global economy in the US, the UK, China, Europe and elsewhere, those challenges are intensifying rather than dissipating and we won't be completely immune from that,' he said.\n\n'Our expectation is that the Australian economy will continue to grow but so will the challenges to the Australian economy.'\n\nCommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said that while Australia was likely to avoid a recession, annual economic growth was likely to slow in 2023 from 3.6 per cent as recently as June to 1.4 per cent as a result of interest rate rises - leading to some flat quarterly growth rates of just 0.2 per cent.\n\n'Very modest growth in the March and June quarters next year on the back of a significant lift in interest rates,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nSaxo market strategist Jessica Amir said the soaring American greenback convinced investors coal prices would peak this year as the world's major economies went into recession as a result of rising interest rates\n\n'Certainly, base case isn't for a recession here in Australia, we think the export backdrop is still favourable.\n\n'The risk of a global recession is growing with interest rates being hiked by central banks in a co-ordinated and synchronised manner.'\n\nAustralia avoided a recession during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and 2009 but in 2022, inflation is much higher around the world.\n\nUS recession fears on Friday night caused Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit new 2022 lows.\n\nThe Australian Securities Exchange's benchmark S&P/ASX200 briefly hit a three-month low at 10.45am, when it was down 2.08 per cent, reaching 6,438.2 points.\n\nThe share market finished the session 1.6 per cent weaker at 6,469.4 points.\n\nThe US dollar has also soared to a two-decade high, as fears about a global slowdown caused a sell-off in key commodities like oil and coal, leading to Australian dollar on Monday falling below 65 US cents for the first time since March 2020.\n\nCrude oil prices look set to suffer a quarterly fall for the first time since 2020 with the American Nymex price on Friday sliding by $US4.75 or 5.7 per cent to US$78.74 a barrel.\n\nSaxo market strategist Jessica Amir said the soaring American greenback convinced investors coal prices would peak this year as the world's major economies went into recession as a result of rising interest rates.\n\n'You've got the US dollar trading at its highest level in two decades on fears that rising interest rates will put some economies into recession,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'So when investors are ultra cautious, they plough into the US dollar so that means they have to be selling something.'\n\nUS recession fears on Friday night caused Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit new 2022 lows (pictured are traders on in New York in September). The Australian Securities Exchange's benchmark S&P/ASX200 briefly hit a November 2020 low at 10.45am, when it was down 2.08 per cent\n\nEuro zone manufacturing data for September, from S&P Global, showed a contraction in business activity while China's Covid shutdowns are hampering production in the economy of Australia's biggest trading partner.\n\nThe British pound sterling on Friday also fell to a 37-year low against the US dollar, hitting $US1.084, after new Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss and her new Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled a mini budget with big tax cuts, fuelling concerns about worsening inflation as voters had more money to spend.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the pound fell to an all-time low of $US1.035.\n\nMs Amir said the UK mini-budget just reinforced the view, among investors, that the Bank of England would continue to focus on fighting inflation, which in August was at 8.6 per cent.\n\n'We had a budget handed down in the UK, you've got historic tax cuts but you also have the Bank of England sticking to their rate hike decision,' she said.\n\nHigher interest rates around the world including in the United States (pictured are homeless people in San Francisco)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is expecting local inflation in 2022 to hit levels unseen since 1990 and has, since May, raised interest rates for five straight months, taking the cash rate from a record-low of 0.1 per cent to a seven-year high of 2.35 per cent.\n\nThis has seen monthly repayments on an average, $600,000 mortgage rise by $660 to $2,966, compared with $2,306 in early May, as variable rates on a typical Commonwealth Bank home loan rose to 4.29 per cent from 2.29 per cent.\n\nDr Chalmers said rising interest rates meant workers were suffering real wage cuts, with pay rising at less than half the pace of inflation.\n\n'There's no use pretending that we don't have an inflation challenge, a real wage challenge and that rising interest rates won't sting the Australian economy and the Australian people,' he said.\n\nAustralia was kept out of recession in 2009 as a Labor government deployed a $42billion stimulus package during the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nBut Australia sunk into recession in early 2020, for the first time since 1991, as a result of national Covid shutdowns, leading to the previous Coalition government spending more than $300billion on welfare measures like JobKeeper wage subsidies.\n\nThe British pound sterling on Friday also fell to a 37-year low against the US dollar, hitting $US1.084, after new Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss (left) and her new Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng (right) unveiled a mini budget with big tax cuts, fuelling concerns about worsening inflation as voters had more money to spend. On Monday afternoon, the pound fell to an all-time low of $US1.035\n\nCovid supply constraints and a surge in petrol prices, following Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, has pushed up inflation globally, with both Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia expecting the consumer price index this year to hit a 32-year high of 7.75 per cent.\n\nThis has led to higher interest rates globally, with economists expecting the U.S. and euro zone economies to fall into a recession in 2022, defined as the economy shrinking for two consecutive quarters.\n\nTreasury budget papers in March forecast gross Australian government debt surpassing the $1trillion mark in the 2023-24 financial year for the first time ever.\n\nMr Felsman said high government debt meant a 'significant' fiscal stimulus program would be unlikely 'unless we see the economy fall back into recession'.\n\nHe also expected the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep interest rates under 3 per cent as the US Federal Reserve went above 4 per cent.",
    "Former greats have their say on Australia's best XI at the T20 World Cup": "Australian cricket legends Adam Gilchrist and Mark Waugh believe Tim David must feature for the Aussies at the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup and expect a pair of veterans the most likely to make way for the boom all-rounder.\n\nWhile David only managed scores of 18 and two from the opening two matches of the three-match T20I series against India, the 26-year-old showed his class with a blistering half-century in the final game of that series in Hyderabad on Sunday.\n\nDavid's first taste of international cricket for the reigning T20 World Cup champions comes on the back of a successful sustained period of T20 cricket in domestic leagues around the world and both Gilchrist and Waugh have been suitably impressed.\n\nThe Australian greats were recently asked to name their best Australia XI for the upcoming T20 tournament and the pair agreed that David has already done enough to feature.\n\n\"Tim David should have a place in that XI,\" Fox Cricket commentator Gilchrist said.\n\n\"His power and the way he has taken it on...and seeing what we have seen from him over the last 18 months all around the world, it is really in all different conditions and they (opposition teams) will fear him coming in.\n\n\"It is a role that Australia have never really tried to fill, having someone who knows they are only going to get 15 or 20 balls (to make an impact).\"\n\nMahela Jayawardena on Tim David | The ICC Review\n\nWaugh echoed Gilchrist's sentiments, although the former champion right-hander said much can change between now and the start of the tournament in mid-October.\n\n\"I have got Tim David in the XI at this stage,\" Waugh noted.\n\n\"That could change with form, but that looks a pretty good side to me.\"\n\nBut the Australian pair couldn't agree on which player should make way for David, with Waugh leaving experienced batter Steve Smith out of his best side and Gilchrist believing the pressure was on Marcus Stoinis to hold on to his spot.\n\nRicky Ponting on T20 World Cup face-offs | The ICC Review\n\nSmith only reached double figures once from three hits against India, while Stoinis skipped the tour and remained home in Australia to rest a side injury he picked up against New Zealand at the start of the month.\n\nThe burly all-rounder did manage 80 runs and was only dismissed once at the last T20 World Cup, importantly saving the day for the Aussies alongside fellow veteran Matthew Wade in the cut-throat semi-final against Pakistan when the duo combined for an 81-run partnership that dragged their team over the line in thrilling circumstances.\n\nMatch Highlights: Pakistan v Australia\n\nBut Gilchrist is unsure on whether the talented 33-year-old is a walk-up start for Australia since the recent emergence of David.\n\n\"Marcus Stoinis seems to be the man under pressure at the moment,\" Gilchrist said.\n\n\"But I think Tim David should have a place in that XI.\n\n\"Unfortunately that best XI is going to have 12 players in it and I don’t know who I am going to leave out.\"\n\nAdam Gilchrist's best Australia XI:\n\n1.

However, after establishing herself as one of the premier talents in the Women’s Super League since joining Leeds Rhinos, Winfield-Hill will realise her goal of playing in a World Cup after declaring her allegiance for England at the beginning of this year.\n\nThe 35-year-old half-back is one of four winners of the Woman of Steel award to make Craig Richards’s 24-player squad that will attempt to win the World Cup for the first time. Winfield-Hill is joined by the 2022 winner, Tara Jane‑Stanley of York, as well as Jodie Cunningham of St Helens and Georgia Roche of Leeds.\n\nThere are seven members of the Leeds squad who won the Women’s Super League this month, with Winfield-Hill and Roche poised to continue their partnership at half-back at international level.\n\nZoe Hornby is the sole uncapped player in the squad, while Richards has named 11 players from the Challenge Cup winners, St Helens. They include the captain, Emily Rudge, who is one of four survivors from the last England squad that played in a World Cup on home soil nine years ago.\n\nLeeds Rhinos’ Zoe Hornby is the only uncapped player in the England squad.

    "Could a politician from Australia help usher in the far right in Italy?": "There’s an election in Australia this Sunday and a small, yet passionate, group of voters across the country could determine who leads Italy. The Italian parliament has four overseas electorates, one of which is the vast Africa-Asia-Oceania-Antarctica (AAOA), home to some 250,000 voters who hold Italian passports. Australia is within its borders.\n\nItalian electoral candidates have spent the past six weeks in Australia discussing healthcare, strong borders and the importance of cultural exchanges between the two countries, in an effort to win the votes of Italian-Australians.\n\nVoting is not compulsory – at the last election only 30% of the roughly 140,000 eligible Australian residents sent in their ballot papers.\n\nBut this time round, things are different.\n\nSunday’s election is expected to usher Italy’s far-right coalition, led by the Brothers of Italy party, into government.\n\nThe AAOA has been held by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) since its creation in 2006. But this year the Brothers of Italy’s candidate, Joe Cossari, is hoping support for the rightwing party at home will spread to Australia.\n\nBrothers of Italy espouses traditional family values, has roots in neofascism and last week was forced to oust a candidate for praising Hitler.\n\nThe party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, is only 45. If it wins, Meloni would be Italy’s first female leader and its first far-right leader since the second world war.\n\n“It is certain that Giorgia will win,” Cossari told Guardian Australia. “She’ll be the first female PM in Italy since the inception of the republic, which is good. Some people say, ‘oh a woman’ but everyone needs a say, ‘we need a change’.”\n\nBrothers of Italy candidate Joe Cossari is hoping to win the vast Africa-Asia-Oceania-Antarctica electorate. Photograph: Joe Cossari\n\nOn Thursday, as the deadline for postal votes was coming to a close, 75-year-old Cossari was in his back yard in Melbourne, tending to his fig trees. He has been the mayor of Knox city council and is a well-known figure in the city’s Italian-Australian community. He has stood as a candidate for the AAOA several times for different parties.\n\nHe shrugged off the suggestion the Brothers of Italy supports fascism and said Meloni did the right thing by booting out a pro-Hitler candidate.\n\n“We get nutters all over the place, don’t we?” he said. “You have to face the reality of the situation. I wouldn’t praise Adolf.”\n\nIf elected, Cossari said his priorities would be facilitating a closer relationship between the two countries and helping Italy enact a border protection policy that mirrors Australia’s.\n\n“I say to my fellow Italians, ‘you come into Australia, at customs they want to know who you spoke to, what you did, what you had for breakfast – and after the interrogation, they say ‘have a good day’,” he said. “That’s democracy.”\n\nWhen the votes are counted on Monday evening Australia time, Cossari will likely be asleep but he has friends who will be acting as election scrutineers in Naples.\n\n“I’m reasonably confident,” he said. “I’m calm, cool, collected and watching my fig trees.”\n\nThe overseas electorates have previously played a key role in the formation of Italian governments, most notably in 2006 when they provided the centre-left coalition with a slim majority.\n\n“Should the election not produce a very clear outcome, or Meloni’s coalition collapses, the handful of MPs from overseas could become crucial, if there was a situation where just a few seats were in play,” Swinburne University politics expert Dr Simone Battiston said.\n\nBattiston said Cossari is the only far-right politician in with a chance, but that the electorate favours candidates from the centre left.\n\n“The Democratic party is more entrenched in the Italian-Australian community and the incumbents, they seem to represent the broad church,” Battiston said.\n\n‘The handful of MPs from overseas could become crucial,’ says Simone Battiston, a senior lecturer at Swinburne University. Photograph: Simone Battiston\n\nDario Nelli, the managing editor of Australian Italian-language publication Il Globo, has followed every election in the AAOA closely. He said interest has gradually dropped off but many in the community think it’s still important to have the right to vote.\n\n“The first campaign had huge interest,” Nelli said. “Now it’s become something like a routine.”\n\nNelli has watched the candidates perform over the past six weeks, even hosting the official debate. He says the big issues are universal healthcare, teaching Italian abroad and economic ties between the two countries.\n\nThe incumbent senator for the PD, 64-year-old Francesco Giacobbe, has been in parliament for two terms and is seeking his third.\n\nHe spends about 41 weeks of the year in Rome and the rest visiting his constituents across the AAOA. When he can, he flies home to Sydney to see his wife, children and two new grandchildren.\n\n“My wife should be given an award for coping with me,” Giacobbe said.\n\nFrancesco Giacobbe, seen with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, is seeking a third term in Italy’s parliament. Photograph: Francesco Giacobbe\n\nGiacobbe has spent the past six weeks flying around the country, campaigning in Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nThe former accountant said the Italian government “is strong enough to withstand” fascist forces.\n\n“I’m not worried about the fascists. I think the democracy is mature enough to withstand that threat,” he said. “But it’s the risk of Italy becoming an isolated country closed in on itself that scares me.”",
    "OECD downgrades Australia economic outlook - Treasurer Jim Chalmers says future 'darker, dangerous'": "Australia's economy may be faring better than those of Europe and the US, but the nation is not safe from gloomy global prospects.\n\nGlobal growth is expected to ease from three per cent in 2022 to 2.25 per cent in 2023, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's interim economic outlook shows.\n\nPlenty of uncertainty underpins these forecasts, with a worst-case scenario seeing severe fuel shortages hitting European economies hard and shaving another 0.5 per cent off global growth in 2023.\n\nAustralia's relatively strong GDP score was noted in the report, but softening demand for exports such as resources may see growth cool.\n\nThe OECD has downgraded economic growth forecasts for Australia and the rest of the world. Pictured is a waitress delivering food\n\n'Japan, Korea and Australia have somewhat stronger growth momentum currently than Europe and the United States, but that is projected to wane over the coming quarters, in part due to softer external demand,' the report said.\n\nThe OECD report downgraded Australia's economic position from June forecasts, projecting real GDP to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022 and 2.0 per cent in 2023.\n\nCore inflation in Australia is also expected to hit 5.4 per cent in 2022 before falling to 4.3 per cent in 2023.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers agreed Australia was not immune from the troubles facing the global economy.\n\n'The OECD report shows the global economy is treading perilous terrain – with slowing global growth, rampant inflation, falling real wages, and extreme uncertainty,' he said.\n\n'These challenges are intensifying, not dissipating, and Australia is not spared from this darker and more dangerous global outlook.'\n\nFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers (pictured) said Australia is not immune from 'darker and more dangerous' times as the OECD lowered the country's economic outlook\n\nHowever, Dr Chalmers said there was reason to be optimistic about the longer-term future of the economy.\n\nHe said his first budget due in October would focus on delivering 'responsible' cost of living relief.\n\nThe OECD report warns nations to avoid providing short-term cost of living support that would fuel inflation.\n\nThe report accepts that support for households struggling with high energy costs will probably be necessary.\n\n'However, this should be temporary, concentrated on the most vulnerable, preserve incentives to reduce energy consumption and be withdrawn as energy price pressures wane,' the report said.\n\nAustralia's relatively strong GDP score was noted in the report, but softening demand for exports such as resources may see growth cool. Pictured: A Sydney tradie\n\nFood security remains a key concern to the global economy, with extreme weather events caused by climate change likely to worsen the situation.\n\nThe grim walk through the state of the global economy reveals inflation spreading widely across many economies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'The effects of the war and the continuing impacts of COVID-19 outbreaks in some parts of the world have dented growth and put additional upward pressure on prices, above all for energy and food,' the report says.\n\nRising interest rates and easing supply bottlenecks are likely to temper inflation, but soaring energy costs and labour shortages are likely to slow its pace of decline.\n\nThe OECD report sees headline inflation pulling back from 8.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent in 2023 among the G20 group of economies which includes Australia.",
    "Mega-polluting coal plans clash with Australia’s climate goals": "The future of the country’s $63 billion coal export industry is a dilemma for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who took office in May with a promise to improve a weak record on climate action. Though his government has tightened emissions reduction targets, Albanese has also signaled support for new gas and coal developments amid a global energy crisis that’s seen buyers scramble for the country’s exports and swelled profits for fossil-fuel producers.\n\nGlobal electricity generation from coal jumped about 8.5% last year to more than 9,600 terawatt-hours, the first increase since 2018, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. Climate groups have raised concerns over the potential impact on efforts to curb emissions as nations revert to using the dirtiest fossil fuel.\n\nAlbanese’s government “is talking the talk that Australia is back on climate, but it’s got all these coal mines that are under review,” said Fahimah Badrulhisham, a spokesperson for Move Beyond Coal, the campaign group that produced the data. “We cannot allow new mines to be dug in 2022.”\n\nMinisters currently have no legal obligation to consider climate impacts when authorizing development of new mines, and campaigners in March lost an attempt to block a Whitehaven Coal Ltd. proposal over its projected emissions. Members of Australia’s Green Party and pro-climate independent lawmakers have called for existing environmental laws to be tightened.\n\nEnvironment Minister Tanya Plibersek is reviewing current laws, her office said. Coal mine applications are being assessed on a “case-by-case” basis, she said in July. Mining tycoon Clive Palmer was refused approvals in August for a the Central Queensland Coal project over the potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nMining giants including BHP Group, Glencore Plc, and Peabody Energy Corp. are among producers with projects in Australia being considered by the government. BHP and Mitsubishi Corp.’s proposed Blackwater South metallurgical coal mine in Queensland is seeking approvals to cover a 90 year lifespan. That would equate to 1.98 billion tons of emissions, according to Move Beyond Coal’s estimates.\n\nBHP declined to comment on the emissions forecast. Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry previously suggested the mine would be unlikely to operate for the duration set out in approval documents.\n\nGlencore’s Valeria thermal and metallurgical coal mine in central Queensland has a proposed lifetime of 35 years and would emit 1.39 billion tons of carbon dioxide, Move Beyond Coal said.\n\nThe release of 17 billion tons of carbon dioxide from all the proposed mines would account for 4% of the world’s remaining “carbon budget” of 420 million tons — the point at which planetary warming of 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes the most likely scenario, according to the Global Carbon Project.\n\nA total of 31 coal mine projects were at the committed stage, where a final investment decision has been taken, or undergoing feasibility studies, Australia’s resources ministry said in a report in December.\n\n(By James Fernyhough, with assistance from Andrew Janes)",

Fair play to the lads, they asked me if I wanted to take it and I said of course - it's a striker's dream, my dream.\"\n\nCeltic midfielder Aaron Mooy and Dundee United defender Aziz Behich were among a clutch of players allowed to return to their clubs after Thursday's 1-0 win over the same opponents as head coach Graham Arnold chose a completely changed starting XI while assessing his squad ahead of this year's Qatar finals.\n\nHeart of Midlothian midfielder Cammy Devlin and St Mirren pair Ryan Strain and Keanu Baccus also came off the bench, three of six players handed their international debuts.\n\nMeanwhile, after Mitchell Duke's opener shortly after the break, it was 18-year-old debutant Garang Kuol, reportedly set to sign for Newcastle United in January, who set up club strike partner Cummings for the shot that led to the penalty.\n\nCummings, whose debut came three years after Arnold first said he wanted him in his squad, hinted that he might add his Australia cap number to his many tattoos.\n\nAsked what it would mean to make the World Cup squad, the former Hibernian, Nottingham Forest, Rangers, Peterborough United, Luton Town and Shrewsbury Town striker added: \"It's everyone's dream, it's my dream.\n\n\"All I need to do now is to go back with the Mariners, work hard, do well there, score goals and you never know.\"",
    "Australian stages are packed with great shows – so why aren’t people booking tickets?": "When the Victorian government announced on Monday it was reintroducing 25% cash back on all entertainment and dining expenses over $40, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra staff sprang into action.\n\nBy close of business Monday, more than 50,000 concertgoers in the MSO database had been alerted and the company recorded a 40% spike in ticket sales – their strongest day in years.\n\nIt was a government stimulus sorely needed by the state’s major performing arts companies. As the industry attempts to recover from Covid restrictions and cancellations, the new normal is still nothing like normal – particularly when it comes to ticketing.\n\n“We’re seeing a seismic shift,” MSO’s managing director, Sophie Galaise, told Guardian Australia, who spoke to more than a dozen performing arts companies for this article.\n\n“We’re not going to, and we’re not even trying to, get back to pre-pandemic levels. We have to see the world in a new way. The pandemic has changed habits; it’s opened some doors, and it’s closed others. It’s going to be a challenge for the next few years.”\n\n‘We’re looking at a three-year recovery’\n\nAs many of Australia’s major companies announce their 2023 programs this month, the return of audiences into theatres and concert halls has been more of a steady trickle than a deluge.\n\nThe Australian Chamber Orchestra – which has a subscriber presence in seven major cities – has so far recovered just over 80% of its pre-Covid subscriber base.\n\n“And single ticket sales are down probably anywhere between 20 [and] 30%,” the ACO’s managing director, Richard Evans, says.\n\n“I think we’re probably looking at a three-year recovery, getting back 10% a year from 2022. We’re hopeful we’ll be back to pre-Covid attendance levels by 2025.”\n\nAudience behaviour has undoubtedly changed, according to new research commissioned by the Australia Council, and it is unclear whether it will ever go back to what it was. In March and August this year, Australian audience tracker company Patternmakers and US-based researcher Wolf Brown surveyed almost 2,300 Australians identifying themselves as regular live performance attendees.\n\nIn the intervening six months, little more than 7% say they had returned to theatres and concert halls. One in four are still staying home – and for those over 65, half would not return unless the venue made masks mandatory.\n\nOf those now back, almost half of the survey group says they were still not attending as frequently as their pre-pandemic level (46% in August, 52% in March) – although health concerns were not the only factor at play.\n\n‘We face yet another threat – the rising cost of living,’ says Queensland Ballet’s Li Cunxin. Photograph: David Kelly/Queensland Ballet\n\nAlmost one in four says financial – not Covid – concerns had curbed their entertainment habits. September marked the fifth month in a row the Reserve Bank raised the cash rate, taking it to a seven-year high of 2.35% and adding more than $600 a month to a $500,000 mortgage.\n\nOnly one in five respondents say their attendance would not be inhibited in any way over the next 12 months.\n\nA state-by-state look\n\nBreaking the research down into states and territories, residents in the ACT remain the most nervous about returning to live performance, with well over half still staying home. Queenslanders appeared to be the most relaxed.\n\nIt is this sentiment Queensland Ballet’s artistic director, Li Cunxin, is banking on, as the company prepares to launch an ambitious $1.5m production of Manon at the end of this month.\n\n“We sold over 18,500 tickets to Romeo and Juliet [in 2019], so I’m hopeful we can do the same for Manon,” Li says.\n\n“However, we are in a very different economic climate. The arts sector was hit hard during the pandemic, and just as the economy starts to recover, we face yet another threat – the rising cost of living.”\n\nWe were the only show in town so we were having incredible sales. Brad Martin, West Australian Symphony Orchestra\n\nAfter Western Australia cut itself off from the rest of the country for almost 700 days during the pandemic, the state appears to have quarantined its performing arts companies from much of the financial pain reported by others.\n\nThe West Australian Symphony Orchestra, the West Australian Ballet and the state’s flagship theatre company Black Swan all recorded record ticket sales while the rest of the country was in lockdown.\n\n‘There was a real groundswell of support and love’: Black Swan Theatre’s You know We Belong Together toured the UK this month. Photograph: Toni Wilkinson\n\n“We were the only show in town so we were having incredible sales through that period,” says WASO’s marketing manager, Brad Martin. “This year we’ve actually had the strongest pre-sales of any of our subscription series in the last five years.”\n\nIn 2022 Black Swan State Theatre saw a 34% increase in subscribers compared with 2019 – from 596 packages to 798.\n\nThe theatre’s marketing manager, Suzanne Beecroft, who moved to Black Swan from the West Australian Ballet in June, says that during Covid her state turned inward and threw its support behind its local performing arts companies.\n\n“There was a real groundswell of support and love,” she says. “People recognised that there was a danger of losing some of the art forms that we love, so people backed us up with their money, whether it was donations or buying subscriptions.”\n\n‘The trauma to Melbourne audiences is still quite fresh’\n\nMelbourne Theatre Company has been regularly tracking the habits of its audience since the pandemic hit. Operating in the most locked-down city in the world, the MTC saw almost 600 performances cancelled and recorded a $19m loss in 2020/2021.\n\nEven when permitted to return to full capacity earlier this year, the Omicron wave meant the MTC auditorium was only filling to 50% capacity.\n\n“The trauma to Melbourne audiences is still quite fresh,” says MTC’s executive director, Virginia Lovett, who conceded that like the ACO, the company was still about 20% down on subscription uptake compared to 2019 figures.\n\n“About 65% of our lapsed subscribers have told us they will return once they feel that it’s back to ‘normal’.”\n\nSign up to Saved for Later Free weekly newsletter Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cyrano reopened on 24 September. Photograph: Jeff Busby\n\nBack in 2019, 55% of the MTC’s single ticket sales were made a month prior to a performance. In 2022 that figure increased to 66%.\n\n“Nearly one-third of our single ticket sales are now happening within the week that the performance happens,” Lovett says.\n\nThe Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne has ditched subscriptions entirely, with the theatres’s associate director, Matthew Lutton, saying “the subscription model broke in Covid”.\n\nInstead, the theatre has launched Malthouse Mate, a “supporter” model that allows donors to pay a minimum of $50 to the theatre in order to get early access to ticket sales.\n\n‘Nerve-jangling’: the rise of last-minute ticket sales\n\nLike almost all the companies who spoke to the Guardian, Black Swan says one trend was undeniable: a rise in last-minute single ticket purchases.\n\n“And I don’t think it’s just Covid and people wanting to make sure they’re healthy and that they won’t have to cancel suddenly,” Beecroft says.\n\nGuy Simon in Griffin theatre’s production of Whitefella Yella Tree, directed by Declan Greene. Photograph: Brett Boardman\n\n“The economic environment is starting to play into this as well. People are waiting for discounts, or really weighing up how they want to spend those discretionary dollars.”\n\nThe Patternmakers/Wolf Brown research from August found that more than 25% of respondents decided to purchase tickets within seven days of a live performance. In November 2021, that figure was just 19%. More than 40% bought tickets within a month of the event between March and August this year.\n\n“Single ticket sales in 2022 are definitely purchased closer to the performance dates, with often a surge two to three weeks out prior to the performances,” the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra’s marketing manager, Renato Capoccia, says.\n\nAccording to the artistic director and chief executive of Sydney’s Griffin Theatre Company, Declan Greene, this new normal is “nerve-jangling”. In 2022, as much as 50% of Griffin’s audience bought their ticket the day of or the day before the performance.\n\n“It’s an entirely different way of running a theatre company … it feels a bit like we’re in freefall.”\n\nWhile many of Australia’s major performing arts companies were given government lifelines during Covid (the country’s most costly performing arts company, Opera Australia received an additional $21.1m in federal and state government funding in 2021, on top its annual $22m from the Australia Council), smaller companies such as Griffin are more reliant on these newly nervous ticket-buying habits.\n\nIt’s an entirely different way of running a theatre company … it feels a bit like we’re in freefall. Declan Greene, Griffin theatre\n\nWith a capacity of just over 200, Sydney’s Ensemble Theatre is in a similar boat. The company’s artistic director, playwright Mark Kilmurray, says advance planning has become a logistical challenge due to the uptick in last-minute ticket sales.\n\nThere are other new challenges, too. For the first time in the boutique theatre company’s history, the engagement of paid understudies has become essential. In a recent opening night performance, an understudy seamlessly took on the female lead after the star tested positive for Covid.\n\n“Now we’re paying for two or three artists to understudy – and then there’s the cost of a second set of costuming, and the cost of rehearsing the understudies,” Kilmurray says. “It increases costs dramatically.”\n\nMore challenges ahead\n\nRecouping those costs isn’t easy. Companies earn significantly more from full-price single ticket sales than from discounted subscription packages, but single ticket sales depend on costly advertising campaigns.\n\nAnd neither comes with much financial security: under Australian ticketing laws, the funds from all ticket sales and subscriptions must be escrowed until the performance has actually taken place – a factor that is no longer a given in these uncertain times. Just last week, a performance of the Sydney Theatre Company’s A Raisin in the Sun was cancelled due to cast illness.\n\nBert LaBonté, Adolphus Waylee and Zahra Newman in Sydney Theatre Company’s A Raisin in the Sun. Photograph: Joseph Mayers Photography\n\nThere is an additional factor expected to affect audience behaviour post Covid lockdown: the decline of the CBD.\n\nIn September, the Property Council of Australia reported that office occupancies in Australia’s two largest cities rose by just 1% in August. In Melbourne, the CBD has returned to just 39% of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the MTC, almost one-third of its audience worked in Melbourne’s CBD pre-pandemic. In March, that figure stood at just 16%.\n\n“That sort of casual ‘let’s go to a show after work’ – I think it’s going to be quite interesting to see how that plays out,” says Lovett.\n\nRichard Evans at ACO agrees. “The drift out of the CBD is definitely going to have an impact,” he says. “We’re going to lose that impulsive side of the market.”",
    "Ex-Australia star Michael Slater hospitalised after arrest for 'possible breach of bail'": "Australian cricket legend Michael Slater was taken to hospital by police for a mental health assessment after being arrested for an alleged breach of his bail conditions\n\nFormer Australia opener Michael Slater has been rushed to hospital for a mental health assessment after being arrested for allegedly breaching bail.\n\nThe 52-year-old was arrested after a woman made multiple calls to police about an alleged disturbance at a home in Sydney. Following his arrest, Slater was taken to Manly police station where an interim apprehended violence order was applied in respect of the woman he was with when he was arrested.\n\nSlater was then taken to hospital for a mental health assessment. A police spokesperson told the Australian : \"About 9.30pm on Thursday 22 September 2022, officers from Northern Beaches Police Area Command responded to triple-0 calls to a male allegedly causing a disturbance at a house in Freshwater.\"\n\nThey said officers spoke to the former cricketer and \"detected\" that he may have been in breach of bail. \"He was taken to Manly police station and later conveyed to Northern Beaches Hospital for a mental health assessment,\" the statement added.\n\nSlater is currently on strict bail after facing serious assault, stalking and intimidation charges, with his bail conditions preventing him from drinking alcohol or taking drugs not prescribed by a doctor.\n\nDomestic violence charges were dismissed in April on mental health grounds, with Slater ordered to spend a minimum of three weeks in a mental health unit.\n\nImage: Patrick Eagar/Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images) Patrick Eagar/Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nMagistrate Ross Hudson was quoted by ABC as saying: \"Since February, Mr Slater has recognised his need to stay medicated and to stay on top of his mental health. He's shown a tangible commitment to therapy and counselling.\"\n\nSlater made 74 Test and 42 ODI appearances for Australia between 1993 and 2001, scoring more than 6,000 international runs and 14 centuries.\n\nFollowing his retirement from playing in 2004, Slater moved into commentary but was axed by Channel 7 in October last year following a public spat with then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Channel 7, however, said Slater was dropped due to budget reasons.",
    "Australia rue ill-discipline as New Zealand toast success": "Crocodile Dundee was in the cinemas the last time Australia won at the All Blacks' Eden Park fortress and it is more than 20 years, and now 27 Tests, since the Wallabies won anywhere on the old foe's territory.\n\nIt was a big ask for any Australian side – not least one which had been patched together after injuries plagued Dave Rennie's squad.\n\nBut after last week's fightback, which ended in defeat for the Wallabies after a controversial finale, a historic victory wasn't out of the realms of possibility – particularly given the All Blacks' chequered year which has included a first-ever series loss to Ireland on home turf.\n\nIn the end it was an easy victory for the hosts, who were crowned Rugby Championship 2022 winners later in the day when South Africa failed to pile on a heavy enough victory over Argentina. As for the Wallabies, their continuous ill-discipline throughout cost them. They lost two players to the sin-bin in the first half and conceded a penalty try at a collapsed maul to put the hosts 17-0 going into the break.\n\n\"Playing with two yellow cards in the first half put us on the back foot,\" Australia's captain, James Slipper, said. \"That's a very disappointing outcome for us tonight.\n\n\"We wanted to come here and perform. We were really gutted with the result last week. We had confidence coming here but the All Blacks were too good for us.\"\n\nIt took 20 minutes for the deadlock to be broken, the All Blacks opting for a penalty goal through Richie Mo'unga after failing to take advantage of the extra man following Jed Holloway's sin-binning for a dangerous tackle on flanker Dalton Papali'i in the opening moments of the match.\n\nThe first of New Zealand's five tries fell to Will Jordan, who put down moments after Mo'unga's opening three points. The winger picked up the ball on the outside right, stepped on the gas and avoided a diving tackle from Jordan Petaia to get over the line.\n\nThe Wallabies looked tough and resolute before the match began, reprising their boomerang response to the All Blacks' haka, but the on-field reality failed to match this initial act of defiance.",
    "Australia ‘needs to become a republic’: Bandt calls for change in wake of Queen’s death": "The death of Queen Elizabeth has instantly reignited discussion about an Australian republic, with the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, using a condolence message to the British monarch to again push for the constitutional change.\n\nFellow Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi also called a republic to be advanced but went further, saying she “cannot mourn the leader of a racist empire”.\n\nBandt was described as “ignorant” and “graceless” by a former Coalition minister for his comments.\n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is a longtime supporter of Australia becoming a republic, but declined to engage with such questions on Friday morning as news of the monarch’s death reverberated around the world.\n\n“Today’s not a day for politics,” he told Radio National. “Today’s a day to pay tribute to the service of Queen Elizabeth as our head of state over those 70 years and to give thanks to her dedication and to her contribution to Australia.\n\n“I regard the Queen as someone who is worthy of respect from every single Australian.”\n\nThe federal Labor government had already flagged its intention to hold a referendum on a republic if elected for a second term, with the prime minister earlier creating the new position of assistant minister for the republic for Matt Thistlethwaite. Supporters of Australia becoming a republic in parliament have long acknowledged that any change was unlikely while Queen Elizabeth remained as head of state.\n\nBandt tweeted before 8.30am on Friday: “Rest In Peace Queen Elizabeth II. Our thoughts are with her family and all who loved her.\n\n“Now Australia must move forward. We need Treaty with First Nations people, and we need to become a Republic.”\n\nRest In Peace Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n\nOur thoughts are with her family and all who loved her.\n\n\n\nNow Australia must move forward.\n\n\n\nWe need Treaty with First Nations people, and we need to become a Republic. — Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) September 8, 2022\n\nShortly after, Faruqi, the Greens deputy leader, tweeted “Condolences to those who knew the Queen.\n\n“I cannot mourn the leader of a racist empire built on stolen lives, land and wealth of colonised peoples. We are reminded of the urgency of Treaty with First Nations, justice & reparations for British colonies & becoming a republic.”\n\nAlex Hawke, the former Liberal immigration minister, tweeted criticism in response to Bandt.\n\n“Truly graceless and bereft of common decency to do this today. Ignorant of the feelings today of hundreds of millions of human beings, worldwide. Just not needed,” he wrote.\n\nThe Liberal National senator Matt Canavan simply responded “no” to Bandt, while United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet replied “poor form”.\n\n“I would encourage you to take a hike out of Australia and don’t look back. I think the nation would join me in celebrating your departure,” he wrote.\n\nThe Australian Republic Movement (ARM) paid tribute to the Queen in a statement.\n\n“Many Australians have known no other head of state – the length of her reign was unrivalled. As monarch, Queen Elizabeth was a patron of more than 600 organisations and served them admirably.

It is unlikely we will ever see a monarch as respected or admired by the Australian people again,” he said.\n\nAlexander Woltz, of the Australian Monarchist League, acknowledged there would be a discussion about a republic in the wake of the Queen’s death but called for “a degree of civility and respect”.\n\n“People have different views and it’s important to consider those views with maturity and intelligence. But I don’t think that now is the right time for those views. You know, we are going to spend probably a fortnight in mourning and that will be really what matters,” he said on ABC TV.\n\nThe organisation paid tribute to her “selfless sense of service, her warm character, devotion to her family and endearing smile”.\n\nA STATEMENT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN MONARCHIST LEAGUE pic.twitter.com/GgjsDXSas5 — AML (@Austmonarchist) September 8, 2022\n\nThistlethwaite tweeted that he was “shocked and saddened” by the Queen’s death.\n\n“Her life was dedicated to service of others.

    "Awer Mabil’s long-range rocket ensures Australia sink New Zealand": "A long-range rocket from Awer Mabil ensured Australia beat New Zealand 1-0 in their World Cup farewell in Brisbane.\n\nThe match, which took place a staggering 11 years after the two teams last met, was Australia’s first game since qualifying for the World Cup and their last on home soil before the tournament in Qatar in November. Aside from Mabil’s 33rd-minute strike, however, it was a far from pretty occasion for the hosts on a wet Thursday night at Suncorp Stadium.\n\nThe 27-year-old looked dangerous in space, curling his first long-range effort just wide of the right post before successfully finding the opposite corner minutes later. It was Mabil’s eighth goal for his country but first in Australia, coming on the back of his move to the Spanish side Cádiz.\n\nAustralia’s defence were sloppy in the first half but weren’t exploited by New Zealand, who looked sharp despite their World Cup qualification near-miss in June. “[It was] disappointing after the Costa Rica result, where I thought we were outstanding, and to lose again when I thought we dominated for long periods,” the All Whites coach, Danny Hay, said.\n\nAustralia were shaky in the early stages and their centre-back Trent Sainsbury was at the centre of it. The defender’s first pass was lobbed into the danger zone and then another poor touch gave New Zealand a second golden chance.\n\nThey took neither, though, and Sainsbury was then denied a goal of his own when his teammate Jackson Irvine was deemed to have knocked down a defender in a goalmouth scramble from a corner.\n\nFor New Zealand, the Empoli talent Liberato Cacace proved a menace on the left without finding the net, while the Newcastle United striker Chris Wood was physical in a friendly that had plenty of spark 100 years after the teams’ first meeting.\n\nAn effort from the Australia substitute Mat Leckie, which was deflected on to the post after Martin Boyle’s fast break, was the standout moment in a relatively subdued second half.\n\nThe Australia manager, Graham Arnold, who enjoyed his former mentor Guus Hiddink’s cameo as his assistant coach, made five changes to the side that started against Peru in their World Cup qualifier. But there were no major experiments, with many of the fresh faces in the 31-strong squad on the bench before this Sunday’s rematch in Auckland.\n\nAdam Taggart and Ajdin Hrustic replaced Jamie Maclaren and Riley McGree early in the second half, while Leckie and Nathaniel Atkinson came on for Mabil and Fran Karacic with 20 minutes to play. Joel King and Connor Metcalfe then played the final minutes instead of Jackson Irvine and Aziz Behich.\n\nArnold said all but one of the starting side wouldn’t travel to New Zealand, as he had wanted to reward those who got the side to Qatar with a home game – and to assess their fitness by playing man-on-man – despite some arriving on the eve of the fixture.\n\n“If there’s one thing disappointing I think we lost the physical battle,” Arnold said. “I wanted to reward the boys who gave a lot of sacrifices to get us through the campaign … now [in Auckland] it’s for the kids.”",
    "The Taste With Vir: Visiting Australia? Don't go only for the food": "This was my third trip to Sydney (and my fourth to Australia). On all of the previous occasions I had been invited by the Australian government to show off Australia’s food scene. This was right after the TV success of the Australian Masterchef and Tourism Australia wanted to establish that Australia was a great food destination — which indeed it was.\n\nOne trip was linked to a pop-up in Sydney by Copenhagen’s Noma in which the chef, Rene Redzepi, used local ingredients to create new dishes that accorded with the Noma philosophy. Another was for the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival.\n\nSince then, a lot has changed. Even before the pandemic, some of Australia's most celebrated chefs were accused of underpaying/mistreating/cheating/exploiting their staff and huge scandals followed. George Calombaris, a celebrity in India because of his role as a judge on Masterchef Australian got into trouble and was booted off Masterchef. The two other judges followed him out and the show now has a new line-up.\n\nNeil Perry, one of Australia’s best known chefs also got into trouble and gave up control of some of his restaurants. So did many of the top Australian restaurant groups.\n\nEven as the sleazy underbelly of the Australian restaurant industry was being exposed, the pandemic hit and Australia shut down. So extreme was the lockdown that the country closed its borders, preventing people from going out or coming in. Of course, like all such restrictions, it was of very little use. Covid arrived in Australia anyway.\n\nAnd now, the country has swung to the other extreme. There are no Covid restrictions visible to visitors. Nobody asks for vaccination certificates, nobody wears masks, and social distancing is a joke.\n\nAlso Read | The Taste With Vir: Kung Pao vs Gong Bao Chicken, reality of food globalisation\n\nBut the pandemic seems to have left its mark. In common with many other countries, Australia has difficulty coping with the influx of visitors. Visas can take weeks to come through. The queue at immigration was long; it took me 90 minutes to negotiate Sydney airport when I landed. And though most Australians remain warm and friendly, the airport is run a little like a penal colony. (No. I am not going to make the obvious joke.) I had got into what seemed to be the shortest of the queues when an aggressive woman who was, I guess, the airport version of a traffic warden instructed me to move to another, longer queue. “If you don’t move to that queue,” she barked, “we won’t let you in”.\n\nEven by the notorious standards of US immigration, this was remarkably offensive and unnecessary. That said, the immigration officials themselves were fine. And on the way back when the immigration checks were automated, the process was painless. Nevertheless, if you are planning to go to Australia, it might be worth considering delaying your trip till things settle down a bit. This is not the best time.\n\nThat option was not available to me because I had to be in Sydney for the World Class cocktail championships. This is an annual drinks competition organised by Diageo and I have been one of the judges of the Indian leg for years. Besides, who would turn down an invitation to a four-day-long cocktail party?\n\nThe last World Class competition was held in the grim environs of Glasgow (the next one is in Sao Paolo which sounds more exciting) so it came as a surprise to me to discover that Diageo had taken over the Four Seasons, Sydney for this year’s World Class. It’s a beast of a hotel (around 500 rooms of which World Class had booked over 400), which is huge for a Four Seasons.\n\nBut perhaps because it is run by two Indians (my old friend Uday Rao is the general manager and Kartik Kapoor is the hotel manager) it operates with the efficiency of the best Four Seasons properties, despite its size and the laidback attitude to service of most Australians. Every single request is met with split-second efficiency, the concierge team is fabulous and they manage to personalise the service for 500 room guests. God alone knows how they do it. But then, I guess, that’s why it is a Four Seasons.\n\nThe Four Seasons also has the best views in Sydney. My room overlooked the harbour and each time I looked out of my window I saw the stunning Sydney Opera House and the iconic Harbour Bridge. Nothing, seemed to be more than a 10-minute walk away so the location was great too. For instance, when I took an Uber to the lovely Botanical Garden, I was embarrassed to discover how near to the hotel I was and just walked back along the seafront.\n\nThough my weather app had assured me it would rain every day, I woke up to bright sunshine on my first Saturday in Sydney. Robin, the Four Seasons concierge, found me a wonderful bay-front table at a good French restaurant (a seven-minute walk from the hotel) called Whalebridge where my wife and I ate Sydney Rock Oysters washed down with a Chardonnay from Australia's Mornington Peninsula.\n\nThe previous night Uday Rao had taken us for dinner to the buzzy and trendy Nomad, where much of the food had Middle Eastern influences. We ate empanadas stuffed with wild mushrooms and bone marrow, a flatbread with Middle Eastern flavours, burata with fennel jam, a dry aged pork cutlet and an unusual lamb’s neck pie.\n\nOn Saturday night, Robin suggested Rockpool Bar and Grill. I had been to the original Rockpool (which I don’t think exists any longer) when it was Neil Perry’s flagship restaurant. Perry started the Bar and Grill as a steakhouse but he is not associated with it any longer. It’s a large, dark, special occasion restaurant. We ate a wood-fired chorizo with vegetables (including bhindi) home-made sausages and a rump steak from David Blockmore’s farm. Given Blackmore’s reputation, the steak should have been better.\n\nMr Wong is the Chinese restaurant everyone recommended. Owned by the massive Merivale group, this may be Sydney’s most popular Chinese place. Though it has 240 seats, it was jam-packed when I went and everyone seemed to be having a good time.\n\nI wouldn’t say I had a bad time but I won’t be going back. The dim sum had no delicacy. They were of takeaway restaurant quality, the kung pao chicken was neither the Sichuan original nor the global, Americanised version, the Angus beef in pepper suffered from the overcooking of the expensive beef (it's hard to get wok timings right when you are feeding 240 guests at once), and my wife thought that the ma pao tofu was ‘odd’. Which it was: It was a layer of a custard-like tofu on which a sauce had been poured. Odd but interesting. The French beans with minced pork, a Sichuan standard, must have been a Wong variation because it had none of the powerful flavours of Sichuan food.\n\nBut we kept going. We had lunch the next day at China Doll in Woolloomooloo. Some of the food was very good: oysters with a Thai dressing and steamed scallops Chinese style were delicious. There was a fun (but very large) version of Sesame Shrimp Toast and unusual chicken samosas, described as fried dumplings on the menu.\n\nMy quarrel was with the Australian contempt for delicacy. Though the dim sum were a lot better than the ones at Mr Wong, they were so huge that you couldn’t really pop a whole dim sum in your mouth. So, you had to cut them in half which destroys the point of dim sum.\n\nWe did one more (very good) big dinner at the Middle Eastern Nour, one of Uday’s favourites, before retreating to watching TV and eating room service burgers. But I was determined to go back to some of the places I had liked on my previous trips.\n\nAria is owned by Matt Moran, one of Australia's best known chefs. I remember having a quite stunning Peking Duck soup there six years ago. This time around, it was only a set menu at lunch and the soup was not on it. The food was fine: European techniques with Australian ingredients but not one dish was startlingly good or memorable.\n\nI went to Firedoor by accident in 2016 after the Manager of Quay, one of Australia’s best restaurants, recommended it. We sat at the counter and watched Lennox Hastie, the chef, cook on the open fire. Lennox told us how he looked carefully for the sources of all the ingredients and cooked us what must have been one of the best steaks either my wife or I had ever had.\n\nSince then, Lennox has become famous: Hee has his own Chef’s Table episode, and Firedoor is a global destination. Which is great, but I was disappointed to find that it had dispensed with the a la carte menu and only served a set menu, on which steak did not feature. You could get one but it came as an extra.\n\nI guess that’s fine. All restaurants evolve and it was good to see a young Indian chef at the pass (Ahana Dutt from Calcutta) and the fire burned just as brightly as it had when we first went.\n\nThere was a fairly large Indian contingent at World Class: Diageo managers, judges, chefs, restaurateurs, media etc. At the end of our stay we compared notes.\n\nCould you eat well in Sydney?\n\nYes, we all agreed. You could.\n\nWas it one of the world’s great restaurant cities?\n\nNo, we were unanimous on that one.\n\nIt could be that we went to all the wrong places and that we were not there for long enough to judge. But between us, we had done all of the city’s best-known restaurants. Speaking for myself, this was very different from my two other trips where I had been blown away by the food in Sydney.\n\nAnd then, a surprise. On our last night in Australia, Uday suggested we eat at Mode. This is a very well regarded modern Australian restaurant but because it is run by the Four Season, I had been slightly dismissive of it and had not bothered to eat there.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThe food was stunning: The best meal I ate on the whole trip. We started with plates of delicious oysters from all over Australia. Then we had a roughly chopped tartare of Backmore Wagyu (it lived up to its reputation this time), there were potatoes with caviar; a top-notch asparagus risotto made with Acquerello rice and the single best steak I ate on the whole trip. I asked to see the person who had cooked it and he turned out to be a young Indian chef who had once worked with the Oberoi group.\n\nSo, this great food had been there in my hotel, all this time! And I had just been too stupid to notice.\n\nWell, live and learn.\n\nDo visit Sydney. Australia is a lovely country and Australians are very nice people. But don’t rush. Australia is not ready to receive visitors. And don’t go only for the food! Find other things to do.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",
    "Electric Utes for Australia & New Zealand": "While EV enthusiasts in Australia and New Zealand might be holding out for a Rivian or a Ford F-150 Lightning, they may have to make do with the Chinese LDV T60 EV (eT60) instead.

It will tow your boat and it won’t ruin your weekend.\n\nIt is an electrified version of the LDV T60 Ute that we are already seeing on Australian and New Zealand roads.\n\n“While pricing is yet to be revealed, LDV has opened up orders online, and will take a $1,000 deposit to secure an electric Ute.

SAIC also owns the MG brand. LDV has been a success story in Australia, going from 214 sales in 2014 to over 15,000 last year. It is well placed to bring electric utes to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe eT60 boasts a range of 325 km from a 88.5 kWh battery. A home charging cable is supplied. Current models will be available in 2WD, with a single electric motor mounted on the rear axle producing 130 kW and 310 Nm of torque. Payload capacity is 980 kg, and it can tow up to 1 tonne. However this will reduce the range by ~50%.\n\nIn New Zealand, the LDV eT60 is listed at NZD$79,990 drive-away, which equates to about $72,000 in Australian currency based on today’s exchange rates — or about 45 per cent more than a top-of-the-range T60 twin-turbo diesel. It is the same price as a Toyota Land Cruiser.\n\n“We are endeavoring to have the LDV eT60 in Australia late this year or early next year, once right-hand-drive production commences. While Australian timing and pricing are yet to be confirmed, we are very excited about the future rollout of electric LDV vehicles,” says Dinesh Chinappa, General Manager LDV Australia.\n\nThe LDV eT60 has half the range and towing capacity of its diesel variant. It only comes in 2WD and it costs 45% more. Why would you buy one? Perhaps because diesel is over $2 a litre in Australia and almost $3 a litre in NZ. It won’t take too many kilometers to make up the difference.\n\nShhh, don’t tell Sussan Ley that there are electric utes for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppreciate CleanTechnica’s originality and cleantech news coverage?

    "Australia's system produces good captains, but you can't say the same about England": "Pat Cummins is an example of the former. For England, Stokes apart, the lack of candidates makes it a lottery\n\nDavid Warner has recently revived the debate over why he was given the harshest punishment for the ball-tampering at Newlands in 2018, while others, including the captain at the time, got away lighter • ICC via Getty\n\nThe subject of captaincy has provoked some vociferous discussion lately, with the daring deeds of England captain Ben Stokes , and manoeuvring in Australia following the announcement that Aaron Finch had retired from ODIs\n\nFinch's retirement was lamented in many circles. This is understandable because he is a good white-ball captain. However, his replacement ought also to be an experienced player with strong leadership qualities. The Australian system for producing leaders, while diluted, is still the best of an increasingly cluttered set.\n\nFinch's retirement needs careful handling, otherwise it could be construed that no other Australian captain would have performed as well. That is an incorrect assumption; there were a number of viable options.\n\nThey both committed a serious crime at Newlands, but Smith's as a captain in saying \"I don't want to know\" was a greater infraction than Warner's. If Warner had been alone in hatching the plot - which is not proven - then it was Smith's job as captain to know about it and put an end to it. Either way they should have received an identical suspension and the fact that they didn't raises serious questions about whether there was prejudice towards Warner. And surely, no one believes that only three players - the banned trio of Smith, Warner and Cameron Bancroft - were the only ones involved in the plot?\n\nWhile Warner has created an intriguing situation with his assertive request, he shouldn't be appointed captain of an Australia side. The captaincy should always be awarded to a player who still has some prime years remaining. A captain must have in his armoury the ability to regularly lead by example on the field. Warner, with his aggressive approach, would have been a good on-field leader but sadly his best now only appears occasionally and it's time to appoint a younger captain.\n\nSelecting the ageing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in the same team anywhere but in England is a mistake. In England it can suit the pitch and surrounding conditions, but it doesn't work on Australia's bouncy pitches, where you need variety and genuine pace\n\nIn the case of Stokes, the job was his if he desired a leadership role. While Joe Root is a top-class batter, he was no captain, and in hindsight, should not have been appointed. If Root was the best choice at the time of his elevation - there was a list of potential captains - then the English system is not producing enough true international leaders.\n\nNow England have the right captain in place, it becomes a matter of choosing the best combination to win in the prevailing conditions. It's not surprising that their results have greatly improved following their disastrous tour of Australia. Their recent games have been in the more comfortable environment of home, and they replaced Root's dubious leadership with the enterprising captaincy of charismatic allrounder Stokes.\n\nEngland were certainly unlucky in Australia because they were deprived of some first-choice fast bowlers through injury. However, it's patently clear that selecting the ageing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in the same team anywhere but in England is a mistake. It's acceptable, but not ideal, to select a right-arm seam attack in England because it can suit the pitch and surrounding conditions. However, that doesn't work on Australia's bouncy pitches, where you need variety and the genuine pace of a Jofra Archer and a Mark Wood to have a chance of victory.\n\nSpin bowling is another major headache for England. Jack Leach or Moeen Ali aren't the right bowlers to succeed against teams like Australia. England tend to choose a holding spinner, whereas what they really need is a potential wicket-taking one. Ideally they need a spin bowler like Graeme Swann, who could handle either role because he was a top-class operator.",
    "India beat Australia by six wickets in rain-hit contest to level T20 series": "Rohit Sharma starred as India levelled the three-match T20 international series against Australia with a six-wicket win in a match reduced to eight overs a side.\n\nIndia won the toss and put Australia into bat in Nagpur after a wet outfield delayed the start by two-and-a-half hours. Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, with 43 not out off 20 balls, and the captain Aaron Finch (31 off 15) scored freely as Australia made 5-90.\n\nThe leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who claimed figures of 3-16 from two overs, bowled KL Rahul to end a 39-run opening stand with Rohit. Zampa then bowled Virat Kohli and trapped Suryakumar Yadav lbw in consecutive balls to give Australia some hope.\n\nRohit took consecutive boundaries off Sean Abbott in the next over, on his way to 46 not out off 20 balls. Pat Cummins had Hardik Pandya caught but India only needed nine to win off the last over, after their captain produced a classy late cut boundary off Cummins with the last ball of the seventh over.\n\nDinesh Karthik sent the crowd into a frenzy with a slog sweep off the first delivery bowled by Daniel Sams, and sealed the win with four balls to spare after striking another boundary. India’s victory sets up a series decider in Hyderabad on Sunday.\n\nMatthew Wade continued his fine form with the bat, hitting 43 off 20 balls. Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/AP\n\nFinch notched 24 of his team’s first 31 runs, including an audacious scoop over the wicketkeeper’s head in the first over and a straight six off Yuzvendra Chahal in the third. Cameron Green was run out for five and Glenn Maxwell was bowled off his first delivery by Axar Patel.\n\nThe spinner also bowled Tim David before Finch had his leg peg uprooted by the recalled Jasprit Bumrah. Wade followed up his match-winning unbeaten 45 in the series opener with another boundary-laden innings, highlighted by three sixes off Harshal Patel in the final over.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Australia is pushing to host a Cop meeting – if successful it would be forced to ramp up climate action | Adam Morton": "If the Albanese government has its way, in two years’ time up to 20,000 people – political leaders, diplomats, lobbyists, activists and professional greenwashers – will spend a fortnight in Sydney (or maybe Brisbane or Melbourne) in what will inevitably be described as an attempt to save the planet.\n\nLabor promised before the election that if it won power it would bid to host a Cop (a conference of the parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change), hopefully in partnership with Pacific island neighbours.\n\nClimate Cops have been a year-end fixture on the global calendar since 1995. Though often derided, sometimes with justification, it is the process that led to the 2015 Paris agreement, which remains the most significant commitment to tackle the climate crisis and prompted an escalation in both commitments and action (although nothing like enough, yet).\n\nThe switch from this obstructionism to vying to host a Cop in Australia for the first time is a full 180-degree pivot\n\nAs laid out in detail in the Guardian podcast series Australia v The Climate, this country has an inglorious history as a global citizen on climate change. With a few notable exceptions, it has adopted positions that undermined and disrupted efforts to accelerate action, prioritising instead the short-term interests of its fossil fuel industries.\n\nIt reached its nadir under the Morrison government, which pulled out of the Green Climate Fund, obstructed an agreement at the 2019 conference in Madrid because it demanded the right to use “carryover credits” from the Kyoto protocol, and refused international exhortations to join other countries in boosting its 2030 emissions target before last year’s summit in Scotland. It then signed up to a Glasgow pact that promised countries would consider lifting emissions targets only to immediately announce it would do no such thing.\n\nThe switch from this obstructionism to vying to host a Cop in Australia for the first time is a full 180-degree pivot. There is no guarantee that Labor will succeed, but its campaign over the next few months is worth watching. If successful, it could become one of the most significant things to happen to advance climate action in the country.\n\nThe push to host the meeting is under way. Over the next week, the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will head to the US for the annual climate week and the UN general assembly in New York. Bowen will also attend a ministerial meeting at a global clean energy action forum in Philadelphia. Hosting a summit will not be the primary focus, but discussions have begun over who will host Cop29 in 2024, which Bowen nominated as the government’s goal.\n\nThere are several hurdles to clear for Australia to even be in that race. Cop hosting duties are decided on a rotational basis between five groupings. Australia is part of a group called Western European and Other States Group (Weog). It will need to first win support within this collection. It is in competition with Germany, represented by a climate minister from the German Greens, and Switzerland.\n\nIf it is successful within its own group, the Albanese government will then face another challenge. The Weog is not due to host a Cop until 2026. Eastern Europe has the chair in 2024 and would need to agree to give it up.\n\nThis is not impossible. Poland has hosted the past three eastern Europe Cops – in 2008, 2013 and 2018 – and there is a view it may not be a great idea to go back again, especially while Russia is attacking Ukraine next door. There is a scenario under which a deal could be struck that involved Australia and Germany taking on the 2024 and 2026 Cops – not necessarily in that order – but first eastern Europe would have to yield its turn.\n\nA decision on 2024 should become clearer by the time climate change ministers head to Sharm El Sheikh on the Sinai peninsula in Egypt for Cop27 in November.\n\nThe Egyptian Cop will not have the hubbub of Glasgow. More than 100 national leaders turned up last year, having promised to boost commitments on the five-year anniversary of the Paris agreement (the meeting was delayed from 2020 due to Covid-19). As usual, results at the summit itself were mixed, but the lead-up was a qualified success. Several major emitters – including the US, China, the EU, Japan and India – pledged to do more.\n\nBy comparison, this year will be what Richie Merzian, a former climate diplomat now with the Australia Institute, calls an “implementation Cop”. The decisions will be more technical than political. He expects maybe 12 national leaders from the host region to turn up. But countries will mostly be represented at the ministerial level. While some news stories last week compared Anthony Albanese’s almost-certain nonattendance in Sharm El Sheikh with pressure on Scott Morrison to attend Cop26 last year, in reality, the two events are quite different.\n\nThe Albanese government is likely to be warmly received at Cop27 for simply not being the Morrison government. It has increased the national 2030 emissions reduction target, fulfilling a pledge made in the Glasgow pact. Its promise still trails most other developed countries, but improvement brings kudos, even if from a subterranean starting point. It may be one of the few bright spots in Sharm El Sheikh, given the impact of Russia’s military aggression, a cost-of-living crisis and China recently breaking off a climate dialogue with the US.\n\nBut if Australia wins the right to host a Cop with Pacific partners the focus will shift. There is likely to be increased scrutiny from overseas and at home on whether it is living up to its rhetoric – and on the community and business opportunities of doing more faster.\n\nStronger climate ambition hasn’t always been a prerequisite for hosting a Cop – Poland remains pro-coal and has hosted it three times – but the pressure on Australia will be greater. It will be representing a group of wealthy countries significantly responsible for the problem while asking for support from leaders across a region where the impacts are most severe.\n\nLiving up to this would mean rejoining the Green Climate Fund, the United Nation’s US$10 billion financing arm to help developing countries. It will also be expected to show it takes seriously the push by the most vulnerable nations for the rich to agree to a mechanism to pay for the loss and damage they suffer.\n\nThe biggest focus is likely to be on its ambition to cut emissions. It will need to set an increased 2035 emissions reduction target ahead of the 2025 deadline for that goal.\n\nAnd it will face growing calls from the Pacific and elsewhere for it to abandon its illogical position that it can take climate change seriously while allowing substantial new coal and gas developments. Two former presidents from the region, Kiribati’s Anote Tong and Palau’s Tommy Remengesau Jr, visited Canberra last week in part to make this case.\n\nAustralia would be focusing on all this just before or shortly after the next federal election. It means the country’s always-promised big climate election may still be to come.",

In fact, there are nations that are slowly making the necessary steps to properly adopt crypto into their financial system.\n\nAustralia, for example, is already turning heads in crypto space after it recently catapulted itself to be among the top nations as far as crypto adoption is concerned.\n\nAustralia Moving Up In the Rankings\n\nA September 2022 report from Finder puts Australia in 4th place among 26 nations that were surveyed about crypto adoption.\n\nThe country’s cryptocurrency ownership rate stood at 23%, just few points below 1st-placer India which boasted a rate of 29%.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Cardano were the popular cryptocurrencies held by people Down Under.\n\nThe report shows 14% of the 272, 257 surveyed people in the country owned Bitcoin.

    "Photos: Protests mark Australia’s ‘day of mourning’ for queen": "Hundreds of activists have rallied in Australia to denounce the destructive effect of British colonisation on Indigenous peoples, as the country held a public holiday to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“Abolish the Monarchy” demonstrators gathered in cities, including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, on Thursday, protesting against the persecution of Indigenous people since the British landed in Australia more than two centuries ago.\n\nIn Sydney, dozens of people came together near a statue of Queen Victoria in the city centre before marching through the streets.\n\n“I think the monarchy needs to be aware that there’s unfinished business happening here in Australia,” said Gwenda Stanley, a 49-year-old activist of the Indigenous Gomeroi people.\n\n“The monarch is nothing to mourn about, it is something if anything for our people to rejoice,” she said, calling for the return of Indigenous lands and restitution for “war crimes”.\n\n“The monarchy needs to be abolished, it should have been many years ago,” said 24-year-old Indigenous activist Paul Silva.\n\n“First Nations people within Australia are still fighting for their traditional lands,” he added.\n\n“We demand that they return those lands to the traditional owners.”\n\nAt a national memorial service for the queen in Canberra, Australia’s Governor-General David Hurley, who represents the monarchy, said he recognised the concerns of the island continent’s first inhabitants.\n\n“Considering the unifying role her majesty played, I acknowledge that her passing has prompted different reactions for some in our community,” Hurley said.\n\n“I’m conscious and respect that the response of many First Nations Australians is shaped by our colonial history and broader reconciliation journey. That is a journey we as a nation must complete.”\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised a referendum in his first three-year term to give Indigenous peoples the right to be consulted by lawmakers on matters that affect them, a so-called Voice to Parliament.\n\nThough an avowed republican, Albanese has made the Voice to Parliament his priority, rejecting questions about a push for an Australian republic as inappropriate during a period of mourning.\n\nThe arrival of British settlers in 1788 signalled the start of two centuries of discrimination and oppression of Indigenous Australians who have inhabited the land for an estimated 65,000 years.\n\nThe persecution of Indigenous peoples has been braided into Australia’s history, beginning with the decimation of the population after colonisation and continuing through policies such as the forced removal of children.\n\nThe inequalities facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia remain stark, with life expectancies years shorter than that of other Australians and a higher rate of deaths in custody.",

Meanwhile, Debney will step in as interim CEO and managing director, another role held by Hallahan, as a search begins for a replacement.\n\nChairman Neil Chatfield described the last two years as “challenging” for Costa amid the pandemic and “extreme” weather conditions.

Under Sean’s leadership, Costa has performed extremely well during a challenging period with global Covid-19 disruptions and extreme weather conditions being successfully navigated and is in a strong financial position.”\n\nThe business farms more than 7,200 hectares and 40 hectares of glasshouses in Australia.

NPAT-S was up 16.2% at AUD64m, and EBITDA was AUD218.2m, a 10.6% increase on the previous 12 months.\n\nHallahan said: “I am proud to leave Costa in a strong position financially and operationally. Reaching my decision has been a process and there are several things that have gone into my decision. It has been an intense couple of years in agriculture made even more challenging with the overlay of the Covid-19 pandemic.”",

And while policy may be one of the most critical elements to ensuring the success of the transition to EVs, innovation and technology are equally important.\n\nIf we take a step back and look for cues in other markets, there are four global technology trends that will play a role in Australia’s EV future.\n\nSmart charging\n\nSmart charging is an intelligent form of EV charging which optimises energy consumption. By enabling communication between a vehicle and the grid, charging can be automated to capitalise on cheaper electricity tariffs. It can also be used to restrict charging to minimise stress on the grid.\n\nIn Europe, high energy prices have seen smart charging technology grow rapidly. Ohme is a UK company, which has taken smart charging one step further, offering the option to charge when renewable energy generation on the grid is at its highest – helping to lower CO2 impact.\n\nIn Australia, companies including AGL and Origin are progressing at pace. In March AGL installed 200 EV smart chargers in homes as part of a trial. And more recently, Origin agreed to supply 100 per cent renewable power for an ARENA-funded project triallling on-street chargers for homes without parking facilities.\n\nAs more EVs connect to the grid, the domestic need for this technology is expected to grow. And over time it will become the standard charging technology for homes and businesses.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nBeyond self-driving vehicles, EV companies and manufacturers are still looking for ways to use AI effectively, but early research points to applications which may prove useful here.\n\nResearch by US company Volta is using machine learning to identify the optimal locations to place charging stations. The technology analyses data including EV adoption rates in areas, demand and expected utilisation. It also analyses demographics to predict infrastructure needs.\n\nResearchers from Idaho National Laboratory are using machine learning to reduce electric vehicle charging times. The scientists have discovered how to create new charging protocols which allow lithium-ion batteries to be charged to 90 per cent within ten minutes. These intelligent technologies will become increasingly important as the Australian Government rolls out its first National Electric Vehicle Strategy.\n\nHome and business integration\n\nAs more EVs come online in Australia, both homes and businesses – especially those that provide public charging stations – will see an increase in demand for electricity. This will require the integration of renewable energy to minimise energy costs and CO2 emissions, as well as increase energy supply.\n\nIntegrating solar panels into charge point power supply is one option. Another approach is to integrate battery storage.\n\nWe are likely to see both rolled out in Australia. In the US, EVgo is an early adopter of using batteries and smart energy management to provide a stable EV charging service. Power is fed into the batteries from the grid off peak, or from onsite renewables, and then released to charge EVs during peak times.\n\nCompanies in Australia are making moves in this space. For example. Chargefox’s ultra-rapid sites are backed by 100 per cent green power, which is also catering to an increasing demand from EV owners to reduce their emissions footprint. In many instances, they also add solar and batteries on site to enable charging via solar energy.\n\nIntegration makes clear business sense for Australian homes and companies and expectations among consumers to charge their vehicles using clean energy are expected to rise.\n\nBattery and vehicle design\n\nLithium-ion batteries are not ultra-efficient and research is underway to find better ways to power EVs. Cell-to-pack batteries are an innovation we can expect to hear more about.\n\nCell-to-pack refers to the direct integration of cells into a battery pack. Instead of flat packs of battery modules laying across the base of a car’s chassis, they can instead be integrated into it.\n\nThis design decreases the weight of the vehicle and can increase cabin space. The upside is quicker and less frequent charging and an increased driving range.\n\nChinese battery company CATL claims its latest iteration of this tech can deliver 13 per cent more power than Tesla’s latest cells. Leapmotor has developed a cell-to-chassis (CTC) battery technology. The CTC tech uses the car’s underbody as a battery box and then integrates the cells into the vehicle’s frame.\n\nSolid state batteries are another innovation close to being market ready. With the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of EV battiers up to 39 per cent, they are expected to be in production from 2025 with OEM testing imminent.\n\nAn eye in the future\n\nAustralia is only on the cusp of starting its EV journey. Policy and EV supply are two barriers which need to be addressed first, but by keeping an eye on innovation around the globe, we can work towards a smart transition.\n\nPaul Sinclair is Telematics Solutions Advisor at RACV’s mobility technology company, Intelematics.",
    "Reserve Bank of Australia reports loss of $37bn and plans to cut dividends to Treasury": "The Reserve Bank’s role in shoring up Australia’s economy during the Covid pandemic has seen it post an accounting loss for the 2021-22 year of almost $37bn, leaving it with negative equity, the bank’s deputy governor, Michele Bullock, has revealed.\n\nAt a speech in Sydney on Wednesday, Bullock said accounting methods used by the central bank had to adjust for the reduced value of billions of dollars of government debt the RBA had bought to support economic activity during the lockdowns.\n\nFor the 2021-22 year, that left valuation losses of $44.9bn which, after deducting for $8.2bn in underlying earnings, left a net loss of $36.7bn, Bullock said. The bank’s Reserve Fund of accumulated profits could only absorb part of those losses, leaving the RBA with negative equity of $12.4bn, she said.\n\nWhile private companies in such a predicament “would not be a concern”, Bullock said the government provided a guarantee and the bank itself could also print money to meet its obligations, and “so it is not insolvent”.\n\n“The negative equity position will, therefore, not affect the ability of the Reserve Bank to do its job,” she said.\n\nEven so, it remained important that the RBA returned to a positive equity position “over time”, and there would likely be an impact on the federal budget in the form of a lack of dividends as the bank rebuilt its equity.\n\n“While it has not sought a capital injection, the board has indicated to the government that it expects that future profits will be retained by the bank until the bank’s capital is restored,” Bullock said.\n\n“The treasurer has endorsed this general approach, noting that under the Reserve Bank Act, the issue of distributions to the government is considered each year,” she said.\n\nIn a response to media questions about whether Treasurer Jim Chalmers was concerned about RBA losses reaching as much as $58bn, he said the bank’s bond buying had been a “really important part of Australia’s response to the pandemic”.\n\n“The advice is that we don’t require an additional capital injection, the bank will repair its capital position over time, and that’s appropriate,” Chalmers said, adding it was also no surprise that there would not be an RBA dividend this year.\n\nThe fiscal impacts of government efforts to keep the economy going during the Covid disruptions have tended to get more attention than the monetary one, including the $134.2bn underlying cash deficit in the 2020-21 year.\n\nHowever, the RBA’s role was also significant, and the impacts of its efforts and residual legacies for its balance sheet and, ultimately the federal government’s, will take some time to determine.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the RBA published the results of an internal review of the so-called quantitative easing measures it took during the depths of the pandemic-induced economic crisis to detail its effectiveness and what lessons it learnt.\n\n\n\nThe bank ended up buying up $281bn of federal, state and territory debt between November 2020 and February 2022. Previously the RBA held little such debt compared with some other rich nations, but the gap narrowed during the pandemic.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here's how the buying compared with other economies. (Source: RBA) pic.twitter.com/3mLivyHOnq — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) September 20, 2022\n\nThe aim of the bond buying was to “lower the structure of interest rates in Australia”, effectively reducing the cost of borrowing.\n\nIn doing so, it provided “extra insurance against the ongoing risk of very bad economic outcomes”, the bank said.\n\nThe RBA review estimated that buying up all those bonds reduced the yields (the interest rate) on government bonds “by around 30 basis points” to record lows.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the process, the RBA’s balance sheet was transformed as the bonds blew out the liabilities.\n\nThe RBA's balance sheet has been transformed by all that bond buying. If marked to market, the bank would have a big negative value given how bonds have traded since the Covid pandemic has eased and inflation has taken off. pic.twitter.com/eGXERQKEUO — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) September 20, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review assesses the program to have been a success, but the RBA board stressed that “it is appropriate to consider use of unconventional monetary policy tools only in extreme circumstances, when the usual monetary policy tool – the cash rate target – has been employed to the full extent possible”.\n\nIn other words, the RBA won’t engage in a similar bond-buying effort unless other options to keep the economy afloat – namely cutting interest rates – have been exhausted.",

    "Lauren Jackson stars as Australia beat Mali to get World Cup back on track": "Australia have shaken off their shooting woes to post a dominant 118-58 win over Mali that has put their FIBA Women’s World Cup campaign back on track.\n\nThe Opals are now 1-1 and likely need to win at least two of their last three games to guarantee a quarter-finals berth.\n\nThe size of Friday’s win at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney could also prove vital, given for-and-against may be the difference between making it through the competitive Group B and leaving the tournament early.\n\nAgainst Mali, the Opals came within one point of their highest-ever score at a World Cup game, posted against Malaysia in 1979 when Lauren Jackson’s mother was on the team.\n\n“It was a great hit-out for us,” Opals coach Sandy Brondello said. “I thought we came with the appropriate toughness and a little bit more poise.”\n\nThe lowest-ranked side at the tournament, Mali only worried the Opals in the opening exchanges, racing out to a surprise 10-2 lead as the hosts struggled for both energy and accuracy.\n\nBut the Malians were prone to fouling and the hosts punished them from the stripe. Eight separate players sunk free-throws, contributing 20 points to the Aussie total.\n\nThe Opals were especially prolific from beyond the three-point line, shooting at 55%.\n\nAustralia managed to shoot with only 26.1% accuracy from the field against France but improved that stat to 56, with seven Opals scoring more than 10 points.\n\nSteph Talbot played a big part in overcoming Mali. Photograph: Kelly Defina/Getty Images\n\nIn defence, they used their size advantage to frazzle Mali, who never rediscovered their early mojo.\n\n“We got off to a slow start but once we got through those post-game one jitters, we hit our stride,” said Opals centre Marianna Tolo. “We were able to get our flow and get some great looks from the three-point line and inside as well.”\n\nIn her second game back for the Opals, basketball legend Jackson helped steady the ship after Mali’s early surge.\n\nJackson and Tolo each sunk a pair of free-throws shortly after being injected into the contest but once the Opals had built an unassailable lead, the 41-year-old was given an early mark.\n\nThe Australians had plenty of strike across the court without her.\n\nYoung gun Ezi Magbegor stood up with 15 points after a quiet showing against France, while Cayla George and Tess Madgen went into entertainer mode with four triples each.\n\nAustralia’s win lifts them into the logjam in the middle of Group B. Four of the pool’s six sides have started the tournament with a win and a loss.\n\nAll six have a rest day on Saturday, the Opals then face Serbia for their next assignment the following evening.\n\n“Every game is going to be tough,” Tolo said. “It’s going to come down to the wire so we just need to take it one game at a time and that starts with Serbia.”\n\nAt the close of play after day two, only China, Canada and the USA remain undefeated.\n\nCanada posted a gritty 59-45 defeat of France to move a game clear atop Group B and close in on a spot in the knockout phase.\n\nThe USA brought Puerto Rico back to earth with a 106-42 thrashing that set the stage for Saturday’s heavyweight tussle with China.\n\nSerbia lost two of their biggest stars to retirement in the months before the World Cup but opened their account with a 69-64 win against reigning Olympic silver medallists Japan.",
    "There’s one way to make Australia’s path to a republic easier – for King Charles to endorse it | Dennis Altman": "Leaders around the world sent their condolences to the people of Great Britain. Despite our insistence that Elizabeth was Australia’s head of state, that was rarely acknowledged elsewhere.\n\nCharles III, prior to his coronation, will visit the various parts of the UK. Again, there is no serious expectation that he will visit the 14 other countries of which he has automatically become sovereign.\n\nYet his accession as head of state of Australia was automatic; by the afternoon of 9 September the supreme court of Victoria was issuing notices in the name of the king. Our national schizophrenia was reflected in references to him as both the British monarch and our king.\n\nThere is a case to be made for constitutional monarchy where the monarch can be seen to embody the nation. Ours is, however, a Claytons system, where the king is represented by a governor general, chosen by the prime minister. No British prime minister gets to choose the person to whom he is theoretically accountable.\n\nThe republican movement is clear that this is an unacceptable situation, and we need an Australian head of state, chosen by some process that allows for popular participation. But there is a prior question to be asked, which is whether we need a head of state at all. In the debates about Scott Morrison’s appointment of himself to several key ministries, even though those positions were already filled, constitutional lawyers suggested the governor general had no choice but to accept his recommendation.\n\nBut if a head of state can do no more than accede to the wishes of the prime minister, what purpose does she or he serve? Unless a head of state can restrain the government of the day, he or she is merely a cypher, useful for opening flower shows but of no constitutional importance.\n\nKing Charles, like his mother, will now meet regularly with the British prime minister, and undoubtedly make his views known. While Elizabeth was scrupulous in observing constitutional niceties there is little doubt that over time she influenced her ministers, using her extraordinary experience to ask difficult questions and encourage confidences.\n\nAs the heir, Charles was far more outspoken, and became known for his particular interests around architecture, agriculture and climate change. As king he will undoubtedly restrain himself, but he will still retain the power to be consulted, to encourage and to warn, as Walter Bagehot summed up the role of the monarchy under Victoria.\n\nRepublicans have hoped that after the death of Elizabeth and the accession of her son there would be a new interest in Australia becoming a republic. My hunch is that the panoply of the funeral, followed by the coronation, will only reinforce support for the monarchy. Combined with the disdain that so many of us feel for politicians, the argument for a republic will be a difficult one. Polls suggest that Australians are no more enthusiastic for change now than they were in 1999, despite the fact that the country is far less British than it was at the time of the referendum.\n\nWhat the death of Elizabeth has underlined is the extent to which many people feel an emotional connection to the royals, who stand above everyday politics. Too often the republican movement sounds as if it were engaging in a tutorial on constitutional law, rather than seeking to encourage us to think more deeply about what sort of nation we want to be.\n\nAt this point in our history we cannot disentangle arguments for a republic from the moral imperative to recognise Indigenous sovereignty. When senator Lidia Thorpe pointed to the indignity of swearing allegiance to a monarchy in whose name her people has been dispossessed, she highlighted the constitutional dilemma.\n\nIronically the easiest path to a republic would be if the new king were to endorse it. It is conceivable that Charles, having been present at the recent decision of Barbados to become a republic and aware of the growing move to follow this in Jamaica, might pre-empt the debate by declaring unambiguously that he would welcome constitutional changes in his remaining realms beyond the UK.\n\nIn so doing, King Charles could also clarify the deliberate confusion that seems to exist around membership of the Commonwealth. The majority of countries in the Commonwealth are already republics, including major states such as South Africa and India. Five countries (Malaysia, Tonga, Brunei, Lesotho and Eswatini) have their own monarchies. Yet even the most sophisticated reporters seem confused about the fact that becoming a republic does not affect Australia’s membership of the Commonwealth.\n\nAt moments, especially during the Thatcher years, Queen Elizabeth seemed more aware than her government of the need to recognise change in her former colonies. It would be fitting were her son to follow suit and acknowledge that it is no longer appropriate for him to be head of state in countries as far flung as Papua New Guinea and Grenada."
