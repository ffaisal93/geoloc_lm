    "Hurricane Ian to bring devastating winds to Cuba": "A man collects empty cans at the seafront ahead of the arrival of Tropical Storm Ian in Havana, Cuba, September 26, 2022. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nHAVANA, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ian is expected to hammer western Cuba late in the day with heavy winds and rain and a potentially life-threatening storm surge after strengthening overnight from a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday.\n\nThe fast-growing storm is located about 100 miles (160 km) west of Grand Cayman, barreling northwest toward Cuba with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour (130 km per hour), making it a Category 1 hurricane on a five-step scale.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is possible where the core of Ian moves across western Cuba,\" the center said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe storm is forecast to strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane that will soak Florida, where residents are stockpiling supplies and filling sandbags.\n\nCuba over the weekend began evacuating tourists and some workers from Isla de la Juventud and Cayo Largo, off its southwestern coast, where the hurricane was expected to make landfall on Monday evening.\n\nThe storm is set to cross the island as it moves north into the Gulf of Mexico, but both U.S. and Cuban forecasts put its track west of the Cuban capital of Havana, where a major storm strike would likely cause catastrophic damage to the city´s antiquated infrastructure.\n\nFarther north, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency in all 67 of the state’s counties, some of which had already announced evacuation orders.\n\nThe U.S. hurricane center said the highest risk of life-threatening storm surge would occur along Florida's western coast from Fort Myers to the Tampa Bay region.\n\nIn Cuba, officials have placed the island's western provinces under a hurricane alert and have announced plans for allocating food and evacuating people from low-lying areas.\n\nAt a bakery in the Cuban capital just after sunrise Monday, the line for bread had swelled to nearly twice its normal length, occupying several blocks, as demand rose for basic goods ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I´m buying bread now because later in the afternoon I won´t be able to leave my house,\" said Guillermo Gomez, 79, as he waited to enter the bakery. \"The water will be up to my knees.\"\n\nThe storm appears set for a direct hit on the tobacco-growing province of Pinar del Rio, a more lightly populated area of the island dedicated primarily to farming and fishing.\n\nElsewhere in the Caribbean, Cayman Islands airports halted operations on Sunday due to the storm, officials said, and the island's weather service predicted waves of up to 14 feet (4.3 meters).\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Dave Sherwood in Havana and Brian Ellsworth in Miami; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Cuba approves same-sex marriage in unusual referendum": "HAVANA (AP) — Cubans have approved a sweeping \"family law” code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt as well as redefining rights for children and grandparents, officials said Monday, though opposition in the national referendum was unusually strong on the Communist Party-governed island.\n\nThe measure — which contains more than 400 articles — was approved by 66.9% to 33.1%, the president of the National Electoral Council, Alina Balseiro Gutiérrez, told official news media, though returns from a few places remained to be counted.\n\nThe reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from the growing evangelical movement in Cuba — and many other Cubans — despite an extensive government campaign in favor of the measure, including thousands of informative meetings across the country and extensive media coverage backing it.\n\nCuban elections — in which no party other than the Communist is allowed — routinely produce victory margins of more than 90% — as did a referendum on a major constitutional reform in 2019.\n\nThe code would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel Díaz-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged questions about the measure as he voted on Sunday.\n\n“Most of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, he celebrated approval of the measure, tweeting “Love is now the law.”\n\nPassage “is to pay a debt to various generation of Cubans whose domestic plans had been waiting years for this law,\" he added. “As of today, we will be a better nation.”\n\nThe measure had been approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, after years of debate about such reforms.\n\nA major supporter of the measure was Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially — and often militantly — atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro — Raul’s brother — it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nOpposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

His successor, Joe Biden, has left the designation in place.\n\nAs a result, any British holidaymaker who has been to Cuba in the past 11 years is disqualified from using the “Esta” scheme, with which the vast majority of UK travellers visit the US. They must instead pay £137 for a visa – and wait months for an interview appointment.\n\nA family of four who have visited the Caribbean’s largest island and now want to go to the US face a bill of over £500 to comply with the rule.\n\nThe outgoing president put Cuba on the same list as Iran, North Korea and Syria on 11 January 2021 – barely a week before he was replaced by Mr Biden.\n\nThe classification is applied to nations that have “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism”.\n\nThe government in Havana strenuously rejects the accusation.\n\nBut its effect is to disqualify any prospective visitor to the US who has been in Cuba since 1 March 2011 from using the swift online application process known as Esta (the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation).\n\nThe Independent has been told by the US State Department: “Any visit to an SST on or after March 1, 2011, even if the country was designated yesterday, renders the applicant ineligible for Esta.”\n\nInstead, they must try to get a tourist visa – which requires payment of $160 (£137) and for the traveller to attend an appointment at the US embassy in London or the consulate-general in Belfast.\n\nBut because of delays incurred during the coronavirus pandemic, there is a serious backlog of appointments.\n\nThe US embassy in London says: “Please note that due to an increasing backlog of visa appointment requests, you may experience a significant delay between paying your visa fee and scheduling an interview appointment.\n\n“By paying the visa fee, you acknowledge that it may take several months to schedule an interview appointment.”\n\nAnyone who has been to Cuba and obtains Esta clearance for the US will be breaching the rules, and could in theory be turned away upon arrival\n\nBut some travellers have told The Independent that they have successfully visited the US using passports issued since their trips to Cuba.\n\nEarlier this month, Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, described the US position as “illegitimate, unsustainable and immoral”.",
    "Pandemic worsened inequalities, exposed true essence of unjust global order, Cuba tells UN": "“Never has humankind had this wealth of scientific and technical potential that it has now, neither has it ever had the extraordinary capacity than it does now to create wealth and well-being,” he said on Wednesday, but added: “However, never has the world been so unequal in terms of just how much people suffer.”\n\nHe pointed to some grim figures, including that some 828 million people are going hungry, around 50 million children suffer from stunting and unemployment will affect 207 million persons in 2022.\n\nTrillions in military spending while vaccines remain scarce\n\nHe went on to note that around 6.5 million people have died because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccinations to tackle this crisis are inaccessible to billions of people in low-income countries.\n\nReferring to global military expenditures, which have grown at a dizzying pace and for the first time now exceeds $2 trillion dollars, and while championing the universalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he raised the question of how much more could be done if these resources were devoted to promoting health and development, how many lives could be saved.\n\nTalking about the climate crisis, the Cuban Foreign Minister remarked, “we have one planet earth, one common home, for the rich and the poor, we must act without delay.”\n\nEconomic war against Cuba\n\nIn sharing his observation that international relations are moving along a dangerous path, he decried the United States for its offensive of economic, military, political and diplomatic coercion.\n\nRecalling the General Assembly’s adoption of the first resolution to end the embargo against Cuba 30 years ago, he denounced the US for the “act of economic war in times of peace,” for ignoring the resolution, creating material shortages, pressuring banking institutions and damaging the Cuban people.\n\nCriticizing the “unfair inclusion” and “slanderous classification” of Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism when Cuba “has been a victim of state terrorism”, he called out the US for its double standards, inconsistency, selectivity and manipulation including on human rights.\n\nReferring to the colossal challenges that face the Cuban people and government, he said “the Cuban economy has withstood extraordinary pressure which is having an impact on industry service provision, leading to scarcity in food and medicine, and leading to a decline in consumption and thus resulting in a decline in the general well-being of our people. The human damage caused by this policy is impossible to quantify but is nevertheless vast, cruel and immoral.”\n\nUrging the US to address the issues fueling irregular migration, he commended the return of visa processing at the US embassy in Havana and reiterated Cuba’s readiness to move towards better relations with the US but only based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and no attempts at undermining sovereignty and independence.\n\nSolidarity with others\n\nThe Foreign Minister shared that at the worst moments of the pandemic, Cuba was able to send 58 medical brigades to some 48 countries. He went on to express solidarity with the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua, support for Caribbean nations’ claims for reparations for the slave trade and colonialism, reaffirmed Cuba’s commitment to independence of Puerto Rico and reconstruction of Haiti.\n\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez reiterated Cuba’s staunch commitment to peace in Colombia, an end to foreign interference in Syria, and a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict. He also called for an end of the Israel occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n\nHe concluded by turning to Ukraine and said that the realistic solution to the war must guarantee the security and sovereignty of all. He said, “Cuba will continue to speak out loud and clear to reject hegemonism and domination, unilateral coercive measure, genocide blockades and attempts to impose one culture and one model on the world.”",

    "Better than Bulgaria but not as nice as Cuba: how did the US become such an awful place to live? | Arwa Mahdawi": "What do you call a country where nearly one in 10 adults have medical debts and a broken bone can boot you into bankruptcy? A country where a city of more than 160,000 residents recently had no safe drinking water for weeks? A country where life expectancy has dropped for the second year in a row and poor people sell their blood plasma in order to make ends meet? A country where the maternal mortality rate of black women in the capital is nearly twice as high as for women in Syria?\n\nYou call it one of the richest countries in the world.\n\nThe US is the second-wealthiest country in the world (recently overtaken by China) when you look at national balance sheets. It’s the largest economy in the world when you look at GDP. And it’s home to some of the richest people in the world. By all those measures of progress, the US is doing great. By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth. And, on this measure, the US comes just behind Cuba and just above Bulgaria. The US is “becoming a ‘developing country’,” one political historian said last week, based on this index.\n\nIf you’re reading this from the other side of the Atlantic, things aren’t much better. An analysis in the Financial Times last week found that “On present trends, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024, and the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade.” Essentially, the analysis concluded, income inequality in the US and UK is so enormous that the two nations should be classed as poor countries with some very rich people. Most of whom seem to be in the government.",
    "Hurricane Ian will hit Florida as a major storm, forecasters say": "Updated September 26, 2022 at 3:06 PM ET\n\nHurricane Ian is projected to bring a perilous storm surge and winds as strong as 140 mph when it nears Florida's Gulf Coast in the middle of this week, the National Hurricane Center said on Monday.\n\nIan had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph as of 2 p.m. ET Monday — but it will rapidly intensify into a major storm, developing wind speeds over 110 mph as it moves toward western Cuba, forecasters say.\n\nAs it hits Cuba, Ian's storm surge \"could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet above normal tide levels\" in some areas, the hurricane center said.

Over the next 48 hours, the storm is expected to shift course toward the north and northeast — and the timing of those moves will likely determine where it makes landfall on the U.S. mainland.\n\nIan sets off alarms after a quiet summer\n\nLuis Santana / Tamp Bay Times via AP / AP Victoria Colson, 31, of Tampa, Fla., loads sandbags into her truck along with other residents who waited for over 2 hours at Himes Avenue Complex to fill their 10 free sandbags on Sunday.\n\nA hurricane warning — meaning dangerous conditions are imminent — is in effect for western Cuba. In the U.S., roughly 100 miles of the Florida coast is under a hurricane watch, from Englewood north to the Anclote River — a stretch that includes Tampa, Clearwater, and St. Petersburg. A hurricane watch is normally issued 48 hours before storm conditions arrive.\n\nIan is the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2022, a season that only saw its first hurricane earlier this month. So far, predictions of above-average activity in the 2022 hurricane season haven't come to pass — a circumstance explained by fluctuations in the jet stream and heat waves in northern latitudes.\n\nBut Ian's menacing approach is a reminder of a warning that hurricane experts often invoke: A single bad storm is enough to upend people's lives.\n\n\"It only takes one land-falling hurricane to make it a bad season for you,\" Jamie Rhome, the NHC's acting director, told NPR earlier this month.\n\nBoth President Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis have declared emergencies in Florida, easing the way for federal and state agencies to coordinate their planning and response.\n\nPeople in Florida are tracking the storm closely\n\n/ Esri, HERE, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS / Esri, HERE, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS Hurricane Ian will strengthen into a major storm before it runs into western Cuba and Florida, forecasters say.\n\nAlong the coast of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, all eyes are on forecasts that model Ian's potential path. But experts urge everyone in the region to have an emergency plan in place, even if the latest track doesn't show the storm making landfall in their area.\n\nPredictions currently call for the storm to remain off of Florida's western coast as it moves north toward the Panhandle. But it will drop heavy rain along the way — up to 15 inches in local areas, and 8-10 inches in central western Florida overall.\n\nIn areas along the coast, the deepest waters are expected to strike on the storm's right-hand side, due to the double-whammy of the storm surge and waves whipped by strong winds.\n\n\"Regardless of Ian's exact track and intensity, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this week,\" the NHC said on Monday.\n\nGrocery shoppers in the storm's predicted path are stocking up on water, batteries and other supplies. Some shelves were reportedly bare in northern Florida, but in the Tampa area, residents were more relaxed, hoping the storm will steer clear of them.\n\n\"It's trending west,\" a shopper at a Winn-Dixie store in Sarasota told member station WUSF on Sunday. \"We have looked at the models and only a few of them look like they are going to impact us, everything else says it is going to be the Panhandle.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Cuba: the communist climate criminal kids ignore": "When it comes to socialist and communist dictatorships, environmental groups fall silent. There is an unwillingness to criticise these oil-heavy nations for profiting off the black gold of fossil fuel, even when things go horribly wrong.\n\nThis moral double standard makes a mockery of UN-affiliated green groups who routinely heap praise on their ideological bedfellows while demonising Western nations for their rolling green fields of family farms or the horror of reliable energy grids.\n\nThe ethical dilemma was on full display when a Cuban oil storage facility at the Matanzas supertanker port went up in flames on August 5 after it was struck by lightning. The resulting blaze spread across four fuel tanks over the following week, injuring over a hundred. It was later discovered that 16 firefighters were missing and eventually confirmed dead. The ferocity of the blaze sent thick, black smoke laden with chemicals churning into the sky like a volcanic eruption.\n\nThe Big one… Raging fire in Cuban oil depot leaves 80 injured and 17 firefighters missing: 800 people evacuated as smoke billows towards Havana after lightning strikes oil tank#cuba pic.twitter.com/3O0cNATC1l — Kyle.Taylor (@livingbyyyz) August 6, 2022\n\nExperts were rushed in from ‘friendly’ nations such as Venezuela and Mexico during the initial panic. They created a fleet of planes and helicopters that buzzed around the fire like bugs at night, dousing it in foam. Their efforts could not stop the original half-tank fire spreading, but did eventually bring the worst fire disaster in Cuban history under control.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cuba has called on the US Environmental Protection Agency for help wanting access to ‘innovative US techniques and procedures’ for the cleanup operation. The amount of help offered by the Biden administration is likely to be limited.\n\nThe destroyed fuel tanks formed part of an eight-tank facility that stores part of Cuba’s vast supply of crude oil ready for transport. Some is sent off to the nation’s thermoelectric plants – one of which had to be shut down. At the time, locals were ‘warned to wear face masks and avoid acid rain’ as water mixed with toxic fumes. They later saw evidence of black filth appearing all over their residences.\n\nWhile our politicians bicker about whether or not they’ll have to destroy Australia’s agriculture industry to cut ‘emissions’, huge tanks full of oil were burned and released directly into the atmosphere.\n\nWhat’s the carbon footprint for this mess?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the United Nations going to punish Cuba for endangering the entire planet by bringing on the climate apocalypse?\n\nWhy didn’t we see climate-panicked school children from Western nations pour onto the streets, crying, screaming, and clutching banners about ‘Cuban climate criminals destroying the world!’?\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find an Australian school that mentioned the disaster that occurred near Havana, let alone a teacher brave enough to criticise their Left-wing regime.\n\n📹| Another Blast in Cuba Oil Warehouse. ▪️Friday’s thunderstorm caused a giant fire at a crude oil warehouse in #Matanzas, #Cuba. 1 dead, 147 wounded and 14 missing.pic.twitter.com/8Z2NG2T9FY — EHA News (@eha_news) August 9, 2022\n\nCuba distanced itself from the world in the 1950s under Fidel Castro and created a communist dictatorship. Their story since then has followed the typical communist collapse of terrible living conditions, blackouts, food shortages, crime, civil unrest, and pitiful healthcare.\n\nBut don’t worry, the World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report 2006 listed Cuba as the ‘most sustainable model of development on the planet’. It is, apparently, ‘environmentally sustainable’ with a ‘high quality of life’.\n\nWhy all the praise? They installed a few solar panels… That was enough to tip the virtue scales in their favour. It is a game of green shadows and disingenuous ‘science’. As world burns, Cuba number 1 for sustainable development: WWF, went the slightly awkward headline in 2016.\n\nDespite the obvious enormous environmental damage caused by this disaster, the propaganda machine that protects everyone except Western companies seems hesitant to criticise Cuba for the mishap.\n\nDelegate for the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, Oscar García Martínez, notes that ‘air quality’ is the main problem, but that it does not ‘compromise human health’.\n\n‘Everything indicates that what happened in the fire doesn’t seem to have compromised any aspect for the future,’ they said.\n\nBut what about the imminent climate apocalypse, I hear you say? No one mentioned it. Experts can tell you the carbon footprint of your salad wrap, but not the Cuban fire crisis because – uh – reasons?\n\nCitizen reports were more honest than official propaganda. According to World Nation News:\n\n‘In the days leading up to the fire, it was common to read independent media descriptions of residents in high-risk areas who reported “a black spot or powder that stains clothes and hands and leaves an unusual appearance in the water”. While he warned that in the Yumuri Valley, a few kilometers from the town of Matanjas, “the animals don’t want to eat the yerba. They chew it and throw it away. We have nowhere to water the animals. Rivers get polluted after the rains.”’\n\nDespite the glowing reviews of ‘sustainability’, 80 per cent of Cuba’s energy comes from oil and natural gas with almost all of the rest drawn from biofuels. The loss of these four tanks has spread fears of sustained and regular power outages in the months to come.\n\nThe French announced that they would help build the now notorious supertanker hub in 1989 in an agreement between the Bouygues Offshore Group, a Soviet company, and the Cuban oil ministry. While the original base was largely constructed with money from the Soviets, the destroyed tankers were new and built with help from Venezuela. It is no surprise to hear that after the destruction, President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro has put his hand up to say that he will instruct the Ministry of Petroleum to invest in the rebuilding of the Cuban supertanker hub.\n\nUnsurprisingly, instead of worrying about the massive oil fire, Cuba is more concerned about the environmental impact of … Covid.\n\n‘It is not difficult to predict then that the disease will cause new and greater damage to biodiversity, aggravating the already existing deterioration of ecosystems,’ said Cuba’s Minister for Science, Technology and the Environment, Elba Rosa Pérez Montoya.\n\nIt was part of a ploy to get wealthy countries to re-invest in developing countries to save their biodiversity.\n\nSo, while the communist tyrannies of the world burn fossil fuels and complain about their new Climate Change money-making demon of Covid, the rest of us face a future of Veganism and blackouts.",
    "Mark Cuban Considering Leaving Shark Tank As He Bets His Legacy On Low-Cost Drugs": "Blockchain, basketball, Broadcast.com: Mark Cuban has never lost his passion for disruption. Now the billionaire entrepreneur has an ambitious plan to take on Big Pharma and lower the cost of prescription drugs once and for all. And, after 13 seasons, this savvy shark may finally be ready to leave the tank.\n\nM ark Cuban unlocks his phone and opens his inbox, which is pinging like crazy as email after email fills the screen. “Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,” he says, swiping each into the garbage with barely a moment’s thought.\n\nOne with the subject line “A Desperate Plea”: delete. Next, an email about a crypto project he’s working on—Cuban agreed to buy the digital rights to drawings by one of the World Trade Center architects and is planning to turn them into NFTs. He squints. The type’s too small. Next. Finally, an email from an aspiring entrepreneur. His first act of mercy: “I like these guys. I’ll save them for later.”\n\nCuban in real life is not that much different from the role he’s played for 11 years—or in TV math, 13 seasons—on Shark Tank. He listens to everyone, at least briefly, before making snap judgments. His personal email address is public (mcuban@gmail.com), and the billionaire investor slogs through every scam, spam message or pitch sent his way. Why? He can’t help it. “To me it’s the sport I get to compete in and I get to be really good at,” he says, grinning. “I’ll be 110 years old still doing whatever is the equivalent 50 years from now of responding to email.”\n\nCuban, the entrepreneur, has founded more than ten companies, starting in 1983 with software reseller MicroSolutions and up to Cost Plus Drugs, the public benefit corporation he star­ted in January 2022, which aims to lower prescription drug prices. Cuban, the insta-billionaire, sold Broadcast.com, an internet sports radio outfit, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999 (a few years la­ter, Yahoo shuttered the service). Cuban, the investor, has poured at least $25 million into crypto concerns (including dogecoin, the currency famously started as a joke) and taken stakes in at least 400 startups, many through Shark Tank.\n\nSome of his gambles have done all right; some have blown up. But more than two decades later, Broadcast.com is still the main reason he got so rich, worth an estima­ted $4.6 billion. (Cuban didn’t start Broadcast.com; it was founded in 1992 by Chris Jaeb. He joined three years later with his college buddy Todd Wagner, also a Broadcast.com billionaire.) The Yahoo sale earned Cuban an estimated $1.1 billion payout after taxes. He spent $280 million of that buying a majority stake in the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks the next year. Bam, another slam dunk. Now worth $2.2 billion, according to Forbes’ estimate, his 85% stake in the team represents almost half his fortune.\n\nPhoto by Guerin Blask for Forbes\n\n“On the one hand I understand that nobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is,” Cuban says. “You make the best of it, and I don’t feel guilty about it at all. I busted my ass to get here.”\n\nCuban is the rare billionaire who seems to actually enjoy being rich. In his younger years he embraced his wealth by buying a sprawling Dallas mansion, an apartment on Central Park West and a private jet, and traveling the world partying “like a rock star.” More recently he’s been having a blast doling out advice on Shark Tank and via Twitter (he has 8.8 million followers), buying shots for strangers and running his mouth to anyone who will listen. He still spends money on fun stuff. Case in point: He recently bought the town of Mustang, Texas (population: zero), as a favor to a dying friend (“this was his big asset”), and appointed one of his other pals the mayor. The billionaire toyed with the idea of filling the ghost town with life-size robotic dinosaurs made by one of his Shark Tank entrepreneurs but has since deemed that impractical. He’s open to other ideas. (Email him.)\n\nOn the far side of the seriousness spectrum from animatronic T-Rexes is his new pharmaceutical business, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, which he’s positioning as the remedy to skyrocketing prescription prices. Launched nine months ago, Cost Plus Drugs offers steep discounts on around 350 different generic medications. Generic Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering med, costs $151 a month at the local CVS, a steep discount from the brand-name pill, which runs $329. Cuban sells it for $4.80. Ditto Glucophage, a diabetes drug. The generic sells for $20 at CVS, versus $3.90 at Cost Plus. Or there’s the generic version of antidepressant Zoloft, which is $50 at CVS but $4.20 at Cost Plus.\n\n“Nobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is. You make the best of it, and I don’t feel guilty about it at all.”\n\nCuban can offer such low prices because he bypasses the pharma industry’s many middlemen, including the price negotiators known as pharmacy benefit managers. (It is a huge, notoriously opaque business. Market leader CVS Caremark generated $153 billion in sales in 2021.) Instead, Cuban buys directly from the folks who manufacture the pills, paying them just enough to make it worth their while, then sells them online at a fixed markup of 15%, plus $8 for shipping and fees. It’s not an entirely novel idea. Walmart and Costco are experimenting with similar models. But Cuban, perhaps thanks to his celeb­rity, is quickly gaining traction. Cost Plus Drugs already claims more than a million customers and says it is growing at a rate of about 10% each week, on track to be profitable in 2023. Cuban is uncharacteristically tight-lipped about revenue; Forbes estimates Cost Plus has booked at least $25 million in sales during its first nine months as an operating concern.\n\nCuban, who notes that it’s the first com­pany he’s ever put his name on, has invested close to $100 million so far and says he’s all in on the idea and willing to spend “whatever it takes.” It is, in his own words, “legacy defining. If we get this right, this will be the most impactful thing I’ve ever done.”\n\nHe insists he will pull back from other projects to focus on Cost Plus Drugs. He is even considering stepping away from Shark Tank. “Part of me wants to quit,” he says. He’s not worried about whether the show will sink or swim. “They’ll survive fine without me.”\n\nKILLER INSTINCTS | (From left) Longtime Shark Tank stars Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin O’Leary and Lori Greiner with guest investor Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of Kind bars, during the show’s 13th season. ABC\n\nC uban’s friends and family all say the same thing: He was a born entrepreneur. Raised in the quiet Pittsburgh suburb of Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of three sons of working-class parents, he stood out from a young age for his endless stream of moneymaking schemes.\n\n“He was always doing stuff, always hustling to make a buck,” says younger brother Jeff, who runs Cuban’s entertainment properties, including movie distributor Magnolia Pictures. Once, during a printer strike in Pennsylvania, a teenaged Cuban got up before dawn and drove 130 miles to Cleveland to buy newspapers to sell in his hometown.\n\n“Luck is a huge part of everyone’s success. Shaq used to give me a hard time: ‘Oh, you got lucky.’ And I’m like, ‘you planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?’”\n\nThe ploys got more ambitious as he got older. As a rising senior at the University of Indiana, he begged and borrowed enough—even dipping into his student loans—to purchase a local bar, Motley’s Pub. It was at Motley’s, which was eventually forced to close because of underage drinking, that he met his future Broadcast.com partner Todd Wagner. In August, Cuban returned to the site of Motley’s, now called Kilroy’s on Kirkwood, and left a $10,000 tip after buying 100 shots for its patrons.\n\n“[He] always knew he was either going to make it big or he was just going to go broke,” says Jerry Katz, who has known Cuban since kindergarten.\n\nBy 32, Cuban was a multimillionaire after selling Micro­Solutions to CompuServe, an early online service, for $6 million. He decided to retire. But that didn’t stick for long. In 1995, the year Netscape went public, he and Wagner bought into Broadcast.com, then called AudioNet, which was struggling to find a way to provide the play-by-play of out-of-town sports, even experimenting with shortwave radio. Cuban and Wagner took the idea online. As Web 1.0 mania inflated, Broadcast.com recorded the best-ever IPO at the time, ending its first trading day with a market cap of $1 billion, more than 300 times its sales of $3.2 million. It sold to Yahoo a year later.\n\nCuban knew a bubble when he saw one. He and Wagner were paid in Yahoo shares, but in a savvy move suggested by Cuban, the duo used stock collars to cap their upside if the stock jumped—but limited their downside if the shares plummeted. Still, he readily admits that his lucky break was exactly that. “Luck is a huge part of everyone’s success. Shaq used to give me a hard time when I first got to the NBA. He goes, ‘Oh, you got lucky.’ And I’m like, ‘You planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?’”\n\nWagner, who has partnered with Cuban on multiple businesses since, including the Mavericks, and who himself is worth some $1.8 billion, argues it’s much more than just luck. “Mark, I think, has always had an ability, and still does, to see around corners,” he says. “I think of Mark as the smartest, best-prepared guy in the room.”\n\nA s much as he loves money, Cuban might love being famous even more. In 2004, he starred in The Benefactor, ABC’s answer to Donald Trump’s Apprentice, in which 16 contestants competed for $1 million out of Cuban’s fortune. It was canceled after one season. (Trump later wrote to Cuban consoling him on his “disastrous” and “embarrassing” effort. “If you ever decide to do another show, please call me and I will be happy to lend a helping hand.”) A big silver lining: meeting producer Clay Newbill, who later recruited him for Shark Tank. Cuban wasn’t available for the show’s pilot in 2009 but joined as a “guest shark” in the second season in 2011. He has been on every episode since.\n\n“Everybody, at some level, wants to be a celebrity,” says Cuban, who has also appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies as himself, including Entourage and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nLike other Hollywood types, Cuban has become enamored with NFTs, down to owning a CryptoPunk (No. 869, currently valued at $95,000.) He was a prominent supporter of NBA Top Shot, the league’s highly successful NFT marketplace (more than $1 billion in total sales since its October 2020 launch), and even star­ted his own NFT platform, Lazy.com, where he displays his personal collection. In March 2021, the Mavericks became the first NBA team to accept the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin as a form of payment—and (incredibly) still do despite the currency plummeting 90% since last year. It’s quite an about-face for Cuban, who quipped back in 2019 that he’d “rather have bananas” than bitcoin.\n\nLast October, the Mavericks inked a five-year partnership with Voyager Digital, one of the fastest-growing publicly traded crypto brokerages in the United States. Voya­ger has since lost 99% of its value and filed for bankruptcy, prompting a group of customers to sue Cuban, arguing that his endorsement duped everyday investors into pumping $5 billion (now frozen) into the platform. Cuban won’t comment on the lawsuit beyond saying it won’t stop him from promoting crypto.\n\nThe launch of Cost Plus Drugs in January was years in the making for Cuban—and even longer for his cofounder, Alex Oshmyansky, a radiologist from Colorado who, with some doctor friends, came up with the idea of selling off-patent drugs at manufacturing cost back in 2015. The doctors imagined it as a nonprofit and spent three years searching for funding. “We failed spectacularly and didn’t raise a single dime beyond what I put in myself,” says Oshmyansky, who invested about $200,000. In 2018, he switched gears and reincorporated as a public benefit corporation, meaning he could run the pharmacy as a business rather than a charity. That’s when Cuban got involved.\n\nThe billionaire’s initial investment was small (about $250,000), but he incrementally put in more money as the company made progress in overcoming regulatory hurdles and persuading hesitant drug manufacturers to participate. It took a full year to convince the first manufacturer, New Jersey–based Amneal Pharmaceuticals, to agree to make drugs for Cost Plus. At first, Cost Plus offered just 100 medi­cations from three manufacturers. Now it works with 20 manufacturing partners and is adding about 100 new drugs every month.\n\nCost Plus is also planning to manufacture its own medi­cations. Its $11 million, 22,000-square-foot Dallas manu­facturing facility is set to open in November. The all-robotic plant has been designed as a “flexible” facility that can quickly pivot to make whatever drugs the company can’t source from other manufacturers.\n\nA Shark’s Mark\n\nIn his 13 seasons as a Shark Tank judge, Mark Cuban says he’s invested $29 million in at least 85 companies. He has hit a handful of home runs, but just like a traditional VC, he’s also struck out a bunch (at least two Cuban-backed startups have declared bankruptcy or stopped operating). One big winner: preschool app Brightwheel, of which Cuban owns a 2% stake worth $12 million, 20 times his estimated investment. Here are a couple more from each side of the scorecard.\n\nWinners\n\n\n\n\n\ntk tk\n\nDude Products\n\nFour young guys in Chicago who prefer baby wipes to toilet paper invented flushable Dude Wipes, packaged in single travel packets for on-the-go use. Sales grew to $67 million last year and the firm is valued at $300 million. Cuban invested in 2015.\n\ntk tk\n\nBeatBox Beverages\n\nBacked by Cuban in 2014, BeatBox sold $30 million of its prepackaged cocktails—“party punch” flavors include “blue razzberry” and pink lemonade—over the past year. In September, the company raised $15 million from private investors at a $200 million valuation.\n\nLosers\n\n\n\n\n\nBreathometer\n\nCuban put an estimated $250,000 into this smartphone attachment to measure blood alcohol levels in 2013 but later called it his worst investment. The tech didn’t work; the Federal Trade Commission required the company to offer full refunds.\n\nToygaroo\n\nA “Netflix for toys” that rented out children’s playthings for a monthly fee. It floundered, filing for bankruptcy in 2012—just one year after Cuban and fellow shark Kevin O’Leary pledged to invest $200,000 on the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n—Conor Murray and Jemima McEvoy\n\nFor all its benefits, Cost Plus has some major limitations. The company doesn’t accept insurance. Nor does it currently sell drugs that are still protected by patents, which include blockbusters like Humira (arthritis) and Trulicity (diabetes). “Our goal is to be the low-cost provider of medications, and we will surprise a lot of people when we have branded drugs,” Cuban says. “I think people are just missing us. . . . They kind of pigeonhole us.”\n\nBeyond pharma, Cuban is thinking about higher ed, another industry ripe for disruption. “The one thing I will never do is give a school money, because all they’re going to do is build buildings,” he says. He argues that a better approach would be universities stripped down to the basics. Skip the “pretty dorms,” fancy cafeterias, rock-climbing walls and Division I sports and focus instead on recruiting the best teachers and keeping tuition low.\n\nBy nature, Cuban is not a pessimist, but the “one thing” that gets him down is American poli­tics. He isn’t a fan of efforts to hike billionaires’ taxes (shocker!) and thinks the electoral process needs an overhaul. “I want to blow up the two-party system,” he says. “To me, that is the root of all evil.” He seriously explored a presidential run in 2020 but decided against it after attracting less than 25% of the vote in a national poll he commissioned.\n\nFour years ago, Cuban turned 60. His birthday celebration was exactly the sort of blowout you might imagine. A host of friends and celebrities—his Shark Tank colleagues, singer Jennifer Lopez and her then-fiancé, former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez—gathered on the lawn of his epic 24,000-square-foot Dallas spread. Stevie Wonder and the Chainsmokers, a popular electronic-music duo, provided the entertainment.\n\nToward the end of the night, Cuban wandered up to his childhood friends Jerry Katz and Todd Reidbord. “He was the drunkest I’d ever seen anybody, but [he was] a happy person,” Reidbord recalls. “He put his arms around us and said, ‘I can’t believe this happened to me.’”\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Crypto Darling Helium Promised A 'People's Network.'

    "Hurricane Ian nears Cuba on path to strike Florida as Cat 4": "HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Ian was growing stronger as it approached the western tip of Cuba on a track to hit the west coast of Florida as a major hurricane as early as Wednesday.\n\nIan was forecast to hit the western tip of Cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger Category 4 with top winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking Florida.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\n“Please treat this storm seriously. It’s the real deal. This is not a drill,” Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba evacuated 50,000 people in Pinar del Rio province, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses, according to state media.\n\n“Cuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,” U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press early Monday.\n\nHere are the 11am EDT Monday 26 September Key Messages for Hurricane #Ian.\n\n\n\nLatest Advisory: https://t.co/tnOTyfOjMY pic.twitter.com/3yeYqkQCxe — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 26, 2022\n\nThe hurricane center predicted areas of Cuba’s western coast could see as much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.\n\nIn Havana, fishermen were taking their boats out of the water along the famous Malecon, the seaside boardwalk, and city workers were busy unclogging storm drains ahead of the expected rain.\n\nHavana resident Adyz Ladron, 35, said the potential for rising water from the storm worries him.\n\n“I am very scared because my house gets completely flooded, with water up to here,” he said, pointing to his chest.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h), about 195 miles (310 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 85 mph (135 km/h).\n\nThe center of the hurricane was passing to the west of the Cayman Islands, where Premier Wayne Panton said the government and its opposition were working together to keep the people as safe as possible. No major damage was reported there Monday, and residents were going back into the streets as the winds died down.\n\nIan won’t linger over Cuba, but will slow down over the Gulf of Mexico, growing wider and stronger, “which will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,” the hurricane center said.\n\nA surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas.

Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies as it swirls northward off the state’s Gulf coast.\n\n“You have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,” DeSantis said at a news conference. “That’s going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You’re going to have flood events. You’re going to have a lot of different impacts.”\n\nDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Tuesday trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nPlaying it safe, NASA planned to begin slowly rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.\n\nFlash flooding was predicted for much of the Florida peninsula, and heavy rainfall was possible for the southeast United States later this week. With tropical storm force winds extending 115 miles (185 kilometers) from Ian’s center, watches covered the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nBob Gualtieri, sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, said in a briefing that although no one will be forced to leave, mandatory evacuation orders are expected to begin Tuesday.\n\n“What it means is, we’re not going to come help you. If you don’t do it, you’re on your own,” Gualtieri said.\n\nZones to be evacuated include all along Tampa Bay and the rivers that feed it. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch urged residents not to ignore any evacuation orders.\n\n“This is a very real threat that this storm poses to our community,” Welch said.\n\nThe hurricane center has advised Floridians to have survival plans in place and monitor updates of the storm’s evolving path.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida; Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida; and Julie Walker in New York.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Life Expectancy: The US and Cuba in the Time of Covid": "The article documents that, for the first time, life expectancy in Cuba exceeds that in the US by almost three years. It explores intertwined reasons behind this occurrence, including responses to Covid, health care systems, racism, poverty, misinformation campaigns, the embargo, international solidarity efforts, and resilience to climate change.\n\nRecent data shows that between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy (LE) in the US plunged almost three years while for Cuba it edged up 0.2 years. Yet, in 1960, the year after its revolution, Cuba had a LE of 64.2 years, lower by 5.6 years than that in the US (69.8 years). As I document in Cuban Health Care , the island quickly caught up to the US and, from 1970 through 2016, the two countries were nip and tuck, with some years Cuba and other years the US, having a longer LE. But neither country was ever as much as one year of LE ahead of the other.\n\nLife Expectancy (LE) in US and Cuba, 2017-2021\n\nYear LE US LE Cuba US – Cuba 2021 76.1* 79.0 ‡ – 2.9 2020 78.8† 78.9 ‡ -0.1 2019 79.0* 78.8 ‡ +0.2 2018 78.7† 78.7 ‡ 0.0 2017 78.6† 78.6 ‡ 0.0\n\nThis continued through the beginning of Covid, which sharply changed the pattern. LE in the US suddenly dropped behind that in Cuba. Bernd Debusmann Jr.of BBC News wrote , LE in the US fell “to the lowest level seen since 1996. Government data showed LE at birth now stands at 76.1 compared to 79 in 2019. That is the steepest two-year decline in a century.” From 2019 to 2020 , “LE declined in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nHow could a country with all the problems of Cuba, actually have LE almost three years greater than the US? There were enormous differences between the way the countries responded to Covid.\n\nThe Covid Contrast\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirmed that “ Covid-19 was the main contributing factor [to changes in LE]. The statistics show that Covid-19 accounted for 50% of the decline between 2020 and 2021. Between 2019 and 2020, the pandemic contributed to 74% of the decline.”\n\nA critical divergence between the two countries is that Cuba guarantees health care to all as a human right while the US system is based on profit and political grandstanding. When Covid hit, the US dawdled for months as Cuba mobilized for medical action.\n\nThe Ministry of Health developed a national strategy before the island’s first victim had succumbed to the disease. Cuban TV carried daily press conferences with detailed info on the status of new patients, results of cabinet meetings on Covid, and announcing the best way for citizens to protect themselves and others. Social distancing, masks and contact tracing were universally accepted.\n\nEach day Cuban medical students knocked on doors to ask citizens how they were. Students’ tasks included obtaining survey data from residents and making extra visits to the elderly, infants and those with respiratory problems. Clinic staff dealt with issues that doctors were unable to cope with and sent patients they could not care for to hospitals. Medical data was used by those in the highest decision-making positions of the country. In this way, every Cuban citizen and every health care worker, from those at neighborhood doctor offices through those at the most esteemed research institutes, had a part in determining health policy.\n\nThis inclusive approach resulted in Cuba’s having 87 Covid deaths by July 21, 2020, when the US had experienced 140,300. While the US population is 30 times that of Cuba, it had 1613 times as many deaths.\n\nTwo aspects of Cuba’s response to Covid stand out. First, Cuba does NOT have more money to spend on health care. It actually spends less than a tenth as much per person per year than does the US, but it spends that wisely on a holistic system. Second, Cuba’s health care is global – it continued its practice of sending thousands of medical staff to other countries during Covid.\n\nOver the past six decades more than 400,000 Cuban medical professionals have worked in 164 countries and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In addition to providing Cuban doctors with experience coping with diseases and medical issues they do not see at home, this action is positive global diplomacy. US diplomacy, on the other hand, seems to focus on threatening to harm people and/or actually harming them.\n\nIn Addition to Covid\n\nNews stories also mentioned other factors associated with the shorter LE in the US: drug overdoses, heart disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and suicides. The corporate press also acknowledged racial disparities.\n\nThere had been progress in reducing LE differences between Black and white Americans. This was reversed during 2018 – 2020 when LE went down 1.36 years for whites, 3.25 years for Hispanics, and 3.88 years for Blacks.\n\nThe fall in US life expectancy was even more pronounced among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Since 2019, it “dropped by 6.6 years, more than twice that of the wider US population.”\n\nThe US has multiple groups who reject government attempts to vaccinate or wear masks. Most loud-mouthed, of course, are the right wingers who lividly despise the very idea of public health campaigns. While their thought processes are hallucination-based, people of color have reality-based fears of being ignored, lied to, and used for government experimentation, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. There is a strong connection between vaccination hesitation and racism.\n\nWhat They Did Not Look At\n\nAmong factors with increasing US Covid rates ignored by corporate media in the US are poverty, an acute rise in misinformation, abortion, the embargo against Cuba and preparation for climate change.\n\nPoverty . The first task of the Cuban revolution was to simultaneously address poverty, food, sanitation, literacy, education, racism and housing, which the rebels saw as parts of unitary whole. During the Covid crisis, many US corporations were determined to force low wage workers to stay at their jobs, spreading the disease. Cuba told those with Covid to stay home.\n\nMisinformation . Discussions of Covid deaths must not ignore the deadly role of science denial. At the same time Trump was foolishly downplaying mounting dangers of Covid, Cuba was far along developing its “Novel Coronavirus Plan for Prevention and Control.” Trump was not and is not an isolated individual – he manifests a life-threatening movement toward lunacy. Cuba has no significant group which confronts Covid with a bottle of Clorox or expects a cure brought by Q Anon on a flying saucer.\n\nAbortion . Cuba also does not have a “Women’s Lives Don’t Matter!” movement seeking to eliminate abortion rights. Those who do not want an abortion do not get one and people do not seek to impose their religious and spiritual beliefs on others. The Supreme Court’s allowing states to criminalize abortion will cause many women to die, due both from self-attempts at abortion and lack of its availability. LE averages are impacted more by deaths of young than elderly; so, we can expect many abortion-induced deaths in US will be among teenagers and young women, which will affect LE.\n\nEmbargo . The “trade sanctions” or “blockade” or “embargo” have a special relationship with LE in Cuba: one might expect it to decrease LE; but it has not done so. When Cuba was reeling from the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, the US passed laws intending to punish those who continued to trade with it. This raised prices in the already impoverished country and has prevented or slowed the arrival of much life-saving medical equipment. Yet, due to its prioritizing health care during the 1990s, Cuba’s infant mortality decreased while its LE showed a slight increase.\n\nInternational solidarity movements have stepped in to help Cuba overcome many embargo effects. Lack of essential material prevented Cuba from performing liver transplants in children. But, during May 2022, Puentes de Amor (Bridges of Love) delivered the vital chemical compound to the William Soler Pediatric Hospital.\n\nResilience . Avoiding the use of fossil fuels and enormous hydro-, solar- and wind-projects, as Cuba does, will cut down on global destructiveness but have very little effect on reducing climate change on the island. However, preparing for resilience in the face of climate change can hugely affect its quality of life.\n\nIn March 2022 (p. 8) Scientific American editors wrote that most important in preparing for the next pandemic is “building new systems.” Unfortunately, this is what the US is avoiding as it becomes absorbed in making minor tweaks to outmoded, inadequate systems of environmental protection.\n\nCuba has been holding Bastión (bulwark) events involving as many as four million citizens who carry out food production, disease control, sanitation and safeguarding medical supplies. When a policy change is introduced, government representatives go to each community, including the most remote rural ones, to make sure that everyone knows the threats that climate change poses to their lives and how they can alter behaviors to minimize them. They include such diverse actions as conservation with energy use, saving water, preventing fires and using medical products sparingly.\n\nAnother energy positive being expanded in Cuba is farms being run entirely on agroecology principles. Such farms can produce 12 times the energy they consume. Biodigesters break down manure and other biomass to create biogas (very different in Cuba than the US) which is used for tractors or transportation. Vegetable and herb production in Cuba exploded from 4000 tons in 1994 to over four million tons by 2006. This is why Jason Hickel’s “Sustainable Development Index” rated Cuba’s ecological efficiency as the best in the world in 2019.\n\nWhere Are We Headed?\n\nThe connection between LE and climate change is becoming increasingly evident. US media stories typically focus on a given disaster such as a flood and mention how aging infrastructure is being neglected. The implication is that if infrastructure were updated to its status of 50 or 100 years ago, that would be adequate. It would not be adequate because climate change means that storms will be more frequent, more intense and more deadly in the future.\n\nBy 2017, Cuba had become the only country with a government-led plan (Project Life, or Tarea Vida) to combat climate change which includes a 100 year projection. While Cuba is looking ahead and planning how to protect people from increasingly devastating storms, US politicians feverishly bury their heads in the sand in subservience to corporate interests, subjecting future generations to ever greater catastrophes.\n\nThis causes LE in the US to plunge down while LE in Cuba climbs slowly upward. Covid did not create the LE divide between the US and Cuba. Covid exacerbated trends which have become increasingly intertwined for decades. The best guess is that these trends will continue well into the future.",

They have treated our patients with love more than with medicine,” the ambassador commented in the presence of Cuban Energy and Mines Minister Livan Arronte.\n\nHe also mentioned the existing agreements between the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources and the Saudi Fund for Development, from which a series of important projects have been implemented for Cuba’s benefit, he added.\n\nAccording to the diplomat, Saudi Arabia is immersed in an expansion towards new horizons, “based on its strengths, on its privileged strategic location, on a strong and solid economy and on its deep Arab and Islamic roots.”\n\nThe Saudi nation plays a leading role in stabilizing energy markets and leading the next green era through its (Green Saudi Arabia) and (Green Middle East) initiatives.\n\njg/leg/mks",
    "What's Driving The New Migrant Exodus From Cuba": "Then there is Mariupol, under siege and symbol of Putin’s cruelty. In the largest city on the Azov Sea, with a population of half a million people, Ukrainians make up slightly less than half of the city's population, and Mariupol's second-largest national ethnicity is Russians. As of 2001, when the last census was conducted, 89.5% of the city's population identified Russian as their mother tongue.\n\nThe martyrdom of Mariupol Between 2018 and 2019, I spent several months in Mariupol. It is a rugged but beautiful city dotted with Soviet-era architecture, featuring wide avenues and hillside parks, and an extensive industrial zone stretching along the shoreline. There was a vibrant youth culture and art scene, with students developing projects to turn their city into a regional cultural center with an international photography festival. There were also many offices of international NGOs and human rights organizations, a consequence of the fact that Mariupol was the last major city before entering the occupied zone of Donbas. Many natives of the contested regions of Luhansk and Donetsk had moved there, taking jobs in restaurants and hospitals. I had fond memories of the welcoming from locals who were quicker to smile than in some other parts of Ukraine. All of this is gone. Putin is bombing the very people he has claimed to want to rescue. According to the latest data from the local authorities, 80% of the port city has been destroyed by Russian bombs, artillery fire and missile attacks, with particularly egregious targeting of civilians, including a maternity hospital, a theater where more than 1,000 people had taken shelter and a school where some 400 others were hiding. The official civilian death toll of Mariupol is estimated at more than 3,000 . There are no language or ethnic-based statistics of the victims, but it’s likely the majority were Russian speakers. So let’s be clear, Putin is bombing the very people he has claimed to want to rescue. Putin’s Public Enemy No. 1, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is a mother-tongue Russian speaker who’d made a successful acting and comedy career in Russian-language broadcasting, having extensively toured Russian cities for years.\n\nRescuers carry a person injured during a shelling by Russian troops of Kharkiv, northeastern Ukraine. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Ukrinform via ZUMA Press Wire\n\nA bilingual nation Yes, the official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian, and a 2019 law aimed to ensure that it is used in public discourse, but no one has ever sought to abolish the Russian language in everyday life. In none of the cities that are now being bombed by the Russian army to supposedly liberate them has the Russian language been suppressed or have the Russian-speaking population been discriminated against. Sociologist Mikhail Mishchenko explains that studies have found that the vast majority of Ukrainians don’t consider language a political issue. For reasons of history, culture and the similarities of the two languages, Ukraine is effectively a bilingual nation. \"The overwhelming majority of the population speaks both languages, Russian and Ukrainian,” Mishchenko explains. “Those who say they understand Russian poorly and have difficulty communicating in it are just over 4% percent. Approximately the same number of people say the same about Ukrainian.” In general, there is no problem of communication and understanding. Often there will be conversations where one person speaks Ukrainian, and the other responds in Russian. Geographically, the Russian language is more dominant in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine, and Ukrainian in the west.\n\nA daughter of Kyiv Like most central Ukrainians I am perfectly bilingual: for me, Ukrainian and Russian are both native languages that I have used since childhood in Kyiv. My generation grew up on Russian rock, post-Soviet cinema, and translations of foreign literature into Russian. I communicate in Russian with my sister, and with my mother and daughter in Ukrainian. I write professionally in three languages: Ukrainian, Russian and English, and can also speak Polish, French, and a bit Japanese. My mother taught me that the more languages I know the more human I am. At the same time, I am not Russian — nor British or Polish. I am Ukrainian. Ours is a nation with a long history and culture of its own, which has always included a multi-ethnic population: Russians, Belarusians, Moldovans, Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Romanians, Hungarians, Poles, Jews, Greeks. We all, they all, have found our place on Ukrainian soil. We speak different languages, pray in different churches, we have different traditions, clothes, and cuisine. My mother taught me that the more languages I know the more human I am. Like in other countries, these differences have been the source of conflict in our past. But it is who we are and will always be, and real progress has been made over the past three decades to embrace our multitudes. Our Jewish, Russian-speaking president is the most visible proof of that — and is in fact part of what our soldiers are fighting for. Many in Moscow were convinced that Russian troops would be welcomed in Ukraine as liberating heroes by Russian speakers. Instead, young soldiers are forced to shoot at people who scream in their native language.\n\nStarving people ina street of Kharkiv in 1933, during the famine Diocesan Archive of Vienna (Diözesanarchiv Wien)/BA Innitzer",

    "Three Crises Merge in Cuba’s Economy: Causes & Risks": "From Progreso Weekly\n\nBy Julio Carranza (Progreso Weekly)\n\nHAVANA TIMES – What follows is a text trying to summarize, in a concrete way, the main factors that affect, characterize and challenge the Cuban economy at this time.\n\nFirstly, we must take into account that the economy has been in crisis mode for a long period of time with some intermittent but insufficient recoveries, which began in the 1990s — since the fall of the socialist camp and the disappearance of the USSR, plus the intensification of the U.S. blockade. It all gave rise to the obsolescence of the economic model that, without going into details and nuances now, was essentially inspired by the economies of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe that had been established during the first decades of institutionalization of the revolution, especially in the 70s and 80s. This stage, by the way, corresponded to the period of greatest growth and stability of the economy.\n\nPreviously we have tried to make a periodization of this long stage of crisis that has already lasted for more than three decades until reaching this last critical segment that begins in 2020, when the main economic indicators have once again fallen notably and the standard of living of the population has contracted perhaps as in no other previous period, including the special period of the 1990s. In this case with a different generation and under the leadership of a government that, for logical reasons, does not and could not have the influence, the historical authority and the leadership of the then-government.\n\nFactors affecting the current situation:\n\nThe intensification of the U.S. blockade that, after the important but very brief moment of notable improvement in relations with the U.S. during the end of the Barack Obama administration, has reached strong extremes under the delusional administration of Donald Trump and that, so far, has been essentially unchanged during the first two years of Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe impact of the global COVID 19 pandemic, which for more than two years has meant the almost total loss of income derived from tourism, and the commitment of important and very scarce resources to face its various internal consequences.\n\nThe extraordinary achievement during this period, perhaps the only significant one in this context, was by the Cuban scientific community that quickly and effectively obtained more than one vaccine to guarantee total coverage of the population is remarkable.\n\nThe weight of the external debt, time and time again partially renegotiated with Cuba’s main creditors (including China and Russia, with whom it was possible to suspend the payment of their service until 2027), but which continues to limit the country’s access to credit, trade, and international investment.\n\nThe deterioration of the international situation, impacted by the war in Ukraine, which, in economic terms, is characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the markets, as well as by a strong inflationary process worldwide.\n\nFinally, an essential factor of an internal nature is the late, slow and not sufficiently integrated economic reform that the national economy should have.\n\nIf the combination of the above factors is taken into account, it could be stated that the challenges and pressures have been enormous and the response has not been up to the task and with the certainty and agility required. Although the resistance capacity that the country has shown in the face of difficulties and aggression must be recognized, despite moments of increased social tension.\n\nThree crises at once\n\nTrying to dissect the current situation, it could be said that the national economy faces at least three crises that overlap and reinforce each other in the same time and space:\n\n1. The structural crisis of the economic model:\n\nAs we stated earlier, beyond the discussion of whether or not it was the best option, the reality is that for years the Cuban economy established a model for organizing the economy inspired by the socialist economies of Eastern Europe and accompanied by a process of integration in the economic space that they formed with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CAME).\n\nThe disappearance of that world and the closure of the economic space that had allowed Cuba to largely overcome the isolation imposed by the U.S. blockade, made evident from very early on in the 90s the need for a fundamental economic reform of the economy, not to abandon its socialist horizon, but to adapt it to the new and difficult international conditions. Contributing and discussing that necessary change is what motivated our book published in Havana in 1995, “Cuba: Restructuring the Economy: A Contribution to the Debate” (Carranza, Gutiérrez and Monreal). However, beyond specific changes, some of them certainly very important, up to now the model of organization of the national economy has not been restructured to the extent needed and with the necessary depth.\n\nAfter almost two decades of debates and above all the accumulation of evidence, the party congresses discussed and approved documents that opened the political space to advance in the necessary economic reform, mainly “The conceptualization of the economic model,” the “Guidelines” and finally the new Constitution of the Republic approved by the majority vote of the population. However, the measures for change were adopted slowly (if not late) and without sufficient comprehensiveness, which has delayed and continues to delay the articulation of the only strategic solution that, in our opinion, the Cuban socialist economy has in overcoming the immense challenges it faces and the enormous pressures that oppose it.\n\nEssential to the process is the integrating the different economic actors based on their various forms of ownership and management, a deep reform of the state company (leader of the system), reform of the agricultural production subsystem, modification of the relationship between planning and the market, move the economic model towards greater decentralization, construction of markets — including the means of production and monetary markets — with their corresponding regulations, an active monetary, exchange and fiscal policy economically based and rigorously implemented, a focused and effective social policy, an investment policy that respond to national priorities, etc. and everything in the right sequence.\n\nThe reform of the state company is a key point. Make changes, both in their internal organization (so that they better express the interests of their owner, which is the people), as well as the ways in which they relate to each other and to the rest of the economic actors, to create the conditions that allow them to raise their efficiency, which today, in general terms, is at clearly low levels.\n\nA more dynamic economy is needed with greater autonomy and in a competitive context and strong financial restrictions. The leadership of the state company in the national economy should not and cannot be established by “decree,” but rather the result of its scale, efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe proper operation of the markets, with the necessary regulations, including the money market, is impossible without a reformed state company that allows it to attend to them without causing strong distortions. The markets must integrate all the economic actors (state, cooperative and private, plus foreign investment companies), under the leadership of the state company, which must also respond to a more strategic and financial planning than traditional bureaucratic planning that has affected the socialist economies, the Cuban one included.\n\nThe macroeconomic crisis\n\nSecond, the precipitated macroeconomic crisis after 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic — in a two year period the economy contracted more than 13%, with a very slight recovery of 1.3% during the last year — imports were drastically and abruptly reduced, with which the scarcity of practically everything invaded the spaces of the national economy, generating multiple difficulties and growing discomfort in the population.\n\nAll marketing spaces have been characterized over the last two and a half years by a sustained shortage and permanent queues, more in those that offer products in national currency, but also in those that offer in MLC, the latter more difficult to understand since it is a segment that can finance itself and sustain the flow of foreign exchange that favors the economy. (In this sense, and as several economists have been proposing for some time, a greater liberalization of the wholesale and retail markets has recently been decided, a measure still to be implemented.)\n\nThe most evident expression of this dimension of the crisis is the galloping inflation and the monetary chaos that remains and grows in the country as a result of the contraction of the economy and also of the insufficiencies and inaccuracies with which the economic policy has been conducted during the last two and a half years, including how the so-called “monetary order” — started in January 2021 — was conceived and implemented.\n\nWe have expanded on the reasons for the impact of this on the growth of inflation in previous articles. The causes of inflation are not only in the economic and monetary policy, without a doubt there are also external factors, but the internal economic policy has fueled it notably.\n\nOn the one hand, the multiplication of business costs with the devaluation of the national currency from January 2021, and then, trying to compensate for the rise in prices with an excessive expansion of demand with the increase in various incomes and the distribution of “utilities” without the productive support and precise calculations that allow maintaining macroeconomic balances and keeping the fiscal deficit under control, essential factors for the stability and growth of any economy.\n\nThe strong expansion of demand in an economy such as Cuba’s, where the country’s industrial and productive base in general, including agriculture, is so affected, while still tied by clearly unjustified limitations (in addition to pressure from the blockade), makes the response to that monetary expansion not productive but inflationary, it does not exist, so that it can be quickly activated, what Keynesians called “multiplication factor”.\n\nHence the importance of the underestimated sequentiality and comprehensiveness of the reform. Before multiplying costs and expanding demand, conditions must be created for the recovery of supply via production with adequate progress in the comprehensive economic reform, including the consolidation of the different economic actors, including the emerging private sector of SMEs and cooperatives, as well as and essentially, we insist, the reform of the state company, also with a part of the available foreign exchange dedicated to maintain essential imports, especially medicines, food and certain means of production, even when this implies a reduction in the rate of investment in sectors such as tourism.\n\nIn other words, of course, the establishment of an integrated exchange market and monetary order must be a very important component of the reform, but not in any way, with any order, or at any time.\n\nAdded to the regulations are the recent measures for the establishment of a market for the purchase and sale of currencies, but it is being carried out again in a partial, limited and disintegrated manner, which has motivated a new spiral of growth in the price of foreign currency in the parallel market, with all its implications, among them the rise of inflation, which mainly affects the lower-income sectors, which in Cuba affects the largest sector of the population.\n\nIt should be noted that certain official prices (including fuel and other services and products offered in the state network) have maintained their level anchored in the exchange of 1 USD for 24 CUP, which was established in January 2021. However, due to the new official parallel rate OF 1 USD for 120 CUP, plus the informal one that is already around 150 CUP, it turns out that for holders of foreign currency or MLC (not the majority of the population that only receives national currency and therefore deals with low incomes), these products and services have, via the exchange rate, a comparatively low price (gasoline is a typical case), which causes significant losses to the state. It is the expression of the great distortion of the money market that this process has created.\n\nMonetary policy is a fundamental instrument of economic policy and also of social policy. It cannot be treated simply as a mechanism for “recovery” of foreign currency because these negative distortions are generated. Previously we had stated that the idea of ​​evaluating the possibility of investing a few million dollars to expand and bring the money market under control — of course there is not enough foreign currency — is not a minor matter. It is a fundamental factor in contributing to put the foreign exchange market and inflation under greater control — a fundamental social priority. It might even be possible to obtain international credits for this purpose. It is a subject as complex as it is essential, so a discussion about it with the corresponding specialists, calculating and reviewing the data, would be very convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, continuing to seek and apply various ways to alleviate the pressure of the external debt is also a factor of great importance, including the exchange of debt for investment, bond issuance, etc. Without payment guarantees there is no possibility of obtaining the resources that the country needs through credit and investment. This is a critical point.\n\nThe country’s economists have talked a lot, and rightly so, about the need for a more balanced investment policy adjusted to national priorities where the agricultural sector stands out for its role in guaranteeing the food security of the population, now notably affected.\n\nAccording to calculations made by economists, between 2 billion and 2.5 billion dollars of investment per year would be necessary to sustain a GDP growth rate of more than 5% per year. The current level is very far from that figure. This supposes greater incentives and policy updates for foreign investment, including aspects such as direct payment to workers hired by investors, etc. But to return to our essential point, an economic model that works in an integrated and efficient manner is also decisive in this matter, including the existence and functionality of structures such as financial services, insurance, post, connectivity. Do they exist? Yes. Do they work effectively? No.\n\nThe sectoral crisis\n\nAdded to the two previous dimensions of the crisis is the specific crisis in important sectors of the economy: mainly energy and agriculture.\n\nThe former is affected not only by prices and difficulties in accessing fuel, but also, and very importantly, by the lack of sufficient foresight in the maintenance cycles of the country’s main power plants, as well as in fuel tanks, which is the reason for constant breakages and accidents. Are they causes or risks?\n\nOf course, the lack of foreign currency and the blockade limits the proper maintenance and capital repairs, but it is a factor that the economy must have enough time and include in its strategic plans. There is not only an economic problem in this, there is also a national security problem.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that the insufficient progress in the installation of alternative energy sources that contribute to changing the national energy matrix. Cuba still has an immense space and conditions to advance in this field.\n\nOn the other hand, the crisis in the agricultural sector, which despite having benefited from a set of liberalizing measures has not yet had the strategic transformation it needs. That is, as we have stated on other occasions, what is needed is a profound change of the agricultural production subsystem as part of the general and comprehensive reform of the economy. “A group of measures” is not enough, no matter how positive they may be. The incentives, links and forms of management in the entire agricultural sector, from production and distribution to marketing and consumption, must be fully transformed.\n\nThe country cannot allow itself to have strong limitations in the supply of food and at the same time idle land and other lands with productivity levels far below those that could be obtained, even taking into account the strong limitations imposed by the blockade.\n\nMention should also be made here of the deterioration of the traditional sugar sector, whose current production levels are still insufficient even to cover national demand.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is imperative that the economic strategy and the economic policy respond to these three crises at the same time, with the integrality and the necessary sequence, without the solutions to the emergencies dismantling or hindering the strategic solution that is, I insist, in the integral and deep transformation of the organization of the economic model, preserving its character of justice and social inclusion, complex and difficult, yes, impossible, no. The future of the country is at stake. Time runs fast and is a critical variable.\n\n*Julio Carranza, PhD in Economic Sciences, is considered among the most lucid Cuban specialists.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times.",

    "‘Cuba Libre’: Keshet International Boards Ambitious Portuguese TV Drama About Che Guevara Follower Ana Maria Silva Pais": "EXCLUSIVE: Keshet International has secured rights to Cuba Libre, a buzzy drama about a follower of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara that’s being billed as one of Portugal’s most ambitious television series ever. The six-part biopic, based on the life of Ana Maria Silva Pais, will form part of KI’s slate at Mipcom Cannes next month.\n\nProduced by Hop! Films for Portugal’s public service broadcaster RTP, the drama follows newcomer Beatriz Godinho in the lead role of Annie, a young Portuguese woman joined the Cuban revolution and gave everything to Che Guevara. The show debuts on RTP tomorrow (September 21) and you can watch the trailer below, with English subtitles.\n\nPais, whose story is told against the backdrop of the Cold War, was the only daughter of the Director General of Portugal’s secret service, the PIDE. Considered a culture lover and legendary beauty, she often clashed with her family’s political opinions in a dictatorship-run Portugal and eventually escaped to Havana with her Swiss diplomat husband. There, she abandoned her life and joined the Cuban revolution, secretly falling in love with the storied Guevara along the way.\n\nJoining Godinho (O Sítio da Mulher Morta) in the biggest international cast ever assembled in a Portuguese drama are Adriano Luz (Mysteries of Lisbon, Night Train to Lisbon) and Margarida Marinho (Meu Amor, Low-Flying Aircraft), who play her parents Fernando and Nita, and French-German actor Pierre Kiwitt (Das Boot, Charité II) plays her husband Raymond. Most of the casting was done over Zoom during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHenrique Oliveira (1986, Vidago Palace), Hop!’s Managing Director, is producer, writer and director. “This has been something of a passion project for me, and it’s taken 20 years to bring Annie’s story to screen having first read about her in a newspaper article,” he said. “This series is quite probably the most ambitious period drama ever produced in Portugal – certainly in terms of its international cast – and I’m thrilled the team at Keshet International is representing it.”\n\nAnke Stoll, KI’s VP of Acquisitions and Co-productions, added: “This is an incredible true story of a woman who changed so many lives to follow her passion and strong political beliefs. The team at Hop! Films have done a fantastic job bringing her vibrant story to life for TV viewers.”\n\nSeveral companies are understood to have tracked the project but ultimately KI, which has sold several local language shows internationally, picked up the rights.\n\nKeren Shahar, KI’s COO and President of Distribution, said: “Adding this vibrant, colorful and authentic drama to our slate brings me joy. Not only is this a captivating watch, but I’m thrilled that we’re helping to bring Annie’s life story to global audiences. It’s fitting that more people will get to learn of her influential role in Cuba’s history.”\n\nOther shows on KI’s Mipcom slate include My Name is Reeva: I Was Murdered by Oscar Pistorius, Rabbit Films’ coming-of-age thriller Summer of Sorrow, which was selected for the 2022 MipTV Drama Showcase in April; Woodcut Media’s World’s Most Evil Killers and reality competition format The Perfect Dessert, which returns to Keshet 12 during the World Cup for a second season.",
    "Cuba: U.S. keeping the country on terrorism list is 'illegitimate' and 'immoral'": "Cuba’s deputy foreign minister accused the Biden administration of acting immorally, illegitimately and unfairly by keeping Cuba on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, claiming it has been a victim of state-sponsored terrorism by the United States for more than 60 years.\n\nCarlos Fernández de Cossio said in an interview with The Associated Press that maintaining Cuba on the State Department blacklist with North Korea, Iran and Syria is “an easy way to punish Cuba with the overall aim of trying to make Cuba what it is not — to make Cuba a failed state.”\n\n“The U.S. unfortunately pays no price for doing something that is illegitimate, unsustainable and immoral,” he said. “And even though, speaking with government officials, they find no reason why Cuba should be in the list, they claim that it is politically difficult for them.”\n\nCuba's director general of U.S. affairs, Carlos Fernández de Cossio, speaks in Havana on Jan. 12, 2021. Ramon Espinosa / AP file\n\nThe United States imposed an economic embargo on Cuba in 1960 following the revolution led by Fidel Castro and the nationalization of properties belonging to U.S. citizens and corporations.\n\nRemoving Cuba from the blacklist had been one of then-President Barack Obama’s main foreign policy achievements as he sought better relations with the Caribbean island, an effort endorsed by Biden as his vice president.\n\nDays before Biden was inaugurated as president, then-President Donald Trump’s administration redesignated Cuba as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” imposing new sanctions. During his campaign, Biden promised to renew relations with the communist-governed island, but he has made no move to do so.\n\nFernández said the “pretext” then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave was the presence in Cuba of representatives of Colombia’s last guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN. He said Cuba didn’t invite them but responded to a request from the Colombian government to host peace talks with the group in Havana.\n\nHe didn’t mention that Pompeo also cited Cuba’s continued harboring of U.S. fugitives and its support for Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as reasons.\n\nFernández said U.S. officials describing delisting as a “politically difficult” decision is “an immoral excuse, because as a result of this designation, the Cuban economy is suffering an additional pain on the one already imposed by the blockade.”\n\nHe explained that anyone engaging economically or financially with a country on the list faces the possibility of being punished by the United States, and that because of Cuba’s designation over 30 financial and banking institutions interrupted their relationships with the country.\n\n“There is huge economic pressure,” Fernandez said, explaining that for the past six years the country has had no sources of financing or development credit, and the U.S. has tried to deprive Cuba of fuel so it has to pay a 15-30% premium because of the risk that the few sellers take.\n\nThe country is also still suffering from the impact of Covid-19 and tourism, especially from Canada and the European Union, which is an important source of income, he said.\n\nNonetheless, the minister said Cuba hopes the economy will grow by 2.5% this year.\n\n“So the country has not collapsed,” he said, though there are serious difficulties in terms of electricity, power and fuel.\n\n“We think we could come out of it,” Fernández said. “We’ve done it in the past, but it’s going to take a lot of effort. It would be much easier if the entire blockade did not exist, or at least a few flexibilities were introduced, which the Biden administration has promised but has not introduced.”\n\nHe expressed hope that the Biden administration will “do the right thing” and lift the terrorism designation because “it’s totally unfair, it’s totally unjustified, and it’s totally immoral.”\n\n“There is no way to morally sustain or justify punishing several generations of Cubans, or the whole population of Cuba, for over six decades with the aim of making the country a failed state,” Fernández said.\n\nHe cited a State Department document from April 1960 that describes the aim of U.S. policy to depress Cuba’s standard of living, provoke hunger and despair, and force the population to rebel against the government.\n\nThe Cuban minister said the government had no answer as to why Biden didn’t follow Obama’s opening to Cuba.\n\n“The simple answer they give is Biden is not alone,” he said. “That, in my opinion, is an excuse for a way out.”\n\nFernández led the Cuban delegation to talks in Washington in April on migration that he said focused on reviving the 1994 agreement on the U.S. issuing 20,000 visas for Cubans every year. He said there was progress, and perhaps the target can be reached later this year.\n\nFernández said the mass exodus of Cubans this year is the result of “a perfect equation” — the U.S. not complying with the 20,000 visas per year since 2017 and people wanting to migrate, the incentive for people to migrate by irregular means including by using smugglers because close to 90% of Cubans who reach the U.S. are accepted, and the difficult economic situation in Cuba which the U.S. encourages.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

    "EXCLUSIVE Cuba seeks more electricity supply from Turkish powerships": "Companies S-Energy Co Ltd Follow\n\nHAVANA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Cuba, mired in an energy crisis that has brought frequent blackouts, is negotiating with a Turkish company to have it double the megawatts it currently produces for the country from shipboard generators just offshore, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nCuban officials are in talks with Karpowership, one of the world’s largest operators of floating power plants and part of the Turkey-based Karadeniz Holding, the sources said. The company already has five ships operating off Cuba with a capacity of around 250 megawatts (MW).\n\nThe Communist-run country needs to generate more than 3,000 MW to meet minimum demand and currently is producing between 2,000 MW and 2,500 MW.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe Cuban National Electric Union did not respond to a request for comment. Karadeniz declined to comment.\n\nThe sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations, said the talks centered on how to ensure lease payments from Cuba.\n\n\"The (U.S. trade) embargo makes Western financial transactions very difficult and Cuba is cash short and behind on payments with many suppliers and joint venture partners,” one source said.\n\nExperts say the Turkish company would need to add to its fleet off Cuba to produce the required amount of energy. Powerships carry their own generator fueled by oil or gas, anchor close to land and connect to the local electricity grid. They are leased by the host country.\n\nThe deal, if it moves forward, would provide quick and much-needed relief for the embattled Cuban government as power outages have spread across the island and increased in length.\n\nCuba is desperate for more electricity.\n\nThe energy crisis, with blackouts in 4 to 6-hour-blocks twice daily or more in most of the country, is perhaps the most painful symptom of a deeper financial crisis caused by external factors such as U.S. sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic and poor economic management.\n\nCubans are also living through food, medicine and fuel shortages, forcing them to wait in long lines for the basics.\n\nThere have been scattered, small protests this summer and U.S. authorities registered a record of more than 175,000 Cubans at the U.S.-Mexican border since October, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency statistics.\n\nCuban power plants are obsolete, averaging 35 years of age, with a backup system of hundreds of smaller generators at least 15 years old. Just 5% of power comes from alternative energy sources.\n\nThe government blames lack of funds for its inability to update its decrepit grid, and says breakdowns, not fuel shortages, are the main cause of blackouts.\n\nEnergy and Mining Minister Livan Arronte Cruz said last week that the country hoped to all but eliminate blackouts by the end of the year, in part by adding “531 megawatts to generating capacity through new investments,” a figure reduced to 450 MW by President Miguel Diaz-Canel at the weekend.\n\nOmar Ramirez Mendoza, deputy director of the state electricity monopoly, said on state-run TV that “240 MW {of the 450 MW} will come from mobile generation,” a euphemism used by officials to refer to the powerships and coinciding with the source accounts.\n\nThe remainder of the new capacity would come from upgrading existing facilities with the help of foreign partners in the Moa nickel region in eastern Cuba and at the Mariel Special Development Zone just west of Havana, Ramirez said.\n\nJorge Pinon, Senior Research Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute specializing in the Latin American region, said he believed the powerships would provide the \"mobile generation\" referred to by Ramirez, but wondered how the extra capacity would be financed “as the Cubans do not have any money.”\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marc Frank, additional reporting by Can Sezer in Istanbul, Editing by Dave Sherwood and Alistair Bell\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Cuba’s Family Code Referendum Is Sparking Deep Debates": "On September 25, Cuba will hold just its fourth national referendum since the 1959 Revolution. The vote, which will decide the fate of the government’s proposed New Family Code, is generating intense debate. Many voters will cast their ballots based not on the content of the Code, but rather their views on the government and the referendum process itself.\n\nAmid a severe economic downturn, much of the public is struggling to access medicine, electricity and even a basic diet. Meanwhile, the administration of President Miguel Díaz-Canel is scrambling to improve its international image even as it prosecutes a prolonged crackdown on civil society and political opposition. In the wake of the massive anti-government demonstrations of July 11, 2021, over 1,400 alleged participants have been arrested. All of this has precipitated a massive exodus; record numbers of Cubans are attempting to reach the U.S., Spain and other countries.\n\nMany opponents of the government say they will vote against the Family Code to deny the Díaz-Canel administration a victory that might improve its international image and distract from this backdrop of economic and social crisis. For its part, the government claims noble intentions with the referendum. In the last two referenda on modifications to the constitution, in 2018 and 2019, conservatives prevented marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights from being codified.\n\nNow, the Code would guarantee rights to marriage equality and surrogate pregnancies. It would also codify domestic violence penalties; extend labor rights to those who care full-time for children, the elderly, or people with disabilities; and allow for parental rights to be shared among extended and nontraditional family structures that could include grandparents, stepparents and surrogate mothers.\n\nThose in favor of the Code say it promotes equality by guaranteeing basic rights. Some opponents cite religious objections or discomfort with shifting gender roles or identities, while others are concerned about the Code’s language around child abuse and education. It would outlaw corporal punishment or “any other kind of violence, abuse or inappropriate forms of discipline.” It also includes a parental duty to educate children to respect authorities and “love of family,” “the homeland” and “its symbols.” It would also make it easier for anyone to report physical or verbal abuse of minors to law enforcement.\n\nSome fear the government will abuse these stipulations to separate dissidents from their children. The new Penal Code includes a similar stipulation, forbidding anyone from encouraging a minor “not to fulfill their duties related to respect for and love of the homeland.” The government has recently used such laws to incarcerate parents for attempting to homeschool their children.\n\nCritics of the referendum also say that in leaving this decision up to a popular vote, the legislature is abdicating its own responsibility to pass laws that guarantee rights, promote equality and protect minorities. This may serve two purposes, they say. First, if the Code is rejected, the government can simply “wash its hands” of gender and sexuality discrimination and ignore the issue. Second, the act of calling a referendum as opposed to simply passing legislation seems performative. After all, Cuban authorities recently approved the new Penal Code and Decree Law 370, which restricts freedom of expression, without referenda. Critics say the government chose to submit the Family Code to a vote only in order to boost the image of Cuba’s system of “democratic centralism.”\n\nThrough this system, the government has sponsored many rounds of discussions about the Code in workplace and local government councils. Officials say they take note of the points made in these discussions and elevate them up decision-making channels. The government has modified its proposal two dozen times, supposedly based on feedback from these discussions. However, there is little transparency in how these decisions are made, and there is no watchdog or auditing body to oversee them. Even so, the government has been praising this system of consultation in the media as its political leadership seeks to show “greater closeness to the people.”\n\nIf it passes, the Code will also allow the government to posture as aligned with the international left on gender and LGBTQ issues, even as it continues its crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression. For now, the international community continues to condemn the government’s prosecution and jailing of dissidents, some of them minors, since the July 11 demonstrations.\n\nThe Díaz-Canel administration seems bent on improving its reputation—but without softening its repression of political dissent. This may drive many voters who support much of the content of the Code to vote against it.\n\nTurnout is almost always high in Cuba, because authorities generally view abstention as subversive and can easily identify those who don’t vote. This is why most people who wish to protest a vote will turn in blank ballots instead of refusing to cast a ballot. Many others vote in line with the government to avoid the problems that come with being identified as a possible dissident.\n\nWhen the votes are tallied in the referendum on the Family Code, observers should keep in mind that the results will reflect much more than simply how people feel about its contents.\n\n—\n\nGarcía is head of monitoring, evaluation and impact at the Cuban independent media outlet El Toque and is communications lead at the Transparency and Accountability Initiative",

    "Cuba boosts cigar exports to facilitate recovery amid pandemic, sanctions": "Cuba continues to promote cigar exports for economic recovery as the country braves the headwinds from the ­COVID-19 pandemic and the US trade embargo.\n\n\n\nSituated on the outskirts of the Cuban capital city of Havana, the El Laguito cigar factory is well known for producing Cohiba cigars over the past five decades.\n\n\n\nThe factory, one of the five making cigars for exports in Havana, has some 250 workers, with 70 percent being women.\n\n\n\nAmong them is Nelsa ­Leonard, a 75-year-old roller, who started working at El Laguito in 1968.\n\n\n\nShe expects Cuban cigar production to help the Caribbean nation's economy recover amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\"These are the best cigars in the world and Cohiba is our top brand,\" she said. \"We are doing our best to sell as many Cuban cigars as possible to the world.\"\n\n\n\nOfficial data showed that in 2021, the Caribbean nation reported record sales of its hand-rolled cigars worth more than $507 million, as the tobacco industry is one of the four core sectors that contribute most to Cuba's GDP.\n\n\n\nOscar Rodriguez, director of El Laguito cigar factory, said that they are now making some 9,000 Cuban cigars a day.\n\n\n\n\"We continued to work ­despite the COVID-19 pandemic as this is a critical sector for the performance of the economy,\" he said. \"This factory is projected to deliver 2 million Cuban cigars by the end of the year.\"\n\n\n\nMoreover, \"incomes from Cuban cigar sales are redistributed to improve living conditions of people,\" female roller Marilyn Sanchez said. \"With that money, the government repairs hospitals and schools.\"\n\n\n\nThe upcoming Cuban tobacco harvest is scheduled to start in October 2022, said the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n\n\nIt came amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the intensification of the US trade embargo on the Caribbean nation.\n\n\n\nCuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez said that in the first 14 months of US President Joe Biden's administration, the embargo has caused Cuba economic losses of around $6.3 billion.\n\n\n\nFirst imposed in 1962, the embargo was tightened by Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, who imposed more than 240 sanctions against the island.\n\n\n\nThe US \"persists in ignoring the demands of the international community and has intensified the blockade to unprecedented levels,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe island's economy started to see a slight recovery during the first half of 2022.

    "The largest mass emigration in Cuba’s history continues": "A Cuban stands with his makeshift raft on a beach near Havana. ADALBERTO ROQUE (AFP)\n\nCuba’s latest migration crisis is breaking records. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports that in the last 11 months, nearly 180,000 Cubans crossed the US-Mexico border, and another 8,000 tried to make it to the United States by sea. In addition, the US Coast Guard reports that it intercepted 5,421 Cuban rafters trying to cross the Florida Straits since October 2021, and about 3,000 made it to US shores, numbers that exceed the total number of rafters detained in the last five years. The current Cuban exodus is unprecedented and far surpasses previous mass emigrations like the 1980 Mariel boatlift (125,000 people) and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis (35,000 people).\n\nThe Cuban sociologists and economists we interviewed all agree that the hemorrhaging will not be stanched anytime soon and may even worsen due to deteriorating living conditions and economic hardship in Cuba. They believe that the current crisis is structural and that it will take years of investment, financial aid and radical reforms for the country to recover, measures that the Cuban government may be reluctant to take.\n\nMore information The US embargo against Cuba turns 60 with no policy change on the horizon\n\nCuban and US news outlets publish daily reports of deportations, shipwrecks, human trafficking operations and harrowing accounts of the land and sea journeys made by these Cuban emigrants. Hundreds have been killed by the mafias that control illegal migration in Central America and Mexico, while others have drowned at sea or crossing the Rio Grande. But this hasn’t deterred the desperate people who continue to leave Cuba.\n\nThe US Embassy in Cuba recently announced that the US is increasing patrols and enforcement by land, air and sea, as well as a new “interagency task force responsible for deterring, preventing, and responding to illegal maritime migration under Operation Vigilant Sentry. The primary objectives of the task force are to prevent loss of life at sea and to deter and dissuade maritime migration using Department of Homeland Security forces.”\n\nCuban television reporters recently interviewed several rafters deported from the US, including a young woman with a small child, who told how they nearly died at sea. They vowed not to try and emigrate illegally again, sending a clear message of deterrence to viewers. But it is unlikely that this will resonate with the desperate, exhausted and disillusioned Cuban people.\n\nThe crisis led Cuba and the US to convene a “technical meeting” in Havana between the Cuban Border Guard and the US Coast Guard to “increase bilateral cooperation” in combatting irregular migration, human and drug trafficking, as well as maritime search and rescue.\n\nThe official Cuban communiqué about the meeting said it was fruitful and conducted “in a respectful and professional atmosphere… Both delegations noted the usefulness of these meetings and the importance of increased cooperation in this area,” and agreed to hold more technical meetings in the future. In April, Cuba and the US resumed bilateral talks on migration issues, the first high-level discussions since US President Joe Biden was elected. The meetings had been suspended during the Trump administration, which reversed the Obama-initiated rapprochement between the two countries.\n\nImmigration has always been a key issue in the turbulent US-Cuba bilateral relationship. Over the last 60 years, several mass emigrations have ratcheted up tensions between the two nations. Cuba has used emigration as an escape valve during times of economic and political crisis, and also to pressure the US. But the magnitude of the current exodus is unprecedented, and led to historic anti-government protests on July 11, 2021. That date established a before-and-after point in time for Cuba, and the emigration numbers speak for themselves.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020 (year ending on September 30), 14,000 Cubans illegally entered the US across the Mexican border. In FY 2021, this number increased to 39,300. As of August 2022, almost 180,000 migrants have entered the US across its southern border. If the current pace continues, US officials say FY 2022 could close with a record 200,000 irregular Cuban migrants. The US Coast Guard data on Cuban rafters is equally alarming. The number of Cubans intercepted at sea bounced around for years (1,468 in 2017; 259 in 2018; 313 in 2019; 49 in 2020; and 838 in 2021), but in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, US officials picked up 5,421 Cubans at sea.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most severe migration crisis since the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959. The problems in Cuba that are driving the exodus are equally severe and difficult to solve. There seems no end in sight for the widespread exhaustion and desperation of the Cuban people caused by economic hardship, draconian energy blackouts, runaway inflation, medicine and basic necessity shortages, and deteriorating health care services. Many young people feel that leaving is their only option for a better life, a scenario that will surely mortgage the country’s future.\n\nThe Biden administration does not want more irregular Cuban emigrants, and has recently launched several initiatives to resurrect the family reunification program and restore the consular services that Trump dismantled. But Cuban officials say that these measures are inadequate and accuse Washington of accelerating the flow of illegal emigrants by failing to comply with the bilateral agreement stipulating the granting of 20,000 visas annually to Cuban citizens. Cuba also says that the US has not complied with the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows Cubans to obtain permanent residency a year and a day after entering the country, even if they entered illegally. Lastly, Cuba continues to blame US economic sanctions for all its problems. While both governments remain mired in long-running disputes, Cubans continue to suffer and the exodus intensifies.",

About half of those being seen at the center are coming from Venezuela.\n\nThey are part of what U.S. Customs and Border Protection have called a \"new wave\" of migration. 157,921 people were encountered at borders nationwide last month, according to the agency — a 2.2% increase from the month before.\n\n\"Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,\" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said this week in a statement.\n\nHe added that \"those fleeing repressive regimes pose significant challenges for processing and removal.\"\n\nAt the center in El Paso, migrants are screened and vetted, and identified and classified, according U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Landon Hutchens.

    "Cuba Is an Island in Mourning": "By Fabiana del Valle\n\nHAVANA TIMES – It’s 7:30 AM and I was walking down the streets in my town to get to the bank. I guessed the electricity would be back on soon after a long night with a blackout, or maybe the bank would have fuel for their generator to switch on the building and tend to the population’s needs.\n\nAfter so many fruitless trips, I was ready to wait as long as it would take. Despite my optimism, the silent streets were a bad omen. I sat on a wall in front of the bank, and I could see the sun turning the buildings orange from there.\n\nOther people arrived, asked who was last in line, and said:\n\n“I already asked the guard and he told me that they don’t have fuel for the building’s generator. They asked the government, but they were told there wasn’t any.”\n\n“What do you mean they don’t have any? If there isn’t any, how come they’re still driving everywhere?”\n\n“Let’s see if the electricity comes back on, I couldn’t sleep last night. This is the fourth time I’ve come, and I haven’t been able to get what I needed done.”\n\nIt’s 8 AM and we all gather outside the door. The manager comes out sorry and explains the situation to us. There wasn’t any electricity and fuel for the back up generator ran out yesterday. We already knew that. But it did surprise us that the bank had also been offline for three days. The problem had been reported to the provincial office and they still hadn’t had a response.\n\nI started walking home.

    "Russian Airlines Set To Resume Flights To Cuba": "Several Russian airlines, such as Nordwind Airlines, are planning to resume their international connectivity to Cuba in October, despite the ongoing sanctions imposed by the European Union, which will impact the route Russian airlines must follow.\n\nComing back to Cuba\n\nThe Caribbean nation has always been a hot destination for Russian travelers. In January 2022, there were 17 weekly flights from Russia to Cuba, operated by four airlines (Aeroflot, Azur Air, Nordwind, and Royal Flight Airlines). Nonetheless, these commercial services were quickly scrapped in February following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions by the European Union which forbade Russian aircraft and airlines to fly through the EU’s airspace.\n\nThings are about to change, though. On October 1, Nordwind Airlines expects to resume its services to Varadero and Cayo Coco, according to local reports. Pegas Touristik, the Russian tour operator owner of the carrier, expects to open up to four flights per week on the route Moscow-Varadero, and three flights per week to Cayo Coco. Nordwind Airlines would use its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to operate these services.\n\nJuan Carlos Escalona, Cuba’s Tourism counselor in Russia, said that the Caribbean country is ready to receive back Russian tourists, and he expects more tour operators and airlines to follow the example of Pegas Touristik and Nordwind Airlines.\n\nNordwind expects to resume flights to Cuba in October. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nHow will Nordwind operate these routes?\n\nIn the past, Russian airlines could go through the European Union airspace en route to destinations in Latin America (in January, there were 45 weekly flights from Russia to this region). Nonetheless, the sanctions have made it impossible for Russian carriers to employ the EU’s airspace, except for unique one-time-only exceptions, such as the two Volga Dnepr Ilyushin IL-765D-90VDs that have been recently flying between Russia and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn August, Nordwind operated several flights between Moscow and Caracas. This is the route the flight followed. Photo: FlightRadar24.com.\n\nNordwind will have to employ a different path to get to Cuba. We have an idea of what that will look like. Between August 5 and 11, Nordwind operated three flights between Moscow Vnukovo Airport (VKO) and Caracas Simon Bolivar International (CCS). The airline employed a Boeing 777-300ER, registration RA-73342, for these services.\n\nTo operate these services, the crew flew north from Moscow into the Barents Sea, avoiding the airspace of countries such as Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Then it went west through the Norwegian Sea before going south between Greenland and Iceland and flying through the Atlantic Ocean without entering the Canadian and US airspaces.\n\nThe return flight from Caracas to Moscow followed almost the exact same path, except it now went east from Iceland instead of west. The average flight times for both flights were 13:00 and 12:10 hours, respectively.\n\nMore airlines coming?\n\nIn a statement, Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) said that several Russian airlines plan to resume flights to Cuba in the short term.

    "Humanitarian Crisis In Cuba: One Year On From The Anti-Government Protest": "In early July, 2021, thousands of Cubans took the streets in protest against the authoritarian Cuban government which was failing to not only combat the ongoing Covid pandemic, but also address the growing food shortages and severe blackouts plaguing the island country. Now a year later, trials for the 1,400 arrested and the ongoing fallout from the protests have raised concerns over human rights violations throughout the international community. Much of the concerns have centered specifically around the treatment of La Güinera, a poor and predominantly black neighborhood outside of Havana. Of the 700 who were given prison sentences, 100 were just from this neighborhood alone and the one casualty of the protests was a black man shot by the authorities in La Güinera.\n\nPrison sentences have been as high as 25 years ranging anywhere from accusations of vandalism to outright sedition. In an article by the BBC, a father of one of the convicted protesters spoke out about the severe injustice of many of the trials. His son, 22 and from La Güinera, has learning difficulties but was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 12 years of prison time, only allowing government witnesses to be used in the trial. Other instances included even false identification of protestors from obscured footage and trying large groups of people together at the same time. Even before the trials themselves, according to a report published by the Human Rights Watch, there have been instances of arbitrary detentions, abuse during prosecution, and even torture. Many in Cuba as well as the international community believe that the Cuban government is purposefully making an example out of La Güinera in order to discourage any other future uprisings.\n\nLeonardo Fernández, an arrested protester from another part of Cuba told the BBC, “It’s sad to see 20-year prison terms being handed down to 19-year-old kids. There are cases in which the sentences exceed the length of the convicted person’s life. It’s a human tragedy, and one which the international community needs to sit up and take notice of.” As the Cuban government prosecutes those who protested last July, it has ignored the reasons why the protest happened in the first place. The economic crisis has only worsened and now many have chosen to flee the island. According to the New York Times, migration from Cuba to the U.S. has reached its highest level in four decades. A longtime Cuban dissident told the New York Times, “Here, whoever doesn’t leave, it’s because they can’t.”\n\nAs human rights abuses continue to be committed in Cuba, the international community must take action to not only denounce and punish the actions of the Cuban government but to also provide critical aid to those who are fleeing. Between just this past January and May, more than 118,000 Cubans were detained in the U.S. compared to the 17,400 for the same time period last year. As the number of those who are detained rises, so does the overall number of people who are risking their lives in attempts to flee to the U.S. Action must be taken by the U.S. government in order to show its allegiance to the humanitarian plights of the Cuban people. This can be done through politics as well as further trade restrictions with Cuba. As for the refugee crisis, similar measures to those taken for Afghanistan and Ukraine should be applied to Cuba. As a close neighbor to the U.S. and as a country which has also had a complex relationship with the U.S., humanitarian aid measures should also be the same.\n\nSince the Cuban Revolution from 1953-1959 where the communist party of Cuba came to power, migration between Cuba and the United States has increased. The rise of Communism so close to U.S. shores sent a panic through the American government and people as the Cold War began. U.S. meddling during the Cuban revolution also put a strain on U.S.-Cuban relations. This gave birth to many of the policies with Cuba which still exist today, including the U.S. embargo. Harsh isolation of the Cuban economy wreaked irreparable damage to the country as a whole which has lasted into today. Though it was not the only factor, the U.S. did play a hand in Cuba’s current state.\n\nTherefore it is in fact in part the United States’ responsibility to provide aid to the Cuban people. As the humanitarian crisis escalates in Cuba, similar approaches should be taken by the United States and other global powers to the international responses to both Afghanistan and Ukraine.",
    "WOLA Event: A Compounding Crisis in Cuba": "Join the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) and the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) for a discussion on the current crisis in Cuba\n\nAlthough Cuba’s government has sought to spur economic growth in recent years by shrinking the state sector, encouraging greater foreign investment, and expanding the private sector, the sluggish implementation and counterproductive nature of these measures and the ongoing crisis has enacted a deep toll on the quality of life of the Cuban people. Some of the economic measures aimed at the long-term improvement of the Cuban economy have had a dire impact on the ability of Cuban families to survive. In practice, the crisis has meant that Cubans are forced to endure hours-long energy blackouts and stagnated incomes, extreme inflation, and a lack of basic goods and services. The goods that are available on the shelves are often more expensive or in hard-to-obtain currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Lower-income families and Afro-Cubans bear the brunt of this as not all have equal access to foreign currency from abroad. Remittances are one of the top sources for Cuba’s hard currency and play a major role in the ability of many Cuban families and the private sector to survive the ongoing economic crisis on the island. As the Biden administration continues to hold back specifics on how its recent measures will successfully be implemented, Cuban-Americans and others continue to struggle to support their loved ones on the island.\n\nCuba’s economic crisis—defined by extreme inflation, a shrinking GDP, the accumulation of social debts, goods shortages, high external dependency, and weak economic growth—leaves many questions about the island’s economic development and its future overall.\n\nOn Friday, September 9, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. EST, join the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) for a discussion with experts on the current state of Cuba’s crisis, how it differs from the special period in the 90s, and the island’s future overall. A Compounding Crisis: Domestic Shortcomings, U.S. policies, and the Impact on Everyday Cubans will explore weaknesses within Cuba’s economic model, recently announced economic reforms, the role of remittances and the Cuban diaspora, and how U.S. sanctions disproportionately impact Cuban families and the private sector while having relatively unchanged levels of impact on the state economy.\n\nREGISTER ON ZOOM\n\nEvent Details:\n\nFriday, September 9, 2022\n\n10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. EST\n\nPanelists:\n\nOscar Fernández\n\nCuban Economist and Entrepreneur\n\nAnamary Maqueira\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Economics at\n\nthe University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nDenisse Delgado\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Public Policy\n\nat the University of Massachusetts, Boston\n\nModerator:\n\nRicardo Torres\n\nResearch Fellow at the Center for Latin American\n\nand Latino Studies at American University\n\nThis event will be livestreamed via WOLA’s YouTube page."
