    "Shadow minister’s border poll remarks alarm Northern Ireland’s unionists": "Northern Ireland unionists have expressed alarm after the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would be prepared to call a referendum on Irish unity if certain conditions were met.\n\nKyle would set out the criteria for calling a border poll if Labour were in power, he told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show at his party’s conference.\n\n“If the circumstances emerge as set out in the Good Friday agreement, I as secretary of state, would not play games. I would call the border poll,” he said. “I am saying I am not going to be a barrier if the circumstances emerge.”\n\nUnder the 1998 agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would want the region to leave the UK – but the agreement does not specify the criteria, a vagueness that the UK government and unionists have been keen to maintain.\n\nThe Irish government, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) have pushed for clarity on the criteria, which would lay out the steps needed for a vote that could abolish the state of Northern Ireland and unify the island.\n\nKyle said Sinn Féin’s emergence as the biggest party in Northern Ireland and last week’s census results, which showed Catholics outnumbering Protestants, did not suffice. “We’re not even in that circumstance yet, so when we move towards the point where those circumstances set out in the Good Friday agreement start to emerge and it becomes a priority for the people of Northern Ireland, I will act,” he said.\n\nOn Monday the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, criticised the comments as an “unhelpful and ill-timed” distraction from the cost of living crisis and other problems facing Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pro-union Belfast News Letter newspaper said the Labour politician had muddied the waters on a border poll and that it was essential any UK government kept wide discretion. It said: “It is unfortunate that Mr Kyle has chosen this time to give succour to those who want to shatter the UK.”\n\nThe Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard welcomed Kyle’s comments as recognition that the current position was “unsustainable”. “It’s having your head in the sand simply to deny the fact that constitutional change is coming, that people are talking about this, civic society and political parties and all around us,” the South Down MP said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland: Ryan Christie's late penalty gives hosts crucial win": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nRyan Christie scoring his late penalty for Scotland\n\nScotland need a point away to Ukraine on Tuesday to win Nations League Group B1 after a dogged comeback victory over the Republic of Ireland at Hampden.\n\nJohn Egan volleyed Ireland ahead early on, but Jack Hendry's header levelled.\n\nBoth sides spurned big chances before Alan Browne was penalised for handball and Ryan Christie stroked home the penalty winner eight minutes from time.\n\nThat puts Steve Clarke's side two points clear of Ukraine, who briefly went top with a 5-0 win in Armenia.\n\nHowever, Scotland head into their final group game in Krakow, Poland, with more injury worries after full-backs Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey were both forced off, while a late yellow card for Scott McTominay rules the midfielder out through suspension.\n\nIreland, meanwhile, can now finish no higher than third in the group.\n\nScotland were buoyed by Wednesday's 3-0 win over Ukraine at Hampden. But with that dominant performance came expectation they would simply roll over an Irish side who three months earlier had handed them a chastening 3-0 defeat.\n\nAnd a loud and confident Hampden was silenced when Troy Parrott slalomed through the Scotland defence and hammered the ball high into the net. The assistant referee's flag cut short the celebrations, but Ireland were again threatening to spring a shock.\n\nSoon the visitors broke on the counter-attack and got two v two. Hendry blocked Parrott's effort, but it only delayed the opener.\n\nSet-plays had been Scotland's downfall in Dublin and the frailty resurfaced. They struggled to clear a corner, the ball fell to Egan who lashed the ball through a ruck of bodies and past Craig Gordon.\n\nClarke's men had fallen apart in Dublin, but this time they responded strongly. The ball wouldn't fall for Stuart Armstrong and Lyndon Dykes in the box, while John McGinn mis-hit a shot wide, but the anticipation around Hampden was rising as the home side continued to pour forward.\n\nAnd four minutes into the second half Scotland were level. Matt Doherty allowed Christie to breeze past him all too easily, and Hendry met his delivery to guide a header into the far corner via the post.\n\nDoherty could have made amends at the other end when Greg Taylor was caught in possession, but he curled wide. Scotland's McGinn thumped past the post too as the game promised another goal.\n\nAnd that should have arrived when Ireland pulled the hosts apart. From Scotland's corner, Callum McGregor coughed up possession, the Irish broke two on one, Michael Obafemi laid the ball into the path of Parrott who saw the whites of Gordon's eyes but shot straight at him.\n\nThen a Gordon clearance bounced off Chiedozie Ogbene but back into the hands of the grateful goalkeeper. It was all Scotland possession, but Ireland were the ones passing up the chances.\n\nThe momentum shifted again in Scotland's favour. Ryan Fraser had a shot tipped over and Doherty defended brilliantly to head the ball away from McTominay.\n\nJust as Scotland's frustration grew as the winner looked to elude them, they were gifted a penalty when the hand of Browne diverted the ball from McTominay's path in the box.\n\nAfter a video assistant referee check, Christie slotted the penalty down the middle to bring Hampden to its feet. Ireland threw everything at Scotland in an attempt to find an equaliser but found a defence just as desperate to hold on.\n\nMan of the match - Jack Hendry\n\nHis defensive performance alone was enough to win the award, but he capped it with the equaliser to get Scotland back into the match\n\nDogged Scotland find a way - analysis\n\nIt was not the same flowing football from Wednesday, but the 90 minutes was just as pulsating as Scotland made it three straight wins.\n\nScotland's joy against Ukraine had come from their marauding full-backs and clever movement up front.\n\nTactically, though, Ireland were smart. Their two strikers pinned Scotland's wide players back, they defended their corners where Scotland had late joy in midweek. And despite Scotland having the lion's share of possession the Irish repeatedly found opportunities of their own.\n\nIt was a match that could have gone either way, but a penalty settled it.\n\nScotland did not have it all their own way as they did on Wednesday, but the confidence will be sky high before their rematch with Ukraine on Tuesday where Nations League promotion and a Euro 2024 play-off place are at stake.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGroup B1 concludes on Tuesday, as Scotland take on Ukraine in Krakow, Poland (19:45 BST) and Republic of Ireland host Armenia at the same time.\n\n'Mentality doesn't change for Ukraine game' - Clarke\n\nMatch stats\n\nScotland are unbeaten in all eight of their home games in the Nations League (W7 D1) - no team has played more at home without ever losing in the competition (Italy also 8).\n\nRepublic of Ireland are winless in all seven of their away games in the competition (D2 L5), losing each of the last four.\n\nBoth teams scored with their first shots on target - for Scotland it was just the second time they'd conceded first in a home game in the Nations League (also v Israel in 2018), while it was the first time Ireland had scored first in an away game in the competition.\n\nIn his 33rd appearance for Scotland, Ryan Christie both scored and assisted a goal in the same game for the first time at international level.\n\nJack Hendry completed all 60 of his passes - the most a player has made while maintaining a 100% pass accuracy in this edition of the Nations League.\n\nJohn McGinn has created more chances (12) and had more shots (19) than any other Scotland player at this edition of the Nations League, with the midfielder having a further three of each against Ireland.",

And fittingly the 30-year-old was joined on the Late Late Show by legendary runner O'Sullivan to reflect on her stellar season.\n\nRead next: \"I know I am clean...\" - Ciara Mageean hits back at critics\n\nMageean received plenty of praise on social media for her appearance on the show, with people championing her as a brilliant role model for young women in sport.\n\nOne person said: \"You’d run a long way to find a better role model for your daughters than Ciara Mageean.\"\n\nThe Co Down athlete also told of her dream of hearing Ireland's national anthem playing as she competed and won medals and spoke about how she believed in the modern day Northern Ireland and winning Commonwealth Games silver.\n\n(Image: INPHO/Morgan Treacy)\n\nWhen asked about representing both nations, the Portaferry woman replied: \"It is something that I'm proud of to be able to go out and race for Ireland year in year out but I get the opportunity to race for Northern Ireland once every four years.

Defeat in their opening two games in Armenia and at home to Ukraine put paid to that ambition, and although victory over Scotland and a point in the return against the Ukrainians suggested there may be better to come, Saturday’s 2-1 defeat in Glasgow means relegation is a possibility – they will kick off a point ahead of Armenia – heading into the final round of fixtures.\n\nKenny under the cosh\n\nRepublic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny finds himself under pressure once again (Niall Carson/PA) (PA Wire)\n\nKenny’s appointment as Mick McCarthy’s successor did not meet universal approval and while he has blooded a new generation of senior international players and adopted a more progressive approach than some of his predecessors, the improvement he is confident his side has made has not necessarily been reflected by results. His 27 matches to date have yielded just six wins and only three in 20 competitive outings, and that is a stick with which his critics continue to beat him ahead of a game he cannot afford to lose.\n\nTried and tested\n\nRepublic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny (left) left skipper Seamus Coleman (right) out of the starting XI in Scotland (John Walton/PA) (PA Archive)\n\nThe Ireland boss insisted before the trip to Hampden Park that he would not be afraid to leave out senior men Seamus Coleman and Shane Duffy because of their lack of club football, and he was as good as his word with neither man making the starting XI in Glasgow. Both skipper Coleman and central defender Duffy have produced time and again for their country over the years and it would be no surprise if Kenny turned to his old dependables in the Republic’s hour of need.\n\nLeading from the front\n\nThere was a moment in the Scotland game when, with Jack Hendry having cancelled out John Egan’s opener, Troy Parrott found himself through on goal with a chance to restore Ireland’s lead, but could not find a way past keeper Craig Gordon. Parrott, along with Callum Robinson, Chiedozie Ogbene and Michael Obafemi, are among a pool of strikers who have all scored for their country under Kenny, but the fact remains that only Robinson, with six, has found the back of the net more often during his reign than four-goal defender Duffy.\n\nYips in Yerevan\n\nThe seeds of Ireland’s current predicament were sown in Yerevan’s Republic Stadium on June 4, when Eduard Spertsyan’s long-range strike handed the hosts a famous 1-0 victory. The visitors huffed and puffed on the night before running out of steam in sweltering temperatures, and they will need to be significantly better in Dublin if they are to avenge that defeat and end the campaign on a positive note.",
    "Conor McMenamin: Northern Ireland winger cleared over historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan": "Conor McMenamin has been cleared to play in Northern Ireland's Nations League match against Greece on Tuesday as he will face no further action regarding a historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while an independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nImage: McMenamin (right) has played three times for Northern Ireland\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will give him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad. It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's a historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"\n\nAhead of Tuesday's match against Greece, Baraclough said on Monday it had been the right decision to keep McMenamin out of the Kosovo game, but that he was delighted to have him available again.\n\n\"I don't think we could take any chances as an association in light of what had happened a couple of days previously with Kyle (Lafferty),\" he said. \"The decision was taken, we see where it went, the disciplinary committee looked at that and now he is free to be with us tomorrow night which is good news.\n\n\"We couldn't be sure until we looked into it and that's what's been done. I think that was right. It was hard telling the lad, hard to give him the information and to deny him being with the squad and possibly making another cap but it was the right thing to be done.\"\n\nImage: Kyle Lafferty was sent home from Northern Ireland duty amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language\n\nLafferty was sent home from the squad on Friday after a video emerged of him appearing to use an alleged sectarian slur in an altercation with fans, sparking an investigation from his club Kilmarnock. The 35-year-old remains absent with that investigation ongoing.\n\nBaraclough confirmed the incident was believed to have happened after he had taken the players out for dinner last Tuesday evening as part of a team-bonding exercise, but said he had no regrets about doing so.\n\n\"We all went out, we all went to the restaurant and we all came back,\" he said. \"The players had a day off the next day, they're adults and they know they've got a responsibility. When they're away on international duty they're representing themselves, their clubs, their families and me.\n\n\"We can't keep them cooped up in a hotel, we've got to give them a certain amount of trust and hope that's the right thing to do.\n\n\"It might be something we have to look at but it's always served Northern Ireland teams well when we've had that time together. It was something we weren't expecting, to wake up to those sorts of headlines and that sort of news. It was disappointing.\"",

    "Ben Collins – Unionists are already having conversations about a united Ireland": "Ben Collins's new book Irish Unity – Time to Prepare\n\nFor me the Good Friday Agreement was an amazing achievement. It brought to an end the Troubles and secured the peace, however imperfect, which we now enjoy. On a personal level it also enabled me to think about my own sense of identity and how I wanted to see Northern Ireland develop. It allowed me to think about a united Ireland and whether I wanted there to be one, in a way which had not been possible before. Until that point I was determined that I was not going to be forced into a united Ireland through violence or the threats of violence.\n\nI had been a student in Dundee while the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated and returned to Belfast just after the referendum had passed. There was a sense of hope that Northern Ireland could become an economic powerhouse. We are still waiting for that to happen. After the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2001 I returned to Scotland. I had joined the Conservatives just before I moved because I believed in enterprise and was keen to get involved with bread and butter politics. While I had hoped and expected that Ken Clarke would become leader and take the party in a more liberal and pro-European direction, the opposite happened. I was alarmed at their increasing hostility towards Europe. At the same time I heard the SNP talk about fiscal autonomy which really appealed to me. I left the Conservative party after two years.\n\nBeing away from Northern Ireland I was able to embrace my growing sense of Irishness and desire for Irish unity. The beauty of the Good Friday Agreement was that you could be Irish, British, European or all three. Borders were increasingly irrelevant until the EU referendum. While I realised that the vote would be a lot closer than people originally thought, I was genuinely shocked when the UK, or more specifically England and Wales voted for Brexit.\n\nWhile Irish unity had been a long term aspiration of mine, it became an urgent necessity for me after the vote for Brexit. The six years since the vote have been distressing and unsettling in many ways. Members of my own immediate family and close friends voted for Brexit. I do not think that anyone is happy with how it has turned out. My sense of Britishness had dissipated over time and seeing elderly men in Sunderland celebrating the vote to leave the European Union struck me as such an alien idea.\n\nThe idea to write a book on Irish unity came to me in July 2012 just before the London Olympics. I could tell that politics across the UK was changing when the Scottish referendum was called. The UK government intended to win by a clear two to one margin to put the issue to rest for a generation, but the final vote was much closer. It was only after the Brexit vote that I decided to focus seriously on setting out my thoughts on how we could achieve a New Ireland.\n\nI know that Irish unity has been an aspirational ideal for many people for a long time. But when you consider the damage which is being done to the island of Ireland by Brexit, there is now a hard-headed rationale for planning and preparing now.\n\nLike several thousand other people I will be travelling to Dublin on Saturday to attend the Ireland’s Future event ‘Together We Can’ in the 3Arena and I look forward to speaking at it. While political unionism rarely engages in the debate on Irish unity, I know from personal experience that people from unionist backgrounds are already taking part in this conversation. It may not often be happening out in the open, but these discussions are taking place. Often these private chats will cover the same points, Brexit is a disaster, Westminster is dysfunctional and political unionism is completely out of touch. People are open to a different future but they want to know what this will involve and what will it mean for them and their families. In a very small way I hope to add to this conversation with my book ‘Irish Unity: Time to Prepare’ and play my part in helping us to plan and prepare in advance of the border poll which I think is likely at some point over the next decade. I believe that we can win that vote and it will be a success if we have a plan in place beforehand.\n\n:: 'Irish Unity: Time to Prepare' by Ben Collins is published by Luath Press and will be launched at Belfast's Linen Hall Library on Thursday October 6.",

Moloney Investments will have the opportunity to benefit from Kingswood's in-house investment proposition, and Kingswood's clients will conversely benefit from insurance product distribution.\n\nFounded in 1993, Moloney Investments posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of €4mn (£3.6mn) at the end of April.\n\nPost-acquisition, Moloney Investments will continue to operate from its existing premises and be led by the same team which have served its clients since the firm’s inception.\n\n“MMPI [Moloney Investments] provides access to the attractive Irish wealth management market whilst also offering multiple new avenues for growth,” said Kingswood’s chief executive, David Lawrence, today (September 26).\n\n“Bryan Moloney and his senior team have done an exceptional job building MMPI into a successful, scaled, and differentiated financial advisory group with a reputation for exceptional client service.”\n\nLawrence also confirmed in addition to its first Irish market purchase, Kingswood has a “strong pipeline of activity with a further eight potential acquisitions in exclusive due diligence”.\n\nruby.hinchliffe@ft.com",
    "Financial support package announced for GPs in Northern Ireland": "A £5.5m package of support measures has been announced to help ease the pressures facing general practice in Northern Ireland.\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said £1m of the funding would go to a new Attract, Recruit, Retain scheme to help attract GPs in hard-to-recruit areas.\n\nThere is also £680,000 to boost the support team for GP practices who are experiencing difficulties, he said.\n\nAnd it includes £3m to support practices across Northern Ireland through the winter to resource additional in-hours and out of hours sessions.\n\nMr Swann also committed to progressing work to address the ongoing issue of GP indemnity, where Northern Ireland has differed from the rest of the UK on agreeing a state-backed system, with a full plan expected in November.\n\n‘The pressures in primary care services are caused in large part by historic underinvestment over a number of years which has left the system struggling to meet ever-growing demand,’ he said.\n\n‘My department is taking action to address the root causes of these issues in service.\n\n‘This includes increasing the number of GP training places in Northern Ireland to an all-time high of 121 and providing an additional £1.5m investment to support continued staff recruitment to the MDT model.’\n\nBut he added the package announced today would help strengthen GP services through the winter period and provide targeted help to those practices that are most at risk.\n\nCommenting on the additional funding for general practice, BMA NI GP committee chair Dr Alan Stout said the announcement was welcome and it was clear the minister understood the problems general practice was facing.\n\nBut he added that ‘unfortunately it will not be a solution to the problems many practices are experiencing right now’.\n\n‘The Attract, Recruit, Retain scheme may help practices recruit new GPs but with a well-documented ageing workforce, and with a quarter of our GPs over the age of 55, we need to ensure that we retain GPs as well in order to stabilise and grow general practice.\n\n‘MDTs have helped many practices and patients but we really need to see it rolled out right across Northern Ireland so there is parity for all patients.’\n\nHe added they had raised issues with indemnity with the minister and Department of Health many times and it is good to see that recognised.\n\n‘Finally, meaningful change will require proper planning and this will require not only a budget for this year, but also a multiyear budget. This requires an executive and strong political leadership. We will continue to see deterioration of our NHS until this happens.’",
    "Scotland U21 1-1 Northern Ireland U21: Flynn Clarke's debut goal not enough": "Last updated on .From the section Scotland\n\nClarke opened the scoring after only three minutes\n\nNorwich City winger Flynn Clarke scored on his Scotland Under-21 debut as Northern Ireland fought back to draw in a friendly in Paisley.\n\nClarke's third-minute strike gave Scot Gemmell's side the perfect start, slotting between goalkeeper and club-mate Dylan Berry's legs after Lucas de Bolle played him through.\n\nHowever, it was cancelled out when Nottingham Forest striker Dale Taylor swept in a cross from the left to equalise for the visitors after 17 minutes.\n\nThe draw followed a 3-1 victory for the Scots in Belfast on Thursday, when 16-year-old Liverpool winger Ben Doak scored his first at this level.\n\nWith a fresh cycle of players stepping into the set-up, Gemmell was able to hand four debuts in the starting 11 alone, with Alloa Athletic goalkeeper Jay Hogarth, Coventry City left-back Josh Reid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Matthew Craig also all coming in.\n\nBut it was Clarke who made an instant impression after Hamilton Academical midfielder De Bolle weighted his ball through beautifully and the 19-year-old provided an impressive finish.\n\nTaylor had already forced Hogarth to make himself big to save before the 18-year-old already capped by Northern Ireland's senior side levelled the game.\n\nDriving down the left, Chris McKee, the former Rangers forward now at Linfield, held off a couple of challenges, crossed low to find Taylor and the striker's first-time shot nestled in the net.\n\nThe Northern Ireland striker was a menace all afternoon and another shot rippled the side netting, while De Bolle drilled just wide from the edge of the area at the other end.\n\nSubstitute Doak's pace created Scotland's best chance of the second-half for Tommy Conway, but Berry showed good instincts to turn it behind before saving from Josh Mulligan's header from the resulting corner.",

U.S. President Joe Biden has warned against disrupting peace in Northern Ireland, and the two leaders discussed the issue at their first in-person meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"What's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland,\" Truss said Sunday.\n\nTruss is also facing rising tensions from Commonwealth nations around the globe following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, which has reignited debates over whether the nations should sever ties with the British monarchy.\n\nTruss said she has seen an \"outpouring of love and affection\" for the late Queen, and she is very supportive of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"I think the Commonwealth is a force for good,\" she said. \"It's a believer in freedom and democracy, and we need more of that in a world where we are facing these authoritarian regimes who want to subvert those ideas.\"",
    "Emerging Ireland Squad: Meet the Players": "The Emerging Ireland squad that will compete in the Toyota Challenge in Bloemfontein over the next two weeks features a host of players that have starred for Ireland at underage level and on the world stage for the Ireland Sevens. Fourteen were part of the IRFU’s National Talent Squad programme and the majority have already made a breakthrough at senior level for their Provinces.\n\nThe Capped Players\n\nMax Deegan was named Player of the Tournament after helping the Ireland U20s to the final of the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championships. He was capped by Ireland against Wales in the 2020 Six Nations Championships and despite some serious injury setbacks, has amassed 85 senior caps for Leinster.\n\nShane Daly has two caps for Ireland, making his senior debut against Georgia in the 2020 Autumn Nations Cup.

He played for the Ireland U20s in 2020 and has made 32 senior appearances for Connacht.\n\nJoe McCarthy also played in both fixtures against the Maori All Blacks on the 2022 New Zealand Tour and played Ireland U20s with Prendergast in 2020. The second row has made 13 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nThe Development Brief\n\nBoth Tom Ahern and Jamie Osborne trained with the Ireland squad as Development Players ahead of the 2021 Autumn Nations Series. Ahern was an Ireland U20 international in 2019 and 2020 missing the Grand Slam campaign through injury. He has made 21 senior appearances for Munster\n\nOsborne represented the Ireland U20s in 2021 but had already made his senior Leinster debut at that stage. He has made 20 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nProven Provincials\n\nStewart Moore, Calvin Nash and Diarmuid Barron have all established themselves as senior Provincial players. All three represented Ireland at U20 World Rugby Championships.\n\nSince making his senior debut for Ulster in December 2019, Moore has accumulated 32 senior appearances.

    "Drinking Water Quality remains high across Northern Ireland": "The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), which is responsible for regulating drinking water quality, has today published its Annual Report for 2021. It states that drinking water quality in Northern Ireland is of a high standard.\n\nNorthern Ireland Water Limited (NI Water) is required to undertake a stringent monitoring programme to verify that the tap water it supplies to consumers meets all the stringent quality standards set by the drinking water regulations. During 2021, over 95,000 tests were completed. As outlined in the DWI Report, the overall compliance for the mains water supply in 2021 was 99.88%. The results are based on samples taken from water treatment works, service reservoirs and consumers’ taps.\n\nWelcoming publication of the report, Environment Minister Edwin Poots MLA, said: “I am pleased to welcome the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s annual report on Drinking Water Quality in Northern Ireland. The quality of our drinking water remains high which is vital for Public Health, the hospitality sector, farming and the economy.\"\n\nCOVID-19 continued to have an impact, albeit less significant, on the monitoring of the quality of drinking water supplies across Northern Ireland in 2021. The impact of periods of restricted access to domestic properties resulted in a reduced number of samples being collected for specific parameters that are only monitored at consumers’ taps. This shortfall in regulatory sampling by NI Water was approved by DWI in advance, and hence no enforcement action was taken as it was beyond the company’s control.\n\nThe Minister went on to say: “The Drinking Water Inspectorate has an important role to play in providing the Northern Ireland public with independent assurance that their water supply is safe and clean. Through regulatory enforcement, DWI has helped bring about improvements to NI Water’s infrastructure for the benefit of us all.\"\n\nIt is important that NI Water manages risks within the water supply system and this should be supported by an appropriately funded investment programme. The Utility Regulator published its Final Determination on funding for PC21 (the Price Control process from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2027) in May 2021. NI Water must receive appropriate funding to ensure drinking water quality is maintained in the future.\n\nA small percentage of water is also supplied from private water supplies in Northern Ireland. A number of these supplies serve public buildings, such as hospitals and health care premises, universities, and businesses such as food manufacturers, hotels and restaurants. Extensive monitoring is undertaken of registered private water supplies by the DWI (in conjunction with local councils), with almost 12,000 tests conducted in 2021. The Report published today indicates that the overall compliance figure of 99.19% at private water supplies is slightly lower than that reported for the public water supply. The report provides a breakdown of what these supplies are used for and the issues experienced throughout 2021.\n\nMinister Poots added: “Moving forward, continued improvement in drinking water quality in Northern Ireland remains a priority for the Department. Through its work with NI Water and the owners and users of private water supplies, the Department will continue to encourage the use of innovation and sustainable practices. This will ensure public health protection whilst supporting economic growth.”\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nThe Drinking Water Inspectorate operates as a business unit within the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), part of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has an independent responsibility to assess and regulate drinking water quality for both public and private water supplies against the regulatory requirements. NI Water is solely responsible for the supply and distribution of public drinking water. There were 171 registered private water supplies monitored in Northern Ireland in 2021, with six new sites being registered during that period.

    "To survive, unionism now has to be inclusive of Northern Ireland’s Catholics | Malachi O'Doherty": "Census results don’t predict change; they just help to describe what has happened so far. The transformation of Northern Ireland to the point where Roman Catholics now outnumber Protestants has already occurred, and it is no longer the place I grew up in.\n\nThis represents the collapse of the political idea that prevailed after partition and is clung to hopelessly still; that the survival of the union depends on unionism being Protestant. Now there can no longer be a majority for staying in the UK that does not include Catholics. Any strategy for defending the union must appeal across sectarian lines.\n\nThis assertion of “Protestant Ulster” was embodied in the most popular politician in the region, the thundering pastor, the Rev Ian Paisley, who founded the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and topped every vote to the European parliament before making his party the biggest in Northern Ireland and becoming first minister.\n\nPaisley rejected the idea of a united Ireland because he feared that “Ulster”, as he called it, would be absorbed into a Catholic state. This had been the fear expressed by those who, more than a century ago, had opposed home rule, claiming it would amount to “Rome rule”.\n\nPartition was devised to provide a territory that could be governed by a Protestant majority. The original conception is now obsolete – but that does not yet mean that partition must fail.\n\nIn the period of civil rights agitation in the late 1960s, people around Paisley absurdly imagined that the Catholic church was manipulating protest and an IRA uprising. Until the crisis created by the civil rights campaign, the Orange Order had an effective veto on the appointment of Stormont government ministers, all of whom had to be members of the Order.\n\nAnd the monarchy was cherished as the defender of civil liberties against encroaching Catholicism and Gaelic culture through its preservation of the Protestant faith. Yet, when King Charles swore an oath recently to continue in that tradition there was no exultant crowing from unionists, no declaration from anybody that this honoured their deepest convictions and underscored the union.\n\nUnionists don’t talk like Paisley any more. The vision of a Northern Ireland that can retain a preeminently Protestant character is obsolete. For my book, Can Ireland Be One?, I interviewed the current grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland and he made it clear that he had already seen the change and the need to work with it. He said, “We need to coexist to preserve the union.”\n\nHe had recognised before the census result that Northern Ireland could only stay in the United Kingdom with the assent of large numbers of people who are members of the Catholic community and probably identify as Irish but who, as several polls have shown, already believe they are better off in the UK. This, however, would be a vulnerable union founded on pragmatism rather than passion or principle; not ideal from an Orange perspective but the best that is now on offer.\n\nThe last thing that is going to preserve the union is a political culture that would alienate Catholics and Irish-identifying people who have the numbers to vote Northern Ireland into a united Ireland. The only way to preserve the union is to make sure that those people feel at home within it. There is some hope of that.\n\nAs a student and a young man I believed that I lived in an Orange state in which I would always be disadvantaged. The longed-for escape from the shadow of Protestant unionism was a united Ireland, imagined in a future in which Ireland would be more prosperous – as it is now – and less confessional in its own character – as it is now – with the erosion of the influence of the Catholic church. The modern Ireland that I would feel more at home in has arrived at the same time as a Northern Ireland in which I am no longer in danger of being discriminated against.\n\nA new leader like Ian Paisley emerging to proclaim Ulster’s inherent Protestant character would simply be laughed at now. Paisley himself was an anachronism in his own lifetime with nowhere to go but to lead his party into partnership with the largest party of the Catholic community, Sinn Féin. Yet, even with these results, unionism has a hand to play, if it only knew it. It needs to demonstrate that Northern Ireland works and that it has a secular, liberal, inclusive culture in which everyone enjoys full and fully respected citizenship.\n\nSo far, it has not been doing well at that, with its core Protestant evangelical culture having tried to block legislative reform to legalise abortion and same-sex marriage. Even when campaigning against the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, addressed protest rallies supported by loyalist bands, rallies at which a Catholic may not have felt safe.\n\nA unionism that was once the dominant political culture now behaves like an eccentric minority, winning no converts and alienating itself instead of alienating others.",
    "Ireland ambassador to UK urges negotiations to solve Brexit issues": "(Alliance News) - Ireland's ambassador to the UK has stressed the need to find a negotiated solution to the problems surrounding Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements.\n\nMartin Fraser said he was an optimist about the chances of resolving the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol but the situation was currently in the \"words phase\" and had to move to the \"actions phase\".\n\nThe UK government is legislating to effectively tear up parts of the agreement, which sets out how goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are treated.\n\nFraser, speaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, said the protocol was the only way to resolve the problems caused by Brexit.\n\nThe agreement, signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson's government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDevolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.\n\nFraser acknowledged there were \"legitimate concerns\" but said: \"How do we solve it? We solve it by negotiating through the issues that are there.\n\n\"From our point of view, from the EU, we solve it by implementing the protocol that was agreed with the British government, which the British government signed and fought an election, passed through Parliament.\n\n\"We think it's the best and only solution. But of course we recognise that people have legitimate issues and we do definitely recognise that the Unionist community in Northern Ireland has legitimate concerns which we have to try and address.\n\n\"But we address them by negotiating.\"\n\nAsked if he was optimistic about the situation, he said: \"I think we have to solve this problem, I think we can, I think we should.\"\n\nHe added: \"I couldn't have worked on Northern Ireland politics for the best part of 20 years without being optimistic and I think we should all be optimistic.\"\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2022 Alliance News Limited.

The aims of the CIS are to estimate how many people have the infection and the number of new cases that occur over a given time as well as estimating how many people have developed antibodies to COVID-19.\n\nThe survey over time will help track the extent of infection and transmission of COVID-19 among people in the community population (those in private residential households).\n\nKey Findings\n\nDue to the relatively small number of tests and positive swab results within our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nDuring the most recent week of the study (7 – 13 September 2022), it is estimated that 22,900 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 15,000 to 32,800).\n\nThis equates to 1.25% of the population (95% credible interval: 0.82% to 1.79%) or around 1 in 80 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 120 to 1 in 55).\n\nModelling suggests the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the week ending 13 September in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe trend in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 was uncertain across all age groups in the most recent week.\n\nIn the latest six-week period, there were 9,720 swab tests taken in total from 8,403 participants. Of these, 158 participants tested positive from 136 different households. In the latest two-week period, of the 3,600 participants in the study, 49 tested positive from 42 households.\n\nVariant analysis\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for variants of concern.\n\nCurrently, the variants under surveillance in the UK are:\n\nOmicron, including sublineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5\n\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value reflects the quantity of virus (also known as viral load) found in a swab test. A lower Ct value indicates a higher viral load. The latest Ct values of coronavirus (COVID-19) positive tests, as well as analysis of the genetic lineages of coronavirus seen in the samples that are sequenced, are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset.\n\nSince the end of June 2022, the majority of COVID-19 infections in the UK have been Omicron variants BA.4 or BA.5, with BA.5 comprising 88.5% and BA.4 comprising 9.0% of all sequenced COVID-19 infections in the week ending 4 September 2022.\n\nMore information on how variants from positive tests on the survey are measured can be found in the ONS Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methods article.\n\nThe last published main variant analysis was included in COVID-19 Infection Survey, Northern Ireland: Weekly Report 8 July 2022. This showed a very high proportion of infections compatible with the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, so a breakdown of infections by variants is not included in this release. Infections by variant will continued to be monitored and analysis will be reintroduced when considered helpful.\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nThe Department of Health has been working along with the Public Health Agency, Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and the Office for National Statistics (and its various survey partners) to extend the COVID-19 Infection Survey to Northern Ireland. Fieldwork in Northern Ireland began on 27 July 2020. All results are provisional and subject to revision. Due to relatively small number of tests and positive swab tests within the sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These statistics refer to infections reported in the community (i.e. private households). These figures exclude infections reported in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. Estimates of the total national proportion of the population testing positive for COVID-19 are adjusted to be representative of the population of Northern Ireland that live in private residential households in terms of age, sex and region. Weekly reports are to be published with findings from the COVID-19 Infection survey. It is anticipated that new and further analyses will be added to the weekly reports over time. Further information about quality and methodology associated with the survey can be found on the ONS website.

    "Belfast only port in Ireland ready to build offshore wind turbines, according to new report": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest nostalgia features and photo stories from Belfast Nostalgia straight to your inbox\n\nBelfast is the only port on the island of Ireland ready to build offshore wind turbines, according to a new report.\n\nThat's despite the Department for Economy providing no funding for the renewables sector, including wind and solar, over the past five years.\n\nWind Energy Ireland commissioned Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions to analyse Ireland's ability to construct the turbines it needs around its own shores.\n\nRead more: Planners should be looking 200yrs ahead to protect Belfast from climate crisis\n\nIt found that in order to meet renewables and climate targets, the Republic of Ireland needs about 20GW of power from offshore wind by 2050 - that’s around 1,000 turbines. Northern Ireland's Energy Strategy, meanwhile contains a 70% renewables target by 2030.\n\nBut out of 13 ports and harbours they examined across the island, only Belfast is ready to build offshore wind farms.\n\nNoel Cunniffe, CEO of Wind Energy Ireland, said: “We want to build Irish offshore wind farms in Irish ports. That is the best way to create jobs at home and to deliver offshore wind energy at the lowest possible price.\n\n“But we cannot build 7 GW of offshore wind energy by the end of 2030 if we only have a single port on the island suitable for building offshore wind farms.”\n\nThe ports included in the report were Belfast D1, Belfast Harland & Wolff, Bremore, Cork Dockyard, Foynes Island, Galway, Killybegs, Larne, Moneypoint, Port of Cork (Ringaskiddy), Ros an Mhíl, Rosslare Europort and Shannon-Foynes.\n\n“We need to be able to build more than one offshore wind project at the same time if we are to have any chance to deliver the carbon emissions cuts that the Government wants and that climate action requires,” added Mr Cunniffe.\n\n“We know Minister Eamon Ryan is taking this seriously. But with only eight years to deliver 7 GW of offshore wind energy there is growing concern throughout industry that projects may have to be built from outside of Ireland or will need to wait for availability in Belfast.”\n\nWEI says additional infrastructure is needed to meet climate obligations.\n\nThe report recommends state support to plug funding gaps through grants or loans, clarity on timescales to deliver offshore wind farms, better planning and the prioritisation of renewables applications to give Ireland the best chance of meeting its 2030 target.\n\nSarah Gibson, Principal Engineer with Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions and the report’s lead author, said: “Our ports have the ambition, the determination and the imagination to provide first-class infrastructure for the construction of offshore renewable energy projects.\n\n“Ports like Rosslare, Cork Dockyard and Shannon-Foynes have already put in substantial work getting ready for offshore wind.\n\n“Ireland can be a base from which to build a generation of fixed-bottom and floating wind energy projects, creating thousands of jobs and ensuring investment stays in Ireland.\n\n“But it won’t just happen by itself. It will need Government, ports and renewable energy developers working together to make this ambition a reality.”\n\nThe report was co-funded by Wind Energy Ireland members Belfast Harbour, DP Energy, ESB, Inis Offshore Wind, Ocean Winds, Ørsted, Source Energie and RWE.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here.

Ask me now and I would tell you it’s down to social media - not blowing smoke up my own arse.\n\n“Back in 2013, when I was a young budding 20-year-old, to order a pint of Guinness was considered odd. It was perceived as an ‘old man's drink'.\n\n“If you sit and drink with a group of young lads now they will talk just as much about the Guinness as they will football and other general male topics.\"\n\nThe methodology used was the total sum of scores from surveys, Casino source have compiled the ratings out of 10.\n\nOver 9 - the pint was excellent\n\n8 and over – Great\n\nBetween 7-8 – Good\n\nBetween 6-7 – Mediocre/Average\n\nBelow – Bad\n\nWith this in mind, here are the shocking results of best and worst counties in Ireland when it comes to finding a good pint of Guinness.\n\nGalway - 8.53\n\nLimerick - 8.42\n\nKerry - 8.31\n\nSligo - 8.28\n\nDonegal - 8.22\n\nCork - 8.2\n\nDerry - 8.2\n\nWexford - 8.1\n\nKilkenny - 8.1\n\nDublin - 7.95\n\nWaterford - 7.95\n\nArmagh - 7.93\n\nLouth - 7.84\n\nMeath - 7.7\n\nFermanagh - 7.62\n\nAntrim - 7.45\n\nKildare - 7\n\nGuinness’ popularity is not just Ireland. It’s currently brewed in 49 countries and sold in over 150.\n\nAccording to Business Plus, the average cost of a pint of Guinness is now €5.12 in the Republic and £5.29 in Northern Ireland.\n\nGalway comes out on top as number one for a pint in Ireland.\n\nConnaught did exceptionally well in the rankings, with Galway and Sligo in the top 5.\n\nWith no pub featuring a score less than 8, you will be unfortunate to find a bad pint of Guinness in Galway.\n\nFeaturing a score less than 8, Limerick placed second, followed by Kerry (third place), and Donegal (fifth) featured in the top 5.\n\nThe Guinness Guru said: \"My rankings tend to only concern the pubs themselves. But when put into perspective, the standard of Guinness in Galway was absolutely top tier.\n\n“For me, the city of Galway manages to mesh together the exciting feeling of being in the big smoke with the rural heartbeat of the West. If Dublin and Dingle had a lovechild, the child’s name would be Galway.\"\n\nDublin is in the bottom half of Irish counties for a good Guinness.\n\nDublin scored horrifically compared to competitors, but this should be taken lightly.\n\nThe city had by far the biggest sample size out of any county, so while an average score of 7.95/10 doesn’t hold up well against the competition, it’s most likely the best chance of getting a good pint of Guinness.\n\nIt’s not all bad news, as The Guinness Guru himself handed out two 9s with The Gravediggers at 9.3, and Bowe’s Lounge Bar on Fleet Street at 9.\n\nA total of 34 spots delivered a less than satisfactory score of 6/10 – so if you’re wandering the streets of Dublin and a thirst comes upon you, be cautious of where you visit.\n\nResponding to what he dubbed ‘slanderous claims’, the Guinness Guru said: “I can’t help but stand strong against these slanderous claims. This is purely down to the number of pubs. I’m no statistician but I reckon I’ve been to 20-30 pubs around Dublin city as opposed to 4-5 boozers in other cities.\n\n“I would argue that if you took my best 5 reviews from Dublin it would most certainly rival Galway and the other top cities. Dublin is my bread and butter so I’d have to call for a VAR review on this controversial ‘bottom half of the table’ statement.\n\n“For me, pubs such as The Gravediggers, Mulligan’s, Walsh’s and Bowes are the Guinness Gold Standard that’s set in Dublin and adhered to right across the country.\"\n\nDerry is the cream of the crop in the north\n\nDerry was the highest rated county on the table in Northern Ireland followed by Armagh – more famous for its cider tradition – then Fermanagh and Antrim, a disappointing second from bottom.\n\nKildare is the worst place for a pint of Guinness\n\nKildare natives, we are sorry.\n\nNo country wants the crown for the worst average pint of Guinness but unfortunately they are ranked last place in the table.\n\nKildare averaged a lowly 7.3, a full half a point behind their neighbours Meath.\n\nWith dismay the Guru said: “Disappointing to read that about my beloved Royal county.

    "Different story now for sectarianism and sport in Northern Ireland": "More than 30 years ago the late Colm Keane made a haunting radio documentary for RTÉ called A Belfast Game. It told the story of the Ardoyne Kickhams U-16 footballers, winners of the South Antrim championship in 1969, and how The Troubles invaded their lives. The final was played seven days after James Callaghan, the British home secretary, had moved troops into the North to confront the growing unrest, and on their way to Casement Park the team bus passed burnt out cars, the smouldering remains of the previous night’s rioting.\n\nIt was a still point in lives that would be dragged in different directions. Two members of that panel of 24 players lost their lives in The Troubles; two of them lost fathers; two of them had brothers who were shot. Ten of them emigrated, only a couple of whom returned. Among their ranks, too, were a couple of Protestant boys, which would have been unusual then, and unimaginable only a short time later.\n\nTaking a snapshot of Northern Ireland in The Troubles through the lens of sport was a recurring device, across all media. A few years after Colm Keane’s documentary, Fergal Keane of the BBC made The Boys of Summer for television, telling the story of a football team from Holy Cross primary school, in Ardoyne, and set just a year earlier in 1968.\n\nWhen Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton had the chutzpah to turn The Troubles into a dismal West End musical, The Beautiful Game was reportedly inspired by both of those documentaries, with at least a couple of the characters transported from The Boys of Summer, and fitted with a costume for the stage.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIn telling a story from The Troubles, sport offered a universal language. In a divided society, it was an emblem of your tribe, just as visceral as the songs, and the flags, and the faith and the politics. The short hand was simple to decipher.\n\nSo, what does it mean now? Does it mean all the same things it once did? Or have the borders softened?\n\n[ Northern Ireland census: Another psychological blow for unionism ]\n\n[ More Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland for first time, census finds ]\n\nWhen the results of the Northern Ireland census were released on Thursday, one of the outcomes that generated the greatest attention was how people described their nationality. On the census form were eight options, descending from the vanilla responses (British only 31.86 per cent; Irish only 29.13 per cent) to a variety of minority identities (British, Irish and Northern Irish only 1.47 per cent; Irish and Northern Irish only 1.76 per cent).\n\nIn an alternative census, how would those numbers have translated into sporting preferences? Would “GAA only” or “Rugby only” or “Soccer only” have dominated the numbers, like they would have done, say, 30 years ago, or would more of the second and third preferences have been cross-cultural?\n\nIn 2015 the Northern Ireland Executive commissioned the University of Ulster to produce a report, Social Exclusion and Sport in Northern Ireland. Some of the outcomes were heartening: 86 per cent of the people surveyed said they believed sport was a good way to break down barriers between Protestants and Catholics, and around the same figure believed that sport was more “open and inclusive” than it had been a decade earlier; two-thirds of respondents said they believed that sports-based peace-building projects were “effective.”\n\nA significant number of Protestants have hinted at an interest in GAA. Photograph: John McVitty/Inpho\n\nIn the next breath, 57 per cent of the people surveyed believed there was “nothing wrong” with different sports for Protestants and Catholics. Only 1 per cent of the Protestants surveyed said they had watched “a lot” of Gaelic football in the previous year, but nearly two in five said they would go to a game in Casement Park, if they were given a ticket. Even though the free ticket was a hypothetical offer, it represented a degree of curiosity, and minds that were at least ajar.\n\nSearching for what those numbers might mean in the day-to-day life of the mainstream sports requires some rooting around. Ten years ago, for example, when Ulster reached the final of the Heineken Cup against Leinster, they profiled their support base and established that nearly a quarter of their regulars at Ravenhill were from a nationalist background. It is hard imagine that figure has fallen since.\n\nIn recent years, Windsor Park has become a more comfortable environment for Catholics who wish to support Northern Ireland: there are more green and white flags and fewer union jacks, and the song-list in the stands is not as inflammatory as it once was. Are there more football fans who support both Northern Ireland and the Republic now? That would be an interesting question for the alternative census.\n\nThe GAA are attempting to reach out, too. One terrific initiative is the Cúchulainn Cup, which this year included 14 schools in five towns: five Catholic schools, five Protestant schools, and four schools that cater for children of all religions. In each town a multi-denominational team is picked, mostly with beginners, or kids who used to play but haven’t done so for years. This year’s winners were Limavady, with a team picked from two Protestant schools and one Catholic school.\n\nTargeting children as carriers of change is the mission of Peaceplayers, an international organisation, which has been active in Northern Ireland since the early 2000s. “It is based on a very simple premise,” said Gareth Harper, managing director of their Belfast office. “Children who play together can learn to live together.”\n\nTheir work is primarily conducted in schools that are partnered for the purpose of forming integrated basketball teams, a neutral sport not associated with one tradition or the other. One of their initiatives is the Belfast Inter-Face Games where they work with children near the so-called peace lines - segregation walls between loyalist and republican areas that were erected during The Troubles.\n\nOne of their greatest triumphs was in Ardoyne. In the early 2000s, Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school in a Protestant area, was picketed by local parents who claimed that their homes had been attacked by republicans. The protests turned violent and eventually riot police accompanied the Holy Cross pupils and their parents on their daily walk to school.\n\nPeaceplayers worked with Holy Cross and a nearby Protestant school in Wheatfield to build an integrated basketball team and, from that, a bridge. Having had the experience of playing basketball together, they got involved in a Game of Three Halves (a joint Ulster GAA, Ulster Rugby and IFA project) where Protestant kids from Wheatfield and Glenbryn played Gaelic football and Catholic kids from Holy Cross played rugby.\n\nIt is the same neighbourhood where Colm Keane and Fergal Keane told their stories. But it is a different story now.",
    "Ireland need Jeff Hendrick's influence off the bench in certain scenarios": "Irish Journalist Dan McDonnell joined Joe Molloy on The Football Show to discuss Ireland's midfield.\n\nIreland suffered a disappointing loss to Scotland in Hampden Park.\n\nIt was disappointing because they played well and still lost. Alan Browne's handball was silly. It gave Scotland the game-winning penalty, and there were plenty of other missed opportunities too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Ireland played well for the most part. The back three of John Egan, Nathan Collins and Dara O'Shea excelled together. Michael Obafemi and Troy Parrott continue to develop their relationship. Matt Doherty returned in a decent display and the midfield trio battled hard for 90 minutes.\n\nBut there was a lack of control in Ireland's performance. Scotland showed their experience during the second half and Joe Molloy couldn't help but notice Ireland lacked that same quality.\n\n\"There were definitely periods in the second half when Scotland had control of the game,\" Molloy said.\n\n\"We almost did that too readily and you would love if that midfield three had almost said...'We might just try to take the sting out of this game a touch.' Now I don't know if that's experience or nous or maybe they were under strict instructions to get it forward, that's the way we hurt them.\n\n\"But that was definitely a feeling watching the game.\"\n\nDan McDonnell agreed with Molloy.\n\nNone of Cullen, Knight nor Molumby controlled possession or dictated the play. They weren't bad on the ball, but they didn't understand how or have the ability to slow the game down when Ireland needed them to.\n\nMcDonnell explains it's an area that Ireland are concerned about.\n\n\"To a degree this comes back to quality of player in this department,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that where Ireland lack depth at the minute is in those midfield positions...That midfield, Knight and Molumby, probably more so picked for their off the ball work rate than their on the ball abilities. Although Molumby I think has improved on the ball...and Knight is a very good player, but he's someone who makes breaks and latches onto attacks.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have [someone like] Callum McGregor who controls things a small bit more.\"\n\nWill Smallbone and Gavin Kilkenny are potential call-ups for the November internationals. The under-21 team doesn't have fixtures during that window. Smallbone is particularly exciting, but Kilkenny is closer to the quarterback-style passer who will sit deep and slow the game down when Ireland need him to.\n\nBut neither player is an option for Tuesday night and neither player is even guaranteed to make the next squad.\n\nInstead, Ireland can look at their current bench. Jeff Hendrick has more experience than any other Ireland midfielder. He played well for Kenny previously and McDonnell reckons he could have made a difference for Ireland on Saturday.\n\n\"He's an unpopular player with sections of the fanbase...something different would have been bringing in Jeff Hendrick. On a good day, and there have been good days under Kenny. [He's] a good passer and he has a bit of a presence.\n\n\"With his experience he could have taken a bit of the sting out of it. It was a bit frantic, the game in general.\"\n\nMatt Doherty is expecting big things.\n\nFootball on Off The Ball brought to you by Sky.

    "Bailey Peacock-Farrell might have to leave Burnley to keep Northern Ireland shirt": "Bailey Peacock-Farrell deserved a big share of the credit for Northern Ireland’s crucial come-from-behind 2-1 victory over Kosovo on Saturday but still heard manager Ian Baraclough suggest he may need to leave Burnley this winter to keep his place in the side.\n\nPeacock-Farrell has been Northern Ireland’s number one since Michael O’Neill gave him his debut in 2018 and has not let them down in 34 appearances to date, but he came into this international window with his place in question as the only keeper in the squad not getting regular playing time at club level.\n\nConor Hazard has joined Finnish club HJK on loan from Celtic, while Luke Southwood is at Cheltenham on loan from Reading.\n\nPeacock-Farrell spent last season with Sheffield Wednesday but is now back at Burnley and playing back-up to Aro Muric – the man who was in goal for Kosovo at Windsor Park.\n\n“We have spoken about that,” Baraclough said after praising Peacock-Farrell’s display.\n\n“I’ve spoken to Conor Hazard and to Luke Southwood. Bailey was the only one not playing. He knows he’s got competition, so obviously he’s keeping himself in shape. If the next [international] window is March, he’s got six months to get in the team or in January move on.”\n\nPeacock-Farrell said in the Northern Ireland matchday programme he had received offers in the summer but had been told by new Burnley manager Vincent Kompany he was wanted at Turf Moor.\n\n“There were a few clubs here and there interested in taking me on loan, but after talks with Burnley it was clear I was going to be staying there this season,” he said.\n\n“With the change of manager and that kind of thing, it was up in the air a little bit and with lots of players going in and out they wanted me to stay and if they want that, that’s what happens and I am happy to do that and fight for my spot.”\n\nThe victory eased the pressure that had been building on Baraclough, who hopes the result can be a turning point.\n\n“Every win means something, but a Nations League win, the first one we’ve managed, I’m really pleased with that,” he said.\n\n“It gives us a platform to build on. We know we’re not the finished article, but we are still building, trying to bring in young players. Those players create a squad, a competitive squad and we need to keep building on that.”",

    "Preview: Ireland U21s chase the dream in Israel": "It was honours even after the European Under-21 Championship play-off first leg at Tallaght Stadium on Friday night, but the sense in the aftermath was it's advantage Israel ahead of the return game on Tuesday.\n\nIreland had the chances to establish a good lead in Dublin.\n\nThe impressive Aaron Connolly, Willl Smallbone and Eiran Cashin all went close before Idan Gorno struck for the visitors with a header from a corner. Evan Ferguson soared to glance home a deserved second-half equaliser, but Ireland are facing a massive challenge in Tel Aviv, where temperatures are expected to be around 28 degrees come kick-off time.\n\nIsrael have shown Crawford's team ample respect by calling back three players from the senior squad for the second leg.\n\nCeltic attacker Liel Abada, Olympiacos full-back Doron Leidner and Eden Kartsev of Maccabi Tel Aviv are all available having helped the seniors to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Albania on Saturday.\n\nHowever Crawford will not be doing likewise, despite Gavin Bazunu, Troy Parrott, Nathan Collins, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi being eligible. They will stick with Stephen Kenny's senior squad for the Aviva Stadium clash against Armenia.\n\nMeanwhile Crawford remains upbeat and quietly confident his charges are good enough to make history and qualify Ireland for a first ever major finals at the U-21 grade.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good performance on Friday,\" he told RTÉ Sport.\n\n\"It was disappointing to concede a goal from a set play. It's something we work a lot on, but these things happen. The players showed resilience and character to get themselves back into the game.\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have. I have no doubt we'll be able to do that.\n\n\"Of course you'd have regrets you missed chances. On another day we could have been a coupe of goals up after the first leg, and I think the real measure of our performance was that they have drafted down three players from the senior team. It's going to be a stiffer challenge, there's not doubt about it, but I think with the quality we have in our squad, we'll be okay.\"\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have\" - Ireland U21s boss Jim Crawford spoke to @darrenfrehill ahead of Tuesday's massive Euros play-off in Israel, live on the @RTEplayer (6.15pm ko) #RTEsoccer pic.twitter.com/bOyfm2fYF6 — RTÉ Soccer (@RTEsoccer) September 26, 2022\n\nFerguson is nursing an ankle knock but he's expected to be OK. Bar that, Ireland have a clean bill of health.\n\nHaving really gone at the Israelis in Tallaght, the complexion of the game is likely to be a lot different at Bloomfield Stadium. Certainly Israel will look to take the game to their hosts a lot more, buoyed by the returning trio of Abada, Leidner and Kartsev, plus a partisan crowd that will expect them to play on the front foot.\n\nCrawford also admitted that the heat may dictate the Irish approach.\n\n\"You have to factor that in too, to go after a team for 90 minutes in those type of conditions can be challenging,\" he added.\n\n\"You've got to pick and choose your moments to get after teams. Our boys are clever enough. They'll be well versed on what we've got to do.\"\n\nThere's some seasoned Irish campaigners who have been with the group for a long time now. Among them is Lee O'Connor, the tigerish Tranmere Rovers caps full-back desperate to make the big breakthrough.\n\nO'Connor has been a mainstay of Ireland squads from U-15s up. This is his last campaign in underage international football, and he wants to make it count.\n\n\"I've said it many times, there's nothing like it... it's just a different kind of feeling when you play for Ireland,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"It's something I've love since my very first game.

    "Northern Ireland power sharing slips to 2023 as few relish a winter election": "The UK has given a six-month deadline for the Northern Ireland protocol row to be resolved, indicating Liz Truss is far more relaxed about the absence of a devolved government in Stormont than previously indicated.\n\nAn April 2023 date for the resolution of the Brexit row emerged after a meeting between the prime minister and the US president, Joe Biden, and would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday agreement.\n\nBut the deadline extension means power sharing in Northern Ireland is, in effect, paused until next year despite legislation requiring elections this year if the parties cannot agree to return to Stormont.\n\nParties elected in May were given 24 weeks, or until 28 October, to form a new executive at Stormont, but the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has been boycotting power sharing until the Northern Ireland protocol row is resolved.\n\nThe April deadline creates a challenge for the newly appointed Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nUnder legislation brought in by his predecessor, Brandon Lewis, he is obliged to call a Northern Ireland assembly election if an executive is not formed by 28 October.\n\nThis week, on his second only visit to Northern Ireland, he said that is exactly what he would do.\n\n“It’s not an idle threat – it’s not a threat at all. It’s a fact that the legislation says that I need to do that on 28 October,” he said.\n\nFew, however, believe that can now happen.\n\nNone of the parties want a Christmas election. The Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, described the prospect of a winter election as “absolutely diabolical”.\n\nCensus results released on Thursday showed Catholics outnumbered Protestants for the first time in the 100-year history of Northern Ireland.\n\nJon Tonge, a professor of British and Irish politics at Liverpool University, said this confirmed that the religious basis for the state was no longer there.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t mean unionism would be eliminated in the next election.\n\nThe census figures show that the majority of passport holders hold a British document, and that 17% of people do not identify with any religion, underlining the power of the centrist Alliance party, which came second in May’s election.\n\nTonge said: “All a Christmas election would do is help Sinn Féin further crush the SDLP. It would perhaps allow the DUP to win back some votes from the Traditional Unionist Voice but we would end up with the same standoff over the protocol.”\n\nIt appears likely that Heaton-Harris will legislate to extend the 24-week deadline to form an executive at Stormont, rather than force a new election.\n\nDoes this all mean a protocol resolution is more likely, and can the US be the broker of such a deal? Tonge said both Biden and Truss were “pledging absolute fidelity to the Good Friday agreement”, but those pledges meant different things to each side. The British side was focused on getting the DUP back into Stormont and more compromises from the EU, while the US was focused on the Irish perspective.\n\nWe can expect forked tongues in the next few weeks. Truss wants a negotiated deal and has limited bandwidth for Northern Ireland, but will keep the Brexit fire burning for domestic party reasons. “She is not going to be throwing flowers and love at the EU at her first party conference as prime minister,” Tonge said.",

In addition to a 15-year lease for a newly built warehouse in Doncaster in the North of England, Maersk has signed a lease for two new distribution centres in the Irish capital Dublin. All the facilities have a strong focus on their operations creating low CO2 emissions. The Doncaster facility is part of the G Park Doncaster Mammoth 602 development and perfectly connected via road (close to five motorways), rail (Doncaster International Railport), and air (Robin Hood Airport). With more than 600,000 sq ft total space, 60 dock levellers, 20m internal clear height as well as several hundred parking spaces and offices the warehouse is one of the largest in UK. It ranks also among the most sustainable logistics buildings in the North of England. The developer GLP has built the facility on a net zero carbon scheme for construction (within the UKGBC framework). In addition to the warehouse in Doncaster, Maersk’s portfolio comprises two other distribution centers in the UK in Tamworth and Kettering.\n\nIn Ireland, Maersk has signed a lease for renting two new warehouses in the Quantum Logistics Park in the North of Dublin. The units 3 and 4 within Quantum Logistics Park will feature a combined space of 250,000 sq ft and will be built to fulfill the sustainability standards of LEED Gold and BREEAM Excellent ratings. The Dublin based developer IPUT Real Estate will complete the two warehouses in Q4 2022 and Q2 2023, while unit 4 will also become Ireland’s first net zero logistics building using a glue-laminated timber structural frame. Quantum Logistics Park is strategically located 2 km from Dublin airport and 15 km from Dublin port with immediate access to the M2 motorway.\n\nThese three new warehouses in the UK and Ireland are a strong statement that we are ready to deliver on our integrator promise to our customers and serve them with end-to-end logistics solutions from factory to their end-consumers if they wish. The demand for integrated and thus more resilient supply chains has grown significantly over the past two years. The disruptions of Brexit and the pandemic moved the logistics from a commodity level to a C-level topic – where it actually belongs. Gary Jeffreys Area Managing Director UK & Ireland\n\nAs decarbonization of sea, air and land logistics by 2040 is an integral part of Maersk’s strategy, we are happy to partner with two very capable developers which help us to deliver on that ambitious goal in landside logistics. Following the successful acquisition of the warehousing specialist LF Logistics in Asia, Maersk today offers its customers integrated logistics solutions in more than 550 warehouses with a total global space of around 9.5 million sqm. Several additional Maersk warehouses are planned to go into operation in Europe in the coming months. As an integrator of logistics, Maersk is developing and providing solutions ranging from ocean transportation to landside and air transportation, contract logistics including warehousing & distribution (W&D) and depots, custom clearances, visibility solutions and more. When supply chains were impacted due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Maersk’s resilient end-to-end solutions ensured customers’ cargo kept moving. The integrated solutions allow Maersk to have greater control over the movement of the cargo at multiple stages of its journey and thus bring resilience to the supply chains. With the expansion of W&D facilities, Maersk is strengthening its position further by providing a larger array of services out of one hand to its customers. About A.P. Moller - Maersk A.P.

    "Biomethane can help boost Northern Ireland’s economy, says Chris Huhne at ADBA event": "Over 160 anaerobic digestion (AD) industry leaders and stakeholders gathered in Belfast on 21 September to discuss the role AD and biogas can play in Northern Ireland’s decarbonisation strategy.\n\nChaired by the now ADBA Chairman, Chris Huhne, the half-day event – entitled “AD: Potential, ambition, delivery” presented what ADBA says was the inside track on the role anaerobic digestion and biogas must play in decarbonising the province’s economy and the growth opportunities.\n\nSpeaking at the event, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and ADBA Chairman Chris Huhne, said: “Northern Ireland is the best-placed part of the UK to produce the most biogas and biomethane.\n\n“It has the potential to meet 80% of its gas demand from this home-grown, cost-effective, and sustainable source thanks to the importance of livestock farming.\n\n“With the right support, biogas can help boost the Northern Irish economy and insulate it from world gas prices by halving the cost of gas. And it can be done quickly: biogas plants can be built in two years.”\n\nNorthern Ireland is the best-placed part of the UK to produce the most biogas and biomethane.\n\nEconomy Minister, Department for the Economy, Gordon Lyons MLA, opened proceedings with a keynote speech on “maximising Northern Ireland’s opportunities for biomethane in the path to net zero energy”. He emphasised the need to get “back to the future” and secure energy security for NI – an ambition in which biomethane would play an important role.\n\n“I am committed to ensuring that in the delivery of self-sufficiency in affordable renewable energy, we will transform our economy, and the whole of our society will benefit from it. Biomethane will play a key role in this transition.\n\n“The pro-active role being taken by local industry encourages me that Northern Ireland will not be just a passenger in our journey towards the achievement of Net Zero 2050 targets, but is very much in the driving seat of change.”\n\nSpeakers from DAERA, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, KPMG, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, WRAP, BioCapital, CAT Finning, Queen’s University Belfast, Phoenix Natural Gas, SGN Commercial Services, and Firmus Energy then highlighted the “benefits of investing in AD and biogas to boost and decarbonise Northern Ireland’s economy”.\n\nJudith Wilson from DAERA reaffirmed the department’s commitment to the Green Growth Strategy and objectives to reach net zero by 2050 and a 48% reduction in emissions by 2030. She laid out the path they intend to take to get there, including developing the AD sector while mitigating any unwanted impacts on the environment and land use.\n\nWith the right support, biogas can help boost the Northern Irish economy and insulate it from world gas prices by halving the cost of gas.\n\nRussell Smyth of KPMG presented findings from their upcoming Supporting a Renewable Gas Sector in Northern Ireland report, describing the significant demand for biomethane in the country (largely due to its dairy industry and the energy needed to dry milk powder) and reviewing the various financial support options available. He pointed out that biomethane is currently cheaper than fossil fuels.\n\nUFU’s John McLenaghan described the “trilemma” of energy vs food vs environment – and how AD, given the right support, was uniquely poised to be a solution to all three. How to remove barriers to deployment – economics, planning and permit – was also explored.",

    "Northern Ireland lifts co-ownership limit 8.6% to £190,000": "The property value limit is the cap on the value of a property that can be purchased through co-ownership, and applies to co-own, rent to own and co-own for over 55s schemes. The previous property value limit was £175,000.\n\nCurrently, £158m of funding has been approved for the Co-Ownership Housing Association to support over 4,000 households into home ownership by 2024, according to the department.\n\nThe association has operated since 1978, is regulated by the government department, and is its main delivery partner for affordable shared ownership housing in the region.\n\nIts rent to own product allows homeowners to choose a new build house in Northern Ireland up to the property value limit. The association will buy the property and rent it to the homeowners for up to three years, with the owner able to purchase it any time after the end of the first year.\n\nThe department says £8m of further funding has been provided to support the co-own for over 55s scheme, which opened for applications in June. This product is based on a shared ownership model and is for people who want to move to a more suitable home that meets their needs as they age, but can’t afford to do so on their own.\n\nThe body says 93% of co-ownership purchases in 2021/22 were made by first-time buyers, adding that 46% of these buyers came from the private rented sector.\n\nThe average house price in Northern Ireland was £169,063 in the second quarter of this year, a 9.6% rise on the same period in 2021, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency’s latest Northern Ireland Housing Bulletin.\n\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey says: “I want to ensure people and families can access good quality, affordable housing. Shared ownership can provide an alternative to the private rented sector. It is important that the option of shared ownership is open to as many people as possible.”\n\nCo-ownership chief executive Mark Graham adds: “This renewed property value limit remains ahead of the average house price in Northern Ireland so we’re confident that this change will have a positive impact on incoming applicants.\n\n“We have helped over 30,000 people to date and year on year we are responsible for around 10% of the FTB market indicating the continued need for alternative routes to home ownership.”\n\nNAEA Propertymark President Stephen McCarron says: “With house prices and rents rising considerably in recent months, we are pleased to see that this is being reflected in the co-ownership schemes loan value.\n\n“By introducing this change at a time where some are feeling the pinch of the cost-of-living crisis and rising interest rates, the Northern Ireland Executive will be able to continue to encourage those looking to get onto the housing ladder to do so.”",

    "Why Chris Heaton-Harris and Steve Baker mean instability for Northern Ireland": "Professor Peter Shirlow is Director of the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies.\n\nLiz Truss has admitted that a US-UK trade deal is off the table.\n\nThis may seem odd given that such a trade deal was often sold as one of the key benefits of Brexit – but the White House and Congress have stated that no progress can be made unless the UK settles its ongoing dispute with Brussels over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nIf Truss is willing to discard that option, publicly at least, it suggests she and her government are preparing for an escalation in tensions with the EU over the issue, rather than a resolution.\n\nThat was certainly the message sent when Truss appointed two former chairs of the Eurosceptic backbench European Research Group (ERG) to the UK’s Northern Ireland Office a fortnight ago – a move that delighted the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but signalled further instability for the country to others.\n\nThe new prime minister’s choice of Chris Heaton-Harris and self-styled ‘Brexit hardman’ Steve Baker is seen by the DUP as a sign of support for playing hardball with the EU.\n\nHeaton-Harris kicked off his appointment by calling for the controversial Protocol Bill to be accelerated. This bill allows the UK to overrule sections of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, and lets UK ministers override the European Court of Justice in decisions about EU laws that were to be maintained in Northern Ireland to protect its access to the single market.\n\nIn short, the bill is a hazardous legislative method that potentially tears up an international treaty.\n\nThe EU’s chief negotiator Maroš Šefčovič has suggested that physical checks on goods travelling across the Irish Sea could be reduced to a “couple of lorries a day” – if the UK government would re-engage in negotiations. Despite such flexibility and pragmatism, the government’s response was that the EU should accept in totality the policies (or, rather, demands) laid out in the Protocol Bill.\n\nIt is hardly the language of flexibility – negotiations that result in further mitigations are likely to encounter the perpetually hard-line mood of the ERG and DUP. Neither group is akin to the pragmatic architects who delivered the Good Friday Agreement through compromises favoured by both Republicans and Unionists.\n\nThe agreement saw Republicans accept the principle of consent, which rejected violence as a means to create constitutional change, and achieve reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary into the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Unionists. meanwhile, witnessed the Irish state’s dropping of territorial claim to Northern Ireland, but accepted the legitimacy of Republicans to pursue a united Ireland. That was the era of ideological dilution to achieve compromise during a period of intense violence.\n\nWhat appears now, however, is a form of political ‘leadership’ that cannot bear conciliation.\n\nERG politics asserts that unionists demand the removal of the Protocol – when, in fact, surveys show both they and Irish nationalists actually want to see negotiations and additional mitigations. It is a complete misnomer to contend that there is no inter-community consensus that seeks solutions.\n\nThe emerging politics of forceful Brexiteerism now threatens the Good Friday Agreement and the positive change that it achieved.\n\nOver the past 15 years, sectarian crime has declined by 62%. Belfast, which between 1970 and 1998 lost a quarter of its central retail space to bombing, is currently ranked seventh out of 179 UK NUTS3 regions in terms of gross value added (that is, an area’s relative contribution to the national economy).\n\nYet now, Northern Ireland’s emergence as a world leader in fintech and cybersecurity is threatened by Brexit’s instability.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland had claimed to be protecting people’s respective identities – but were in fact reproducing the excesses of those identities through violence. Since 1998, many in the country have come to reject that ideology of conflict.\n\nThat situation is now being confronted by a new ideological excess: Brexit. The whole premise of the Good Friday Agreement, based upon the right to variant identities, open borders, and softer forms of Irish nationalism that could live within a more inclusive Northern Ireland, is now inverted by the blunt assertions of the ERG. The ERG prefers restrictive forms of nationalism at the cost of a proper appreciation of the delicate nature of relationships that shape a more consensual society.\n\nThe ERG’s perpetual energy for chaos is well established. In 2017, the group rejected the May government’s Backstop Protocol, which was to keep Northern Ireland and Great Britain in some aspects of the single market with the EU while solutions to remove the need for customs controls between Northern Ireland and GB were negotiated. In 2020, the same group voted for the protocol, now, again, it effectively wishes to repeal it.\n\nThe protocol has proven, given Northern Ireland’s better-than-GB post-COVID trade performance, the importance of access to the EU single market. It epitomises the fundamental and dire realities of Brexit’s subversion of single market access. The protocol – with its open borders, European-led arbitration, protection of rights and promotion of all-Ireland inter-connection – is intolerable to the small-minded rhetoric of taking ‘our country back’. It is too consensual, imaginative and beyond UK control. The fact that it places Northern Ireland in a unique trading position both within the UK and EU single market, and that it will thus drive investment and reduce dependency upon the Exchequer, is disregarded within emotions wrapped in anti-European sentiment.\n\nBut the protocol has undoubted flaws, too. The ludicrous surcharge of 25% on steel products being moved from GB to Northern Ireland, due to EU policy in August 2022, highlights one of them. A year earlier, Brussels was forced into a humiliating U-turn after initially trying to impose border controls on COVID vaccines moving into Northern Ireland from the Republic.\n\nUltimately, those in charge of Northern Ireland’s future have faith in ill-defined principles: either protocol rejection, or sacrosanct protection of the EU single market. Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland brought positive changes in security and investment, and faith in the Northern Ireland Assembly. These changes are now unprotected and vulnerable. Peacebuilding is being cast upon the shore by the politics of Brussels and, especially, London. It is time to protect the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThis article was first published on Open Democracy.

    "Ireland joins EU hawks on Russia, as outrage spreads": "Ireland has joined Poland and the Baltic states in lobbying for more hawkish Russia sanctions, in a sign of widening moral outrage in Europe.\n\nThe Irish added their \"IE\" stamp to a 9-page long list of proposals, including bank and diamond industry bans, circulated in Brussels and seen by EUobserver on Friday (23 September).\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nNo more smartphone sales to Russia, the group added (Photo: Wikimedia)\n\nThe Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, also condemned Russia's actions in strident terms at the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.\n\n\"Russia [is] behaving as a rogue state,\" he said, referring to its plan to annex parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIreland is neutral in military terms, located at the opposite end of Europe from the war, and has a liberal government.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are Nato hawks with Russian borders who fear Russian aggression and who have more conservative ruling parties.\n\nThe Irish foreign ministry declined to comment on the novel EU grouping.\n\nOne EU diplomat described it as a \"big deal\", which showed how the conflict was reshaping European politics. A second EU diplomat speculated that the US, which has close ties with Ireland, might have urged Dublin to side with Warsaw against more dovish EU capitals.\n\n\"We hope even more will join the group,\" a Polish diplomat said.\n\nBut a fourth EU diplomat said it wasn't so surprising, given Ireland's record of \"maximalist\" positions on human-rights issues.\n\nThe Irish-backed proposals say Russian lenders Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, Rosbank, and Tinkoff Bank should be cut off from the 'Swift' international payments grid.\n\nA Gazprombank ban would have far-reaching consequences because it handles payments for Russian gas exports.\n\n\"It shall be prohibited to purchase, import, or transfer, directly or indirectly, diamonds ... if they originate in Russia and if they have been exported from Russia into the [European] Union or to any third country,\" the group also proposed to add to the EU's sanctions regime.

    "American in Ireland? It's time to register to vote for the US midterm elections": "Democrats Abroad Ireland is encouraging some 25,000 eligible American voters in Ireland ahead to vote in the US midterm elections, which will this year be held on Tuesday, November 8.\n\nPatti Shields, chair of Democrats Abroad Ireland, recently told BreakingNews.ie that the group is encouraging Americans in Ireland to register to vote and request their ballots before October 5.\n\nUS citizens living (or working or traveling) outside the US have the right to vote in US Federal elections, which occur every two years and include all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives along with one-third of the US Senate seats.\n\nVoters living outside of the US can register to vote on VoteFromAbroad.org, which, although is a public service provided by Democratic Party Committee, voters from any party affiliation can use.\n\nShields said: \"When we do our VoteFromAbroad.org, our general voter outreach, which is really I'd say 90 percent of what I'm doing right now, we do that in a non-partisan way. We support the act of registering to vote without partisanship.\n\n\"The website we refer people to for voting is completely non-partisan in terms of you go all the way through the process of registering to vote, then at the end of the process if you care to hear more about Democrats Abroad it will take you to a page to go there.\"\n\nThe process to register to vote via VoteFromAbroad.org \"takes about seven minutes,\" Shields said.\n\n\"You need to know your old address, if you have an old social security number you need the last four digits but if you don't have that there are other ways to do it, the process itself is quite easy. You just need to do it far enough in advance.\"\n\nShe added: \"Some of the ballots are mailed, they're sent to some voters electronically... it varies by state, but most ballots need to be mailed back, or a copy needs to be mailed back.\n\n\"You need to mail something back. You just have to do it well enough in advance that it can be received in time for the election. The mail services in our current countries and the US I still don't think have fully recovered from Covid, things take a bit longer, so we're encouraging people to get out and do it sooner rather than later.\"\n\nThe first ballots began to be delivered on September 24, which Democrats Abroad marked with an online Ballot Day Rally, which featured candidates in some of \"the most competitive and crucial races in the country,\" as well as special guests, including Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, encouraging people to voters to complete and return their ballots.\n\nShields explained: \"In most states, you can electronically submit your ballot request and your registration completely electronically, so you don't even need a printer anymore... you can digitally capture your signature.\n\n\"We do one-on-one voter assistance and help them manage steps as simple as getting the piece of paper in front of the camera, that kind of thing.\n\n\"I think the fact that in the past three years there's been a growing number of voters and population moving here [in Ireland] and also them being very aware and very participative in the US electoral process just speaks to the relationship between the US and Ireland.\"",
    "Killing Leprechauns: Irish satirist mines British ignorance in comedy podcast": "When Oliver Cromwell’s forces sacked the Irish town of Drogheda in 1649 and massacred its inhabitants the comedy potential seemed limited. Thousands perished and that was just the start of a military campaign that wiped out much of Ireland’s population before Cromwell returned to England.\n\nFour centuries later, however, those dark events and other landmarks of Irish history have been mined for humour – and the joke is on the British.\n\nOliver Callan, an Irish satirist, has questioned British comedians about their knowledge of Ireland and uncovered an apparently deep well of ignorance. For Killing Leprechauns, a six-part BBC podcast that launches on Saturday, Callan asked a dozen young comics about Irish stereotypes, history and current affairs. The general response: obliviousness.\n\nIt validated the old joke about the Irish never forgetting their history and the British never remembering theirs, Callan said in an interview. “It was much worse than I expected.”\n\nThe comedians appeared unaware that Britain’s closest neighbour had a young population and tech-driven economy, he said. “Their view is it’s still an old place, mass-going, the Catholic church still has a grip, we’re still backward; it’s a misty, old-fashioned country that’s taken to the drink.”\n\nComedians tend to consume a lot of media and to focus on what audiences find familiar, said Callan. “So if British comedians don’t know about Ireland and aren’t talking about Irishness, it’s indicative that their audiences don’t either and this is because their media and their establishment are not paying attention.”\n\nOliver Callan, centre, with Josh Jones and Sophie Duker who take part in the podcast.\n\nIn the series Callan pokes fun at the Irish, suggesting they were created when a red-haired rabbit copulated with a long streak of misery that floated through upper Cavan. But after prodding his guests to recount Irish tropes, such as drunkenness, he responded with facts and statistics that challenged the stereotypes.\n\nThe comedians, who include Rhys James, Glenn Moore, Ana Magliano, Josh Weller and Sophie Duker, submitted themselves to tests on their “Mick ignorance”, regarding Irish culture, and a segment called “Great Britain or hate Britain” that asked them how aspects of Britishness are regarded in Ireland.\n\nFew were aware of Cromwell’s record in Ireland, though James recalled learning in school the Puritan leader had invaded and irked the natives with “cosmic ways”. Told about massacres and that Drogheda’s governor was beaten to death with his wooden leg, James replied, tongue in cheek: “Now you’ve told me I’m furious about it, mate. If you’re listening in Ireland, I’m livid about it.”\n\nKnowledge about the Great Famine was scant but Callan said the Irish extracted a revenge of sort when the resulting emigrant tide to Britain produced an infamous descendent, Piers Morgan. “So things have a way of evening out.”\n\nThe British comedians were fuzzy about Éamon de Valera, who dominated Irish politics for much of the 20th century, but noted his name’s resemblance to “devil” and Cruella de Vil.\n\nQuestions about Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, and his predecessor Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s first openly gay and mixed-race leader, drew a blank. The comedians were surprised to learn Joe Biden, John F Kennedy and other US presidents celebrated their Irish roots, and that Ireland had become a liberal, secular state.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Irish people followed British TV, British sport, British politics, but Britons showed little awareness or interest in Ireland. “Our intense focus on British matters is not even reciprocated at a micro level.”\n\nBritons had little reason to share navel-gazing Irish obsessions such as Biden’s Irish heritage but it was a shame they did not follow the example of King Charles, his late mother and other members of the royal family who have visited and engaged with Ireland, said Callan.\n\nThe satirist said Irish people had their own blinkers, such as ignorance about Northern Ireland and aspects of Britain, especially its geography. “We couldn’t place many cities on a map.” Brexit gave the Irish licence to create their own stereotypes, he said. “We milked it quite a bit to portray Britain as narrow-minded.” Even so, the Irish yearned for attention. “We just want the Brits to notice us.”",
    "Meet the Ballyclare 13-year-old roaring up the ranks of Northern Ireland motorbike racing": "You must be destined for greatness on two wheels if you were sitting on your own motorbike before you could walk.\n\nAnd that’s certainly the case for 13-year-old Ruben Sherman-Boyd from Ballyclare, Co Antrim, who is proving to be almost unbeatable on the Irish short circuit racing scene.\n\nHaving already piled up the championship wins at junior level, the Ballyclare High School pupil is continuing to blaze a trail through the motorcycling ranks.\n\nAt the weekend, Ruben completed his latest triumph when a remarkable 18th win from 18 starts saw him seal the 2022 Dunlop Masters DM Ground Works & FJS Plant Ltd Moto One Championship in a style he is becoming accustomed to.\n\nRuben didn’t even have to leave the grid for the final race of the championship series — he had the title in the bag long ago.\n\nBut mum Michelle said the family are doing all they can to keep his feet firmly on the ground.\n\n“Honestly, Ruben might be far from quiet around the house but he’s such a modest boy,” she said.\n\n“He didn’t even know he’d already won the championship ahead of last Saturday’s race. For him it’s about going out on the track, competing and above all having fun. We wouldn’t be making this commitment every weekend if there was no enjoyment in it, but when he pulls on that helmet he seems to be a different person.\n\n“It can be tricky watching from the trackside, though. Up until this year Ruben was competing against his 10-year-old brother Buster in the junior classes. I was never sure which way to look!”\n\nRead More\n\nRuben has taken the move up to the more senior ranks in his stride. He’s on course for further national championship success before the season ends as the trophy cabinet at home keeps on filling up.\n\nHaving been a pupil at Ballynure Primary, the school also attended by a young Jonathan Rea, it’s no surprise that the six-time World Superbike champion is an idol.\n\n“It’s Jonathan Rea all the way in our house,” added Michelle.\n\n“Ruben went to the airport a couple of years ago when he was arriving home after another world title win and couldn’t believe he was getting to meet Jonathan. He burst into tears. Jonathan signed his helmet and of course that’s now his most treasured possession.”\n\nExpand Close Ruben Sherman-Boyd in action / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Ruben Sherman-Boyd in action\n\nAnd with Ruben enjoying success after success on the track, it could only be a matter of time before he inspires a new generation himself.\n\n“Motorbikes are a family way of life,” said Michelle.\n\n“His grandad, Bertie Boyd, is his biggest fan. Bertie ran the successful Village Carpets team in the past and his team had a strong connection with the late David Wood, and that’s the academy Ruben’s now lucky enough to be a part of.”\n\nRuben was signed up for the Team Wood Academy after starring in the Irish Minibike Championships (IMC).\n\n“It was his uncle, Andrew Boyd, who bought him his first mini Yamaha,” said his mum. “That was for his first birthday, so he was sitting on a bike before he could even walk.”\n\nRuben has rarely got off a bike since. “I guess he was always destined to compete, and we’re proud of his achievements and the way he had handled himself off the track,” she said.\n\n“Being part of a bigger team now has really given him all the confidence in the world.\n\n“Every weekend it’s been bike racing. All his friends are there and it’s our family way of life.\n\n“He’s doing well and he’s thriving. The competitive streak comes out and this year has gone very well. He just wants to go out there and win every race.\n\n“He’s still modest though, and we’ll keep it that way.”",

    "Can Ireland's bumper savings be put to good use?": "Limited spending options and fears of what was to come turned Irish consumers into great savers during pandemic lockdowns.\n\nEven as the economy reopened, the average household was saving far more of their income than before – though recent data suggests the rising prices are forcing that to change.\n\nThis means that there is a huge bulk of money sitting in Irish bank accounts at the moment – right at a time when households, businesses and politicians search for ways to cover the rising cost of living.\n\nHow much money do people here have saved?\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nA huge amount – somewhere in the region of €146 billion by the end of July, according to the most recent figures from the Central Bank.\n\nTo put that into context, the upcoming budget is estimated to be worth around €6.5 billion– and that's a far bigger figure than it would be in a normal year, because of the billions of euro that are planned around the cost of living.\n\nSo the people of Ireland have more than 22 bumper budgets worth of cash sitting in their bank accounts at the moment.\n\nAnd that figure has ballooned significantly in the past two and a half years – because people saved an extraordinary amount during the pandemic.\n\nComparing the February 2020 figure with the July 2022 figure, there’s nearly €35 billion more in our savings. That’s the kind of money it would normally take a decade or more to build up.\n\nIt works out at about €28,600 for every person in the country.\n\nBut I don’t have anything like that in my bank account…\n\nUnfortunately, all of that money isn’t very evenly distributed.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, it’s the country’s higher earners that tend to hold the bulk of the money saved.\n\nIt should be said that most people in the country do have some level of savings – recent figures from the Central Statistics Office says that nearly 97% of households have some form of savings.\n\nBut the amount in those savings accounts tends to decline in line with the amount of disposable income a person has.\n\nThere are also links between the likelihood of having savings and your level of education, and whether someone is living in their own house or whether they’re renting.\n\nAnd that inequality in savings was only enhanced by the pandemic.\n\nIf you were to take two types of workers – let’s say, a high-earning tech worker, and regular retail worker.\n\nThere’s already a huge difference in their earnings here – but when the pandemic hit, the tech worker was able to continue doing their job from home, pretty much with no interruption.\n\nThat means their earnings stayed the same, in some cases they actually increased, and because they couldn’t go anywhere, suddenly all of their socialising money started building up in their bank account.\n\nThe retail worker also wouldn’t have had much available to spend their money on, but because they were forced to stop working altogether, and put onto the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they didn’t have much in the way of disposable income left once their bills were taken care of.\n\nAre we still saving our money?\n\nAs the economy began to reopen, there was lots of discussion about what might happen with all of the savings built up during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere were some – particularly retailers – who hoped that there might be some kind of post-lockdown spending spree.\n\nConsumer spending did rise – and some people seemed to put their savings towards some big ticket items, like a trip abroad. Some of the rapid rise in house prices has also been attributed to people directing their savings towards a deposit on a new home.\n\nBut while spending has been higher than before, it’s definitely not been the splurge that some had expected.\n\nIn fact, so far it seems as though people have continued their savings habit even as life returned to normal.\n\nThe most recent Household Savings stats from the CSO shows that people were still putting away almost 20% of their income in the middle of the year.\n\nThat’s about double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nPerhaps people realised that they were able to save more than they previously thought possible – or perhaps it shows that households are remaining cautious, particularly given the context of the war in Ukraine and talk of a recession in the Euro Zone.\n\nIt should be said, though, that these CSO figures only bring us to June – before the cost of living crisis really started to bite.\n\nA more recent survey from the Bank of Ireland shows that people are now saving less than they feel they should, because they simply can’t afford to.\n\nSo if we’re not spending it, what options do savers have to get the most out of their money?\n\nWell, if they’re looking to save it – there’s not a lot on offer at the moment.\n\nAcross the board, savings accounts are offering next to nothing in terms of interest – and that’s been the case ever since the European Central Bank dropped its interest rates to zero.\n\nECB interest rates are on the rise but so far the main Irish banks – outside of tracker mortgages - haven’t yet passed those on.\n\nThat’s good news for those on a variable mortgage, or someone with a personal loan, but it’s bad news for savers, because it means they’re not yet benefitting from the interest rate.\n\nFor those looking for a return on their money, investments are of course an option – but only if you have a lump sum of money that you’re happy to put out of reach for a couple of years.\n\nAnd, unlike savings, there’s no guarantee with investments – so you could end up losing money, or not making an awful lot.\n\nGenerally it’s about balancing risk and reward with this kind of thing – if you want the best chance of making a great return, you need to make riskier investments.\n\nIf you want to be sure you don’t lose money, you’re going to have to go with something that promises fairly modest returns.\n\nTake, for example, a 10 Year National Solidarity Bond– which is 100% guaranteed by the State.\n\nIf you put €1,000 into that today, in 10 years time you’ll get back €1,100.\n\nAnd with the current rate of inflation…\n\nThe is the problem facing all people saving at the moment – they’re getting little or nothing for their money, and the value of that money is being whittled away by the month.\n\nFor example, if you put that €1,000 into your savings at the start of the pandemic, in terms of buying power, it’s now effectively worth less than €890 because of inflation.\n\nThe rate of inflation is expected to tail off over the next year or two – but it’s still going to be higher than desired, which means your money is slowly losing value while it’s earning you nothing.\n\nSo what other options do savers have?\n\nWell, they could spend the money – though due to inflation there’s not much value to be had, especially if they were thinking of doing something like a home renovation or upgrade.\n\nPeople may also be unwilling to let go of their savings at the moment, for fear that they need it to fall back on if their household budgets get squeezed even further, or if there’s another economic downturn that threatens their income.\n\nAnd the general personal finance advice is to keep a certain amount of cash to hand at all times – just in case your income suddenly stops, or the washing machine breaks down.\n\nSo using up all of your savings isn’t a good idea either way.\n\nBut assuming you have money beyond that recommended buffer, paying off debt is probably a good use of money at the moment, especially if it’s high interest lending like on a credit card.\n\nThe most recent Central Bank statistics tell us that household debt stood at €128 billion late last year – so not too far behind what we have saved.\n\nIf people have the money to clear some of that, it might mean reducing or even wiping out a loan repayment altogether, which will bolster their monthly budget as they head into the winter.\n\nIn fact, even if you’re just paying off a part of a loan – like your mortgage – it will ultimately stand to you.\n\nAnother option is to put money towards a pension.\n\nFor many this is about as long-term of an investment as you can make, but we do know that a lack of pensions provision is a major issue in Ireland, and it takes a long time for people to build up the kind of pension pot that they would like to have a comfortable retirement.\n\nIs there any way for the Government to tap into those savings?\n\nWell it kind of does already – for example, any interest earned is liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax – or DIRT – at 33%.\n\nThough, given that people haven’t been earning much on their savings for the past few years, there isn’t really much money to be made from that tax at the moment.\n\nThe State Savings scheme, including things like the National Solidarity Bond and Prize Bonds are effective an attempt by Government to benefit from people’s savings, too.\n\nThat’s because they’re effectively a way for the State to borrow citizens’ money for an extended period of time, which they can then use for various investments and public services.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Government is actually in a bit of a bind when it comes to people’s savings.\n\nNormally if you were looking at businesses around the country struggling on the one hand, and billions and billions sitting in savings accounts on the other, it would make sense to try to come up with a scheme to try to unleash that cash in order to help businesses out.\n\nThink of some kind of reverse SSIA scheme that incentivises spending rather than saving.\n\nBut, if you were to do that, you run the risk of simply adding to the inflation problem at the moment – which would only prolong the pain that consumers and companies are facing right now.\n\nSo, as counter-intuitive as it seems, the Government probably doesn’t want too much money coming into the economy right now.\n\nIn fact, that’s partly why a central bank raises interest rates when it wants to cool economic activity. Because higher interest rates on your savings account – in theory at least – encourages you to save rather than spend.",
    "EU Cohesion Policy: €1.4 billion for Ireland's economic and social development and green transition in 2021-2027": "Ireland will benefit from €1.4 billion in Cohesion Policy funding between 2021-2027 to support the sustainable development of its economy.\n\nThe details and strategy for these investments are set out in the Partnership Agreement between Ireland and the Commission that is formally launched today.\n\nThese EU funds will help Ireland address regional disparities by boosting innovation and competitiveness, enabling the economy's digital transformation, investing in social inclusion, skills training and employment, and in the green transition.\n\nGreen transition, innovation and cross-border cooperation\n\n€396 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will strengthen regional innovation ecosystems by improving the capacities of the newly created ‘Technical Universities', which will function as regional knowledge hubs. Funds will also be invested to increase energy efficiency in housing, thereby helping families at risk of energy poverty, whilst contributing to the green and fair transition.\n\nERDF will also be of a great help for the revitalisation of town centres. The investments will improve the appearance and livability of medium sized and smaller towns in Ireland, in line with the principles of the New European Bauhaus.\n\nAdditionally, €293 million will be allocated to European cross-border cooperation programmes for joint development and peace activities in the Northern Periphery and Atlantic areas and with Northwest Europe.\n\nFinally, €84 million from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) will support Ireland's Midlands addressing the impact of the transition out of peat for electricity generation.\n\nEmployment and social inclusion\n\n€508 million from the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) will contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan and contribute to achieving EU-level social headline targets.\n\nOver half of the ESF+ envelope will contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion, with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups. More than 20,000 vulnerable children will benefit from improved access to social services tailor-made to their individual needs. To facilitate the social and employment integration of disadvantaged communities of people with a migrant background, the ESF+ will also finance mentoring, language and social skills training.\n\nESF+ funding will also improve the chances of people to get a job by providing training to up-and reskill, lifelong learning, and education measures. There will be a focus on assisting people who face greater challenges on the labour market, including over 6,000 persons with disabilities. In total, the programme aims to help 90,000 jobseekers to participate in a training course to develop new skills by 2029.\n\nSustainable fisheries, aquaculture and processing sector\n\nAround €142 million from the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) will enable the adaptation of the Irish fishing and aquaculture sectors to the present challenges. The funding will support the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, the growth of a sustainable blue economy and healthy, safe and sustainably management of seas and oceans. Investments in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will also contribute to the green transition in Ireland, by promoting development of small-scale coastal fisheries through community-led local development.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, said: “Following today's adoption of the Partnership Agreement, Ireland will receive support to further develop its economy in a fair and green manner, ensuring that no region is left behind. Since its accession to the EU in 1973, the country has benefitted from Cohesion Policy funds to support its transformation to a modern, innovation-led economy. Support under this new Partnership Agreement will continue to boost innovation across Irish regions, while also contributing to the green transition and to the quality of life in Irish towns. Ireland has a far-reaching smart, green and digital future ahead.”\n\nCommissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, added: “In these challenging times, having a fair and inclusive labour market and society is more important than ever. The ESF+ will make a positive difference in the everyday life of people in Ireland, especially focusing on those who need extra support, helping them to find new jobs, learn innovative skills and protecting them from poverty and social exclusion.”\n\nCommissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said: “This Partnership Agreement will create favourable conditions to support the development of a sustainable blue economy in the coastal, island and inland areas of Ireland. It will play a central role in increasing the resilience of fishing and aquaculture sectors, while enhance the protection of the marine environment and biodiversity. It will also support coastal communities and contribute to Ireland's pledge for a carbon neutral economy by 2050.”\n\nBackground\n\nUnder Cohesion Policy, and in cooperation with the Commission, each Member State prepares a Partnership Agreement, a strategic document for programming investments from the Cohesion Policy funds – ERDF, ESF+, and the Cohesion Fund – the JTF and the EMFAF during the Multiannual Financial Framework.\n\nThe Partnership Agreements focus on EU priorities, laying down the strategy and investment priorities identified by each Member State. They present a list of National and Regional Programmes adapted to the needs of the country for implementation of the investments on the ground, including the indicative annual financial allocation for each programme.\n\nThe Partnership Agreement with Ireland is the 22nd to be adopted following those of Greece, Germany, Austria, Czechia, Lithuania, Finland, Denmark, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Portugal, Estonia, Slovakia, Italy, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia and Malta.",
