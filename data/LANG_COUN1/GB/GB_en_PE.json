    "Top Things to See and Do When You Visit Peru": "One of the most popular destinations for anyone visiting Peru is Machu Picchu, however, it’s not the only attraction this South American country has to offer.\n\nThat’s not to say you shouldn’t include the Inca Trail as part of your Peru tours. Make sure it’s number one on the list, but remember to include one or more of the following.\n\nHike the Rainbow Mountain\n\nThis journey will be a day-long trek at more than 14,000 feet, but when you get to the rainbow-colored mountain it’ll be a scene you won’t forget.\n\nYou’ll be walking along a dirt path that winds between looming green peaks and eye-catching red rock but the route is gorgeous. Along the way, you’ll also find yourself walking past local villages built from local stone and alongside glittering mountain streams.\n\nSacred Valley\n\nIf you haven’t got the time to visit Machu Picchu, one alternative is to see the Sacred Valley. This tourist location includes an impressive Inca City known as Ollantaytambo and it’s a great place to explore.\n\nDune Hiking\n\nDid you even know that Peru has a desert? Well, it has and it’s a massive 188,700 square kilometers. While there’s nothing quite like hiking to the top of a dune to watch the sun go down, it’s also great fun riding around on a dune buggy.\n\nThe dunes in Peru are high enough to get your heart pounding. It could well be one of the most thrilling rides you’ve ever taken.\n\nHuacachina\n\nThis is the name given to a village that’s been built around a natural lake. It also happens to be located in the middle of the desert known as the Oasis of America.\n\nThe location is very beautiful and should be added to your list of things to do in Peru. Massive dunes surround the lake and along the shoreline, there are plenty of restaurants, guesthouses, and hotels where you can relax and chill out for a while.\n\nSandboarding\n\nIf you prefer to explore the dunes without the help of an engine, why not try sandboarding instead? If you’re already an expert snowboarder, you’ll soon get to grips with riding the sandy waves and carving out edges.\n\nNazca Lines\n\nThe Nazca Lines are possibly the coolest thing you can see in Peru. To date, nobody has been able to explain these ancient geoglyphs, which makes them all the more amazing.\n\nFrom the air, you can see 70 different plant and animal drawings along with hundreds of lines and other geometrical shapes. Some of the lines are 10 kilometers long and speak over hundreds of square kilometers.\n\nA few of the most notable figures are a lizard that measures 180 meters long, a condor with a 130-meter wingspan, and several other animals including a killer whale, spider, hummingbird, and a monkey.\n\nIt is thought that these unusual lines date back to 500 BC in Nazca culture. The Lines are one of the many UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Peru.\n\nThese intricate designs, created by primitive humans, reach 370 meters and have lasted for 2500 years.\n\nLake Titicaca\n\nThe picture at the top of the page is Lake Titicaca. It’s located at the border with Bolivia and is known for being the highest navigable lake in the world. It’s located at 3,812 meters in the Andes.\n\nApart from its height, Lake Titicaca is also somewhere where you can discover more about the culture of Peru. One memorable part of this visit is bound to be the famous floating houses.\n\nThe floating islands have been created by the Uros people out of reeds. Entire communities live their lives on the lake. As old rotting reeds float away, new reeds have to be added.\n\nThe best way to appreciate the lake is to take a boat trip to the islands and surrounding villages. While the floating islands are a popular attraction, the real charm of the area lies in the small villages lining the hills along the shores of the lake.\n\nParagliding Miraflores in Lima\n\nIf you’re a bit of an adrenalin junkie and are looking for something more adventurous to do, paragliding is for you. Peru is one of the easiest places to go paragliding and Lima is a city you should fly over. Walk down the cliffs at Miraflores and you’ll find plenty of guys willing to take you.\n\nPisco and the Ballestas Islands (Isla Ballestas)\n\nSometimes referred to as the “poor man’s Galapagos,” the Islas Ballestas are home to hundreds of thousands of birds, pelicans, dolphins, penguins, and large colonies of sea lions.\n\nYou can take a boat tour from Paracas and Pisco to the islands, leaving in the morning. The tour will take you past a hillside geoglyph, known as the “Candelabra.”\n\nAs you can see, there’s so much more to Peru than Machu Picchu. If you love an adventure, take a hike along the infamous Inca Trail to Machu Picchi. But don’t forget to include some of the suggestions above.",
    "Peru declares state of emergency after Amazon oil spills": "The government of Peru on Saturday declared a 90-day state of emergency in the Peruvian Amazon communities of Cuninico and Urarinas, two indigenous-inhabited areas whose rivers have been affected by oil spills. Official information shows that the zones are home to some 2,500 native individuals who depend on artisanal fishing.\n\nThe decision comes less than a fortnight after a rupture was reported in the Petroperú-controlled Norperuano Pipeline (ONP, in Spanish), a 40-year-old construction that is 1,106 kilometers long and takes oil from the Northeastern department of Loreto to the Pacific coastal port of Bayóvar, in the Piura province.\n\nMIDAGRI, a través de la @ANAPeru, verifica en campo los efectos causados por el derrame petróleo en la región #Loreto. pic.twitter.com/18P2DMP38P — MIDAGRI – PERÚ (@midagriperu) September 24, 2022\n\nIt is estimated that about 2,500 barrels of crude oil were spilled into local rivers as of this week, affecting at least six indigenous communities of the Kukumas ethnicity. According to state-owned Petroperú, the accident was caused by an intentional 21-centimeter-long cut in the pipes, the 11th “attack” suffered by the structure since January.\n\nPeru’s National Society of Mining, Petroleum, and Energy (SNMPE) says the Norperuano Pipeline has been the target of at least 29 acts of sabotage since 2014. Peruvian special environment prosecutors have already opened a new investigation.\n\nAs The Brazilian Report has previously explained, the 782,880 square kilometers of Peruvian territory considered part of the Amazon rainforest are threatened by climate change.",
    "Peru vaccinates u-5s against COVID-19": "Peru vaccinates u-5s against COVID-19\n\n26th Monday, September 2022 - 10:02 UTC Full article\n\nSome children have been in intensive care units, Vaccination Coordinator José Ipanaqué said\n\nPeruvian health authorities began vaccinating children under five years of age Sunday against COVID-19 with pediatric doses available in Lima and Callao.\n\nThese drugs are for children from six months to four years and eleven months of age, according to the Health Ministry (Minsa).\n\nThe importance of vaccinating this age group is because although it is true that there are no alarming figures that they could be infected or have become seriously ill, statistically speaking there are children who have been in intensive care units, Vaccination Coordinator José Ipanaqué said.\n\nHe also argued that children should be vaccinated because they spread the disease in their homes, which could become dangerous in families with a vulnerable member.\n\nIpanaqué also pointed out that 83.78 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been applied, with 29.86 million (91.1%) first doses, 28.21 million (86.1%) second doses, and 20.67 million (72.4%) third doses, according to the Repositorio Único Nacional de Información en Salud (Reunis).\n\nPeru has accumulated 4,140,874 confirmed cases and 216,473 COVID-19 deaths in a country with one of the highest mortality rates globally.\n\nAuthorities have also issued an epidemiological alert after an increase in cases of dengue. A Minsa statement showed that 58,117 cases and 75 deaths had been reported, mostly in Piura, Loreto, San Martin, Junin, Cajamarca, Ucayali, Cusco, Amazonas, Huanuco, and Madre de Dios.\n\nOf the total number of cases reported, 50,870 (87.53%) correspond to dengue without warning signs, 7,054 (12.14%) to dengue with warning signs, and 193 (0.33%) to severe dengue, while the national case fatality rate stands at 0.13%.\n\nMinsa also explained that the mosquito spreading this disease, the Aedes aegypti can be found in 22 regions, 94 provinces, and 528 districts of the country.\n\nIn addition, dengue has presented a seasonal behavior that coincides with the rainy season in the Amazon regions and with the summer season on the coast of the country, a Minsa statement read.\n\nWith the new epidemiological alert, the second issued so far this year, Minsa seeks to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance system and the adoption of preparedness and response measures to protect the health of the population in vulnerable areas. The increase in dengue cases in 2022 has been higher when compared to the same period of the previous year, as 30,873 cases and 28 deaths had been reported by the same date in 2021.\n\n(Source: Xinhua)",
    "Anglo American commences copper mining at its Quellaveco project in Peru": "Anglo American is one of the world’s largest diversified mining groups with operations in Africa, Europe, South and North America, Australia and Asia.\n\nFollowing successful operations testing and final regulatory clearance, Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) has started commercial copper operations at its Quellaveco project in Peru.\n\nQuellaveco is expected to produce 300,000 tonnes per year of copper equivalent volume on average over its first 10 years of operation.\n\nIn a statement, Anglo American chief executive officer Duncan Wanblad said: \"Our delivery of Quellaveco, a major new world-class copper mine, is a testament to the incredible efforts of our workforce and our commitment to our stakeholders in Peru over many years.\n\n\"Quellaveco alone is expected to lift our total global output by 10% in copper equivalent terms and take our total copper production close to 1mln tonnes per year.”\n\nCommenting on the operations, Ruben Fernandes, chief executive officer of the company’s Base Metals segment, said: “We designed Quellaveco as one of Anglo American's and South America's most technologically advanced mines, incorporating autonomous drilling and haulage fleets – a first in Peru – a remote operations centre, as well as a number of Anglo American's digital and advanced processing technologies.”\n\nAnglo American expects that Quellaveco will ramp up fully over the next nine to 12 months.",
    "Preview: Peru vs. El Salvador - prediction, team news, lineups": "Sports Mole previews Wednesday's International Friendlies clash between Peru and El Salvador, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nPeru will face off against El Salvador at Audi Field in Washington DC on Tuesday, with both sides having to look forward to a summer without World Cup football.\n\nHugo Perez's El Salvador will be playing their first game since June, after their scheduled friendly on Friday against Honduras was cancelled.\n\nMatch preview\n\n© Reuters\n\nAfter losing out to the heroics of Australian keeper Andrew Redmayne in the intercontinental playoff for one of the final World Cup places, Peru returned to the international stage with a 1-0 friendly defeat to Mexico on Saturday.\n\n2022 started off well for Peru, but everything came down to qualifying for the World Cup. They missed out on automatic qualification by two points and, after losing the playoff, manager Ricardo Gareca resigned, being replaced by former Cruz Azul manager Juan Reynoso.\n\nFans in the United States, where this fixture against El Salvador is being held, will be familiar with Seattle Sounders striker Raul Ruidiaz, who has reached double-digit goals every year since 2018 and has scored nine MLS goals so far this season.\n\nManager Reynoso will be looking to learn more about his side in this friendly, as the international year comes to a premature end for them.\n\nThe next competitive chance to test his team will be in the 2024 Copa America, so this friendly gives him an opportunity to experiment and familiarise himself with the team.\n\nEl Salvador had a difficult time in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying, only picking up 10 points in 14 games and finishing seventh in the table.\n\nHowever, the 2026 World Cup will provide an unprecedented opportunity for CONCACAF sides to reach the biggest stage, and Hugo Perez's side will be bidding to qualify for their first World Cup since 1982.\n\nWith the USA, Canada and Mexico hosting the tournament, six CONCACAF teams will have automatic places after qualifying, with the three hosts included.\n\nOn top of that, two CONCACAF teams will compete in the intercontinental playoffs, so there are plenty of chances to qualify if El Salvador can find a winning formula.\n\nThe CONCACAF Nations League has been successful for La Selecta, with El Salvador having already secured their place in the Gold Cup and still in contention for a Nations League Finals spot depending on their result against USA, who they held to a 1-1 draw in their last outing, next year.\n\nSince becoming the manager in April 2021, Perez has made significant steps to improve the team; not only have the results in the Nations League been positive but Perez has also emphasised picking players born in the United States to Salvadoran parents to help bolster the roster he can choose from.\n\nNelson Bonilla will be key to the El Salvador attack if they are to provide any attacking threat against Peru; he scored twice in their 3-1 win against Grenada, their only win in a successful Nations League campaign so far.\n\nPeru International Friendlies form:\n\nPeru form (all competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Salvador International Friendlies form:\n\nEl Salvador form (all competitions):\n\nTeam News\n\n© Reuters\n\nThe lineup for Peru is challenging to predict as it is only Juan Reynoso's second game in charge; he played a 4-2-3-1 formation against Mexico, as opposed to the 4-1-4-1 that his predecessor regularly played.\n\nOne decision that will be interesting to see is if he starts Anderson Santamaria or Carlos Zambrano at centre-back - Santamaria started the last game against Mexico but was taken off at half time.\n\nIn the Nations League, El Salvador used the 4-2-3-1 formation twice in their three games so far so could well match formations with Peru in this fixture.\n\nThe selection of the attacking midfielder could be the key choice to look out for in the starting lineup. Christian Martinez, Eric Calvillo and Enrico Hernandez have all played that position in the Nations League, so there are plenty of options to choose from.\n\nPeru possible starting lineup:\n\nGallese; Lopez, Callens, Zambrano, Advincula; Flores, Tapia, Cueva, Aquino, Carrillo; Ruidiaz\n\nEl Salvador possible starting lineup:\n\nGonzalez; Larin, Dominguez, Gomez, Tamacas; Reyes, Orellana, Martinez, Landaverde, Henriquez; Bonilla\n\nWe say: Peru 1-2 El Salvador\n\nWith El Salvador having a much more settled side and Peru having a manager who is only taking charge of his second game for the national team, there is a chance for El Salvador to pick up a really good result here. After their draw against the USA, a win in this fixture could definitely be on the cards.\n\n\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nTop tip Under 3.5:data Our expert tipster partners at Sporita.com are predicting under 3.5 goals in this match.

    "Peru set for double-digit hike in grape exports": "Shipments are forecast to reach 71.5m cartons in 2022/23 according to initial forecasts from Provid\n\nPeruvian table grape exports could top 600,000 tonnes of grapes in the 2022/23 campaign, equivalent to 71.5m (8.2kg) cartons, according to the latest forecast from industry association Provid. This would represent an increase of 11 per cent on last season.\n\nLogistical disruption is once again set to cause major headaches for exporters, while soaring production and shipping costs and the strengthening dollar will likely impact the profitability of the campaign.\n\nAs with last season, there are concerns that the low availability of containers, late changes to shipping itineraries and slow clearance of consignments through customs could add days, if not weeks, onto journey times, putting considerable pressure on fruit quality and shelf-life.\n\nNational plant health authority Senasa said it plans to authorise 23,000ha of grape plantings located in the regions of Ica, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Arequipa and Ancash, along with 104 packhouses ahead of the new season.\n\nMeanwhile, the sector continues to work hard to open new markets. This season will see the first exports to Japan, while negotiations with Chile and Japan are also reported to be at an advanced stage, with both markets expected to open in the short term.",

REUTERS/Marcelo Rochabrun\n\nLIMA, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Vladimir Cerron, the head of the far-left party that ushered Peruvian President Pedro Castillo into power last year, told Reuters on Tuesday that his congressional bloc is still committed to staving off impeachment attempts against the embattled leader.\n\nCastillo won the election by a razor-thin margin last year, spooking investors on the campaign trail with a radical plan written by Cerron, the head of the Marxist-Leninist Peru Libre party. The plan included rewriting the constitution and nationalizing key industries. Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer.\n\nBut once in office, Castillo has kept the economy under moderate hands and said he will not change Peru's market-friendly rules, angering Cerron who demanded Castillo's resignation from the party, which Castillo agreed to. However, Cerron still supports Castillo remaining in the presidency.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"What is missing for a (successful) impeachment are a few votes that Peru Libre could have provided at any moment,\" Cerron, a neurosurgeon trained in Cuba, told Reuters in a rare interview at his party headquarters.\n\n\"And that is definitely not our intention...Peru Libre remains an insurmountable barrier so far.\"\n\nPeru Libre controls 16 of 130 seats in Peru's unicameral Congress. Ousting Castillo requires 87 votes, but the two impeachment trials so far yielded 46 and 55 votes respectively.\n\nCerron's remarks will give Castillo breathing room at a time when some lawmakers in the opposition-led Congress are discussing launching a third impeachment attempt, although they have acknowledged they do not currently have enough votes.\n\nPeruvian politics are notoriously volatile, cycling through five presidents since 2016 and witnessing six impeachment trials in the same period.\n\nCerron said he would like Castillo to finish his term in 2026, which would make him the first elected president in a decade to do so, after Ollanta Humala who took office in 2011.\n\nCastillo is also in a weak spot, besieged by six criminal investigations, among them whether he has used the presidency to benefit his family and whether he has obstructed justice to protect key allies. His sister-in-law has been jailed, while a former minister remains on the run.\n\nCastillo has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNEW CONSTITUTION EFFORTS STALLED\n\nCerron said Peru Libre is not currently seeking a constitutional assembly to redraft the Constitution.\n\nWhile writing a new magna carta remains a key party objective, he acknowledged currently there is no legal way to achieve that without persuading a majority of Congress, which remains split among conservative parties that are opposed to a rewrite.\n\n\"The doors have been closed not just for Peru Libre but for other social organizations that were supporting (a new constitution,)\" Cerron said.\n\nWhile analysts have said a constitutional rewrite is unlikely, Cerron's comments are the strongest so far acknowledging that improbable scenario.\n\nHe added he has not spoken with Castillo in a month and that Castillo's administration has abandoned virtually all of Peru Libre's objectives.\n\nCastillo \"is a pragmatic man,\" Cerron said. \"He's a president who is facing the day-to-day without having an agenda for the future.\"\n\n(In paragraph 6, corrects voting tally of first impeachment attempt to 46, not 76)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marcelo Rochabrun and Marco Aquino; Editing by Josie Kao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Household survey data indicates that recent decades of high output growth also witnessed a substantial narrowing of socioeconomic gaps among ethnicities. Most notably, the Mestizo ethnic group surpassed the White group in income per capita, and Native American also experienced a relative improvement. Mincerian regression analysis suggests that the main contributors to these developments were rural-to-urban migration and increased education. Based on our statistical findings, we propose enhancing education and other public services, increasing government revenues, lowering informality, and promoting competition as the main public policies that could accelerate the ongoing narrowing of ethnic gaps.",
    "Paradise lost: Inside Peru's emergency zone": "One woman said she was 16 when she agreed to work at a bar in the area in August 2021 on the promise of making more money in a week than most make in a month. She said she had no idea that the job would involve sexually catering to men. She was ultimately paid $50 for sex, but also had to endure physical and psychological abuse from her boss and the boss’s children.\n\n“The entire time I worked there was absolute hell,” said the woman, who managed to escape in March after police raided the illicit establishment. “I would not want even one more woman to go through the same thing.”\n\nDiana Valencia, a prosecutor in Madre de Dios focused on human trafficking, said her office brought charges against 90 people in the first six months of this year.\n\nA young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado. A young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado.\n\nU.S. authorities and the Peruvian national police are now assisting local law enforcement in the region. In February, a U.S.-assisted operation led to the arrest of three trafficking suspects and the rescue of multiple victims.\n\n“Many of the victims are threatened,” Valencia said. “When they get to the place, they are deprived of their liberty, their ID is retained, so that they can’t leave.”\n\nGuadalupe eventually stopped traveling to the camps himself because of the various dangers and instead focused on expanding his network of collaborators. The local police started raiding the prosti-bars and bringing the young girls they rescued to Guadalupe’s shelter, where they would be provided with clothes, food, education and a bed.\n\nThe shelter also welcomed poor kids who moved to Mazuko to attend school but had no family in the area. Those rescued from the mines would join in on the lessons, Guadalupe said, providing a mental escape from the horrors they had endured.\n\nIn all, Guadalupe said more than 1,000 children had passed through his shelter until he closed it in 2019 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic. The local government had by then set up its own facility to house children trafficked to the mines.\n\n\n\nGuadalupe said the youngest boy he cared for was 8; the youngest girl was 9. Some of the children stayed for a couple of days, others for a couple of years.\n\nSome of them went on to become college students and parents themselves. One is now studying medicine in college in order to become a doctor.\n\n“I don’t think that I have done a great job,” Guadalupe said. “I just did what I had to do.”\n\nHe now travels the country educating people on the dangers of child trafficking. But there are some stories he cannot tell without breaking down.\n\nThe first girl he rescued was a 13-year-old who spoke no Spanish, only an Indigenous language. When Guadalupe found her, she was sick with an infection after being sexually abused by miners.\n\nGuadalupe brought her to a local clinic but they weren’t able to pursue her attackers because she didn’t know their names. At the time he still didn’t know that the men who abuse girls like her rarely face justice because the mines are so remote and catching them in the act is difficult.\n\nEven two decades later, he said he’s still haunted by what that young girl went through and the lack of accountability for her abusers.\n\n“When we remember it, we feel we haven’t done anything,” he said with tears in his eyes.",
    "76 Pre-Inca Child Sacrifices Found at Peru’s Pampa La Cruz site": "Archaeologists working at the pre-Inca Pampa La Cruz site in Peru have found even more evidence of Chimu child sacrifice practices. The sacrificial remains of 76 more children have been discovered at the site, located in the remote Huanchaco district about 190 miles (305 kilometers) north of Lima. The Pampa La Cruz site is a large, pre-Inca Chimu culture archaeological dig that has yielded many child sacrifices, adult graves, and countless artifacts.\n\nThe first mass child sacrifice graves discovered at this site have led to many more. In fact, child sacrifice seems to have been somewhat of a routine practice among the Chimu.\n\nIncluding the latest 76 Pampa La Cruz child sacrifices, the remains of 302 child sacrifice victims have been dug up in the area so far, according to Peru’s Andina news agency .\n\nThe Pampa La Cruz Site Reveals Dominant Pre-Inca Culture\n\nThe Chimu culture flourished along a strip of desert on the northern coast of Peru from about 900 to 1470 AD. The Chimu, with their capital at Chan Chan , had the largest and most important political system in Peru before the Inca.\n\nThe Chimu culture was based largely on agriculture, for which they carried out immense works of irrigation engineering that created a large network of hydraulic canals, which carried water from the mountains to fields, palaces and temples, according to a 2019 Ancient Origins article . The Chimu also produced extraordinary textiles, and gold, silver, and copper objects. Chimu society was highly stratified extending from the peasants at the bottom to the nobles at the top.\n\nAlthough now an uninhabitable water-scarce region, Chan Chan, the powerful Chimu culture capital, was once an extensive city that covered over 14 square miles (36 square kilometers). Adobe brick architecture was used to create streets, lofty walls, reservoirs, pyramids, and houses. At its peak Chan Chan’s population likely numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1465-70 AD, the Chimu were conquered by the Inca ruler Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui and his son Topa Inca Yupanqui . Many elements of Chimu culture, from political organization to irrigation and road engineering, were incorporated into the Inca imperial system after their conquest of the Chimu.\n\nRecent excavations at the north Peruvian Pampa La Cruz site during which 76 more child sacrifices were found. ( andina / Huanchaco Archaeological Program)\n\nEarlier Child Sacrifice Discoveries in Pampa La Cruz Region\n\nHuman sacrifice remains, particularly of children, have been discovered multiple times in the Pampa La Cruz region, indicating that this was a common practice among the Chimu. Pampa La Cruz is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of Chan Chan.\n\nRemains of hundreds of children were found at the Pampa La Cruz site in 2018 and 2019. Feren Castillo, the chief archaeologist at the site, is quoted by the Guardian as saying in 2019, “This is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found. There isn’t another like it anywhere else in the world. It’s uncontrollable, this thing with the children. Wherever you dig, there’s another one.”\n\nAlthough archaeological work in Huanchaco started in 2011, the first findings were only published in 2018. Researchers reported the discovery of the sacrificed remains of 140 children and 200 llamas from Huanchaquito in April 2018. In June 2018, another 56 human skeletons were found in the neighboring site of Pampa La Cruz.\n\nThe archaeologists also found the remains of small footprints that survived rain and erosion . The footprints suggest that the children were marched, likely from Chan Chan, to meet their grisly end at these numerous sacrificial sites.\n\nAccording to experts in this field, the sacrifices were made to appease the gods when heavy El Nino rains caused flooding.\n\nA recently unearthed child sacrifice skeleton, at the bottom of this image, is vivid and the teeth are all perfect. ( andina / Huanchaco Archaeological Program)\n\nHow Frequent? Six Separate Sacrificial Events in 450 Years\n\nThe Andina news agency reports that radiocarbon dating has established that there were six separate child sacrifice events carried out over more than 450 years in the Pampa La Cruz area. The six events, dated to between 1050 and 1500, were associated with important junctures in the founding, development and consolidation of Chimu development.\n\nThe latest 76 skeletons were unearthed during the July-August excavation period. Of these, 25 graves were found in Mound I and the other 51 were uncovered in Mound II. The most curious discovery was the tomb of five females buried sitting head to head in a loose circle. This tomb was unearthed in Mound I. Experts have yet to come up with an explanation for this unusual burial.\n\nGabriel Prieto, the head of the Huanchaco Archaeological Program (Pahuan), who is a researcher at the University of Florida, told the Andina news agency that the earliest child sacrificial event occurred around AD 1050.\n\nAll the Huanchaco child burials shared one other thing, besides their sacrificial end. They were all buried with their feet facing east and their heads west. In that position they would have had the ocean, the Pacific Ocean, behind them and would have been facing the rising sun.\n\nWhile past cultures shouldn’t be viewed through the prism of modern sensibilities, it is difficult to imagine mass child sacrifice not causing widespread trauma in any society.

    "Green Investment opportunities in Peru highlights the potential of GSS+ market growth in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC)": "New report by Climate Bonds and LAGreen Fund presents a sector roadmap for sustainable finance development\n\nYesterday (15 September), at Estudio Echecopar in Lima, the Climate Bonds Initiative and the LAGreen Fund launched the Peru Sustainable Finance State of the Market 2022, the first report of its kind about the country.\n\nPeru was the first country in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to issue a green bond (2014). As the fourth-largest country, and sixth economy in the region, there is potential for a green investment pipeline in the country. The Peruvian sustainable finance market is advancing with important milestones to encourage green, social and sustainability issuances, such as the guides by the Lima Stock Exchanges and discussions to develop a local taxonomy by 2025.\n\nLeisa Souza, Head of Latin America, Climate Bonds Initiative\n\n\"Peru is an important player in the Latin American sustainable debt market, being the first country to issue a green bond in the region. The growth of GSS+ bonds has been timid, but there is potential to favour further labelled issuances. The Peru State of the Market highlights a few of the opportunities for Peru and we are excited about how it can contribute to the discussions in the country and support more deals from Peruvian issuers.\"\n\nDiana Arango, Member of LAGreen’s Investment Committee and Technical Assistance Facility\n\n\"The green debt market in Peru has shown progressive growth, a fact which is confirmed by the Peru State of the Market. With this report, we aim to empowered local players to be agents of change who can innovate the financial system to deliver tangible climate and environmental impact. The LAGreen Fund and Technical Assistance Facility are there to complement the knowledge shared in the report by offering support, insight and potential financing to current and future GSS+ bonds issuance in Peru.”\n\nA USD6.6bn market\n\nAccording to the report, after issuing the first green bond deal in the LAC region, the Peruvian market experienced a hiatus between 2015 and 2017. It was only after the launch of the Green Bond Guide for Peru by the Lima Stock Exchange in March 2018 that the green bond market picked up again.\n\nGreen, social and sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSS+) deals originating from Peru increased in 2021, reaching USD4.8bn. Three large sovereign social and sustainability bonds account for 90% of the total. Green bonds account for 17% of Peru's GSS+ deals, with a cumulative USD1.1bn issued up to April 2022. 2019 was the record year for green issuance with USD652m. Non-financial corporates represent 97% of the cumulative issuance volume.\n\nGreen investment opportunities in Peru\n\nBased on the Climate Bonds Taxonomy, the report mapped the most relevant sectors for Peru's sustainable finance development:\n\nRenewable energy: More than 65% of its electricity mix comes from renewable sources, mainly hydropower (60%). Hydropower has a generation potential 13 times greater than the installed hydro capacity, and wind power has a generation potential 58 times greater than the installed wind capacity.\n\nSustainable water management: There is a USD22bn funding gap in sanitation that must be addressed to leverage growth, while Peru's water sector faces challenges as pollution of water bodies and wastewater treatment.\n\nLow-carbon agriculture: Agriculture and livestock are important economic sectors in the country, and while there are concerns around deforestation. Due to Peru’s location, there are opportunities to promote low-carbon agriculture management and best practices. Government launched the Sustainable Production Coalition to support these efforts.\n\nSustainable forest management: The sustainable management of the Peruvian Amazon through investments in forest maintenance and controlled production of timber and non-timber products in monitored areas can support the elimination of illegal logging and intensive extraction of valuable environmental assets.\n\nLow-carbon transport: Peru is committed to shifting its transport modals, as the transport system relies predominantly on roads. There is an infrastructure gap, with around USD49bn needed in investments by 2038.\n\nTaxonomy: Following other Latin American and Caribbean countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, Peru should develop a national green finance taxonomy by 2025, which is an important step to identity sectors that are economically relevant to a low-carbon transition in the country.\n\nTransition: Peru must support the transition of its hard-to-abate sectors that are critical to economic stability. Sectors such as industrials, cement, steel, mining and oil and gas are not eligible for green UoP investments, but SLBs or transition bonds could be issued to support transformation aligned to a 1.5ºC trajectory. Climate Bonds is developing transition criteria to support the decarbonization of these sectors. A Steel Paper will be launched soon, and the Cement and Chemicals Criteria are under development.\n\nBarriers to growth in Peru’s sustainable finance market\n\nCurrency hedging: Local issuers prefer GSS+ bonds to be denominated in local currency, which makes foreign investors require currency hedging solutions to avoid credit risk with currency risk. Currency risk is a challenge in Emerging Markets, as contracting debt in hard currencies is a higher risk and more expensive to local issuers.\n\nMarket liquidity: Peru’s capital market still struggles with lower liquidity and diversity than other LAC markets. There is a high incidence of informal labour in the country, which has prevented the establishment of a large, liquid, poll of local pension fund capital.\n\nIssuance costs: The issuance costs of smaller bonds are relatively high compared to loan financing in emerging markets like Peru. These higher costs can deter smaller issues from entering the market, while for larger deals, the costs are negligible, yet the issuer may perceive the additional steps to obtain a GSS+ label as a barrier to entry.\n\nBankability and pipeline: The risk exposure and risk-return profile of GSS+ projects may be higher than in other traditional sectors. Lack of pipeline is also a barrier for investors.\n\nMarket awareness: The understanding of thematic bonds and best practices is a central barrier for markets in LAC. Further education is needed to grow the market and to improve the business environment for GSS+ instruments.\n\nPolitical environment: Peru has a complex political landscape that is frequently changing. Market uncertainties can shift investment perceptions and capital flight to other countries. Opportunities in the GSS+ market could be encouraged through policy and institutional changes.\n\nThe Last Word\n\nThe report provides a roadmap to growing Peru’s sustainable finance market and identifies stakeholders and their roles to expand green investments in the country. For example, investors influence the market by building demand and incorporating green and sustainability into their investment policy guidelines. Regulators and policymakers can set policies and promote a conducive environment to facilitate the issuance of labelled bonds. Finally, intermediates can support local market players to follow best practices and come to the market.\n\nThe fact that the Ministry of Environment announced its intention to develop a Green Finance Taxonomy, supported by the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ), is very exciting for market development in the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n\nSustainable finance can protect the country's natural resources to ensure resilient economic growth, which addresses its increasing vulnerability to natural disasters and other climate impacts. Peru's sustainability journey is underway, and the market must scale to achieve the required impact needed to transform the country.\n\nDownload the report now: < https://bit.ly/3DN6tZV > STAY TUNED!

    "JetSMART Peru Granted Permission To Conduct International Flights": "JetSMART Peru has now got access to 22 new routes and can start spreading its wings deeper into South America.\n\nLittle more than three months since it launched operations, JetSMART Peru has been granted rights to 22 new routes. These rights include flights from Peru to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile.\n\nThe rights were issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru (DGAC). According to Aviacionline.com, the DGAC said it had granted the request of the local subsidiary of JetSMART and authorized operations to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile. JetSMART Peru is allowed to carry out regular passenger, cargo and mail operations with third and fourth freedom air traffic rights. The report said these are in accordance with the pre-existing agreements of the Andean Community, the Fortaleza Agreement and the bilateral agreement between Peru and Chile.\n\nMore A320neos will be needed in Peru\n\nJetSMART Peru has a fleet of three Airbus A320neos and will need more to service the new routes. Photo: JetSMART.\n\nOf the 22 routes listed, all but one allow for up to seven weekly services, with the outlier being the Lima - Santiago - Lima route which allows for up to 16 weekly services. If all the new routes were taken, admittedly an unlikely scenario, that would add 163 new services to the 15 routes and 12 destinations JetSMART Peru currently operates. Data from ch-aviation.com shows the airline, a subsidiary of JetSMART, has three Airbus A320-200neos, which is not enough to take on 22 new routes.\n\nParent company JetSMART has a larger fleet of four A320-200s, three A320-200neos and one A321-200neo. However, the data lists JetSMART has outstanding orders with Airbus for 105 aircraft, including 43 A320neos, 48 A321neos and 14 A321XLRs. How and where those aircraft will be deployed is not shown, but they will likely find homes in the group's airlines in Chile, Argentina and Peru. JetSMART Peru launched operations in June with an inaugural domestic flight from Lima to Arequipa, one of the 13 routes in its initial network.\n\nA part of JetSMART's strategy is to offer SMART routes, which are interregional routes that connect point to point and bypass Lima. These are Arequipa-Cuzco, Arequipa-Trujillo, Arequipa-Piura and Arequipa-Tarapoto. Arequipa is a commercial and industrial center in Peru, located around 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) south of Lima, with approximately one million inhabitants.\n\nA strong ULCC pedigree\n\nJetSMART first commenced services in Chile, its home base, in 2017, followed by JetSMART Argentina in 2019 and JetSMART Peru in 2022. The company is owned by Indigo Partners, which invests in three other ultra-low-cost carriers, Frontier Airlines, Volaris and Wizz Air. In 2019 Peru was a growing market for air travel, with 14 million domestic and 12.3 million international passengers, although that fell to eight million domestic and 3.4 million international passengers in 2021.\n\nJetSMART expects to receive 105 aircraft from Airbus, including 48 A321neo and 14 A321XLR.

    "Amid disgust over corruption, Peru regional elections spark little enthusiasm": "By Paula Bayarte\n\nLima, Sep 21 (EFE) – A deep cynicism reigns on the streets of Peru ahead of next month’s regional and municipal elections, with most people slamming the country’s political class as hopelessly corrupt and saying virtually no candidates deserve their support.\n\n“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for because there are no proper candidates,” Manuel, a street fruit vendor in a working-class Lima neighborhood, told Efe.\n\nAsked what he is looking for in the next mayor of this capital, he said “someone without a (criminal past) who has done something for his people would be enough,” though adding that none of the candidates are to his liking.\n\nRegional and municipal elections are scheduled to be held on Oct. 2.\n\nBut despite their proximity, there has been a striking lack of political rallies and a notable absence of headline-grabbing proposals by the candidates.\n\nThe only indication of the upcoming balloting is the presence of campaign signs, particularly in poorer neighborhoods and small municipalities, as well as some traffic-blocking public works projects.\n\nThose latter initiatives are also viewed cynically by a jaded electorate, who say they are a telltale sign that elections are around the corner.\n\nManuel’s sentiments are echoed by most other ordinary citizens, who say they assume all politicians are corrupt. Indeed, the level of distrust is so high that voter participation would inevitably be very low if the country did not have compulsory voting laws.\n\n“There will aways be corruption, whether the candidate is good or bad. The only way to vote for a non-corrupt candidate is to vote for the last one on the list,” Gamaliel joked while standing outside a shopping mall in this capital with his wife, who said she will vote for the current mayor of the Lima district of Chorrillos even though he is ineligible to run again.\n\nThe indifference of voters contrasts with an ongoing intense political crisis that is now the main focus of news coverage in Peru.\n\n“They’re all scoundrels. All my life they’ve done the same. I’ve lived here since 1952, and there hasn’t been one good candidate. They’re all thieves. It’s a shame. I won’t vote. I’m 81 years old and I’ve always gone (to cast a ballot), but I don’t need anyone anymore because I live happily with my work. A total change is needed,” one passer-by, Manuel Sialer, said.\n\nAnother woman riding in a combi (a small minibus) who preferred to remain anonymous said she will cast a blank ballot because “these mayors come in, steal and do nothing.”\n\nOne teenager Efe spoke to expressed similar disgust with the political class.\n\n“Young people aren’t very interested. They’re into their own things and vote just to vote,” Jair Manosalva, a 19-year-old from Peru’s northern coastal region, told Efe outside a Lima gym. “They’ve disappointed us too much. We don’t care about them anymore. So whoever wins is going to be the same as the next one or the one who just left.”\n\nThe front runners in Lima mayor’s race are Daniel Urresti, a retired army general and former interior minister; and Rafael Lopez Aliaga, a businessman and right-wing populist.\n\nBoth have pledged to battle corruption and crime if elected.\n\nAgustin Luyo, a shoe shiner in Villa Maria del Triunfo, says the fight against street crime is the top priority for residents of that low-income district on Lima’s south side.\n\nGuillermo, who spoke to Efe on the opposite side of the city, said he is voting for Lopez Aliaga because that candidate will “clean up corruption” and “improve public safety.” EFE\n\npbc/mc",
    "The Mennonites being accused of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon": "Were it not for the ebullient fecundity of the Amazon rainforest surrounding it, Wanderland could almost be a stretch of Dutch farmland from the 19th century; a straight muddy track bisects rows of neatly spaced farmyards with perpendicular houses and barns.\n\nA typical morning begins as horse-drawn buggies driven by smiling blond-haired, blue-eyed boys collect shiny churns of fresh milk from farm gates to be made into cheese. The name given to this pastoral idyll carved out of thick foliage of the jungle seems to need little translation, even from Plautdietsch, the mixture of Low German and Dutch spoken by its inhabitants.\n\nBut there is unease in this rustic paradise. It is one of three Mennonite communities being investigated by Peruvian prosecutors over accusations of illegally deforesting more than 3,440 hectares (34 sq km) of tropical rainforest in the past five years. The brush with the law has alarmed the community of about 100 families who fear they could lose the land which they have made their home.\n\nAbraham Thiesen, 44, who arrived to Peru with his wife and six children in 2015, is among several hundred of the secretive Anabaptist Christian group which traces its origins to 16th-century Friesland who migrated from Bolivia, along with others from Belize, where they have long-established populations.\n\nThiesen, president of the Wanderland Mennonite association, says they acquired the land in good faith for agricultural purposes on the understanding that they would be granted legal titles once the area was cleared for farming.\n\nMennonite boys carry out chores on the farm from a young age. By the age of 13 they are working full-time. Photograph: The Guardian\n\nBut that explanation was rejected by environmental prosecutor José Luis Guzmán. “I can’t deforest and then ask for a permit! It doesn’t work like that,” he said.\n\n“In order to carry out deforestation there – to remove the vegetation cover of trees and forests – you need a permit from the state, and in this case, they did not have any permit,” Guzmán said from his dilapidated office in Pucallpa, the frontier capital of Peru’s Amazon Ucayali region. He has opened an investigation into whether the Christian group should be formally accused of deforestation.\n\nBut Thiesen said: “We have come here for good.” Entire families, typically with four to seven children, had uprooted from their communities in Bolivia’s sprawling lowlands and invested their savings in the new land deep in the Peruvian Amazon. “We are not thinking of moving because we are already established here,” added Thiesen, his ruddy face framed by the typical straw cowboy hat worn by all the community’s menfolk.\n\n“Our hope is that we can be allowed to work peacefully, because where are we going to get enough to eat if they don’t let us work the land,” he added. Farming is a tenet of their faith, Thiesen explains, they believe God commanded them to work the land to live ever since Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden.\n\nBut these Old Order Mennonites, the most orthodox of the pacifist sect, which has spread from Canada to India in their search for isolation and grand expanses of land to farm, may have fallen afoul of the notorious informality and corruption often linked to land-titling in the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nThey say they had initially bought 500 hectares (5 sq km) of land in 2015 near Pucallpa which they swapped with a wealthy timber merchant for more than 3,000 hectares of rainforest where the three communities are established.\n\n‘Our hope is that we can be allowed to work peacefully, because where are we going to get enough to eat if they don’t let us work the land.’ Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian\n\nThe remote tract of jungle suited the Mennonites’ preference for being left alone. The Guardian travelled for 14 hours by boat down the Ucayali river and drove for another hour along a muddy track to visit the community which sits about halfway between Pucallpa and Iquitos, the largest city in the world accessible only by boat or plane.\n\nThe nearest settlement to the new Mennonite colonies, Tierra Blanca, is a poor riverside outpost which suffers occasional outbursts of violence as it sits on a cocaine trafficking route. There the local people welcome the dungaree-clad settlers and the womenfolk in long cape dresses with curious amusement. Old-timers say decades of logging has stripped any valuable tropical hardwoods from the forest where the communities now live.\n\n“It was secondary [forest] because the loggers had already used all the wood,” said Thiesen. “We don’t work wood. We prefer the soil, to work the land, he added, although he admitted the leftover timber was used to build “houses, schools, churches, bridges, some little things”.\n\nVegetation along Clavero Lake.\n\nPhotograph: Kike Calvo/Alamy\n\nLegally, it is an important distinction. Secondary forest is one step closer to purma, the scrub which grows after tree felling. Purma can be legally transitioned to agricultural use while felling primary rainforest is illegal.\n\nMatt Finer, a senior research specialist at NGO Amazon Conservation, disagrees with Thiesen’s assertion. “The area was selectively logged, as is much of the Amazon but it’s still primary forest,” he said.\n\nMennonite settlements had become the “new leading cause of large-scale deforestation in Peru”, he said. “In total, we have now documented the deforestation of 3,968 hectares across four new colonies established in the Peruvian Amazon since 2017,” he added. Three out of those four colonies are in Tierra Blanca.\n\nEnvironmentalists worry this could just be the beginning of the Mennonite invasion in Peru. Satellite images show land clearing for another settlement, also in Loreto, a vast Amazon region the size of Germany. A 2021 study in the Journal of Land Use Science says Mennonites have 200 settlements across seven countries in Latin America and collectively occupy more land than the Netherlands.\n\nPeru lost a record 2,032 sq km of Amazon to deforestation in 2020, a figure almost four times the 548 sq km it lost in 2019, according to its environment ministry.\n\nThe Mennonites may be easy targets for environmental prosecutors but their neighbours have jumped to their defence.\n\nThe evening meal at the Thiesen household. Photograph: The Guardian\n\n“The Mennonite colony has changed the face of this village,” said Medelú Saldaña, the former mayor of Tierra Blanca. “We are blessed to be able to learn from this orderly agriculture.”\n\nThe Mennonites sell their cheese and other dairy products locally and as experts in growing soya, sorghum and rice, their farming knowhow is valued by the locals.\n\n“[They] have come to invigorate the economy of our district, where the state neither makes an appearance nor invests,” Saldaña added.\n\nProhibited by their beliefs from using modern technology, the Christian group do not drive any vehicles except for tractors so they rely on local transportation for journeys to and from their communities, as well as longer journeys by river to sell their products at market.\n\nIn the balmy evening, amid the high-pitched squeaks of bats and chirruping cicadas, the Thiesen family sit on their porch chatting and laughing as they gaze at the Milky Way streaking across the night sky.\n\nTheir simple way of life appears to have changed little in more than a century but environmentalists fear even more of Peru’s Amazon – second only in size to Brazil’s –could be lost with the arrival of more Mennonites in search of isolation and land to farm.",
    "What are the Top Things To Do in Peru?": "What are the Top Things To Do in Peru?\n\nPeru is a large country in South America that is home to a diverse population and a rich culture. The country is home to many different tourist attractions, including the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu, the Nazca Lines, and Lake Titicaca.\n\nPeru is also a great place to try new foods, as the country is known for its delicious cuisine.\n\nPeople should visit Peru because it is a beautiful country with a rich culture. Peruvian culture is a mix of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences. The population is diverse, from the indigenous peoples who have lived there for centuries to the Spanish colonists who arrived in the 16th century.\n\nIt is so colorful you will feel like you’ve appeared in a bobcasino.com/en-CA/games/all_slots game.\n\nPeru is a great place to visit if you are interested in learning about different cultures. The country has a wide variety of places to visit, from the capital city of Lima to the Amazon rainforest. There are also a number of archaeological sites that are worth visiting.\n\nPeru is a great destination for both history buffs and nature lovers. Now let’s see what the top things to do in Peru are.\n\nVisit the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu\n\nThe ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Peru. Every year, thousands of people visit this incredible site to see the well-preserved ruins and learn about the ancient culture that once inhabited this area.\n\nMachu Picchu is located about 2,500 meters above sea level, in the middle of a tropical forest. The best way to reach the site is by taking a train from Cusco, which takes around 4 hours.\n\nOnce you arrive at Machu Picchu, you can explore the ruins on your own or take a guided tour. There is so much to see at Machu Picchu, including the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon. The views from the site are also incredible, with the Andes mountains in the background. Visiting Machu Picchu is an unforgettable experience and a must-do when traveling to Peru.\n\nTake a cruise down the Amazon River\n\nThere’s something special about taking a cruise down the Amazon River. Perhaps it’s the feeling of being in the heart of the rainforest, surrounded by wildlife and beauty. Or maybe it’s the sense of adventure that comes with exploring one of the world’s most iconic rivers.\n\nWhatever the reason, a cruise down the Amazon is an experience you won’t forget. From the moment you set sail, you’ll be treated to stunning views of the jungle and the river itself.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for wildlife like monkeys, sloths, and pink river dolphins. As you cruise down the Amazon, you’ll make your way to some of the river’s most famous landmarks.\n\nStop at Lake Teles Pires to see the biggest freshwater fish in the world, the arapaima. Visit Anavilhanas National Park, where you can explore the jungle on foot or go for a swim in the river.\n\nSee the Nazca Lines from a hot air balloon\n\nFrom up above, the Nazca Lines are even more impressive than you thought they would be.\n\nThey stretch for miles and miles, some of them curving and twisting in ways that seem impossible. And they’re so big! You won’t believe that somebody made these lines all those years ago. It’s amazing to think about how long they’ve been here, and how they’ve survived the elements.\n\nYou can only imagine how beautiful they must have looked when they were first created. You won’t help but feel a sense of wonder and respect for the people who made them.\n\nShare:",

    "Protection Monitoring Peru: Snapshot (July 2022) - Peru": "This snapshot summarizes the main findings of the Protection Monitoring conducted in Lima and Tacna, Peru in July 2022 as part of the humanitarian intervention of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and ENCUENTROS SJM in the country. This project is implemented with funding from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO).\n\nTo view the interactive Dashboard with the results from this period and from the beginning of the Protection Monitoring program, click here.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the course of July 2022, DRC and ENCUENTROS SJM interviewed 34 households accounting for a total of 129 persons. Since the beginning of the Protection Monitoring exercise in Peru in October 2020, 1,434 households have been interviewed reaching a total of 5,028 persons.\n\nANALYSIS OF THE PROTECTION SITUATION\n\nThe Peruvian Government proceeds with the extension of the Temporary Residence Permit up to two years, regulating the migratory situation and granting rights and duties for foreigners in Peru.\n\nIn July, the Peruvian Migration authorities made an important announcement in regards with the extension of the deadline to manage the Temporary Residence Permit Card (CPP), which grants rights and duties to foreigners and inserts them into Peruvian society for a period of 90 calendar days.\n\nAs announced, the interested individuals will be able to manage the document until October 2 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. All interested persons will be able to manage their documentation until October 2, 2022 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. However, the access to digital platforms, is a challenge that the population must also assume, since, due to the context of the health emergency, all these procedures are carried out through the digital platforms of Migration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a process that for most migrants and refugees is widely complicated, knowing their discontinuous access to the internet.\n\nLikewise, this document will now be valid for 2 years. This allows the regularization of persons in an irregular migratory situation who entered before October 20, 2020. Although the validity of this document will not exceed the duration of two years, it will potentially allow the renewal of the documentation to those persons whose residence permit granted by the Migration authorities has expired since October 2020, but who still remain in Peruvian territory. Additionally, this announcement intends to motivate people who entered the country without having carried out the migratory control to regularize their entry and residence in Peru.\n\nAlthough this measure allows extending the time for immigration regularization, the requirements of the process are not clear. On the one hand, there is no reference to the evidence necessary to demonstrate entry into the country before the deadline, which would imply an impediment for people who entered in an irregular manner without immigration control or who are without documentation. In the same way, there have been identified people who have independently managed such procedure, indicating a date of entry to Peru after October 20, 2020 and have been granted the CPP, so there are doubts as to whether such date is mandatory.\n\nThis announcement is expected to reduce a significant burden borne by Venezuelan migrants and refugees who were unable to cover the financial cost of fines imposed by the Migration authorities due to the expiration of their legal residence permits.\n\nTwo days before the announcement of the extension, more than 100,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees were called to pay costly fines imposed by the National Migration System, amounts they were unable to pay due to their limited economic resources, facing the fear of being forced to leave the country. In the case of people who have exceeded their time of stay, the cost of the fine is 4.60 soles per day (a little more than one dollar) and 46 soles per day in the case of people who did not make extensions on time. Knowing that DRC Monitoring shows that 76.6% of the people surveyed earn less than 900 soles per month, these fines are unaffordable for families already living in a precarious situation.\n\nDespite the fact that the migratory and refugee situation is crucial and affects different strata of the political and socioeconomic context of Peru; on July 28, during the presidential speech that is traditionally made in Congress, there was no mention of the expulsion of foreigners from Peru as had been stated in the inaugural speech of the previous year. Additionally, there was also no allusion to migration policy, nor to measures for the protection of the foreign population residing in the country. The absence of any relevant reference to migration policies suggests that no public policy decisions prioritizing complementary protection measures for refugees and migrantsin Peru are currently being foreseen.",

    "Pedro Castillo’s troubled presidency deterring investment in Peru": "In recent decades, Peru’s economy has stood out among its Latin American peers for its steady growth, and has been described as one of the best performers in the region. However, for many specialists, the performance of President Pedro Castillo’s much-criticised government could be jeopardising this stability, as well as foreign investment.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2019, Peru’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 4.8% a year, and stayed reasonably consistent at 4.5% annually between 2010 and 2019, when the wider Latin American average was on the verge of a deficit. Peru even withstood the 2008 global financial crisis, the worst in recent decades: the year after its start, the South American country experienced a slowdown, but no deficit, with the growth rate at 1.1%.\n\n4.5%\n\nPeru’s average annual GDP growth rate between 2010 and 2019, a relatively consistent rate while wider Latin America verged on defecit\n\nPeru’s average annual GDP growth rate between 2010 and 2019, a relatively consistent rate while wider Latin America verged on defecit\n\nTo a large extent, this resilience was due to the country’s macroeconomic policy, the foundations of which were laid in the 1990s. Two institutions were strengthened at that time: the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Central Reserve Bank (BCR). In both institutions – the former part of the executive and the latter autonomous – there has since been a continuity, in both its policies and its officials.\n\nIn the case of the BCR, its president is appointed by governments at the beginning of their term of office for a period of five years. Julio Velarde, current head of the BCR, has been in office since 2006 – something unheard of in a country as politically unstable as Peru. In 2015, The Banker magazine named him as its global Banker of the Year, and the best central banker in the Americas in 2020 and 2022.\n\nBut in stark contrast to its stable economic performance, Peruvian politics is in turmoil: five presidents have passed through the seemingly revolving door of the Government Palace in the last six years.\n\nAfloat, but with mistrust\n\nDespite the political problems, the Peruvian economy has remained afloat, with the exception of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which did what not even the 2008 crisis could, in halting the period of consecutive growth that began in 1999. 2020, the year of Peru’s first deficit since 1998, saw the GDP growth rate fall by 11.1%.\n\nAmid these circumstances, Pedro Castillo became president in July 2021. Formerly a rural school teacher, he won the election on a radical leftist campaign and by securing the anti-Fujimorism vote, of those opposed to controversial former president Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) and his political ideology that has retained significant influence long after his time in office.\n\nCastillo’s time in office has, however, been characterised more by a series of contradictory messages and bad decisions. In his first year, he has had to appoint more than 67 ministers in his cabinet, to nearly 20 different portfolios – a turnover unheard of even in a country as politically tumultuous as Peru. In addition, he has been accused of corruption, with the public prosecutor’s office opening several investigations for alleged crimes committed during his administration.\n\nWith Castillo in office, investor confidence has also decreased, translating into fewer possibilities for private investment from home and abroad. Currently, the business confidence index, published by the BCR every month, is at its lowest level since 2009, the time of the international financial crisis. In April 2022, expectations reached 40.26, a figure only surpassed in April and May 2020, the critical first two months of the pandemic.\n\nIn September 2021, a month after Castillo took office, credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Peru’s rating from A3 to Baa1, signalling a warning over stability. The credit rating agency considered the country to have a “continuously polarised and fractured political environment”, leading to increased “political risk” and weakened policymaking capacity.\n\nThe BCR’s June inflation report indicates that private investment increased by just 0.8% in the first quarter of 2022, which represented the third consecutive half-year period of decline. In addition, the BCR shifted economic growth projection for 2022 downwards, from 3.4% to 3.1%. Similar estimates have been made by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nElmer Cuba, an economist and former director of the BCR, indicates that the Peruvian economy “is still growing dynamically because it has a lot of momentum”. He points to a decision by congress earlier this year to approve the withdrawal of a percentage of the funds that formal workers have in the private pension system. He also highlights the upcoming start of production at the Quellaveco copper mine, the largest mining investment in the country (valued at US$5.5 billion), and the increasing return of tourists following reductions in numbers during the pandemic.\n\nDue to these factors, Cuba estimates that Peru will grow according to projections. However, from his perspective, the country’s situation will worsen thereafter, as by 2023 it will no longer have the inertia of these circumstances. “Then the economy will start to suffer. [...] There are no macro factors that make you think that next year will be better than this one,” he says.\n\nThis weak, populist government discourages investment\n\nA national survey by Ipsos Peru, conducted in June, indicates that 75% believe that President Castillo is negatively affecting the economy and employment. Moreover, 79% of Peruvians say the economic situation is worse than it was a year ago.\n\nThis negative feeling is compounded by uncertainty. For Elmer Cuba, Castillo’s government “can be seen as a shock that we don’t know how long will last… it could last a year or five”, due to the opposition’s constant requests and proposals for the president to resign.\n\n“His government is so weak and volatile, it gives confusing signals ... You don’t know what to expect. And with the weakening that is being done to the state from within, it’s taking business expectations to their lowest levels,” he added.\n\nAn official consulted on the economic situation, who asked to remain anonymous, says it is very difficult to grow without the contribution of private investment, for which clear projections are needed to reassure investors that there will be no change in the rules of the game in the coming years.\n\n“This feeling of a weak government, in which populist Castillo can radically change what he proposes, discourages investment,” they said. “If there is no investment there is no employment, and if there is no employment people do not generate resources, and if they do not generate resources there is no consumption, and if there is no consumption there is no growth. It becomes a vicious circle.”\n\nThe shrinking state apparatus\n\nJeffrey Radzinsky, a political analyst and director of the Grupo Fides Perú consultancy, believes that the country’s technocratic apparatus is facing its worst moment so far this century – not only because of the continual re-appointments of ministers, but also because of the weakening at different levels, including deputy ministers, directorates and lower-ranking officials. According to the aforementioned Ipsos survey, 76% believe that the ministers and officials chosen by Castillo are not honest or qualified.\n\nA critical case has been the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC), the engine of public investment in the country. This ministry offers concessions to the private sector for large infrastructure works, such as airports, ports, roads or metro lines – projects that represent hundreds of millions of dollars in budget.\n\nNewspapers in recent months have reported on an alleged mafia operating in the MTC to direct tenders, some allegedly linked to Chinese companies, which have been exposed by a collaborator of the justice system. For this case, the prosecutor’s office is investigating President Castillo, his nephews and former high-ranking officials such as Juan Silva, who was minister of the sector, and is currently on the run.\n\nThe MTC is one such portfolio that has seen a high turnover of officials due to poor appointments. One official stated that constant changes in a ministry such as the MTC have an impact on the institutional framework, leading to delays in the progress of major projects and loss of opportunity cost.\n\nThe problem is not confined to the MTC. In May, despite the looming global food crisis, Castillo appointed a person with no experience in the sector and who had previously been imprisoned as Minister of Agrarian Development. Social conflicts that the government failed to resolve quickly also affected the mining sector in recent months.\n\nIn its June report, the BCR attributes the drop in growth to 3.1% to lower production in primary sectors such as mining, due to the stoppage of important operations such as the Southern and Las Bambas mines, the latter operated by China’s MMG; and in agriculture, due to higher fertiliser prices. This translates into fewer exports and, therefore, less revenue for the state.\n\nA third civil servant consulted emphasises the poor performance of ministries such as the MTC and of agrarian development, but also believes that in the wake of the pandemic, which has pushed some 3 million Peruvians back into poverty, people are calling for a larger state, because they have realised that they need better health and education systems, and labour protection. In Peru, the rate of employment informality is over 70%.\n\nThe problem, they add, is that the Peruvian state is too small by any standards (number of teachers or hospital beds per inhabitant, for example) and inefficient (it does not have a healthy civil service), which, the source believes, also limits economic growth. This is why they point out that “growth is not only achieved with private investment, but also with a good state”.\n\nThe civil servant does not believe that Castillo’s government will break the country’s macroeconomic paradigm, which is very solid, but it will affect the state apparatus in general. This, they say, will require reconstruction, but also an opportunity to make the economic reforms the country needs.",
    "Peru’s FM Resigns as President Changes Western Sahara Position": "",
    "Peru’s Troubles Go Well Beyond Castillo": "Peru’s economy was once dubbed a “miracle” by analysts who marveled at its stability despite years of political chaos. But now, it’s facing tough times.\n\nDespite a strong rebound in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic, Fitch Ratings has revised down its projections for GDP growth in 2022 from 2.5% to 2.3%. Similarly, the IMF has adjusted its projection from 3.3% to 2.8% and has announced that Colombia’s growth rate looks set to overtake Peru this year. Analysts have pointed to adverse global financial conditions, including high inflation and less demand from China, Peru’s main trade partner and the biggest consumer of its mineral exports.\n\nThere is no doubt that Peru is not performing as it once did. But what’s new is that the country’s economy is finally being affected negatively by political crises. A recent Reuters article noted that Peru’s central bank had recorded the lowest level of investor confidence since the 2008 recession, due to the series of corruption scandals and constant cabinet changes of Pedro Castillo’s government. According to Fitch, “politics and the economy can no longer be treated separately.”\n\nBut how fair is it to say that the Castillo administration is fully to blame for Peru’s economic woes? While the country’s governability has always been shaky, Castillo has taken this to new levels. Currently, the president is facing six criminal investigations that implicate him directly in bribery and other corruption schemes and include his wife and sister-in-law as well as several other close associates. He has reshuffled his cabinet 59 times in a year, which means that there has been a new minister every week on average. Congress is also not helping matters; so far it has tried twice to impeach Castillo and will likely try again. The general chaos prompted over 200 business organizations to sign an open letter in July condemning all the corruption allegations against the president and demanding that Congress remove him if these continue to appear.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Castillo is facing opposition from business groups, due to the alarm his presumed leftist agenda caused since the beginning of his presidency. But Peru’s economic troubles go beyond investor confidence. It was only a matter of time until the country’s economy could no longer solely rely on its solid macroeconomic policies. Previous governments, all very business-friendly, were able to keep politics divorced from economics mostly because in the 2000s and 2010s there was an appetite for Latin American resources not seen since the end of the Second World War. This commodity boom, driven by China’s rise, allowed Peru to accumulate high levels of reserves, grow almost 6% annually for years and reduce poverty to 20% from the 50% recorded in the early 2000s. It also let governments ignore repeated warnings that secondary reforms would be necessary to maintain economic performance.\n\nAlready by 2014, for example, the IMF and World Bank were stressing the need for Peru to have a broader tax base, to modernize its labor market in order to incorporate more workers into the formal sector, to invest in technology and to diversify its economy so that it reduced its reliance on mineral exports, which make up about 10% of the country’s GDP. None of these things occurred.\n\nNeither was any previous government able to provide a definitive solution to the social conflicts that have repeatedly arisen around mining projects in the last decade. Relationships between mining companies and the communities that live in their vicinity have become increasingly frayed. The Las Bambas copper mine, owned by MMG, was recently paralyzed for almost 50 days, despite the government’s several attempts at brokering talks between the population and the company. However, protests have been occurring since 2015, and in general, the inability to resolve the social conflict issue has now resulted in a smaller pipeline for mining investment in 2022.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Castillo’s new minister of Finance, Kurt Burneo, a well-known technocrat, has publicly recognized the need to recuperate investor confidence in order to foster economic growth. Two weeks ago, while presenting the budget for the next fiscal year, Burneo stressed that one of the government’s goals is to recover this confidence by promoting private investment through commissions that fast-track projects and government-to-government arrangements like the one with the United Kingdom for the 2019 Panamerican Games. Burneo has also stated that the ministry will not seek to increase taxes in a similar effort to reassure investors.\n\nThe Castillo government, thus far, has not proved to be the threat to the private sector that it was feared to be. In fact, it has largely maintained the same fiscal and macroeconomic management that’s been in place since the structural adjustment policies implemented in the 1990s.\n\nAnd yet, macroeconomic discipline alone cannot foster the conditions necessary for Peru’s development. Politics was eventually bound to catch up to the economy. Unfortunately, it has coincided with a highly incompetent president at the helm, adding fuel to the fire.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Moncada, a contributing columnist to Americas Quarterly, is a Peruvian journalist and political analyst currently based in the UK.

    "Abimael Guzman, Shining Path’s leader, died a year ago. The terror he unleashed on Peru lives on": "A year has passed since Abimael Guzmán, the aging leader of the Shining Path terror group, died in prison, yet the trauma he inflicted on the Andean nation continues to haunt its people and his legacy still poisons Peru’s fraught politics.\n\nThe professor-turned-messianic leader, who died aged 86, unleashed an internecine conflict that killed tens of thousands of people in the 1980s and 1990s. Most victims were peasants trapped between fanatical fighters bent on creating a proletarian utopia and the Peruvian armed forces’ brutal counter-attack.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2000, nearly 70,000 people were killed in the intense conflict; Guzmán’s followers were responsible for about 54% of the deaths.\n\nSince then, decades have passed, but for many thousands of Peruvians, the wounds are still open and bleeding.\n\nFew, however, witnessed the horror and folly of the conflict as closely as Lurgio Gavilán, who was forcefully enlisted into the Shining Path aged 13, only to be captured by the military before rejoining the war as a soldier in the Peruvian army.\n\nAfter a stint with the Catholic Franciscan Order, he is now neither a soldier nor a monk but an anthropology professor at the university where Guzmán once taught philosophy.\n\n“Here, the people say [Guzmán] died for us a long time ago,” said Gavilán, 48. “Oblivion, being forgotten, is the worst punishment for us. We don’t remember him.”\n\nGavilán has lived many lives in half a century, but for him, the single most remarkable feat is that he survived to tell the tale.\n\nLurgio Gavilán, 48, revisiting a deserted army base in Razahuillca, near Huanta, Ayacucho, where he was posted as a teenage soldier in the 1980s. Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian\n\nGrowing up dirt poor in a mountain village in the Andean Ayacucho region, he remembers first hearing about “social justice” soon after May 1980, when the Shining Path first declared war on the Peruvian state, burning ballot boxes just as Peruvians were celebrating a return to democracy after military rule.\n\nSoon afterwards, however, his elder brother went missing. “Someone told me where he was and I went to look for him. That’s how I came across the Shining Path,” he recalled. There was no way back.\n\n“It wasn’t possible to escape. Every punishment was death. If a compañero wanted to escape they would kill him on the spot, to make an example of him,” he recalls, now narrating with clear-eyed distance. “Even if you managed to escape, the peasant vigilantes would butcher you, or the soldiers would disappear you.”\n\nHe soon found there was nothing glorious about Sendero’s struggle. His companions were a rag-tag band, mostly children. “We had some shotguns, and homemade dynamite which we packed into tin cans. We were very poor, we had no change of clothes. We all had fleas.”\n\nTo compensate for its lack of strength, Shining Path turned to terror as a strategy of war, slaughtering Quechua-speaking peasants, enslaving youngsters, assassinating officials and forcing thousands to flee. María Ruiz, 68, remembered how the arrival of rebels in rural Chungui district marked the end of her peaceful, happy life.\n\nResidents of a village participate in the funeral of 23 of their relatives after their remains were recovered from a mass grave and identified via DNA testing in Huanta municipality, Ayacucho region, Peru. Photograph: Cris Bouroncle/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe was forced to flee with her husband and four young children over the mountains into the Amazon cloudforest.\n\n“We were like wild animals, hiding in caves, hiding in the bush, without food, trying to stay silent,” she recalled. When the state security forces arrived they became trapped between the two forces – each of which accused the locals of supporting their enemy.\n\n“Instead of defending us, the military would kill us too. They would jail us, disappear us, rape us,” she recalled, weeping.\n\nOne day in 1985, her husband went to gather potatoes – and never returned. “The soldiers killed him.”\n\nNearly 40 years later, she lives in Huamanga, the regional capital of Ayacucho, where she scratches by a living for her children by selling food on the street and washing clothes.\n\n“We can never forget what we have seen, it stays in our hearts,” she laments. “No one has asked for our forgiveness, no one.”\n\nFor Gavilán, thrust into a war, there was no choice: “We had to kill or we would be killed,” he recalled.\n\nGavilán’s deliverance from the rebels came in the shape of a military ambush in 1985.\n\nAfter a decade in the army, he decided to continue his studies with the Franciscan Order in Huamanga. “I was tired of the war, tired of seeing so much death.”\n\nGavilán completed a doctorate in anthropology at Mexico’s Ibero-American University and now teaches at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University, where Guzmán taught in the 1970s.\n\nIt wasn’t possible to escape. Every punishment was death. If a compañero wanted to escape they would kill him on the spot Lurgio Gavilán\n\nJosé Coronel Aguirre, 74, an anthropologist and professor at the same university, is one of few living academics who knew Guzmán. He remembers a dogmatic professor who used his position to recruit poor students from rural areas and brainwash them.\n\n“He had no interest in peasant movements or workers’ unions … he preached only about the armed struggle,” said Coronel, who, as a student leader in the late 1960s and 70s, appeared at several events with Guzmán.\n\nThe man who considered himself the “Fourth Sword of Marxism” after Marx, Lenin and Mao, was captured by undercover police in a Lima safehouse in 1992. Peruvians saw their tormentor on their television screens, most for the first time, raging with his fist raised inside a cage, wearing a black-and-white striped prison uniform.\n\nGavilán as a teenaged soldier aged approximately 15 or 16. Photograph: Courtesy Lurgio Gavilán\n\n“It’s difficult to talk about Guzmán’s ‘legacy’ because what he left was a reversal in Peru’s social and historical progress,” he said. “The left in Peru has been demonized because it appears unjustly associated with Sendero’s barbarity.\n\nFor Ruiz, the memories are still raw. “I can never forgive that man,” she said. “How many families have been left without a father or mother? How many orphans? How many women have died? How many men have been killed, tortured to death?,” she asked.\n\n“We created this monster too, due to the [social] injustices,” reflected Gavilán, who says the root causes of the violence still simmer beneath the surface. “We still haven’t understood this conflict. It’s still with us.”",
    "Changing lives through music: legendary tenor's dream for Peru": "“I had a dream. I had the dream of helping disadvantaged boys and girls in Peru…“Juan Diego Flórez\n\nAn extraordinary social project in Peru is helping to change the lives of disadvantaged children through the power of music education. The project is the initiative of the internationally acclaimed Peruvian tenor, Juan Diego Flórez.\n\nInspiration for Sinfonía por el Perú\n\nFlórez was first introduced to this concept when he visited Venezuela in 2009 to perform with conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Venezuela’s El Sistema was an internationally lauded programme known to have helped children coming from a background of crime and drug abuse since its creation in the 1970s.\n\nInspired by this project Flórez then created numerous music schools throughout Peru, where children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds have access to free music education. They can learn an instrument or sing in the choir and the best of them make it to the Youth Orchestra which gets to perform with Flórez.\n\nSome of these musicians from the music education programme, Sinfonía por el Perú, have embarked on an extraordinary journey, taking them from Lima to Salzburg. One of them is Gabriel Vera Correa. Life hasn’t always been easy for the 15-year-old, but music has given him a purpose as his mother Nelly Mercedes Vera Correa, explains.\n\n“He was bullied at school because he was chubby. There were kids who threw his backpack in the bin. Music has helped him to lose his fears, to feel more confident, to feel that whatever he wanted to achieve he was able to achieve.”\n\nGabriel Vera Correa, a 15 year old viola player in Lima. Euronews\n\nGabriel plays with the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra and explains how he discovered a passion for his instrument.\n\n“I’ve always liked music and have always been interested in learning, whether it is an instrument or singing. I was thinking of starting the violin and then I came across the viola and fell in love with this instrument. My favourite moment is when I’m with Sinfonía because it just makes me happy. It makes me feel grateful to be alive because I’m learning to play an instrument.”\n\nThe power of music to change society\n\nAs well as his day job as a legendary tenor, Juan Diego Flórez, is also the Founder & President of Sinfonía por el Perú, and he explains the vision he had when he began this project.\n\n“When I decided to do Sinfonia por el Peru I had a dream. I had the dream of helping disadvantaged boys and girls in Peru to you know, find a space where they feel secure, where they can develop, where they can find education, where they can have values for life.”\n\nSeeing the impact his initiative has had on the thousands of lives of the children involved, has changed his perception of what music is and what it can achieve. As Florez describes.\n\n“Before I understood that music can change society, for me, music was going to the theatre singing and everybody applauding and that's great. But now I see music as a way to change the world, as a way to improve society, as a way of making a better world.”\n\nPeruvian childrern from Sinfonía por el Perú initiative Euronews\n\nThousands of children throughout Peru regularly practice for several hours every day in one of the numerous music schools called nucléo, created by the programme.\n\nLuis Castillo is the coordinator núcleos and a music teacher for the Sinfonía por el Perú.\n\n“The impact of Sinfonia has been wonderful and marvellous. It influences their behaviour, their whole development, not only in terms of music, but it also encompasses the family and it even has an impact on society.”\n\nRecent research also shows that the programme has significantly increased creativity, self-confidence, and academic success. As Florez explains.\n\n“The first study had amazing results. The prevalence of child labour was reduced in 90%. Of course, because they were at the núcleo making music together. Their parents were less violent towards them, but the results that struck me the most were that they wanted to continue into university studies.”\n\nJuan Diego Flórez, acclaimed tenor & Founder & President of Sinfonía por el Perú Euronews\n\nDiana Espinoza, is a flutist, with the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra and is among those taking her studies to the next level. The 18-year-old is doing her post-graduate degree at Lima’s Universidad Nacional de Musica. Looking back, she says she values the important life-lessons she learned at Sinfonía.\n\n“I learned teamwork, it helped me to take on responsibility, to know that I have to be organised and have a certain schedule. And then it gave me a passion for music. I want to do this all my life, playing in an orchestra and being a professional musician.”\n\nDiana is also part of the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra, where only the best students from the various music schools get to perform together.\n\n“What I like the most and what I enjoy the most is playing with my friends and doing what we are passionate about. Playing symphonies together, enjoying melodies together. That's what I Iove.”\n\nA dream come true\n\nThe dream of Juan Diego Flórez when he started this project was to help disadvantaged children in Peru, and this dream is now being realised. However, exceeding his wildest expectations was an opportunity to take his orchestra on an extraordinary journey to the Festival of Salzburg, the most important in the world of classical music. He describes his unbridled joy.\n\n“The Salzburg concert is so important for the orchestra, because it’s the first time they really travel as a whole orchestra. It feels great to be close to the kids of Sinfonia por el Peru, to the youth orchestra to work with them, to rehearse very hard with them for the tour that we are doing in Europe, especially for the Festival of Salzburg. I’m so happy, I’m so happy to be close to them. It’s really amazing, really.”\n\nViola player Gabriel Vera Correa, describes his excitement at this opportunity.\n\n“I'm happy to be going to Salzburg and I'm excited that I'm going to be there with a lot more people who like what I do.”\n\nFor flutist Diana Espinoza, this is a very meaningful opportunity.\n\n“Knowing that Mozart was there, that Mozart lived there and knowing that it's the cradle of music and being able to walk through these little streets I can’t even describe my emotions.”\n\nWorld-famous tenor, Juan Diego Flórez, rehearsing with Youth Orchestra Euronews\n\nViolin player Diego Manrique, feels that this experience has implications that go beyond the musicians who are performing in Salzburg.\n\n“I’m really happy and grateful. It's like a dream that every kid in Sinfonía por el Peru would love to experience and we're representing them all.”\n\nSentiments that are echoed by the double bass player, Revoredo.\n\n“We’re not only representing the 5,000 kids of Sinfonía por el Peru, but also the whole of Peru, showing that Peru has talent.”\n\nFor Flórez, it represents an opportunity to inspire and to give hope to future generations of young musicians and young people in general. As he explains.\n\n“When they play in an orchestra, they feel, oh, I’m somebody. I am recognised. Imagine these kids now, they say, Yes, we made it. Nothing is impossible.”",
    "Peru president’s sister-in-law sent to jail amid corruption probe": "The sister-in-law of Peruvian President Pedro Castillo has been given 30 months of pre-trial detention on Sunday, the most serious escalation so far of a host of criminal investigations that have targeted the leader’s inner circle.\n\nCastillo has often referred to Yenifer Paredes, his sister-in-law, who he and his wife raised since she was little, as his “daughter”.\n\nProsecutors allege she was part of a group that engaged in influence peddling to assign public contracts to allies of Castillo in their home region of Cajamarca, in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nParedes has not been charged with a crime and she will spend time in jail as prosecutors continue their investigation.\n\nCastillo, who has been in office for 13 months, is besieged by scandals and has already survived two impeachment attempts. He denies any wrongdoing and has accused prosecutors of being complicit in an attempt to remove him from power.\n\nProsecutors have opened six criminal investigations against him, including one for alleged obstruction of justice in the firing of a former interior minister.\n\nAnother former minister has been on the run for months, while the current transport minister has kept his job despite prosecutors alleging he is part of a “criminal organisation” alongside Castillo.\n\nProsecutors have also asked that Castillo’s wife, Lilia Paredes, be banned from travelling abroad for the next three years.\n\nWhile prosecutors have moved aggressively with Castillo’s inner circle, they cannot charge or detain him while he remains president.\n\nPeruvian leaders have often been ensnared by corruption scandals.\n\nFour past presidents are either in jail, in house arrest or facing charges that could lead them to prison time in the future.",

    "Drastic increases in commodity prices pummel Peruvian working class": "The sharp increases in the prices of food, fertilizers, fuel, and public transportation, combined with the uncertainty of the exchange rate and unemployment remaining high, are having a devastating effect on Peru’s urban and rural working class, on students, and on the poor more generally.\n\nLong line of people waiting to get into bank in Lima [Photo by Victor Idrogo/World Bank]\n\nThe higher cost of urea fertilizer, a result of the war in Ukraine, increases the cost of food from farms, and a resulting fall in production drives up prices in retail markets. It is estimated that, if the war in Ukraine continues, the price of fertilizer could increase by 40 percent by the end of 2023.\n\nThe Ukraine war is also affecting the price of energy. In Repsol gas stations, the main fuel supplier in Peru, the pre-pandemic price of 90 octane gasoline on December 31, 2018, was 4.85 nuevo (new) soles per gallon. On September 4 this year, it was quoted at 19.95, an increase of 307 percent, equivalent to an astonishing 45.4 percent annually.\n\nAs a result of gasoline price hikes, public transportation fares in Lima, the capital, rose on July 16 from 2.50 to 3.50 nuevo soles, a 40 percent increase.\n\nLast month the private public transportation companies in Arequipa, the second most populous city in Peru, which transport 800,000 passengers, announced that they would raise the base fare from one sol to 1.40 soles, an increase of 40 percent from one day to the next.\n\nThe daily Peru21 reported that in Arequipa an average family of four spends a minimum of 168 soles per month on public transportation. With the new increase it would rise to 235 soles, 22 percent of the minimum monthly living wage (SMV) of 1,025 soles (US$265.27).\n\nTo get an idea of the true dimensions of the precarious economic situation Peruvian workers face, for every dollar that a worker in New York state earning minimum wage receives, his Peruvian counterpart is paid only 11.5 cents.\n\nThough in August there was a small decrease from July, the inflation rate as to consumer prices remained high. The monthly report in August of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) placed inflation in the previous 12 months at 8.41 percent, well above the bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target. This was slightly lower than the 8.5 percent rate in the U.S., and the 10.07 percent rate in Brazil, the Latin American country with the highest rate.\n\nThe week before last the BCRP raised its inflation forecast for 2022 and 2023. Speaking at a news conference in Lima, bank chief Julio Velarde said the bank had raised its inflation estimate for 2022 to 7.8 percent from a previous 6.4 percent and for 2023 to 3 percent from 2.5 percent.\n\nTo cope with inflation, on July 7 the BCRP had fixed the policy interest rate at 6.00 percent. A year ago, on August 8, 2021, it was just 0.50 percent.\n\nAt that time, the bank was trying to reactivate an economy hit by shutdowns and a high unemployment rate resulting from the pandemic. Since then, the BCR has raised the rate numerous times. Today it is not about stimulating the economy, but curbing inflation, and above all, keeping wages from rising.\n\nOn Friday, the bank raised the key rate to a 20-year high of 6.75 percent. This was slightly less than expected, because September’s inflation rate compared to August’s showed a second monthly slight decrease. The 6.75 percent rate was nonetheless the 14th straight increase in a cycle that has pushed up borrowing costs 650 basis points. And the bank emphasized that it was not ruling out additional interest rate increases depending upon incoming data.\n\nOn top of attempting to tame inflation, constrain wages and protect the national currency, political instability—i.e., country risk—also looms large in the rate calculations. The possibility of a mass uprising, following on half a year of incessant strikes and demonstrations, has led the national bourgeoisie to excessive purchases of dollars.\n\nOn last Friday, the currency closed at 3.877 nuevo soles per US dollar, equivalent to a devaluation of over 19 percent since the start of the pandemic, which was quoted at 3.1268 on March 12, 2019. The exchange rate peaked at 4.1198 nuevo soles per U.S. dollar on October 13 of last year. Throughout the last nine months it has oscillated between a floor of 3.62 and a ceiling of 4.10, swinging according to the bourgeoisie’s perception of Peru's risk.\n\nThe BCRP’s growth projections reveal the precariousness of the political-economic situation. It revised its economic growth estimates for the current year downward from 3.8 to 3.0 percent for 2022 and from 3.2 to 3.0 percent for 2023.\n\nThe slowdown hits hard the production of basic foods for the urban and rural working class. For example, newspapers report that rice production decreased 7.5 percent and potato production 11.73 percent in July.\n\nLikewise, oil and liquid gas production has slowed. Exploration contracts for hydrocarbons were reduced to half the figure of 2019, the last pre-pandemic year.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), “In the December 2021-January-February 2022 quarter, the official unemployment rate in Metropolitan Lima—where one third of the national population resides and economic activity is concentrated—was 8.9 per cent, lower by 5.6 percentage points compared to the same quarter of 2021 (14.5 per cent).” However, when compared to the same quarter of 2020 (7.1 per cent) it was higher by 1.8 percentage points.\n\nAnd these figures do not capture the fact that the share of the working population trapped in informal jobs exceeds 70 percent.\n\nBut it is the fall in production, partially due to the economic contraction in the pandemic years, and the increase in the price of basic necessities, that has hit the working class the hardest. The main factor now is the slowdown of the capitalist economy worldwide, which has pushed Peru into a technical recession.\n\nFinally, adding to the gloomy economic outlook is the fourth wave of Covid-19, with the Omicron strain, which arrived in June, now lashing the population.\n\nAccording to data published by the Ministry of Health (Minsa), the monthly number of deaths in June was 334. It increased to 854 in July, and then reached 1,428 in August. That is, in the space of three months, the mortality rate jumped 260 percent.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the number of positive cases has risen to 4,131,966. and the number of dead to 216,287, representing a mortality rate of 5.23 percent as of September 18.\n\nThese interlocking crises are intersecting with charges of corruption on the part of President Pedro Castillo, his family and government officials, creating a crisis of governability and laying the basis for a social and political explosion.",

    "GIEWS Country Brief: Peru 06-September-2022 - Peru": "FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT\n\n2022 paddy output forecast slightly above the average due to good yields attained in the first half of the year Cereal import requirement forecast at a slightly above-average level in 2022 Cereal prices well above their year-earlier levels in July 2022\n\n2022 paddy output forecast to be slightly above average due to good yields attained in the first half of the year\n\nHarvesting of paddy crop takes place throughout the year, with nearly a half of production concentrated during the May-July period. Paddy production in the third quarter of the year, when on average one-fifth of the annual production is harvested, is forecast to be near average in 2022 on the account of average sowings. According to satellite imagery, vegetation conditions are generally favourable in the key producing rain forecast (selva) and coastal areas. The paddy output gathered in the first half of 2022 is officially estimated to be 10 percent above the average. This is due to the record-high yields attained as a result of favourable weather conditions. Reflecting this bumper harvest, the aggregate paddy production in 2022 is preliminarily forecast at 3.45 million tonnes, about 3 percent above the five‑year average.\n\nYellow maize for feed use is also harvested all year round and nearly 30 percent of the annual output is gathered in the July‑September period. Planted area to be harvested in the third quarter of 2022 is estimated at a slightly below-average level. The contraction in sowings, despite high maize prices and adequate soil moisture conditions, could be attributed to reduced availabilities of fertilizers, as imports in the first half of 2022 were more than 25 percent below the five‑year average of the same period. The 2022 production of yellow maize is forecast to be an average level of 1.2 million tonnes, supported by the above-average harvest in the first half of the year.\n\nRegarding white maize for food use, harvesting was completed in August and production is anticipated at above-average 330 000 tonnes. While the planted area was near average, yields were excellent on accounts of favourable weather conditions in the major producing highlands.\n\nCereal import requirement forecast at a slightly above‑average level in 2022\n\nWheat import requirement is forecast at a slightly above‑average level owing to the rising food demand, supported by the increasing population. Maize imports, which account for 60 percent of the total annual cereal imports, are also anticipated to be slightly above the average. This mainly reflects an acceleration of increase in poultry production in the first half of 2022, after a decline in production by about 3 percent in 2020. With the highest per capita consumption of chicken meat in Latin America, the demand for yellow maize by the domestic poultry sector has been generally increasing during the past ten years.\n\nCereal import requirement in the 2022 marketing year (January/December) is anticipated at a slightly above‑average level of 6.4 million tonnes.\n\nCereal prices well above their year-earlier levels in July 2022\n\nThe annual food inflation rate in Lima metropolitan area recorded an increase of 10 percent in July 2022 , up from 3 percent in the same month in 2021. Wholesale prices of cereals rose since April 2022, reflecting rising production and transportation costs. Elevated international quotations exerted additional upward pressure on domestic prices. This was particularly the case for prices of wheat flour, due to high dependency on wheat imports to satisfy its domestic consumption needs as well as high processing costs. While prices of yellow maize and rice were 20 percent higher year on year in July 2022, prices of wheat flour were nearly 45 percent above those a year earlier.\n\nThe government introduced a series of measures to contain price increases and improve access to food. These include a temporary VAT exemption for chicken meat, eggs, pasta, bread and their inputs from May to July 2022 as well as a new food voucher programme “* Bono Alimentario .*” The programme aims to deliver a one‑off payment of 200‑300 PEN (equivalent to about 50‑80 USD) to 1.3 million vulnerable households (6.5 million people and about 17 percent of total population) under the new budget of 2 000 million PEN (equivalent to about 520 million USD).\n\nDisclaimer: The designations employed and the presentation of material in this information product do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of FAO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.",

    "Peruvian and Venezuelan girls come together to campaign for social change": "Venezuelan and Peruvian girls participating in the Chamas en Acción (Girls in Action) programme pose with two of Quinta Ola's founders, Beatriz Córdova and Gianina Márquez (second and third from the left, first row). © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nPau* was 11 years old when she and her mother left their native Venezuela to make the exhausting overland journey to Peru. For Pau, the transition was a difficult one. At her new school in the Peruvian capital, Lima, she became the brunt of so much bullying that she fell into a deep depression. Things got so bad that the preteen decided to adopt a Peruvian accent in a bid to no longer stand out.\n\n“It was very painful, having to lose my identity,” recalled Pau, who is now 15.\n\nBut in 2021, her mother heard about an organization, called Quinta Ola, that was working to empower young Peruvian women and Venezuelan refugees and migrants from the same demographic. She signed Pau up for one of the group’s virtual programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online sessions for young Venezuelan women covered topics such as sexism, xenophobia, gender-based violence and youth activism, and gave them the confidence and tools to participate in campaigns for social change and even to design their own initiatives. Other sessions brought the Venezuelan and Peruvian girls together, stoking cross-cultural friendships.\n\n\"Now, I feel much more self-assured.\"\n\nThe sessions “gave me the chance to learn about my rights and understand what I, as a human being, deserve,” said Pau, adding that the programme, known as “Chamas en Acción,” or Girls in Action, had restored much of her prior confidence. “Having to leave my country demolished my self-esteem. But now, I feel much more self-assured.”\n\nThe programme also allowed her to bond with Peruvian girls her age.\n\n“I see [Quinta Ola] as a family, the girls are like my sisters,” said Pau, adding that her friendship with a 16-year-old Peruvian named Suyay had proved particularly rewarding.\n\nSuyay said the sessions were eye-opening for her too.\n\n“I was able to connect with the Venezuelan girls … because like me, they were also interested in feminism, empowerment and activism,” said Suyay. “Knowing we had something in common was super important to being able to connect.”\n\nPau, who is Venezuelan, and Suyay, who is Peruvian, have forged a strong friendship through their participation in the \"Chamas en Acción\" programme. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nMaría, a young Venezuelan participant of \"Chamas en Acción\", studies at her house in Lima, Peru. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nYoung Venezuelan and Peruvian girls take part in a workshop run by Quinta Ola. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nFounded in 2017 by three Peruvian women in their early thirties, Quinta Ola – which translates to Fifth Wave, in a reference to the successive stages of the feminist movement – teaches women and girls political empowerment through workshops, community organizing, and activism. It also includes mentorships aimed at helping participants identify the types of the social change they want to champion.\n\nThe seed for the organization was planted one day when the three friends, Beatriz Córdova Aquino, Gianina Márquez Olivera and Karina Nuñez Paz, were discussing gender-based violence and came to the terrible realization that it had affected nearly every woman they knew.\n\n“At that moment, a flame was lit within us,” said Gianina, adding they wanted to find a way of breaking the cycle of violence by giving young women a voice within their own families and, eventually, a seat at the tables of power.\n\nThey initially created a group modelled after GirlGov, an empowerment programme pioneered in Pennsylvania, in the United States, and worked with no funding for the first year. But Quinta Ola’s work with Peruvian girls won them kudos and attracted financial backing, allowing them to extend their programming to include refugee and migrant girls.\n\nThis June, Quinta Ola was among seven women-led organizations to win UNHCR’s annual NGO Innovation Awards (supported this year through Safe from the Start funding from the US government) for its work focusing on the empowerment of Venezuelan girls.\n\nSee also: Yazidi women box their way to recovery\n\nWith more than 1.32 million Venezuelans now registered in Peru, the country is host to the world’s second-largest population of Venezuelan refugees and migrants – most of whom, like Pau’s family, have settled in Lima and the surrounding area. While the Peruvian government has worked to regularize the Venezuelan population, many report facing discrimination.\n\n“Teenage girls from Venezuela find themselves triply discriminated against – for being young, for being women, and for being foreigners,” said Karina, one of Quinta Ola’s founders. “For them, the situation is even more critical [than for their Peruvian counterparts] as their support networks and capacity to mobilize are both very limited.”\n\nParticipants in Quinta Ola’s “Girls in Action” programme identified the fight against xenophobia as one of their top priorities. The girls created a survey to gather data about the discrimination Venezuelans in Peru were facing and used their findings to develop recommendations for public policies aimed at curbing xenophobia, which they dispatched to Peru’s regional governments. They also formed working groups to address the hyper-sexualization of Venezuelan women and girls and discrimination in access to education.\n\nFourteen-year-old María*, a Venezuelan “Girls in Action” participant who also struggled to adapt to her new life in Lima, credited the programme not only with giving her the inner fortitude to carry on, but also showing her a path towards effecting lasting change.\n\n“I’ve learned so much about society, about the world and about myself,” she said, adding that “activism has become something fundamental for me. I sincerely don’t know what would have become of me if I hadn’t become an activist.”\n\n*The Quinta Ola participants asked to use only their first names.",

    "1,300-Year-Old Tomb of the “Lord of Huarmey” Excavated in Peru": "Friday, September 23, 2022\n\nHUARMEY, PERU—Live Science reports that researchers led by Miłosz Giersz of the University of Warsaw discovered a 1,300-year-old Wari tomb in a necropolis on Peru’s North Coast known as El Castillo de Huarmey. The tomb is thought to have belonged to a man who has been dubbed the “Lord of Huarmey,” although the remains of six other people were included in the burial. They are thought to have been buried at another site before they were reinterred in this tomb. The grave also held an abundance of gold and silver jewelry in various stages of completion, bronze tools, knives, axes, baskets, woven textiles, materials for making baskets, and wood and leather items. Giersz suggests that the tomb’s occupants may have been skilled craftspeople in addition to being members of the Wari elite. This tomb is located on top of a larger tomb Giersz and his colleagues discovered in 2012, which contained the remains of three high-status Wari women and 58 other people, some of whom may have been sacrificed. Giersz thinks the Castillo de Huarmey may have been an administrative center for the Wari Empire and a place of ancestor worship. For more on previous discoveries at the site, go to \"Tomb of the Wari Queens.\""
